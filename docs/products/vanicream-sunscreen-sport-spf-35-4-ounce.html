            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>It works great and there is no scent what so ever to react to if you have allergies.</li>
            <li>The two 4oz size packaging is a great deal.</li>
            <li>Got a sample from the dermatologist and is great stuff for your face.  </li>
            <li>My skin was in great shape after using this product.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The two things I love about it best is 1)</li>
            <li>I did love the fact that is non-greasy and feels wonderful on your skin.</li>
            <li>she is a good Doc and uses the best ointments/creams available.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a good lotion for a number of years, and then they changed something in the formulation and now I feel like a greased pig when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Both sunscreens are good.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise all good.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen is good, but not a holy grail and here&#x27;s why:  PROS:</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Good for all skin types and all ages.  </li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>stuff was affordable and gets good reviews.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the skin protection this product gives and it is scent free.</li>
            <li>Good shield of sunshine, no oily feeling, no unwanted chemicals.</li>
            <li>my dermatologist friend has samples of these in her office, so i figure it&#x27;s a good bet.</li>
            <li>but this is the best and super inexpensive.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product and I have been very satisfied in using it.</li>
            <li>She is allergic to most sunscreans, so this is a great help</li>
            <li>We have suggested this product to many friends and family members and everyone that has tried it has also had great results.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased!  </li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love all their products!</li>
            <li>So glad there&#x27;s something he can use!</li>
            <li>i first got it because i read about the 25 best sunscreens on some list</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>My kids are super fair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li>I have used the Vanicream Lite Lotion and was thrilled to find that they make sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>it does eventually fade in on its own.  </li>
            <li>This was a  request from the owners of Wildquest, who own the boat, and host the retreat we attended.  </li>
            <li>My family all plays tennis and an effective sunscreen</li>
            <li>I was looking for a sunscreen that had safe ingredients, good SPF, and would be effective when swimming.</li>
            <li>I bought this before going on vacation to Mexico and liked the product.  </li>
            <li>Product is very good and the source and shipping were prompt and reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>By far, I find this to be the best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used California Baby and liked it better.</li>
            <li>I also need to know that I&#x27;ve gotten good coverage since I burn so easily, and I just can&#x27;t be confident of that with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>No scary ingredients, stays on and does its job great.  </li>
            <li>It works well, rubs in easily, and prevents sunburn effectively.  </li>
            <li>so I am sure to never run out.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff-</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this transaction.</li>
            <li>I am able to use makeup over it.</li>
            <li>I plan to order more to give to my family.  </li>
            <li>I applied once before going out for the day, then one or two more applications during the day.</li>
            <li>California Baby has a fragrance to it and is a bit more greasy.  </li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It blends well and safe for skin.  </li>
            <li>Better that then a bunch of unpronounceable chemicals.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen was ok.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It is on the greasy side and more appropriate for use when you are involved in an outdoor sport vs wearing it under makeup.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t found it to be better than others but dermatologist favors this product.</li>
            <li>We have been buying Vanicream Sunscreen Sport for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I love all their products</li>
            <li>I apply this on my face and have avoided more sun damage.  </li>
            <li>This is very non-greasy and a great product.</li>
            <li>Of course she probably has a business relationship with the manufacturer, but that&#x27;s okay......</li>
            <li>I have told lots of people who have also tried it and love it.</li>
            <li>I do appreciate it&#x27;s non fragrance, as I have many allergies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price and worth a try.</li>
            <li>I love it--it serves as my moisturizer and sun screen in the morning every day.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many over the years</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Many sunscreen products cause reactions for those with skin sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I was very happy and will take this sunscreen on my next vacation.</li>
            <li>which was pretty good also, and also rated well on the EWG Sunscreen App.</li>
            <li>so it is easier to spread if it is slightly warm and spread quickly.</li>
            <li>I figured if they were selling it, it must be safe and free of all the yucky stuff many sunscreens contain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Vanicream blended better and is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have now been using this for 2 summers no rash, but most important never have a burn not even at the beginning of summer when I have no tan</li>
            <li>Is works great on my sensitive skin, even in 110+ heat.</li>
            <li>It is at a reasonable price and it works for our fair skin.  </li>
            <li>she really loves the sunscreen for the good protection.</li>
            <li>It seems a bit greasy at first, but absorbs in, and it kept this lily-white New Englander sunburn free in the Florida sun, so I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li>I usually burn very easily, but this screen was perfect...</li>
            <li>This item is very effective and easy on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Excellent coverage and durability under extreme sport conditions.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen was really hard to wash off hands after application even with a lot of scrubbing, which is not a pro in itself, but did make me feel like there was really good water resistance so ideal for the beach.</li>
            <li>other reviewers have mentioned, Vanicream still rates highly (although not the highest) on EWG&#x27;s annual best sunscreens list, and while that&#x27;s a good start</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and transport.  </li>
            <li>My skin also burns easily and it protects my skin well.</li>
            <li>on easily</li>
            <li>Generally these work great but are sticky and leave a residue on the collar of my shirts.</li>
            <li>I feel good about using this every day and avoiding the chemicals that seep in from the normal brands.</li>
            <li>Its the best sunscreen hands down.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned, but live in Florida.  </li>
            <li>but the competition has really heated up for nontoxic, effective sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen goes on clean and blends in easily and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I am a tennis player and physical education teacher, therefore, I spend a great deal of time in the sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been allergic to most sunscreen since elementary school.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and rubs in well.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for the last four years and it works great.</li>
            <li>enjoy your summer.</li>
            <li>Goes on cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li>and it was one of two available for prime shipping on amazon.</li>
            <li>(I have light olive skin).</li>
            <li>It is light and smooth and absorbs rights in.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and creamy and there is no residue to be seen.</li>
            <li>Its price is within range of products available that&lt;</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several years and happy to see it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>If it comes off easily, then you&#x27;re not getting adequate protection.  </li>
            <li>well worth it in my book!</li>
            <li>Great product, always works, so long as it is reapplied as recommended (true of any sunscreen), and has never irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I liked the description for this as I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product goes on easy, vanishes quickly, and leaves no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li>I think the best policy is to cover up: wear long sleeves clothing to protect our skin from direct sun light.  </li>
            <li>This did not irritate my skin or cause breakouts-- a huge success for me.</li>
            <li>It also has wrinkle fighting ingredient, good enough for me, I&#x27;m 41</li>
            <li>This sunscreen holds up incredibly well while perspiring heavily or when swimming.  </li>
            <li>If you put too much on you will not be able to rub it all in and you will end up looking like a clown.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a more ghostly look unless you really rub it in.  </li>
            <li>Thicker than many products, so that took time to learn how much to put on.  </li>
            <li>If you are very patient and diligent in application, this may work for you, but I will keep hunting for a better product.</li>
            <li>(goes on nice, but washed off easily) and Livestrong ThinkSport/ThinkBaby (turned white sweat/water)...</li>
            <li>It still is good and will last a long time, so it is still a good buy.</li>
            <li>I know that in the summer months, I will need to make sure it goes on more heavily, as I live in a very sunny place, garden, and drive a convertible.</li>
            <li>A repeat  loyal customer.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and quality product.</li>
            <li>It works, zinc oxide is highly recommended, and it&#x27;s inexpensive in comparison to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>this is a good sunscreen for long hikes and hours on the beach.</li>
            <li>My new favorite is Solbar zinc.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>It also does a great job of protecting you from sunburn while still allowing you to get a little color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vanicream does a great job at protecting our faces, I just wish it was a little easier to apply</li>
            <li>While this is a zinc oxide sunscreen, is effective at preventing sun exposure, and doesn&#x27;t leave skin white, it still contains octinoxate, which is a hormone disruptor.  </li>
            <li>I apply about 3 times during a 12hr day, and rarely get a burn.  </li>
            <li>The old formula was quite ok for my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out or give me hives (I&#x27;m sensitive to most sunscreens)</li>
            <li>it does take some work to rub it all the way in, but i think it&#x27;s worth it for the protection you get.</li>
            <li>My daughter is allergic to so many creams and soaps that it shouldn&#x27;t have surprised me that she also was allergic to sunblock.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it&#x27;s on the safe to use list as far as ingredients are concerned.  </li>
            <li>This Sunscreen is right for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on vacation in Hawaii right now</li>
            <li>I purchased my first tube from the local dermatologists office, I really liked it</li>
            <li>added challenge was to find sunscreen that was free of an ingredient called Avobenzene that would react with the high iron in the waters of Bimini, and turn the boat orange wherever it touched.</li>
            <li>its exactly how it is described and its worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and am very fair, yet I came back with no real evidence of a tan at all, and no skin irritation even around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I burn easily, and have never gotten a burn while using it, and on occasion that has meant going out in direct summer sun all day long.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I use it mostly for golf, it does require an extra hand scrubbing with a brush to remove the residue, but again, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>So easy on sensitive skin and eyes that I use it as an eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I wear sunscreen everyday so it is important to me that I have something that is effective but also doesn&#x27;t irritate me.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, absorbs well, and is apparently less toxic then most.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, isn&#x27;t greasy and it works!</li>
            <li>I do wish they offered an higher SPF that is waterproof.</li>
            <li>I thought I can finally be out and about enjoying the sun again with Vanicream Sunblock</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t buy the big ones.</li>
            <li>In short, I love this</li>
            <li>My go to sun block is Solbar which is for sensitive skin, waterproof, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ll put it on willingly</li>
            <li>It is works great but a bit thick to put on.</li>
            <li>First introduced to product by dermatologist and his recommendation was spot on.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>goes on smooth with no irritation to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, I have gone through many different brands of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I love beach vacations but would always get rashes which we thought were related to sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I used to have issues rubbing in the higher SPFs.</li>
            <li>This product it’s an excellent choice  for people who has a very delicate and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Has some of the downsides as other suncreens--a bit greasy and can stain black clothing--but I find this product works best for sun protection.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very gentle and good for my skin, but it is very cakey and not easy to smoothe in.</li>
            <li>Exceptional UV protection from harsh subtropical sun.  </li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen for a beach vacation based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it all over the world and so far no bad sunburns.</li>
            <li>I found out about Vanicream after reading the EWG reviews, and after trying many different highly rated sunscreens on that list.  </li>
            <li>They both also have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Pure sunscrreen</li>
            <li>I burn very easily so it&#x27;s important to me to get full body coverage, especially at the beach, and honestly I feel like it took at least 30 mins for me to apply this all over.</li>
            <li>Inevitably though, we would have missed spots and ended up getting burnt there (the skin that was sunscreened was fine).</li>
            <li>Feels like very high end lotion.  </li>
            <li>I live in FL, so having the right sunscreen really matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We adopted a little boy from China, whom we found out on the first day of swimming, is highly allergic to sunscreens of any kind.</li>
            <li>I thought this went on smooth enough, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to provide me with much protection, and I broke out with it on my face.</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s important to squeeze out just enough to coat.  </li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t disappear quite as fast as i would like.</li>
            <li>However even if you do put too much on</li>
            <li>There is no greasy residue with this lotion, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>One application was sufficient for the whole day, except in places like my brow where I was sweating and wiping the lotion away.</li>
            <li>It is thicker and harder to rub in, whereas the others are more liquidy.  </li>
            <li>Also, this had a nice dry-touch feel to it on the skin which I love because I hate the greasy feel of most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Vanicream has worked very well for me and has kept my Rosacea in control</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years, primarily,  on my face.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I used the product once a day for 4 days straight, on my face, neck and forearms.</li>
            <li>I really like the Vanicream sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anything that Vanicream makes!  </li>
            <li>The product works very well.</li>
            <li>After recent Mohs surgery for basal cell carcinoma on my nose, my dermatologist suggested Vanicream - the one product his most chemical sensitive patients could handle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering that the price is about half of the comparable, highly rated sunscreens, it&#x27;s a great value, and it&#x27;s the only sunscreen I use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have tried many other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; sunscreens and found them greasy, filmy, and/or ineffective.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid runner and cyclist with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t leave a white cast like most physical sunscreen .</li>
            <li>Most recently, I have started experiencing severe reactions to sunscreen, but only on my face.  </li>
            <li>It is difficult to find (only on-line and in pharmacies), but has excellent results.  </li>
            <li>recently ordered some more, but did not realized that I ordered the non-sport version which is only SPF 30 instead of SPF 35.</li>
            <li>So long story short, I really wanted to love this sunscreen, and it has a lotof positives.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my highly irritable skin.</li>
            <li>Rated highly by the EWG for non-toxicity.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many sunscreens but they all break me out in little bumps and rashes.</li>
            <li>An effective sunscreen, especially for the active person who spends a lot of time in the sun.  </li>
            <li>My son has bad excezma and we have been using the Vanicream sunscreen for years with great results!  </li>
            <li>I live in the high desert.</li>
            <li>(made me pasty white, especially in water), BurnOut (washed off really easy), Beyond Coastal Natural (didn&#x27;t work, got burned), Climb On!</li>
            <li>I had cellulitis and have new skin on my legs~</li>
            <li>This new formula burns my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping that I had found my new sunscreen, but it wasn&#x27;t to be.</li>
            <li>and that is saying a lot since we live in Florida</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and</li>
            <li>My new every day go-to sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It is only good for 80 minutes and found it hard to keep having to reapply every hour or so.  </li>
            <li>I was outdoors, but under a huge tent, out in the sun for only brief moments.</li>
            <li>My wife and kids are very sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>Does not cause break-outs for my very sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My daughter is very sensitive to sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>No one in our family has ever burned, it soaks in easily, lasts for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film.</li>
            <li>Tried many many sunblocks and I still got rashes and some was so bad it took a whole month to recover.</li>
            <li>This is the second year I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen, since it was rated in the top ten in EWG testing last year.  </li>
            <li>For the first time - no reaction, no redness, no breakouts, no welts that last for days.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get burned once the entire week, even during a whole day of beach/surfing!</li>
            <li>My red headed boyfriend has extremely sensitive skin and the Vanicream protects his skin without giving him a chemical burn like so many other products.</li>
            <li>If your skin is a bit dry you may want to use moisturizer right before putting it on to aid in the application.</li>
            <li>Active Sunscreen SPF 40 1oz by True Natural Cosmetics]]</li>
            <li>I also took with me my old standby, Coppertone Waterbabies, SPF50, [[ASIN:B001QXDZKM Coppertone Waterbabies Sunscreen Lotion Pure &amp; Simple, SPF 50, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sun sensitive and regularly apply it once during the day and after recreational activity</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to sunscreen..</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>I bought the Vanicream Sport SPF 30 sensitive skin and the Vanicream Sensitive Skin spf 60.</li>
            <li>I use it on my child who has eczema and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I also use it on all my childrens&#x27; faces and they do not complain that it ever gets in their eyes, plus my 3 and 5 year old apply it themselves to their face and have no problems.</li>
            <li>My daughter has eczema and is highly sensitive to sunscreens.</li>
            <li>but I feel it doesn&#x27;t provide as much protection as the blue lizard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>it does not irritate the eczema, 2) protects her skin from the sun 3) and allows the eczema to heal from the suns natural</li>
            <li>Dermatitis (sensibility to off shelf products with additives) has not reacted - thought used only a handful times before seeing real results</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen that really protect my face.</li>
            <li>have used this product for years since I developed an allergy to parabens.  </li>
            <li>It does go on thick, but I love the fact it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using their sunscreen guide, because unfortunately most sunscreens are not nearly effective enough and also include risky ingredients for our bodies.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker than most sunscreens I&#x27;ve used so a little does go a long way.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and rich!  </li>
            <li>Decent product overall.</li>
            <li>Looks a little white when you first put it on but white fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s not a thick, white coating.  </li>
            <li>I use several brands of sun blocker and look for new brands from time to time.</li>
            <li>I have dark olive skin and as long as you rubbed the sunscreen in really well, this did not leave as much of a white cast as I would expect given the zinc levels (it still shows more than some other sunscreens though).</li>
            <li>Although applying it can take some time and it does leave a little shine, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Great product, a little tough to get off your skin after application, but i rather scrub a bit extra in the shower than stay in the sun with no protection.</li>
            <li>The reason I am giving it three stars is because it is very thick - more of a paste than a lotion.</li>
            <li>I recently returned from a vacation where I was out in direct August sun in Istanbul, Jerusalem and Cairo.</li>
            <li>Having extremely sensitive skin (including eczema), it has been a challenge to find a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t cause an adverse reaction - especially on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone - but especially to those who feel as I did that there wasn&#x27;t a sunscreen made for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoother than blue lizard sensitive</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been looking for a sunscreen that won&#x27;t aggravate the rosacea that I&#x27;ve developed over the last year.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on it is barely noticeable-no oilyness at all.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Our preschooler is wildly allergic to regular sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I recommend Vanicream for those with extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has gotten near my eyes and bothered them- the big reason I avoid sunblock.</li>
            <li>It was difficult to find an effective sunscreen that did not make me breakout.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so thick it doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as the Coppertone Sport</li>
            <li>: To answer the question of what other sunscreens I tried along with this one, I used Active Sunscreen SPF 40 3oz by True Natural Cosmetics, [[ASIN:B0051PLB7U</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended I use this sunscreen for daily use since I have sensitive skin and a few irritated spots appeared on my face, most likely due to sun damage.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy without that thick white goo on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I like this sunscreen over a whole lot of other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>It works really well to prevent burning and is almost invisible, unlike other zinc sunscreen products.  </li>
            <li>A little thick to put on, but effective.</li>
            <li>looks a little ghostly when first applied, but ends up being translucent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on very thick, but that&#x27;s a very small price to pay when it comes to getting a great product that protects you from the sun and harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li>But ultimately, I need something that is quick and simple to apply so that I will be encouraged to wear it everyday and reapply as necessary.</li>
            <li>It does take a little time to work in as it will look white at first.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and so only a dab is needed for the face and does require a little more effort to apply.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I did love the fact that is non-greasy and feels wonderful on your skin.</li>
            <li> she is a good Doc and uses the best ointments/creams available.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a good lotion for a number of years, and then they changed something in the formulation and now I feel like a greased pig when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Both sunscreens are good.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise all good.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen is good, but not a holy grail and here&#x27;s why:  PROS:</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> Good for all skin types and all ages.  </li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> stuff was affordable and gets good reviews.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the skin protection this product gives and it is scent free.</li>
            <li> Good shield of sunshine, no oily feeling, no unwanted chemicals.</li>
            <li> my dermatologist friend has samples of these in her office, so i figure it&#x27;s a good bet.</li>
            <li> but this is the best and super inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I have been very satisfied in using it.</li>
            <li> She is allergic to most sunscreans, so this is a great help</li>
            <li> We have suggested this product to many friends and family members and everyone that has tried it has also had great results.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased!  </li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> but I love it!</li>
            <li> love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love all their products!</li>
            <li> So glad there&#x27;s something he can use!</li>
            <li> i first got it because i read about the 25 best sunscreens on some list</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> My kids are super fair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used the Vanicream Lite Lotion and was thrilled to find that they make sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> it does eventually fade in on its own.  </li>
            <li> This was a  request from the owners of Wildquest, who own the boat, and host the retreat we attended.  </li>
            <li> My family all plays tennis and an effective sunscreen</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sunscreen that had safe ingredients, good SPF, and would be effective when swimming.</li>
            <li> I bought this before going on vacation to Mexico and liked the product.  </li>
            <li> Product is very good and the source and shipping were prompt and reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> By far, I find this to be the best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used California Baby and liked it better.</li>
            <li> I also need to know that I&#x27;ve gotten good coverage since I burn so easily, and I just can&#x27;t be confident of that with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> No scary ingredients, stays on and does its job great.  </li>
            <li> It works well, rubs in easily, and prevents sunburn effectively.  </li>
            <li> so I am sure to never run out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff-</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this transaction.</li>
            <li> I am able to use makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I plan to order more to give to my family.  </li>
            <li> I applied once before going out for the day, then one or two more applications during the day.</li>
            <li> California Baby has a fragrance to it and is a bit more greasy.  </li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It blends well and safe for skin.  </li>
            <li> Better that then a bunch of unpronounceable chemicals.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was ok.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It is on the greasy side and more appropriate for use when you are involved in an outdoor sport vs wearing it under makeup.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t found it to be better than others but dermatologist favors this product.</li>
            <li> We have been buying Vanicream Sunscreen Sport for many years.  </li>
            <li> and I love all their products</li>
            <li> I apply this on my face and have avoided more sun damage.  </li>
            <li> This is very non-greasy and a great product.</li>
            <li> Of course she probably has a business relationship with the manufacturer, but that&#x27;s okay......</li>
            <li> I have told lots of people who have also tried it and love it.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate it&#x27;s non fragrance, as I have many allergies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price and worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love it--it serves as my moisturizer and sun screen in the morning every day.  </li>
            <li> Have tried many over the years</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Many sunscreen products cause reactions for those with skin sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I was very happy and will take this sunscreen on my next vacation.</li>
            <li> which was pretty good also, and also rated well on the EWG Sunscreen App.</li>
            <li> so it is easier to spread if it is slightly warm and spread quickly.</li>
            <li> I figured if they were selling it, it must be safe and free of all the yucky stuff many sunscreens contain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Vanicream blended better and is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have now been using this for 2 summers no rash, but most important never have a burn not even at the beginning of summer when I have no tan</li>
            <li> Is works great on my sensitive skin, even in 110+ heat.</li>
            <li> It is at a reasonable price and it works for our fair skin.  </li>
            <li> she really loves the sunscreen for the good protection.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit greasy at first, but absorbs in, and it kept this lily-white New Englander sunburn free in the Florida sun, so I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li> I usually burn very easily, but this screen was perfect...</li>
            <li> This item is very effective and easy on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Excellent coverage and durability under extreme sport conditions.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen was really hard to wash off hands after application even with a lot of scrubbing, which is not a pro in itself, but did make me feel like there was really good water resistance so ideal for the beach.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned, Vanicream still rates highly (although not the highest) on EWG&#x27;s annual best sunscreens list, and while that&#x27;s a good start</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and transport.  </li>
            <li> My skin also burns easily and it protects my skin well.</li>
            <li> on easily</li>
            <li> Generally these work great but are sticky and leave a residue on the collar of my shirts.</li>
            <li> I feel good about using this every day and avoiding the chemicals that seep in from the normal brands.</li>
            <li> Its the best sunscreen hands down.  </li>
            <li> I am fair skinned, but live in Florida.  </li>
            <li> but the competition has really heated up for nontoxic, effective sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on clean and blends in easily and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I am a tennis player and physical education teacher, therefore, I spend a great deal of time in the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been allergic to most sunscreen since elementary school.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and rubs in well.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for the last four years and it works great.</li>
            <li> enjoy your summer.</li>
            <li> Goes on cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li> and it was one of two available for prime shipping on amazon.</li>
            <li> (I have light olive skin).</li>
            <li> It is light and smooth and absorbs rights in.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and creamy and there is no residue to be seen.</li>
            <li> Its price is within range of products available that&lt;</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years and happy to see it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> If it comes off easily, then you&#x27;re not getting adequate protection.  </li>
            <li> well worth it in my book!</li>
            <li> Great product, always works, so long as it is reapplied as recommended (true of any sunscreen), and has never irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I liked the description for this as I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product goes on easy, vanishes quickly, and leaves no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I think the best policy is to cover up: wear long sleeves clothing to protect our skin from direct sun light.  </li>
            <li> This did not irritate my skin or cause breakouts-- a huge success for me.</li>
            <li> It also has wrinkle fighting ingredient, good enough for me, I&#x27;m 41</li>
            <li> This sunscreen holds up incredibly well while perspiring heavily or when swimming.  </li>
            <li> If you put too much on you will not be able to rub it all in and you will end up looking like a clown.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a more ghostly look unless you really rub it in.  </li>
            <li> Thicker than many products, so that took time to learn how much to put on.  </li>
            <li> If you are very patient and diligent in application, this may work for you, but I will keep hunting for a better product.</li>
            <li> (goes on nice, but washed off easily) and Livestrong ThinkSport/ThinkBaby (turned white sweat/water)...</li>
            <li> It still is good and will last a long time, so it is still a good buy.</li>
            <li> I know that in the summer months, I will need to make sure it goes on more heavily, as I live in a very sunny place, garden, and drive a convertible.</li>
            <li> A repeat  loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and quality product.</li>
            <li> It works, zinc oxide is highly recommended, and it&#x27;s inexpensive in comparison to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> this is a good sunscreen for long hikes and hours on the beach.</li>
            <li> My new favorite is Solbar zinc.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> It also does a great job of protecting you from sunburn while still allowing you to get a little color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vanicream does a great job at protecting our faces, I just wish it was a little easier to apply</li>
            <li> While this is a zinc oxide sunscreen, is effective at preventing sun exposure, and doesn&#x27;t leave skin white, it still contains octinoxate, which is a hormone disruptor.  </li>
            <li> I apply about 3 times during a 12hr day, and rarely get a burn.  </li>
            <li> The old formula was quite ok for my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out or give me hives (I&#x27;m sensitive to most sunscreens)</li>
            <li> it does take some work to rub it all the way in, but i think it&#x27;s worth it for the protection you get.</li>
            <li> My daughter is allergic to so many creams and soaps that it shouldn&#x27;t have surprised me that she also was allergic to sunblock.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s on the safe to use list as far as ingredients are concerned.  </li>
            <li> This Sunscreen is right for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on vacation in Hawaii right now</li>
            <li> I purchased my first tube from the local dermatologists office, I really liked it</li>
            <li> added challenge was to find sunscreen that was free of an ingredient called Avobenzene that would react with the high iron in the waters of Bimini, and turn the boat orange wherever it touched.</li>
            <li> its exactly how it is described and its worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and am very fair, yet I came back with no real evidence of a tan at all, and no skin irritation even around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I burn easily, and have never gotten a burn while using it, and on occasion that has meant going out in direct summer sun all day long.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I use it mostly for golf, it does require an extra hand scrubbing with a brush to remove the residue, but again, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> So easy on sensitive skin and eyes that I use it as an eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen everyday so it is important to me that I have something that is effective but also doesn&#x27;t irritate me.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, absorbs well, and is apparently less toxic then most.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, isn&#x27;t greasy and it works!</li>
            <li> I do wish they offered an higher SPF that is waterproof.</li>
            <li> I thought I can finally be out and about enjoying the sun again with Vanicream Sunblock</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t buy the big ones.</li>
            <li> In short, I love this</li>
            <li> My go to sun block is Solbar which is for sensitive skin, waterproof, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ll put it on willingly</li>
            <li> It is works great but a bit thick to put on.</li>
            <li> First introduced to product by dermatologist and his recommendation was spot on.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> goes on smooth with no irritation to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Over the years, I have gone through many different brands of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I love beach vacations but would always get rashes which we thought were related to sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I used to have issues rubbing in the higher SPFs.</li>
            <li> This product it’s an excellent choice  for people who has a very delicate and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Has some of the downsides as other suncreens--a bit greasy and can stain black clothing--but I find this product works best for sun protection.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very gentle and good for my skin, but it is very cakey and not easy to smoothe in.</li>
            <li> Exceptional UV protection from harsh subtropical sun.  </li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen for a beach vacation based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it all over the world and so far no bad sunburns.</li>
            <li> I found out about Vanicream after reading the EWG reviews, and after trying many different highly rated sunscreens on that list.  </li>
            <li> They both also have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Pure sunscrreen</li>
            <li> I burn very easily so it&#x27;s important to me to get full body coverage, especially at the beach, and honestly I feel like it took at least 30 mins for me to apply this all over.</li>
            <li> Inevitably though, we would have missed spots and ended up getting burnt there (the skin that was sunscreened was fine).</li>
            <li> Feels like very high end lotion.  </li>
            <li> I live in FL, so having the right sunscreen really matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We adopted a little boy from China, whom we found out on the first day of swimming, is highly allergic to sunscreens of any kind.</li>
            <li> I thought this went on smooth enough, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to provide me with much protection, and I broke out with it on my face.</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s important to squeeze out just enough to coat.  </li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t disappear quite as fast as i would like.</li>
            <li> However even if you do put too much on</li>
            <li> There is no greasy residue with this lotion, which I really like.  </li>
            <li> One application was sufficient for the whole day, except in places like my brow where I was sweating and wiping the lotion away.</li>
            <li> It is thicker and harder to rub in, whereas the others are more liquidy.  </li>
            <li> Also, this had a nice dry-touch feel to it on the skin which I love because I hate the greasy feel of most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Vanicream has worked very well for me and has kept my Rosacea in control</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, primarily,  on my face.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I used the product once a day for 4 days straight, on my face, neck and forearms.</li>
            <li> I really like the Vanicream sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anything that Vanicream makes!  </li>
            <li> The product works very well.</li>
            <li> After recent Mohs surgery for basal cell carcinoma on my nose, my dermatologist suggested Vanicream - the one product his most chemical sensitive patients could handle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering that the price is about half of the comparable, highly rated sunscreens, it&#x27;s a great value, and it&#x27;s the only sunscreen I use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have tried many other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; sunscreens and found them greasy, filmy, and/or ineffective.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid runner and cyclist with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t leave a white cast like most physical sunscreen .</li>
            <li> Most recently, I have started experiencing severe reactions to sunscreen, but only on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find (only on-line and in pharmacies), but has excellent results.  </li>
            <li> recently ordered some more, but did not realized that I ordered the non-sport version which is only SPF 30 instead of SPF 35.</li>
            <li> So long story short, I really wanted to love this sunscreen, and it has a lotof positives.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my highly irritable skin.</li>
            <li> Rated highly by the EWG for non-toxicity.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many sunscreens but they all break me out in little bumps and rashes.</li>
            <li> An effective sunscreen, especially for the active person who spends a lot of time in the sun.  </li>
            <li> My son has bad excezma and we have been using the Vanicream sunscreen for years with great results!  </li>
            <li> I live in the high desert.</li>
            <li> (made me pasty white, especially in water), BurnOut (washed off really easy), Beyond Coastal Natural (didn&#x27;t work, got burned), Climb On!</li>
            <li> I had cellulitis and have new skin on my legs~</li>
            <li> This new formula burns my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that I had found my new sunscreen, but it wasn&#x27;t to be.</li>
            <li> and that is saying a lot since we live in Florida</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and</li>
            <li> My new every day go-to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It is only good for 80 minutes and found it hard to keep having to reapply every hour or so.  </li>
            <li> I was outdoors, but under a huge tent, out in the sun for only brief moments.</li>
            <li> My wife and kids are very sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li> Does not cause break-outs for my very sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My daughter is very sensitive to sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> No one in our family has ever burned, it soaks in easily, lasts for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film.</li>
            <li> Tried many many sunblocks and I still got rashes and some was so bad it took a whole month to recover.</li>
            <li> This is the second year I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen, since it was rated in the top ten in EWG testing last year.  </li>
            <li> For the first time - no reaction, no redness, no breakouts, no welts that last for days.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get burned once the entire week, even during a whole day of beach/surfing!</li>
            <li> My red headed boyfriend has extremely sensitive skin and the Vanicream protects his skin without giving him a chemical burn like so many other products.</li>
            <li> If your skin is a bit dry you may want to use moisturizer right before putting it on to aid in the application.</li>
            <li> Active Sunscreen SPF 40 1oz by True Natural Cosmetics]]</li>
            <li> I also took with me my old standby, Coppertone Waterbabies, SPF50, [[ASIN:B001QXDZKM Coppertone Waterbabies Sunscreen Lotion Pure &amp; Simple, SPF 50, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sun sensitive and regularly apply it once during the day and after recreational activity</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to sunscreen..</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Vanicream Sport SPF 30 sensitive skin and the Vanicream Sensitive Skin spf 60.</li>
            <li> I use it on my child who has eczema and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I also use it on all my childrens&#x27; faces and they do not complain that it ever gets in their eyes, plus my 3 and 5 year old apply it themselves to their face and have no problems.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and is highly sensitive to sunscreens.</li>
            <li> but I feel it doesn&#x27;t provide as much protection as the blue lizard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> it does not irritate the eczema, 2) protects her skin from the sun 3) and allows the eczema to heal from the suns natural</li>
            <li> Dermatitis (sensibility to off shelf products with additives) has not reacted - thought used only a handful times before seeing real results</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that really protect my face.</li>
            <li> have used this product for years since I developed an allergy to parabens.  </li>
            <li> It does go on thick, but I love the fact it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend using their sunscreen guide, because unfortunately most sunscreens are not nearly effective enough and also include risky ingredients for our bodies.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than most sunscreens I&#x27;ve used so a little does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and rich!  </li>
            <li> Decent product overall.</li>
            <li> Looks a little white when you first put it on but white fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s not a thick, white coating.  </li>
            <li> I use several brands of sun blocker and look for new brands from time to time.</li>
            <li> I have dark olive skin and as long as you rubbed the sunscreen in really well, this did not leave as much of a white cast as I would expect given the zinc levels (it still shows more than some other sunscreens though).</li>
            <li> Although applying it can take some time and it does leave a little shine, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Great product, a little tough to get off your skin after application, but i rather scrub a bit extra in the shower than stay in the sun with no protection.</li>
            <li> The reason I am giving it three stars is because it is very thick - more of a paste than a lotion.</li>
            <li> I recently returned from a vacation where I was out in direct August sun in Istanbul, Jerusalem and Cairo.</li>
            <li> Having extremely sensitive skin (including eczema), it has been a challenge to find a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t cause an adverse reaction - especially on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone - but especially to those who feel as I did that there wasn&#x27;t a sunscreen made for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoother than blue lizard sensitive</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been looking for a sunscreen that won&#x27;t aggravate the rosacea that I&#x27;ve developed over the last year.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s on it is barely noticeable-no oilyness at all.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Our preschooler is wildly allergic to regular sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I recommend Vanicream for those with extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has gotten near my eyes and bothered them- the big reason I avoid sunblock.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find an effective sunscreen that did not make me breakout.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick it doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as the Coppertone Sport</li>
            <li> : To answer the question of what other sunscreens I tried along with this one, I used Active Sunscreen SPF 40 3oz by True Natural Cosmetics, [[ASIN:B0051PLB7U</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I use this sunscreen for daily use since I have sensitive skin and a few irritated spots appeared on my face, most likely due to sun damage.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy without that thick white goo on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen over a whole lot of other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> It works really well to prevent burning and is almost invisible, unlike other zinc sunscreen products.  </li>
            <li> A little thick to put on, but effective.</li>
            <li> looks a little ghostly when first applied, but ends up being translucent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on very thick, but that&#x27;s a very small price to pay when it comes to getting a great product that protects you from the sun and harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li> But ultimately, I need something that is quick and simple to apply so that I will be encouraged to wear it everyday and reapply as necessary.</li>
            <li> It does take a little time to work in as it will look white at first.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and so only a dab is needed for the face and does require a little more effort to apply.  </li>
            <li> My5 year old daughter has suffered with extreme eczema and this is the only sunscreen that works.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin due to various chemical allergies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; with no scent, limited ingredients, and highly rated by the EWG.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and sensitive skin - all other sunscreens have caused him to break out.  </li>
            <li> It does go on thick, so it requires a little extra rubbing/spreading, but it&#x27;s worth it to finally have a natural sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make you glow once you get in the water</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it goes on very thick and bottles get used up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I would typically apply bronzer to help counter act this effect, otherwise it looked kind of weird.</li>
            <li> tested this out on a week long vacation to Hawaii, where we were outside in the sun a lot...</li>
            <li> It is long lasting, even after snorkeling for two hours.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty thick, but glides on smoother than others.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little to thoroughly cover your face, although it does take some doing to get it completely rubbed in.</li>
            <li> Very thick consistency and leaves no white residue on skin once it&#x27;s absorbed.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both got so frustrated that 20 minutes into application we&#x27;d kind of give up and hope we&#x27;d got enough coverage.</li>
            <li> She then tried the Vanicream Sensitive Skin SPF 60 a few days later and broke out immediately.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, this product does not cause any skin reactions and gives me total protection from the harsh sun at 8,000 feet here in the mountains.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I&#x27;ll reapply lotion to be careful</li>
            <li> so there really is no better litmus test than what I go through in a normal work day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using vanicream sunscreen for a long time.</li>
            <li> Does not take that long to work in.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen was fine, but it&#x27;s quite thick &amp; hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and until I found this product, I was not able to use sunscreen because it made my skin burn and itch.  </li>
            <li> It does cast a white shadow where you put it, and is a little greasy, but it actually works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind any of the above if I&#x27;m just going for a run, or doing some other activity</li>
            <li> It provides lasting protection without any greasy residue to get on my clothing and other things.</li>
            <li> It does make my face white but not as much as other zinc oxide sunscreens I have used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very low in toxins, it makes a great base before I put on my makeup, and it even helps to fill in my wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> but it does dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> An hour later, I was covered in a heavy rash ONLY on the portions of my body where I had applied Vanicream.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to almost all sunscreens except the ones denoted &amp;#34;pure and free&amp;#34; as well as only for use on a &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; (containing titanium dioxide as the active ingredient).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the only sunscreens that protect my 4 year old red heads delicate skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark skinned African-American female and I didn&#x27;t find the product whitening/</li>
            <li> I did not put any sunscreen on today, was only out in the sun for less than two hours</li>
            <li> Not only does it protect my skin, it seems to make it healthier--less redness, less dryness.</li>
            <li> If I have been swimming a lot, or have been out all day, I usually will touch up later in the day with Kinesys spray sunsceen (in the white or orange bottles), which I also like.  </li>
            <li> While it is a little thicker than norm, the Vanicream Sport 35 worked well, whether on a FL vacation or for daily pool use.</li>
            <li> People who has melasma should wear it every 2hrs only on the dark spots!</li>
            <li> I was often tempted to make application easier by pre-mixing with a little of the regular vanicream lotion, but I have a feeling this would diminish the SPF factor.</li>
            <li> I even started to use it daily on my little</li>
            <li> This sunscreen can be tough to wash off-but that really is a plus.  </li>
            <li> I only use it on her face because all other sunscreens blister her face!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I would purchase again not because it so bad, but because I found others I like better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not exaggerating, I was honestly annoyed at how much beach time I was wasting trying to lotion up.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s not really not that difficult.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several bottles of this now and have found it&#x27;s one of the few sunscreens that continues to work while I sweat.  </li>
            <li> It was also a bit harder to blend in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 12 hours in the sun without reapplying &amp; still didn&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li> Just what we expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter now, so curious as to how I will handle it in the summer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little expensive, but for me, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It seems all products that block out the sun go on very heavy but at least I have not broken out from this one.</li>
            <li> The product absorbs faster than other products I&#x27;ve tried from Vanicream.  </li>
            <li> My kids don&#x27;t complain about putting on an ounce of this suncream like they do the other brands.</li>
            <li> I recommend to check out this website about this product and other sunscreens as well to compare.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with a couple of other options, for my vacation to Bimini, Bahamas.</li>
            <li> Unlike other sunscreens, this stuff never makes me itchy.  </li>
            <li> It works through my activity, sweating, and other stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hope this helps other parents and kids with eczema or skin allergies.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin like a lot of other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> No more swollen, itchy red skin!</li>
            <li> There is no burning sensation when put on the faces of children as there is with other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I buy 8 tubes at the beginning of every summer to leave in each of our swim bags, at home, and in the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have purchased other Vanicream sunscreen products, and while they all work, the Sport stays on the longest in the pool and during sports.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I become allergic to all other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for the other parts of the body that&#x27;s exposed to the sun.</li>
            <li> Other sunscreens sting my eyes due to my being allergic to some chemical in them.</li>
            <li> My old standby Coppertone Sport (chemical based) would have had a hard time matching that!</li>
            <li> I used to use, but it has none of the bad ingredients, so the extra effort is worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has no smell and is not very greasy as I hate putting any lotions or creams on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t forget you&#x27;re meant to reapply sunscreen every few hours, especially after swimming, so there was just a lot of time wasted putting on sunscreen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little expensive, but after the amount of money you spend on finding the right product you will not have to search any longer.</li>
            <li> The only downside of this product is it feels very greasy, though for my dry skin that wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> Because it is really thick, it is a hassle to put on, but it does last.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the slight scent affected my sinuses.</li>
            <li> No more redness or  dry skin.</li>
            <li> This leaves a slightly whitish color but that&#x27;s typical for my skin...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like the typical sun screen.</li>
            <li> While it takes slightly longer to rub in, she can wear it without any problems.</li>
            <li> On Amazon, however, it was nearly half that price, and with my Prime membership, shipped</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed, because, on the plus side, Vanicream is the first SPF product that has not left a metallic taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Also the sunscreen leaves a slightly shiny film.</li>
            <li> Does not make a mess.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen is thick due to the zinc (making it hard to spread and leaving a bit of a white cast), but this is what prevents skin cancer, so I cannot complain.</li>
            <li> I discovered this sunscreen a little over two years ago at the Mayo Clinic&#x27;s store in their basement.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well into my skin, leaving little visible whiteness.</li>
            <li> It was a little \\&quot;lumpy\\&quot; in texture, if that makes sense, and I don&#x27;t feel it stayed on as well as the Vanicream.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but</li>
            <li> Once rubbed in, it does leave a little bit of a shine to my skin - it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, just shines.</li>
            <li> so little chance of getting sun-burned, but we are at some elevation</li>
            <li> It is thicker to apply and takes a little time (you have to work on one section of your face at a time).</li>
            <li> I just wish it were a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Our other son, who usually gets rashes after a few days of sun and sunscreen on the beach, used it as well.</li>
            <li> but no, it was not meant to be because a few minutes after I put a little bit of it on my skin as a test, I started feeling itchy and soon after - the rashes appeared.</li>
            <li> I see it&#x27;s down to #20 this year, (out of 469 tested!)  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is not available in any store and not very many websites.</li>
            <li> It is a little thick and difficult to blend in however it is gentle on the skin so that it doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the heavy coverage and protection of this suncreen.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and dries in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few sunscreens that I can wear without getting an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use this both as my everyday lotion, under my make-up and as sunscreen for the beach, etc.</li>
            <li> so I use sunscreen year round on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of the few sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen everyday on my face.  </li>
            <li> It was too time consuming to apply and leaves my skin ever so slightly pale looking</li>
            <li> Due to an allergy to common ingredients in over the counter sunscreens, my dermatologist recommended Vanicream.  </li>
            <li> It is rather thick, and rubbing it into my skin takes a little time.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy a couple tubes at a time</li>
            <li> and I used this product for the past week.  </li>
            <li> I knew it worked for me in the past, and I ended up sharing that</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult to re-apply every 2 hours while exercising for several hours.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but agreed to try it - as I now have to wear SPF 30 daily on my face.  </li>
            <li> They usually sting and burn her skin, so my dermatologist recommended this for her (and me, as I had melanoma 3 years ago).</li>
            <li> At noon on the fourth day, I felt woozy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> No more skin problems.  </li>
            <li> kids may not love it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run even with heavy face sweating!</li>
            <li> Also like the fact it does not contain some of the unhealthy chemicals found in other brands.</li>
            <li> No strong odor either!</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that it is too thick and difficult to spread around and work into the skin.</li>
            <li> This is SO hard to apply.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find, and it was over $20 a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Hard to apply.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is really thick and hard to spread and rub in.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to have at least have somewhat of a tan.  </li>
            <li> It sucks.  </li>
            <li> If I get it on too thickly, it can be tricky to spread or remove some</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so thick feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The one thing is that it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just thick and tacky, otherwise no harm.</li>
            <li> My twelve year old twins and my husband hate suncreens that feel greasy or have a heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> It is a thick cream</li>
            <li> Works well, goes on thick.  </li>
            <li> It is really thick</li>
            <li> No more rashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to sunscreen &amp; other random face products.</li>
            <li> Slightly more expensive but nothing outrageous.  </li>
            <li> Some of the others smell bad or don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> Too thick!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and works like cream.</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s minor due to the fact that it keeps those evil UVA and UVB rays from penetrating the skin.</li>
            <li> She tried the Vanicream Sport for a while and it seemed to work during the day, but after she came home from soccer practice, she had broken out in a rash.</li>
            <li> It is about 50%less expensive ordering through Amazon than getting from the Dermatologist (at least from My Dermatologist)!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, she has also had problems with the blocking sunscreens.</li>
            <li> We bought this after growing concern over the ill effects of chemical sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> The one-star is erroneous, but I had to mark something in order to write a review.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with either.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the greasy feeling or unpleasant scent that I had come to associate with sunscreens, too, so I don&#x27;t mind wearing it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have any terrible smell.</li>
            <li> Two years ago I had a terrible case of actinic keritosis, a precursor to squamous cell cancer.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This Sunscreen is right for me.  Was recommended by a Dermatologist.  My skin is sensitive to sunscreen..skin turns red when applied, but this Vanicream works..no redness. YES!</li>
            <li> I had cellulitis and have new skin on my legs~ my dermatologist recommended this to avoid sun burn while I was on vacation last month.  It worked great-no sunburn and no irritation from the sun screen.</li>
            <li> My wife and kids are very sensitive to chemicals. This did not irritate their skin. Worked well.</li>
            <li> I discovered this sunscreen a little over two years ago at the Mayo Clinic&#x27;s store in their basement. I figured if they were selling it, it must be safe and free of all the yucky stuff many sunscreens contain.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, isn&#x27;t greasy and it works! I usually buy a couple tubes at a time so I am sure to never run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this suncreen for years.  I&#x27;m very sun sensitive and regularly apply it once during the day and after recreational activity all day I haven&#x27;t been burned once.  Occasionally I&#x27;ll reapply lotion to be careful but I&#x27;ve only burned where I&#x27;ve missed a spot.</li>
            <li> My5 year old daughter has suffered with extreme eczema and this is the only sunscreen that works. It does go on thick, but I love the fact it&#x27;s waterproof. I do wish they offered an higher SPF that is waterproof. This does not sting or irritate her skin even when she&#x27;s scratch until the skin is open.  I use vanicream soap, lotion, and vaniply as well and I am happy with everything.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said this is the best sunscreen.It also has wrinkle fighting ingredient, good enough for me, I&#x27;m 41 my kids are in their 20&#x27;s everyone thinks I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is the second year I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen, since it was rated in the top ten in EWG testing last year.  I see it&#x27;s down to #20 this year, (out of 469 tested!)  but the competition has really heated up for nontoxic, effective sunscreens.  I burn easily, and have never gotten a burn while using it, and on occasion that has meant going out in direct summer sun all day long.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars rather than 5 because it does take a bit of effort to apply.  I find it&#x27;s important to squeeze out just enough to coat.  If I get it on too thickly, it can be tricky to spread or remove some so there&#x27;s not a thick, white coating.  That being said, it&#x27;s not really not that difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Considering that the price is about half of the comparable, highly rated sunscreens, it&#x27;s a great value, and it&#x27;s the only sunscreen I use.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is the best!  I have used the Vanicream Lite Lotion and was thrilled to find that they make sunscreen.  It&#x27;s thicker than most sunscreens I&#x27;ve used so a little does go a long way.  My son always would break out in a rash when I put the name brand name sunscreens on his face.  He never had a reaction using Vanicream sunscreen. It stays on in the water too.</li>
            <li> I have skin allergy toward sunblocks. Tried many many sunblocks and I still got rashes and some was so bad it took a whole month to recover. I thought I can finally be out and about enjoying the sun again with Vanicream Sunblock but no, it was not meant to be because a few minutes after I put a little bit of it on my skin as a test, I started feeling itchy and soon after - the rashes appeared. I do have to say I like the fact that it&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t give you an extra sheen of sweat, like you just got out from the shower. I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t buy the big ones.</li>
            <li> This product goes on easy, vanishes quickly, and leaves no unpleasant odor. I like it&#x27;s UVB and UVA rating.</li>
            <li> This product is not greasy.  It&#x27;s unlike the others.  It&#x27;s very thick and works like cream.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff- it works great under makeup, not perfumed, my face doesnt react to it and it is moisturizing.  Its the best sunscreen hands down.  Ive tried vanicream that is not the sport but it felt shiny and greasy,  in my opinion the sport 35 absorbs well in the skin</li>
            <li> I swear by Vanicream and have been using it on my face for years. It was difficult to find an effective sunscreen that did not make me breakout. I like Vanicream because it does not have lanolins, PABA, dyes that could irritate me. This leaves a slightly whitish color but that&#x27;s typical for my skin... it evens out later on. I can use makeup over it with no problem worrying about clogged complexion.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was well-rated on the Skindeep database ([...]), and this will become my go-to sunscreen. It absorbs well into my skin, leaving little visible whiteness. It doesn&#x27;t have the greasy feeling or unpleasant scent that I had come to associate with sunscreens, too, so I don&#x27;t mind wearing it. Crucially, it doesn&#x27;t trap the heat like some sunscreens, meaning I don&#x27;t risk heat stroke by trying to protect myself from the sun. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my highly irritable skin. In short, I love this and I look forward to my next chance to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and it also prevents sunburn.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen but doesn&#x27;t disappear quite as fast as i would like.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of this sun screen.  I have allergies and this is the only one I have found that is truly non-allergenic.  Product is very good and the source and shipping were prompt and reasonable.  I am pleased with this transaction.</li>
            <li> We adopted a little boy from China, whom we found out on the first day of swimming, is highly allergic to sunscreens of any kind. The allergist recommended this and gave us samples as well. While it is a little thicker than norm, the Vanicream Sport 35 worked well, whether on a FL vacation or for daily pool use. Our other son, who usually gets rashes after a few days of sun and sunscreen on the beach, used it as well. No more rashes!</li>
            <li> It seems all products that block out the sun go on very heavy but at least I have not broken out from this one. I will be testing this cream when I go to Aruba to see if actually does block the sun. So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on vacation in Hawaii right now and I used this product for the past week.  It&#x27;s almost as if I didn&#x27;t go out in any sun.  I would only put it on once and even with swimming for hours, I was still protected.  Love the fact that it has no smell and is not very greasy as I hate putting any lotions or creams on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My vacation is almost over and I wanted to have at least have somewhat of a tan.  I did not put any sunscreen on today, was only out in the sun for less than two hours and now I&#x27;m burnt!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it makes.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and is allergic to all chemical sunscreens that we have found. Unfortunately, she has also had problems with the blocking sunscreens. Her dermatologist recommended Vanicream and after looking at all the reviews, I thought this may be our answer. I bought the Vanicream Sport SPF 30 sensitive skin and the Vanicream Sensitive Skin spf 60. She tried the Vanicream Sport for a while and it seemed to work during the day, but after she came home from soccer practice, she had broken out in a rash. Strike one. She then tried the Vanicream Sensitive Skin SPF 60 a few days later and broke out immediately. So, still looking for something that she&#x27;s not allergic to.......</li>
            <li> This sunscreen holds up incredibly well while perspiring heavily or when swimming.  It does not seep into your eyes at all when sweating.  It takes a bit of rubbing to get it in.  If you put too much on you will not be able to rub it all in and you will end up looking like a clown.  However even if you do put too much on it does eventually fade in on its own.  There is no greasy residue with this lotion, which I really like.  I had been using a good lotion for a number of years, and then they changed something in the formulation and now I feel like a greased pig when I use it.  This sunscreen can be tough to wash off-but that really is a plus.  If it comes off easily, then you&#x27;re not getting adequate protection.  I work as a lifeguard on the beach so there really is no better litmus test than what I go through in a normal work day.  This sunscreen does the job.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen over a whole lot of other sunscreens.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so thick feeling.  I guess I got used to the fact that I just have to use it sparingly.  If this were smoother applying sunblock, it would get 5 stars.  It still is good and will last a long time, so it is still a good buy.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on clean and blends in easily and is not greasy. It doesn&#x27;t feel like the typical sun screen. This sun screen does not contain carcinogenic ingredients and gives great protection from the sun. Does not cause break-outs for my very sensitive, oily skin. I am able to use makeup over it. When properly applied, it will not give you the \\&quot;white face\\&quot; look.   I plan to order more to give to my family.  I would hate to run out of this great item.</li>
            <li> We bought this after growing concern over the ill effects of chemical sunscreens.  While this is a zinc oxide sunscreen, is effective at preventing sun exposure, and doesn&#x27;t leave skin white, it still contains octinoxate, which is a hormone disruptor.  We are moving on to find a purely physical sun block.</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell and taste (yes, I know it is supposed to be unscented, but to me it smells and tastes--breathing the fumes in--like sunscreen).  The product absorbs faster than other products I&#x27;ve tried from Vanicream.  and it does not run into my eyes as the day progresses.</li>
            <li> I never leave the house without it.  Absorbs into my skin in seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin white and pasty!.  I wear this all over and never breaks out my face.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy without that thick white goo on your skin.  Doesn&#x27;t have any terrible smell. My kids don&#x27;t complain about putting on an ounce of this suncream like they do the other brands. Very low toxicity levels. Only wish it came in a larger size tube. I recommend to check out this website about this product and other sunscreens as well to compare. [...]</li>
            <li> I bought this along with a couple of other options, for my vacation to Bimini, Bahamas. It is reviewed by Environmental Working Group Sunscreen selector App as a sunscreen that is low toxin/high protection. That is how I chose it to try, along with the fact that it&#x27;s a Sport sunscreen, which I needed since I would be snorkeling, and out on a boat for 6 or so hours a day. It worked perfectly! I usually burn very easily, but this screen was perfect...I applied once before going out for the day, then one or two more applications during the day. This will be \\&quot;my\\&quot; sunscreen of choice from now on. It is a zinc-oxide screen, but as the name suggests, it blends in and vanishes easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE: To answer the question of what other sunscreens I tried along with this one, I used Active Sunscreen SPF 40 3oz by True Natural Cosmetics, [[ASIN:B0051PLB7U Active Sunscreen SPF 40 1oz by True Natural Cosmetics]] which was pretty good also, and also rated well on the EWG Sunscreen App. It was a little \\&quot;lumpy\\&quot; in texture, if that makes sense, and I don&#x27;t feel it stayed on as well as the Vanicream. I also took with me my old standby, Coppertone Waterbabies, SPF50, [[ASIN:B001QXDZKM Coppertone Waterbabies Sunscreen Lotion Pure &amp; Simple, SPF 50, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] just in case. I knew it worked for me in the past, and I ended up sharing that a lot with my very fair skinned friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added challenge was to find sunscreen that was free of an ingredient called Avobenzene that would react with the high iron in the waters of Bimini, and turn the boat orange wherever it touched. This was a  request from the owners of Wildquest, who own the boat, and host the retreat we attended.  Coppertone Waterbabies, in a myriad of \\&quot;mainstream\\&quot; commercial screens, has a low toxicity/high effectiveness ratio, AND it&#x27;s Avobenzene free...difficult to find both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several bottles of this now and have found it&#x27;s one of the few sunscreens that continues to work while I sweat.  I&#x27;m outside for 12hrs at a time and sweat a ton.  I apply about 3 times during a 12hr day, and rarely get a burn.  My only complaint is that it goes on very thick and bottles get used up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Very thick consistency and leaves no white residue on skin once it&#x27;s absorbed.  The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t spread over damp skin so it&#x27;s difficult to re-apply every 2 hours while exercising for several hours.  But that&#x27;s minor due to the fact that it keeps those evil UVA and UVB rays from penetrating the skin.</li>
            <li> Vanicream Sport is the only sunscreen I have used now for about two years. It&#x27;s very low in toxins, it makes a great base before I put on my makeup, and it even helps to fill in my wrinkles!  Unlike other sunscreens, this stuff never makes me itchy.  Amazon&#x27;s price was the best price I could find on the internet on the day of my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am a tennis player and physical education teacher, therefore, I spend a great deal of time in the sun. I appreciate the heavy coverage and protection of this suncreen.</li>
            <li> I recently returned from a vacation where I was out in direct August sun in Istanbul, Jerusalem and Cairo. I have eczema and am very fair, yet I came back with no real evidence of a tan at all, and no skin irritation even around my eyes. One application was sufficient for the whole day, except in places like my brow where I was sweating and wiping the lotion away. The only downside of this product is it feels very greasy, though for my dry skin that wasn&#x27;t so bad. My daughter didn&#x27;t like its feel, however.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and sensitive skin - all other sunscreens have caused him to break out.  This sunscreen does not cause him to break out!  I use it for him (6yo), my daughter (2yo) and myself.  It works great with us getting in and out of the pool, we never get sunburned and we never break out!&lt;br /&gt;It is a little expensive, but for me, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I looked for Vanicream because my dermatologist recommended it.  I am a cyclist and am out in the sun.  I managed to get sunspots on the side of my face.  The derm also recommended Califormnia Baby.  Both sunscreens are good.  California Baby has a fragrance to it and is a bit more greasy.  It was also a bit harder to blend in.  Vanicream blended better and is fragrance free.  I use California Baby on the weekends while outside and the Vanicream during the work week with make up.  Take care of your skin.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a well-rated sunscreen for its effectiveness and non-toxicity by the Environmental Working Group.  Highly recommend using their sunscreen guide, because unfortunately most sunscreens are not nearly effective enough and also include risky ingredients for our bodies.    It has a different texture than the mainstream sunscreens I used to rely on.  It is thicker and harder to rub in, whereas the others are more liquidy.  It leaves a more ghostly look unless you really rub it in.  However, especially after trying another similar sunscreen that was like a glue stick (TruKid Facestick), this one is acceptable to me.  I will probably buy it again.  Health and effectiveness will trump cost and appearance for me.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m photo-sensitive to sunscreens, but despite the name of this product, it still uses only sunblocks (zinc, for instance) and none of the chemical compounds that I can&#x27;t tolerate. It seems a bit greasy at first, but absorbs in, and it kept this lily-white New Englander sunburn free in the Florida sun, so I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li> works well but is thicker than drug store brands</li>
            <li> This Worked well for me. It isn&#x27;t too greasy, so I can tolerate putting it on my face. My dermatologist, after gouging out a skin cancer, recommended it.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I can use on my face without breaking out.  It is non-greasy and dries in a few minutes.  I use it daily under my makeup.  Also,  I use this on my grandchildren&#x27;s faces.  Since it is waterproof, it does not run in their eyes.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is the best!  I use it on my child who has eczema and sensitive skin and she does not have any problems.  I also use it on all my childrens&#x27; faces and they do not complain that it ever gets in their eyes, plus my 3 and 5 year old apply it themselves to their face and have no problems. i purchase this product all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been allergic to most sunscreen since elementary school.  This is one of the few sunscreens that I can wear without getting an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin but also for use on your face - it doesn&#x27;t make you break out.  It&#x27;s light and rubs in well.  It also does a great job of protecting you from sunburn while still allowing you to get a little color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Amazoners suggested this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it all over the world and so far no bad sunburns. It works through my activity, sweating, and other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing is that it&#x27;s thick. Very thick. Otherwise all good.</li>
            <li> Having extremely sensitive skin (including eczema), it has been a challenge to find a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t cause an adverse reaction - especially on my face and neck.  After recent Mohs surgery for basal cell carcinoma on my nose, my dermatologist suggested Vanicream - the one product his most chemical sensitive patients could handle.  I was skeptical, but agreed to try it - as I now have to wear SPF 30 daily on my face.  I am so pleased!  For the first time - no reaction, no redness, no breakouts, no welts that last for days.  I would recommend this product to anyone - but especially to those who feel as I did that there wasn&#x27;t a sunscreen made for my sensitive skin.  Excellent results.</li>
            <li> I use several brands of sun blocker and look for new brands from time to time. I liked the description for this as I have very sensitive skin but I don&#x27;t like it very much. It&#x27;s sticky and very white and I can&#x27;t verify any water resistant factors. My go to sun block is Solbar which is for sensitive skin, waterproof, smooth and silky. I felt that Vanicream would work but I won&#x27;t buy it again. I will use it for my body though, great for kids too. It&#x27;s just thick and tacky, otherwise no harm.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  I use it daily on my neck and hands.  Feels like very high end lotion.  The consistency is great.</li>
            <li> Great protection for year-around use.  Thicker than many products, so that took time to learn how much to put on.  Has kept my grandchildren burn-free all summer.</li>
            <li> I also read about this sunscreen on EWG. My family all plays tennis and an effective sunscreen is a must. My twelve year old twins and my husband hate suncreens that feel greasy or have a heavy perfume. Vanicream has neither and they&#x27;ll put it on willingly which makes my life a lot easier.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and is highly sensitive to sunscreens. They usually sting and burn her skin, so my dermatologist recommended this for her (and me, as I had melanoma 3 years ago). While it takes slightly longer to rub in, she can wear it without any problems. I am grateful for this product.</li>
            <li> Been using this for the last four years and it works great. Use sparingly and you don&#x27;t look all pasty white. I feel good about using this every day and avoiding the chemicals that seep in from the normal brands.</li>
            <li> This new formula burns my eyes.  It sucks.  The old formula was quite ok for my eyes.  I have now started using Banana Boat Baby SPF 50, which does not burn my eyes, but it too is not waterproof to the extent of stopping sweat from running into my eyes.  I only use the Banana Boat on my face.  A very good website is ewg.org.  It gives info on sunscreens with health ratings.  Pass up the Vanicream.</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin! The two things I love about it best is 1) it doesn&#x27;t irritate my son&#x27;s skin and 2) it has no discernible scent. A little pricey but well worth it in my book!</li>
            <li> An effective sunscreen, especially for the active person who spends a lot of time in the sun.  Has some of the downsides as other suncreens--a bit greasy and can stain black clothing--but I find this product works best for sun protection.</li>
            <li> This is my daily sunscreen.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out or give me hives (I&#x27;m sensitive to most sunscreens) but it does dry my skin out.  I use this after putting on the Vanicream moisturizer, and that seems to work.</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by a friend&#x27;s dermatologist. The sunscreen is thick due to the zinc (making it hard to spread and leaving a bit of a white cast), but this is what prevents skin cancer, so I cannot complain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for years.  It blends well and safe for skin.  It doesn&#x27;t leave visible white residue.</li>
            <li> Decent product overall. I&#x27;m a dark skinned African-American female and I didn&#x27;t find the product whitening/ it didn&#x27;t leave a white cast like most physical sunscreen . It is greasy! No problem with order.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years!!  It doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, is the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make my face feel like it&#x27;s on fire when I put it on, and it stays on through a marathon!  It does cast a white shadow where you put it, and is a little greasy, but it actually works!</li>
            <li> Good product.  I do not mind the chalky sunscreens. Better that then a bunch of unpronounceable chemicals. Great supplier.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested it and its great!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was ok.  It goes on smoother than blue lizard sensitive but I feel it doesn&#x27;t provide as much protection as the blue lizard.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again not because it so bad, but because I found others I like better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen.  I use it everyday.  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  Perfect for my sensitive skin.  Great for acne prone people like me.</li>
            <li> I found this sunscreen two summers ago, for my daughter who has severe eczema and asthma.  This is a miracle sunscreen, 1) it does not irritate the eczema, 2) protects her skin from the sun 3) and allows the eczema to heal from the suns natural elements.&lt;br /&gt;You only need to apply once, it does not come off in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little expensive, but after the amount of money you spend on finding the right product you will not have to search any longer. If you buy this product earlier enough in season, it wont be that pricey. Hope this helps other parents and kids with eczema or skin allergies.  enjoy your summer.</li>
            <li> Works great, keep on the boat in summer just in case we forget to sunscreen. Got hives from the cheep brands but with Vanicream I can stay in the sun all day. no worries!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen leaves a bit of a residue as compared with the non-Sport version. Otherwise, it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin like a lot of other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen without allergic reaction or breakouts. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to the chemicals in sunscreen. My dermatologist recommended I try Vanicream Sport Sunscreen. I have been using it for several years now &amp; not once had an allergic reaction or been sunburned.  I have converted everyone in the home to using this - even the dog.  I love, love, love this sunscreen. There isn&#x27;t that gross greasy feeling - it feels like lotion.  It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> my daughter has ezcema and this is the sunscreen the dermatologist recommended.  It is works great but a bit thick to put on.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen for a beach vacation based on the positive reviews. I was looking for a sunscreen that had safe ingredients, good SPF, and would be effective when swimming. The sunscreen is good, but not a holy grail and here&#x27;s why:  PROS: Rated highly by the EWG for non-toxicity. Great percentage of zinc (mine had 11%). UVA and UVB protection. I have dark olive skin and as long as you rubbed the sunscreen in really well, this did not leave as much of a white cast as I would expect given the zinc levels (it still shows more than some other sunscreens though). The sunscreen was really hard to wash off hands after application even with a lot of scrubbing, which is not a pro in itself, but did make me feel like there was really good water resistance so ideal for the beach. Also, this had a nice dry-touch feel to it on the skin which I love because I hate the greasy feel of most sunscreens. It still went on greasy on my face though, but everyone&#x27;s face is different so your experience there might vary.  CONS: This is SO hard to apply. The sunscreen is really thick and hard to spread and rub in. I burn very easily so it&#x27;s important to me to get full body coverage, especially at the beach, and honestly I feel like it took at least 30 mins for me to apply this all over. I&#x27;m really not exaggerating, I was honestly annoyed at how much beach time I was wasting trying to lotion up. And don&#x27;t forget you&#x27;re meant to reapply sunscreen every few hours, especially after swimming, so there was just a lot of time wasted putting on sunscreen. My husband and I both got so frustrated that 20 minutes into application we&#x27;d kind of give up and hope we&#x27;d got enough coverage. Inevitably though, we would have missed spots and ended up getting burnt there (the skin that was sunscreened was fine). Even when we thought we were being thorough, we&#x27;d miss spots on our body because of the difficulty in application.  So long story short, I really wanted to love this sunscreen, and it has a lotof positives. But ultimately, I need something that is quick and simple to apply so that I will be encouraged to wear it everyday and reapply as necessary. I also need to know that I&#x27;ve gotten good coverage since I burn so easily, and I just can&#x27;t be confident of that with this sunscreen. If you are very patient and diligent in application, this may work for you, but I will keep hunting for a better product.</li>
            <li> it  was recommended by our dermatologist as it has zinc in it and it is not greasy and is not perfumy</li>
            <li> Dermatitis (sensibility to off shelf products with additives) has not reacted - thought used only a handful times before seeing real results</li>
            <li> Purchased this product on an allergist recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;Works great.  No irritation.  Good protections.&lt;br /&gt;Would give it a five, but it is kinda pricey.</li>
            <li> I am an avid runner and cyclist with sensitive skin. Vanicream has worked very well for me and has kept my Rosacea in control</li>
            <li> Not only does it protect my skin, it seems to make it healthier--less redness, less dryness. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> After several hours in the beach sun, no sunburn with Vanicream. My only complaint is that the slight scent affected my sinuses.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and until I found this product, I was not able to use sunscreen because it made my skin burn and itch.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen on the market that does not trigger any of my allergies, plus I like it!</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen on the market</li>
            <li> I have eczema and have struggled with beauty products my entire life.  Most recently, I have started experiencing severe reactions to sunscreen, but only on my face.  My allergist recommended that I purchase Vanicream sunscreen, so off to the pharmacy I went.  It was hard to find, and it was over $20 a bottle.  On Amazon, however, it was nearly half that price, and with my Prime membership, shipped free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is incredible, but does have some drawbacks.  It is rather thick, and rubbing it into my skin takes a little time.  Once rubbed in, it does leave a little bit of a shine to my skin - it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, just shines. Although applying it can take some time and it does leave a little shine, it is worth it.  I have not had a reaction at all this summer!</li>
            <li> A little thick to put on, but effective.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that I had found my new sunscreen, but it wasn&#x27;t to be. I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve been looking for a sunscreen that won&#x27;t aggravate the rosacea that I&#x27;ve developed over the last year. I thought this went on smooth enough, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to provide me with much protection, and I broke out with it on my face. As all products seem to work on different people, I&#x27;m not trying to discourage someone else from trying it. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, primarily,  on my face.  It works really well to prevent burning and is almost invisible, unlike other zinc sunscreen products.  My family has used it under the Southern California and Hawaiian sun and have never burned once.  It is on the greasy side and more appropriate for use when you are involved in an outdoor sport vs wearing it under makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to sunscreen &amp; other random face products. I wear Vanicream sunscreen every day. I&#x27;ve spent 12 hours in the sun without reapplying &amp; still didn&#x27;t get burned. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!  It&#x27;s one of the only sunscreens that protect my 4 year old red heads delicate skin! I only use it on her face because all other sunscreens blister her face!! It is a thick cream but I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage and durability under extreme sport conditions.  Exceptional UV protection from harsh subtropical sun.  A repeat  loyal customer. First introduced to product by dermatologist and his recommendation was spot on.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item as a \\&quot;safe\\&quot; sunscreen for me and my family. It goes on white - but not greasy - and stays on even in water. My 18-month-old with VERY fair skin has not burned even after spending two hours at a pool with this sunscreen on. I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> My daughter is very sensitive to sunscreens.  This is literally the only sunscreen that does not burn her skin.  Since using this product she has never once burned and that is saying a lot since we live in Florida and we are also big boating people.  I would recommend if you have a sensitivity to sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Just what we expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was fine, but it&#x27;s quite thick &amp; hard to rub in.  My new favorite is Solbar zinc.  I have even found that brand at my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t found it to be better than others but dermatologist favors this product. A bit pricey</li>
            <li> The one-star is erroneous, but I had to mark something in order to write a review. I used the product once a day for 4 days straight, on my face, neck and forearms. I was outdoors, but under a huge tent, out in the sun for only brief moments. At noon on the fourth day, I felt woozy and uncomfortable. An hour later, I was covered in a heavy rash ONLY on the portions of my body where I had applied Vanicream. The redness lasted 3 days, followed by brown scarring that took 2 weeks to fade. I was so disappointed, because, on the plus side, Vanicream is the first SPF product that has not left a metallic taste in my mouth. I purchased it on the recommendation of m y dermatologist/oncologist.</li>
            <li> I was having some skin issues years ago and my dermatologist suggested I switch to this for my sunscreen. It only takes a little to thoroughly cover your face, although it does take some doing to get it completely rubbed in. I use this both as my everyday lotion, under my make-up and as sunscreen for the beach, etc. Great product, always works, so long as it is reapplied as recommended (true of any sunscreen), and has never irritated my skin. I would definitely recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Pure sunscrreen no frangrance no bs:  All zinc based</li>
            <li> Too thick!  Hard to apply.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist suggested this years ago. It is the only lotion I can put on my face and not break out. Not to mention this is an excellent product for protecting your skin.  I live in Florida and for me this is the greatest sun block I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this before going on vacation to Mexico and liked the product.  I just wish it lasted longer.  It is only good for 80 minutes and found it hard to keep having to reapply every hour or so.  I did love the fact that is non-greasy and feels wonderful on your skin.</li>
            <li> Use all Vanicream products as recommended by my dermatologist.  No more skin problems.  No more redness or  dry skin.</li>
            <li> We have been buying Vanicream Sunscreen Sport for many years.  It is at a reasonable price and it works for our fair skin.  No sunburn while lying on the beach in Florida or a day of golfing.  Quick shipping and quality product.</li>
            <li> Good for all skin types and all ages.  Easy to apply and transport.  Does not make a mess.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> love this product!  goes on smooth with no irritation to sensitive skin.  Love all their products!</li>
            <li> this is a great product, works well</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen and abosrbs well with no residue. Great for sensitive or acne prone skin. Highly recommend. I have several of the vanicream skin care line and I love all their products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter here so little chance of getting sun-burned, but we are at some elevation so I use sunscreen year round on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff was affordable and gets good reviews. The reason I am giving it three stars is because it is very thick - more of a paste than a lotion. I have to put different dabs of it on my face then rub each separately. I would prefer something a bit looser so I could put it in my hands and then on my face like a lotion.</li>
            <li> This product it’s an excellent choice  for people who has a very delicate and sensitive skin.  I did not irritate my eyes.  People who has melasma should wear it every 2hrs only on the dark spots!</li>
            <li> Started using this product about 5 years ago on the suggestion of a dermatologist. Also like the fact it does not contain some of the unhealthy chemicals found in other brands. Very happy with the skin protection this product gives and it is scent free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this stuff for years.  It works, zinc oxide is highly recommended, and it&#x27;s inexpensive in comparison to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using vanicream sunscreen for a long time. Good shield of sunshine, no oily feeling, no unwanted chemicals. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> product arrived promptly. i use it when outdoors and my wife and kid like it as well. its exactly how it is described and its worth the price. will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick it doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as the Coppertone Sport I used to use, but it has none of the bad ingredients, so the extra effort is worth it. Once it&#x27;s on it is barely noticeable-no oilyness at all.&lt;br /&gt;It looks a little ghostly when first applied, but ends up being translucent.&lt;br /&gt;Since I use it mostly for golf, it does require an extra hand scrubbing with a brush to remove the residue, but again, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, suggested by my dermatologist.  It is about 50%less expensive ordering through Amazon than getting from the Dermatologist (at least from My Dermatologist)!  😊</li>
            <li> This sunblock was recommended by the dermatologist I saw for removing 2 places with skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first tube from the local dermatologists office, I really liked it so when I saw it on Amazon I went ahead and ordered it. I have extremely sensitive skin, this product does not cause any skin reactions and gives me total protection from the harsh sun at 8,000 feet here in the mountains.</li>
            <li> This item is very effective and easy on sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t leave the house without applying it to my face.  So easy on sensitive skin and eyes that I use it as an eye makeup remover.  I live in the high desert. I am 57.  I do reapply 2 to 4x a day.  It does take a little time to work in as it will look white at first.  Does not take that long to work in.  I do use it on the rest of my body as well.  I buy 2 tubes a year.</li>
            <li> Our preschooler is wildly allergic to regular sunscreens.  His doctor gave us a sample of this sunscreen, and now he wears it any time he&#x27;s out in the sun.  No more swollen, itchy red skin! So glad there&#x27;s something he can use!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty thick, but glides on smoother than others. it&#x27;s not oily, sometimes i&#x27;ve even used it on my face under makeup.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned, but live in Florida.  Over the years, I have gone through many different brands of sunscreen.  I found out about Vanicream after reading the EWG reviews, and after trying many different highly rated sunscreens on that list.  By far, I find this to be the best sunscreen I have ever used.  Some of the others smell bad or don&#x27;t last.  I put it on once in the morning and it lasts all day, even after swimming.  Because it is really thick, it is a hassle to put on, but it does last.  If I have been swimming a lot, or have been out all day, I usually will touch up later in the day with Kinesys spray sunsceen (in the white or orange bottles), which I also like.  As an aside, after using this for about a year, I went to my dermatologist, who just happened to be giving out samples of Vanicream as well.</li>
            <li> I really like the Vanicream sunscreen. The only complaint that I have is that it is too thick and difficult to spread around and work into the skin.</li>
            <li> An excellent product.  I apply this on my face and have avoided more sun damage.  Two years ago I had a terrible case of actinic keritosis, a precursor to squamous cell cancer. My dermatologist recommended this product and I have been very satisfied in using it.</li>
            <li> Goes on cleanly and easily. I wore it during my Ironman and after 7 1/2 hours, I didn&#x27;t get a speck of sunburn on my face! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen for children..... There is no burning sensation when put on the faces of children as there is with other sunscreens.  I highly recommend  it.</li>
            <li> This is very non-greasy and a great product. I have sensitivities to a lot of fragrances and this hasn&#x27;t given me any problems. My skin also burns easily and it protects my skin well.</li>
            <li> this is a good sunscreen for long hikes and hours on the beach. it does take some work to rub it all the way in, but i think it&#x27;s worth it for the protection you get. kids may not love it. my dermatologist friend has samples of these in her office, so i figure it&#x27;s a good bet. i first got it because i read about the 25 best sunscreens on some list and it was one of two available for prime shipping on amazon. since then i&#x27;ve bought a couple tubes for myself and my sister for her kids.  she really loves the sunscreen for the good protection.</li>
            <li> works well for my mother&#x27;s allergenic skin. She is allergic to most sunscreans, so this is a great help</li>
            <li> This product works well</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I use this sunscreen for daily use since I have sensitive skin and a few irritated spots appeared on my face, most likely due to sun damage. It is thicker to apply and takes a little time (you have to work on one section of your face at a time). I was often tempted to make application easier by pre-mixing with a little of the regular vanicream lotion, but I have a feeling this would diminish the SPF factor. I didn&#x27;t like this so much as a daily sunscreen to wear under make-up. It was too time consuming to apply and leaves my skin ever so slightly pale looking (I have light olive skin). I would typically apply bronzer to help counter act this effect, otherwise it looked kind of weird. Also the sunscreen leaves a slightly shiny film. I don&#x27;t mind any of the above if I&#x27;m just going for a run, or doing some other activity, it&#x27;s jut not that practical for me for daily wear. This did not irritate my skin or cause breakouts-- a huge success for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun; Badger All Nat. (made me pasty white, especially in water), BurnOut (washed off really easy), Beyond Coastal Natural (didn&#x27;t work, got burned), Climb On! (goes on nice, but washed off easily) and Livestrong ThinkSport/ThinkBaby (turned white sweat/water)... I live in FL, so having the right sunscreen really matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, Vanicream still rates highly (although not the highest) on EWG&#x27;s annual best sunscreens list, and while that&#x27;s a good start it still has to WORK! It does go on thick, so it requires a little extra rubbing/spreading, but it&#x27;s worth it to finally have a natural sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make you glow once you get in the water/start to sweat, and stays on well enough so that you don&#x27;t get burned going for a swim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this out on a week long vacation to Hawaii, where we were outside in the sun a lot... I didn&#x27;t get burned once the entire week, even during a whole day of beach/surfing! My old standby Coppertone Sport (chemical based) would have had a hard time matching that!</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that really protect my face. I do outdoor sports and this cream is te best!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, absorbs well, and is apparently less toxic then most.  Slightly more expensive but nothing outrageous.  I use it for running and it works well.</li>
            <li> My daughter is allergic to so many creams and soaps that it shouldn&#x27;t have surprised me that she also was allergic to sunblock. This brand was recommended by her dermatologist and it works great.</li>
            <li> Then I couldn&#x27;t find it.  This is the only sunscreen I can put on my face without having an allergic reaction.  Great makeup base as well.</li>
            <li> Waiting for the sun to test it out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easily</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anything that Vanicream makes!  It&#x27;s been a life saver for our son&#x27;s eczema and this is the only sunscreen we&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t further agitate his skin.  I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very gentle and good for my skin, but it is very cakey and not easy to smoothe in.</li>
            <li> Use this product every day!  My dermatologist recommended it and I love it!</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this product, and it works well.  Of course she probably has a business relationship with the manufacturer, but that&#x27;s okay......she is a good Doc and uses the best ointments/creams available.  Cetaphil is another product she likes.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with either.</li>
            <li> Due to an allergy to common ingredients in over the counter sunscreens, my dermatologist recommended Vanicream.  I have had no problem with rashes with the use of this product.  I recommend Vanicream for those with extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I teach swimming during the summer and before I found this product I always had a summer rash on my arms and face.  I knew it was the sunscreen but after trying 10 different ones I gave up and just suffered.  I have now been using this for 2 summers no rash, but most important never have a burn not even at the beginning of summer when I have no tan what so ever. Great product no rash.  I have told lots of people who have also tried it and love it.</li>
            <li> The best sun screen I&#x27;ve ever found that&#x27;s gluten free!!! It works great and there is no scent what so ever to react to if you have allergies.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  It provides lasting protection without any greasy residue to get on my clothing and other things.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t cause me to have a rash like others.  Also, I have had skin problems.  This sunscreen covers well and protects well.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t the best sunscreen i&#x27;ve ever used, but it did a good job.  i&#x27;ve used California Baby and liked it better.</li>
            <li> Using this on the recommendation of my doctor. It&#x27;s winter now, so curious as to how I will handle it in the summer. I can feel it on my skin. Currently, I apply moisturizer then the Vanicream immediately. I know that in the summer months, I will need to make sure it goes on more heavily, as I live in a very sunny place, garden, and drive a convertible. I chose this over the 50 Spf because of the reviews regarding the change in formula. It has gotten near my eyes and bothered them- the big reason I avoid sunblock. I do appreciate it&#x27;s non fragrance, as I have many allergies. It&#x27;s a good price and worth a try.</li>
            <li> have used this product for years since I developed an allergy to parabens.  I love it--it serves as my moisturizer and sun screen in the morning every day.  It protects and acts as a primer for makeup.  Looks a little white when you first put it on but white fades quickly.  Have tried many over the years but this is the best and super inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Works well, goes on thick.  It doesn&#x27;t run even with heavy face sweating!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. It is light and smooth and absorbs rights in. If your skin is a bit dry you may want to use moisturizer right before putting it on to aid in the application. I am allergic to almost all sunscreens except the ones denoted &amp;#34;pure and free&amp;#34; as well as only for use on a &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; (containing titanium dioxide as the active ingredient). Generally these work great but are sticky and leave a residue on the collar of my shirts. Vanicream does not do this. It is smooth and creamy and there is no residue to be seen. It also does not sweat off into your eyes like the others. My new every day go-to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin due to various chemical allergies. This is one of the few sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I&#x27;m so gad I found it!</li>
            <li> I love beach vacations but would always get rashes which we thought were related to sun exposure. It turns out that it was caused by the sunscreens I was using. I have environmental allergies, but never considered that it was a reaction to something in the sunscreens. I used this and did not get a rash or a sunburn. It is long lasting, even after snorkeling for two hours. It is really thick so it is easier to spread if it is slightly warm and spread quickly. I am stocking up for the summer!</li>
            <li> Many sunscreen products cause reactions for those with skin sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;This one does not.  Its price is within range of products available that&lt;br /&gt;do not have sensitivity as a goal.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> We have been using Vanicream Sport since our kids (now 8 and 6) were babies. My sister, whose child has severe eczema, recommended it after it was prescribed by her dermatologist.  It is difficult to find (only on-line and in pharmacies), but has excellent results.  We all use it.  No one in our family has ever burned, it soaks in easily, lasts for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film. It&#x27;s extremely &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; with no scent, limited ingredients, and highly rated by the EWG. I buy 8 tubes at the beginning of every summer to leave in each of our swim bags, at home, and in the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have purchased other Vanicream sunscreen products, and while they all work, the Sport stays on the longest in the pool and during sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have tried many other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; sunscreens and found them greasy, filmy, and/or ineffective.  We&#x27;ll stick with this one!</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice but so far so good.  I become allergic to all other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Vanicream does a great job at protecting our faces, I just wish it was a little easier to apply but then it probably wouldn&#x27;t protect as well. The two 4oz size packaging is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Got a sample from the dermatologist and is great stuff for your face.  No extra perfumes added.</li>
            <li> I always take this cream on vacation.  It is thick and rich!  I took it to Aruba and sat in the sun on the beach all day.  I did not burn!!  I did keep re-applying.  My skin was in great shape after using this product. I was very happy and will take this sunscreen on my next vacation.</li>
            <li> I know sunscreen...and this one is great!  I have used all kinds and will continue to use this one.  Is works great on my sensitive skin, even in 110+ heat.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s on the safe to use list as far as ingredients are concerned.  I still got a tan from Bali though because I was surfing.  I think the best policy is to cover up: wear long sleeves clothing to protect our skin from direct sun light.  I will continue to use it for the other parts of the body that&#x27;s exposed to the sun.</li>
            <li> My son has a sunscreen allergy, and Vanicream is the only product we&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause him to have an allergic reaction.  Thank goodness for Vanicream!  It works well, rubs in easily, and prevents sunburn effectively.  I just wish it were a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is not available in any store and not very many websites. I was happy to find it here on Amazon. The product works very well. I was on a 4 hour cycling ride and any where I applied the sunscreen was not burned. It even lasted through the sweat and I didn&#x27;t need to reapply it. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I like the texture of this sunscreen.  I used to have issues rubbing in the higher SPFs. This one works perfectly.</li>
            <li> My red headed boyfriend has extremely sensitive skin and the Vanicream protects his skin without giving him a chemical burn like so many other products. We have suggested this product to many friends and family members and everyone that has tried it has also had great results.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen because of its purity (no dyes/perfumes). I wear sunscreen everyday so it is important to me that I have something that is effective but also doesn&#x27;t irritate me. Other sunscreens sting my eyes due to my being allergic to some chemical in them. I don&#x27;t have that problem with Vanicream. It is gentle and goes on easily. It does make my face white but not as much as other zinc oxide sunscreens I have used.</li>
            <li> No scary ingredients, stays on and does its job great.  Every time I bring this to the beach or to the fields, people want to borrow it.  It goes on very thick, but that&#x27;s a very small price to pay when it comes to getting a great product that protects you from the sun and harmful ingredients.  Best stuff out there.</li>
            <li> My kids are super fair! The youngest is white as a ghost and she&#x27;s gotten burned while wearing sun block before. This stuff holds up well. They both also have super sensitive skin and this does not seem to irritate them. No strong odor either!</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen everyday on my face.  It is a little thick and difficult to blend in however it is gentle on the skin so that it doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
            <li> Great product, a little tough to get off your skin after application, but i rather scrub a bit extra in the shower than stay in the sun with no protection.</li>
            <li> I have tried many sunscreens but they all break me out in little bumps and rashes. My dermatologist told me about Vanicream Sunscreen and voila, no bumps or rashes and best of all, it does not smell like sunscreen. It has no smell at all. I use nothing else now when I go out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Vanicream Sports SPF 35 daily as a day facial moisturizer for over 7 years.  It is thick and so only a dab is needed for the face and does require a little more effort to apply.  It does not leave the face looking ghostly white if you have properly worked it into the skin.  I even started to use it daily on my little toddler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ordered some more, but did not realized that I ordered the non-sport version which is only SPF 30 instead of SPF 35.</li>
            <li> My son has bad excezma and we have been using the Vanicream sunscreen for years with great results!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years and happy to see it on Amazon.  I play golf in Florida so sun protection is a must.&lt;br /&gt;This keeps me from burning while out for the day in the Sun.</li>
