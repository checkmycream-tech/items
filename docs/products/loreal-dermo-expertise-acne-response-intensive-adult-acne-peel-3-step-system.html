    <ol>
            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great product!  </li>
            <li>and i am very happy to see the results that this product has giving.</li>
            <li>I got deceived reading the excellent reviews about this company but felt so cheated when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>YOU WILL BE CHEATER FOR SURE !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>but this was perfect.</li>
            <li>And i&#x27;ve been using the 20% Perfect Peel TCA diluted with bottled water on a 50% to 70% dilution (7 to 7 drops water/tca or 9 water/7 drops tca)</li>
            <li>This product provides the perfect balance and it does wonders.  </li>
            <li>Good call, folks!    </li>
            <li>I also switched to Burts Bees willow bark cleanser, added 3 drops of tea tree oil and 14 drops of salicylic and together, my face is beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how the product would work on its own, but it is AWESOME with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>and it got great reviews</li>
            <li>This product was great I have had acne problems since my teens I am 29 and</li>
            <li>While it was a great product, any product still out there is expired.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of the reviews and the reality is it works amazing!</li>
            <li>I loved this face wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly jaded beauty product consumer-- lots and lots of research before I pay any amount for a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it great product A</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>And I love that you don&#x27;t have to apply it too often!</li>
            <li>I look forward to continue using this product and seeing more results!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so amazing.  </li>
            <li>An AMAZING product.</li>
            <li>but after reading people&#x27;s reviews about this loreal product i decided to buy it...... thinking on how much i would have to spend with proactiv, loreal was the best option for me.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this</li>
            <li>but to be honest, I&#x27;m sacrificing that for clearer skin</li>
            <li>And its a super great price for a 6 month supply.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s my own fault for not doing thorough research, but I was so excited to find an at home peel kit that I snatched this up!  </li>
            <li>After I finished graduate school, I started having more acne than ever.  </li>
            <li>And items for your skin cannot be used after they&#x27;ve expired, so I&#x27;m sure just because they could not sell it to any store, they sold it to me through online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many acne products, and none of them worked for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using Proactive off and on depending on if I had a breakout, which didn&#x27;t work for me most of the time.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT...  </li>
            <li>I wish I was able to buy it in the stores...</li>
            <li>In any case, I&#x27;m sure any sacrylic acid and benzoyl mixture would work just as well.  </li>
            <li>This is safe for my African-American skin.</li>
            <li>If anything my skin may even be more irritated.  </li>
            <li>this product does what it says it will do, and more.  </li>
            <li>those creams and lotions are sure to break you out again...</li>
            <li>thats why most people get break outs after doing sulphur masks or chemical peels.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t always had acne, but I suffered a lot more severely from it when I moved to NYC.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>and this is too be used at most three times a week.</li>
            <li>which just using that for a couple days has cleared most of my acne away.</li>
            <li>Proactiv was pretty good</li>
            <li>but I have noticed my skin clearing up significantly!</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Less wrinkles, smoother skin, reduced acne.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m ordering more as my 24 year old daughter is also experiencing great results.</li>
            <li>Works better and more consistently than proactive!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely make sure you use a good moisturizer with sunscreen while using this product as it will make your skin particularly sensitive to the sun.  </li>
            <li>when i first got this it was AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I also didnt see much improvement with this--until i bought Perfect Peels 20% Salicylic Acid and added about 7 drops (initially) to a full bottle, then added 4 more drops for a total of 11 drops.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for shrinking pores.</li>
            <li>The price for this product it cheap, so you get what you are pay for.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re ethnic or have darker skin, do test patches where you can conceal if things get too light with the tca peel.</li>
            <li>I developed some adult acne and this product works the best of any I have tried!</li>
            <li>I started Dan&#x27;s \\&quot;The Regimen\\&quot; with pretty darn good results (gentle cleanser, 2.5% benzoyl peroxide morning and night, then lots of moisturizer).  </li>
            <li>I made sure to follow the directions exactly as on the label but to no effect.      </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this out to help get rid of my acne scars on my cheeks</li>
            <li>Brings a nice glow to my skin and makes my skin very clear.</li>
            <li>This seemed to work really good and was able to use it every other day.</li>
            <li>I really love this product as i saw the result straight after i used the product</li>
            <li>I really kinda looked like a zombie for 4 days, and i did not pick at all--and 3 times and my skin looks completely better.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this one a try because it had received so many positive reviews, and the price was right</li>
            <li>Luckily, I can still find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Results are quick.</li>
            <li>I use 1/2 sweet almond oil with 1/2 grapeseed oil right after the Loreal Peel</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much time or investment and it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lived with it for 20 years and finally found the magic combo that is making me as pretty as i used to be. :-)</li>
            <li>This little kit is really great and inexpensive for what it does.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a HUGE difference in the scars/pits</li>
            <li>Its important to really really moisturize with this.</li>
            <li>thats bright and pretty--better than all that money i spent at the drs and spas for medicine, treatments, antibiotics, and peels.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be worth a shot.      </li>
            <li>Lucky for me, this is the first thing I tried.  </li>
            <li>Work with the dilution of the s.a. using bottled water in a dropper to get the right combination for you.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use very much, so</li>
            <li>and it was the first time i use it.</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li>this is the first product that has helped.</li>
            <li>Use as directed and within a fortnight you will notice positive results.  </li>
            <li>most people dont know that dry skin can cause acne too.......</li>
            <li>&quot; even after leaving it on for 10 minutes (it says to leave it on for 5), I don&#x27;t think its a strong enough concentration to really \\&quot;peel\\&quot; but I&#x27;m still giving it a chance to help me out.</li>
            <li>My nose has been a problem area for blackheads since I was a teenager and after the first use I noticed a significant reduction the following morning.</li>
            <li>There are too much alcohol in it.</li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>Really, i am nt exaggerating it.</li>
            <li>nothing much to say about it</li>
            <li>Get as much of it as you can, as you cannot find it in stores anymore, it seems.  </li>
            <li>compare to 20% salicylic acid peels or some really intense chemical peel.</li>
            <li>This system really and truly works.</li>
            <li>This is the third different acne prevention system I&#x27;ve tried, the previous two being Klear Action Acne Treatment System and Proactiv, and after two weeks I am ready to say this one is the best and also the cheapest!    </li>
            <li>Didnt pick at the skin, used neosporin and walgreens Eucerin moisture cream in the tub,  and followed w/ 3 tblspoons white vinegar to 1/2 gal cool water soaks to soothe and help removed the flaking skin.</li>
            <li>I do worry about the high toxicity of the chemicals in this-</li>
            <li>Ditto Proactiv, which cost twice as much as the Klear Action.    </li>
            <li>it really did clear up my face</li>
            <li>My chin is another problem area and it took a few more uses to see results but there are almost none now.</li>
            <li>me first say that I have been incredibly lucky almost all of my life to have very clear skin with only the occasional zit or two.</li>
            <li>I use it every other night instead of benzyol peroxide and have literally been zit free since.  </li>
            <li>, now you can see my new face</li>
            <li>The step 2 can be a little stinging at first but the feeling goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I had been using Proactiv over the years (the past decade) and eventually (like most products) it stopped working for</li>
            <li>First of all, it came in yellow envelope, WITHOUT MANUFACTURED BOX!</li>
            <li>adult onset!)</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works well, not too harsh on the skin.  </li>
            <li>After many weeks of having no success, I tried applying Benzoyl-Peroxide after the 3rd step.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and does what it claims by sloughing off dead skin and revealing the fresh new layers without over doing it like some chemical peels.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this in hopes of clearing up the scarring, discoloration and slight pitting that I have from having acne for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>and it helps keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>and I consider my skin fairly sensitive.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until after my college years I discovered Klear Action and it did work in preventing the acne, however did nothing to repair the scarring.  </li>
            <li>I have used this since last month and it doesnt really help the breakout.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Dermo Expertise Acne Response Intensive Adult Acne Peel, 3-Step System.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had problems with my face for years and this is the only thing that I have found that really clears it up in a day...</li>
            <li>Dermo Expertise Acne Response Intensive Adult Acne Peel,</li>
            <li>and i had adult acne all my life even during my pregnancy, breast feeding</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, my adult acne is clearing up.</li>
            <li>But it made my face redness more serious than before.</li>
            <li>my face was full of very dark scars caused by acne.</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal system is an easy three-step process, just like the other aforementioned systems, but you only have to use it 2-3 times per week as opposed to every day with KA and Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>My skin is not completely cleared up but my breakouts are minimized and there isn&#x27;t as much redness.</li>
            <li>It really works and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 21 year old who has recently started having breakouts.</li>
            <li>I also have an odd skin type, where I don&#x27;t have really oily skin</li>
            <li>I have 3 large pimples around my neck and it dried up after i used it.     </li>

            <li> compare to 20% salicylic acid peels or some really intense chemical peel.</li>
            <li> This system really and truly works.</li>
            <li> This is the third different acne prevention system I&#x27;ve tried, the previous two being Klear Action Acne Treatment System and Proactiv, and after two weeks I am ready to say this one is the best and also the cheapest!    </li>
            <li> Didnt pick at the skin, used neosporin and walgreens Eucerin moisture cream in the tub,  and followed w/ 3 tblspoons white vinegar to 1/2 gal cool water soaks to soothe and help removed the flaking skin.</li>
            <li> I do worry about the high toxicity of the chemicals in this-</li>
            <li> Ditto Proactiv, which cost twice as much as the Klear Action.    </li>
            <li> it really did clear up my face</li>
            <li> My chin is another problem area and it took a few more uses to see results but there are almost none now.</li>
            <li> me first say that I have been incredibly lucky almost all of my life to have very clear skin with only the occasional zit or two.</li>
            <li> I use it every other night instead of benzyol peroxide and have literally been zit free since.  </li>
            <li> , now you can see my new face</li>
            <li> The step 2 can be a little stinging at first but the feeling goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I had been using Proactiv over the years (the past decade) and eventually (like most products) it stopped working for</li>
            <li> First of all, it came in yellow envelope, WITHOUT MANUFACTURED BOX!</li>
            <li> adult onset!)</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works well, not too harsh on the skin.  </li>
            <li> After many weeks of having no success, I tried applying Benzoyl-Peroxide after the 3rd step.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and does what it claims by sloughing off dead skin and revealing the fresh new layers without over doing it like some chemical peels.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this in hopes of clearing up the scarring, discoloration and slight pitting that I have from having acne for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> and it helps keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> and I consider my skin fairly sensitive.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until after my college years I discovered Klear Action and it did work in preventing the acne, however did nothing to repair the scarring.  </li>
            <li> I have used this since last month and it doesnt really help the breakout.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Dermo Expertise Acne Response Intensive Adult Acne Peel, 3-Step System.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had problems with my face for years and this is the only thing that I have found that really clears it up in a day...</li>
            <li> Dermo Expertise Acne Response Intensive Adult Acne Peel,</li>
            <li> and i had adult acne all my life even during my pregnancy, breast feeding</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, my adult acne is clearing up.</li>
            <li> But it made my face redness more serious than before.</li>
            <li> my face was full of very dark scars caused by acne.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal system is an easy three-step process, just like the other aforementioned systems, but you only have to use it 2-3 times per week as opposed to every day with KA and Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not completely cleared up but my breakouts are minimized and there isn&#x27;t as much redness.</li>
            <li> It really works and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21 year old who has recently started having breakouts.</li>
            <li> I also have an odd skin type, where I don&#x27;t have really oily skin</li>
            <li> I have 3 large pimples around my neck and it dried up after i used it.     </li>
            <li> It did dry my skin a little at first.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, follow the directions carefully and really dedicate yourself to this.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old woman and I use this every other day.  </li>
            <li> This is well worth the very small amount it costs to buy and ship.</li>
            <li> The redness and zits are already going away, and so far no new acne has come to replace it!!!</li>
            <li> I now only use it as a spot treatment to dry out big pimples, which takes days of application now.</li>
            <li> my first box has lasted this long and it should last at least another month.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was opened before, but it absolutely could be.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and have sent me another with the excuse, telling me the same.</li>
            <li> applied with a toothpick (VERY SMALL AMOUNT Gently applied, neutralized with baking soda after frosting) in the acne scars to help them no look so deep, It&#x27;s been working, but when i initially did it, i did it on we</li>
            <li> I was scared that it would sting or make my acne worse, luckily it didn&#x27;t sting and works well.</li>
            <li> While it did leave my skin feeling soft after, I woke up with small white heads the next morning in places where I&#x27;ve never had pimples!</li>
            <li> forward to today: I&#x27;ve only completed two treatments (you are only supposed to do a treatment every other day, in the evening...)</li>
            <li> and I dont use the neutralizer--salicylic self neutalizes within 6-10 min regardless and leaving it on a little longer seems to help clear out the pores.</li>
            <li> I have really bad acne scars and after using this product for a week, I noticed amazing results.  </li>
            <li> I had tried all of my normal tricks that seemed to work for me in the past to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s suffered long term acne/problem skin.  </li>
            <li> Within the past month, I started getting outburst on only one side of my face and strange little tiny bumps near my jawline.</li>
            <li> If I go out without any makeup on, it&#x27;s ok because there aren&#x27;t any glaringly ugly zits or red spots.  </li>
            <li> i never feel dry.  </li>
            <li> it will leave your skin dry though..</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have dry skin either.  </li>
            <li> I devoted myself to my daily skincare regimen with no success.</li>
            <li> The box was half open/used and because he sent through local mail, the box was pressed when I opened the pack.</li>
            <li> less wrinkles, fewer scars, smaller pores, clearer skin</li>
            <li> I feel bad to smell the lotion, and my skin dosen&#x27;t feel better after I use it.</li>
            <li> now all the scars are fading, they are pink color and the pimples are gone.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks I see absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> It dried out my skin and turned me blotchy red.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I would also be careful using any other kinds of products that contain AHAs or things of that nature as it could be overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want to warn other customers that please DONT EVER BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers are correct...</li>
            <li> You use it every other day and you see the results almost as soon as you start.  </li>
            <li> After days fo research I settled on this product, but was hesitant due to the lower price</li>
            <li> Very minimal peeling afterwards</li>
            <li> Maybe it just not suitable for Asian girl&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I had not experienced anything like that since I was 13 years old!</li>
            <li> The products were half opened/used and were leaking which also spoilt my carpet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with dr. Woods black soap.</li>
            <li> the seal was linty and dark because it had already been opened !</li>
            <li> With oily/acne prone skin you can do little to prevent wrinkles or to help sun damage...</li>
            <li> Too many of the salicylic acid stuff is just too weak for really bad acne</li>
            <li> Maybe these work for some, but they certainly didn&#x27;t for me which is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Then i put on the oil (sounds crazy, but its noncomedgenic and really moisturizes and soothes).</li>
            <li> I was getting breakouts around my hairline, chin, and even a few on my cheeks and nose.  </li>
            <li> i could probably use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I would have saved thousands of pounds which I&#x27;ve wasted on  creams,lotions and treatments which offered disapointing results.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not widely available.</li>
            <li> , probably used it 5 or 6 times now (every few days).</li>
            <li> and I can already notice the scarring starting to fade a bit, which is something the other two products failed to do.  </li>
            <li> At the least, it will not be effective, and at the worst, can be harmful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I want to expose my skin to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is suppose to smell like rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> They said that there is no box because it could damage in transit (a lot of products can, but sellers usually send it in a box anyway).</li>
            <li> When I use products for oily skin it dries my skin out horribly and when I use products for dry skin it makes my skin really oily.  </li>
            <li> When I received the product, the box was open, smashed and dirty.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with the hormonal acne I have gotten lately.</li>
            <li> so a hydrating mask or thick moisturizer after should help a lot.</li>
            <li> It has reduced/softened the severity of my scarring from a late bought with chicken pox (19-yikes!), and it helps me keep my adult acne</li>
            <li> The products have an odd odor, and none of them \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; as explained in the instructions and unfortunately did not help my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> The only bad part is that I had no luck finding it anywhere in stores..</li>
            <li> I had a lot of bad acne in college along the sides of my face, which also left scarring.  </li>
            <li> I was starting to get extremely frustrated.  </li>
            <li> , i started a peeling treatment at my esthetic center after 2 months, did&#x27;t work for me, and it was VERY expensive</li>
            <li> -I&#x27;ve had worse from a case of wind burn from walking on the Oregon coast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced redness afterward</li>
            <li> Nearing 30, I was getting a little sick of a couple of zits a week, so I looked for something else.  </li>
            <li> It really was devastating and depressing.</li>
            <li> It had a weird smell to it</li>
            <li> I was sad when Loreal discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me.</li>

            <li> I was shocked to see that the item expiry was 2006.</li>

            <li> i deleted my firts review about this item because i was so disappointed because i had no change on my skin, but month after month everything change, i&#x27;m 28</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After I finished graduate school, I started having more acne than ever.  I started Dan&#x27;s \\&quot;The Regimen\\&quot; with pretty darn good results (gentle cleanser, 2.5% benzoyl peroxide morning and night, then lots of moisturizer).  I&#x27;ve done it for five years with only a couple zits a week making an appearance.  It was cheaper than visiting a dermatologist all the time.  Nearing 30, I was getting a little sick of a couple of zits a week, so I looked for something else.  Lucky for me, this is the first thing I tried.  I use it every other night instead of benzyol peroxide and have literally been zit free since.  That was over 2 months ago.  I don&#x27;t use very much, so my first box has lasted this long and it should last at least another month.  I could not be happier.  If I go out without any makeup on, it&#x27;s ok because there aren&#x27;t any glaringly ugly zits or red spots.  I have no idea how the product would work on its own, but it is AWESOME with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> great product! Easy to use, works well, not too harsh on the skin.  Since entering my mid/late 30&#x27;s I developed some adult acne and this product works the best of any I have tried!</li>
            <li> There are too much alcohol in it. I feel bad to smell the lotion, and my skin dosen&#x27;t feel better after I use it. Maybe it just not suitable for Asian girl&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have been experiencing a resurgence of acne in my life at age 37..lucky me!  I had tried all of my normal tricks that seemed to work for me in the past to no avail.  I was starting to get extremely frustrated.  I was getting breakouts around my hairline, chin, and even a few on my cheeks and nose.  I had not experienced anything like that since I was 13 years old! I had been using Proactiv over the years (the past decade) and eventually (like most products) it stopped working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product while doing some searching on Amazon and it got great reviews and I felt I had nothing to lose.  I have used it about 4 times now and can definitely tell a difference in the clarity of my skin.  The breakouts seem to have subsided.  It doesn&#x27;t take much time or investment and it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely make sure you use a good moisturizer with sunscreen while using this product as it will make your skin particularly sensitive to the sun.  I would also be careful using any other kinds of products that contain AHAs or things of that nature as it could be overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product!  The only bad part is that I had no luck finding it anywhere in stores..so who knows if it&#x27;s on the way out or not.</li>
            <li> It works very well and does what it claims by sloughing off dead skin and revealing the fresh new layers without over doing it like some chemical peels. Very minimal peeling afterwards-I&#x27;ve had worse from a case of wind burn from walking on the Oregon coast. I&#x27;ve never experienced redness afterward and I consider my skin fairly sensitive. It has reduced/softened the severity of my scarring from a late bought with chicken pox (19-yikes!), and it helps me keep my adult acne (I&#x27;m 45 ) around my nose/chin and hairline in check-especially in the summer time. This little kit is really great and inexpensive for what it does. I use it about twice a month and I&#x27;ve been using this product in total for about 8 years now.</li>
            <li> This is the third different acne prevention system I&#x27;ve tried, the previous two being Klear Action Acne Treatment System and Proactiv, and after two weeks I am ready to say this one is the best and also the cheapest!    I had a lot of bad acne in college along the sides of my face, which also left scarring.  It wasn&#x27;t until after my college years I discovered Klear Action and it did work in preventing the acne, however did nothing to repair the scarring.  Ditto Proactiv, which cost twice as much as the Klear Action.    So I came across the L&#x27;Oreal system last month and after reading the reviews decided to give it a try.  Good call, folks!    The L&#x27;Oreal system is an easy three-step process, just like the other aforementioned systems, but you only have to use it 2-3 times per week as opposed to every day with KA and Proactiv.  The acne is going/staying away and I can already notice the scarring starting to fade a bit, which is something the other two products failed to do.  And for only $10 (KA is $20 and Proactiv is $40), it&#x27;s a steal!  I will definitely remain a user of the L&#x27;Oreal system.</li>
            <li> I had tried all kinds of product to treat my acne but nothing worked.  so i decided to buy proactiv, i thought that was the only product that could help me to treat my acne.  but after reading people&#x27;s reviews about this loreal product i decided to buy it...... thinking on how much i would have to spend with proactiv, loreal was the best option for me.  Now I&#x27;ve been using loreal for about a month and i am very happy to see the results that this product has giving. my face was full of very dark scars caused by acne. now all the scars are fading, they are pink color and the pimples are gone. it takes some weeks so start seeing the results but it really works.</li>
            <li> I really love this product as i saw the result straight after i used the product and it was the first time i use it. I have 3 large pimples around my neck and it dried up after i used it.     Really, i am nt exaggerating it.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old woman and I use this every other day.  I have pretty oily skin and it helps keep my skin clear.  i never feel dry.  i could probably use it everyday.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this since last month and it doesnt really help the breakout. But it made my face redness more serious than before. I personally don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This seller was terrible. The item was expired for almost 4 years and the packaging was horrible too. The box was half open/used and because he sent through local mail, the box was pressed when I opened the pack. I will never use Amazon products again coz of this bad experience. I wrote to the seller but he did not reply to my mail. \\&quot;    L&#x27;Oreal Dermo Expertise Acne Response Intensive Adult Acne Peel, 3-Step System. Dont buy from Bellagio Export company. I got deceived reading the excellent reviews about this company but felt so cheated when I opened the package. The products were half opened/used and were leaking which also spoilt my carpet. I had to instantly throw it away in the bin coz it was damaging my carpet and table. I was shocked to see that the item expiry was 2006. And items for your skin cannot be used after they&#x27;ve expired, so I&#x27;m sure just because they could not sell it to any store, they sold it to me through online. Just because we cannot see the product at the time of purchase. I want to warn other customers that please DONT EVER BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS SELLER. YOU WILL BE CHEATER FOR SURE !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It really works and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your face. The step 2 can be a little stinging at first but the feeling goes away quickly. And I love that you don&#x27;t have to apply it too often!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my hubby and i hope it works well.. he only used once so he needs to use it again tomorrow.. lets see how it works hehe</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and have sent me another with the excuse, telling me the same. So my question is to put this on sale, but they do.</li>
            <li> The product came already opened so I&#x27;m not sure if I want to expose my skin to this. Very disappointed in the delivery. The moisturizer looked as if was already used.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d discovered this product 30 years ago. I would have saved thousands of pounds which I&#x27;ve wasted on  creams,lotions and treatments which offered disapointing results.  Use as directed and within a fortnight you will notice positive results.  I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s suffered long term acne/problem skin.  Shame it&#x27;s not widely available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many acne products, and none of them worked for me. This one is no different.I got the same results as all the others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is suppose to smell like rubbing alcohol but it did and the seal was linty and dark because it had already been opened ! Very disappointed!!! Although I bought this product probably over a yr ago I never got a chance to write a review and I just found it in my room and threw it away yesterday :-(</li>
            <li> I loved this face wash. Works better and more consistently than proactive! I just wish it was still sold in stores but I do plan on buying it from here again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21 year old who has recently started having breakouts. I have been using Proactive off and on depending on if I had a breakout, which didn&#x27;t work for me most of the time. I ordered this product after reading the reviews. I&#x27;ve tried it once last night and by this morning I could already tell a difference. My skin is not completely cleared up but my breakouts are minimized and there isn&#x27;t as much redness. I look forward to continue using this product and seeing more results!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT...  I wish I was able to buy it in the stores... i&#x27;ve had problems with my face for years and this is the only thing that I have found that really clears it up in a day...</li>
            <li> This system did not do anything for me.  After many weeks of having no success, I tried applying Benzoyl-Peroxide after the 3rd step.  Aftwards, I noticed a big improvement in the effectiveness, but I don&#x27;t know if it was the combination of these two or just the benzoyl acting alone.  In any case, I&#x27;m sure any sacrylic acid and benzoyl mixture would work just as well.  I don&#x27;t like using benzoyl-peroxide, b/c it bleaches everything, but it looks like I may have to after using this product.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed. When I received the product, the box was open, smashed and dirty. It had a weird smell to it so I checked for an expiration date which it did not have. I used the batch code stamped on the products to cross reference a manufacture date and found out it was manufactured in 2005! 10 Years ago!! I definitely won&#x27;t be using the product.</li>
            <li> This is safe for my African-American skin. Brings a nice glow to my skin and makes my skin very clear. Fantastic for shrinking pores.</li>
            <li> nothing much to say about it</li>
            <li> I just received my package with \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Dermo Expertise Acne Response Intensive Adult Acne Peel, 3-Step System\\&quot; today and I am very disappointed with this product. First of all, it came in yellow envelope, WITHOUT MANUFACTURED BOX! I am not sure if it was opened before, but it absolutely could be. The second problem is that you can&#x27;t find the expiration date on any of those 3 product, which is why I assumed it came without a box. I send an e-mail to the seller with a questions about box and expiration date and they just respond me that I simply can return this item (which I will do). They said that there is no box because it could damage in transit (a lot of products can, but sellers usually send it in a box anyway). They said nothing about expiration date. I checked it in internet by the batch code and it showed that this products expired in October 2008. Anyway, I don&#x27;t want to take any chances. Beauty products, if expired, can cause lots of allergic reactions. The price for this product it cheap, so you get what you are pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now. It says to use it 2-3 times a week and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done, probably used it 5 or 6 times now (every few days). I originally bought this in hopes of clearing up the scarring, discoloration and slight pitting that I have from having acne for over 10 years. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a HUGE difference in the scars/pits but I have noticed my skin clearing up significantly! I haven&#x27;t actually ever \\&quot;peeled\\&quot; even after leaving it on for 10 minutes (it says to leave it on for 5), I don&#x27;t think its a strong enough concentration to really \\&quot;peel\\&quot; but I&#x27;m still giving it a chance to help me out.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s my own fault for not doing thorough research, but I was so excited to find an at home peel kit that I snatched this up!  The products have an odd odor, and none of them \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; as explained in the instructions and unfortunately did not help my skin at all.  Later, I discovered this product has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> The only acne product that has ever worked for me. I was sad when Loreal discontinued it. Luckily, I can still find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne for 4-5 years and have tried a handful of products.  I thought I would give this one a try because it had received so many positive reviews, and the price was right so I thought it would be worth a shot.      Nope!  After 3 weeks I see absolutely no difference.  If anything my skin may even be more irritated.  I made sure to follow the directions exactly as on the label but to no effect.      Maybe these work for some, but they certainly didn&#x27;t for me which is disappointing.  I tried it for both facial and back acne to no response.  Time to try something else.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers are correct...BELIEVE the hype...this product does what it says it will do, and more.  I too have oily skin, larger pores, cystic acne/adult acne issues too...but because I use *this product* you would never know it.  Proactiv was pretty good but this was perfect. Besides clearing up and preventing acne, it gets rid of the signs of aging too!  With oily/acne prone skin you can do little to prevent wrinkles or to help sun damage...those creams and lotions are sure to break you out again...but using this helps wrinkles and sun damage too! Get as much of it as you can, as you cannot find it in stores anymore, it seems.  This is well worth the very small amount it costs to buy and ship.</li>
            <li> I also didnt see much improvement with this--until i bought Perfect Peels 20% Salicylic Acid and added about 7 drops (initially) to a full bottle, then added 4 more drops for a total of 11 drops. This seemed to work really good and was able to use it every other day. I also switched to Burts Bees willow bark cleanser, added 3 drops of tea tree oil and 14 drops of salicylic and together, my face is beautiful. Its important to really really moisturize with this. I use 1/2 sweet almond oil with 1/2 grapeseed oil right after the Loreal Peel and I dont use the neutralizer--salicylic self neutalizes within 6-10 min regardless and leaving it on a little longer seems to help clear out the pores. Then i put on the oil (sounds crazy, but its noncomedgenic and really moisturizes and soothes). And i&#x27;ve been using the 20% Perfect Peel TCA diluted with bottled water on a 50% to 70% dilution (7 to 7 drops water/tca or 9 water/7 drops tca) applied with a toothpick (VERY SMALL AMOUNT Gently applied, neutralized with baking soda after frosting) in the acne scars to help them no look so deep, It&#x27;s been working, but when i initially did it, i did it on wed morning, went to work and took off thurs and friday. Didnt pick at the skin, used neosporin and walgreens Eucerin moisture cream in the tub,  and followed w/ 3 tblspoons white vinegar to 1/2 gal cool water soaks to soothe and help removed the flaking skin. I really kinda looked like a zombie for 4 days, and i did not pick at all--and 3 times and my skin looks completely better. less wrinkles, fewer scars, smaller pores, clearer skin thats bright and pretty--better than all that money i spent at the drs and spas for medicine, treatments, antibiotics, and peels. If you&#x27;re ethnic or have darker skin, do test patches where you can conceal if things get too light with the tca peel. Hope this information works. Too many of the salicylic acid stuff is just too weak for really bad acne (i had blackheads, whiteheads, cyctic, and all of it adult onset!). Work with the dilution of the s.a. using bottled water in a dropper to get the right combination for you. I&#x27;ve lived with it for 20 years and finally found the magic combo that is making me as pretty as i used to be. :-)</li>
            <li> i deleted my firts review about this item because i was so disappointed because i had no change on my skin, but month after month everything change, i&#x27;m 28 and i had adult acne all my life even during my pregnancy, breast feeding, i started a peeling treatment at my esthetic center after 2 months, did&#x27;t work for me, and it was VERY expensive, now you can see my new face i uploaded a pic of my before-after and is notorious!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and have been in awe of the results. My nose has been a problem area for blackheads since I was a teenager and after the first use I noticed a significant reduction the following morning. My chin is another problem area and it took a few more uses to see results but there are almost none now. My skin has not been getting as oily throughout the day either.</li>
            <li> there is no burning feeling when you use this product....compare to 20% salicylic acid peels or some really intense chemical peel. it will leave your skin dry though..hence &#x27;peel&#x27;......so a hydrating mask or thick moisturizer after should help a lot. most people dont know that dry skin can cause acne too.......thats why most people get break outs after doing sulphur masks or chemical peels. so just keep hydrating your skin by drinking lots of water and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> when i first got this it was AMAZING. it really did clear up my face well. after about 6 months of use, it has stopped working for me. I now only use it as a spot treatment to dry out big pimples, which takes days of application now.</li>
            <li> This 3 step program has worked worked well for me</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with the hormonal acne I have gotten lately. It seems to work well. I use it 3 times a week. I was scared that it would sting or make my acne worse, luckily it didn&#x27;t sting and works well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t always had acne, but I suffered a lot more severely from it when I moved to NYC.  I bought this product because of the reviews and the reality is it works amazing! I have really bad acne scars and after using this product for a week, I noticed amazing results.  You use it every other day and you see the results almost as soon as you start.  It&#x27;s so amazing.  I also have an odd skin type, where I don&#x27;t have really oily skin but I don&#x27;t have dry skin either.  When I use products for oily skin it dries my skin out horribly and when I use products for dry skin it makes my skin really oily.  This product provides the perfect balance and it does wonders.  I&#x27;m 19 and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else to anyone. And its a super great price for a 6 month supply.</li>
            <li> This product was great I have had acne problems since my teens I am 29 and this is the first product that has helped. I would recomind this to anyone who has acne problems.. It did dry my skin a little at first. But a minnor problem!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this out to help get rid of my acne scars on my cheeks I&#x27;ve had for years and treat existing acne. While it did leave my skin feeling soft after, I woke up with small white heads the next morning in places where I&#x27;ve never had pimples! I gave it another shot and it again did the same thing. This product caused me to break out which lead to a lot of freaking out! &gt;_&lt; I&#x27;m sticking with dr. Woods black soap.</li>
            <li> This item was discontinued by Loreal in 2005. While it was a great product, any product still out there is expired. Per Loreal, if unopened, the shelf life was 3 years, which means that any product still in distribution was expired in 2008. At the least, it will not be effective, and at the worst, can be harmful. Do not purchase this product from any vendor.</li>
            <li> I love it great product A + + + + +  + + + + + + + ++ +</li>
            <li> Yes, I absolutely love this product. It helps minimize my pimples on my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me. It dried out my skin and turned me blotchy red. I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really liked this but I was looking for a daily regimin and this is too be used at most three times a week. I ended up getting proactiv+ which just using that for a couple days has cleared most of my acne away. I plan to use this product soon in place of proactiv one night and see if there is a difference. If not there are people I can give it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly jaded beauty product consumer-- lots and lots of research before I pay any amount for a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me first say that I have been incredibly lucky almost all of my life to have very clear skin with only the occasional zit or two. Within the past month, I started getting outburst on only one side of my face and strange little tiny bumps near my jawline. It really was devastating and depressing. I devoted myself to my daily skincare regimen with no success. After days fo research I settled on this product, but was hesitant due to the lower price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to today: I&#x27;ve only completed two treatments (you are only supposed to do a treatment every other day, in the evening...) and I came close to tears this morning when I looked in the mirror. The redness and zits are already going away, and so far no new acne has come to replace it!!! I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next few weeks. As other reviewers have said, follow the directions carefully and really dedicate yourself to this. It will take some time, but the noticeable results after two treatments have me motivated to keep up with using this product. I do worry about the high toxicity of the chemicals in this- but to be honest, I&#x27;m sacrificing that for clearer skin, however ignorant that may be.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> An AMAZING product. This system really and truly works. Arriving to work last Monday and my co-worker said I looked ten years younger. Results are quick. Furthermore, my adult acne is clearing up. &amp;#34;Less wrinkles, smoother skin, reduced acne.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m ordering more as my 24 year old daughter is also experiencing great results.</li>
