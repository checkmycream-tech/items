            <li> I am still using it and don&#x27;t mind the color as long as the wood does not split.</li>

            <li> have very long curly hair and this product is just what I needed&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seems to work well on wet and dry hair.  </li>

            <li> Love this comb!!! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the finish seams like it will wear off over time. I use it when my hair is wet with conditioner. The comb makes light work of detangling my 4b hair and it minimizes breakage. I was skeptical about buying it because it was hard for me to believe that the seams on a comb cause that much damage to strands, but it&#x27;s true. Seamless is the way to go if you are trying to protect your hair.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> Love it doesn&#x27;t pull hair</li>
            <li> I never had a chance to use the comb.  A third of it broke off as I removed it from the package.  I thought about requesting another comb, but the edges of the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; that attached to the main body of the comb were very rough.  I was afraid it would tear my hair out it was so rough.  Amazon was great about the return.</li>
            <li> I bought this comb because I wanted one that would pull the natural oils from my roots through my hair. I have only had it about a week, but I like it and would highly recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This pic takes a little getting used to but I won&#x27;t be without it. Great for curly hair. Teeth are a little blunt but it&#x27;s a keeper. Feels good to the scalp!</li>
            <li> It is hard to mix wood and water together. But I have very thick hair that can only be conditioned and de-tangled in the shower. I noticed when it got wet it turned a different color than the nice brown you see here. It is a great comb sturdy , hold in my hand very easily and did the job of de-tangling my hair very well. I am still using it and don&#x27;t mind the color as long as the wood does not split.</li>
            <li> I got because of the reviews! Everyone said its was great for curly hair. So I got it. But nobody said anything about that smell! The smell of that pick is so Gross I thought I was going to loses it. I did not to use in my clean hair. I am going to try so soak in some unit blue like we did in beauty school if that does not work it will go in the trash. Will fill sorry for the trash.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;I have very long curly hair and this product is just what I needed&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see more</li>
            <li> This is a great comb for my thick, easily tangled wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;So much better than a plastic one.  A mild, pleasant scent and excellent finish and craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like Aphrodite!!!!</li>
            <li> Comb arrived with two cracks in the wood that ripped my hair right out. I purchased the comb as a way to avoid snagging while detangling, but this completely defeated the purpose. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> After use a few times a week for less than a month the finish wore off.</li>
            <li> Gave to my 12 year old cousin. I hope she uses it to prevent knots from occurring. Happy Happy Happy</li>
