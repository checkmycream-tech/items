            <li>The top section with the wording is not permanently attached which I love because I got this for my beauty room</li>
            <li>and it looks so much better without the wording.</li>
            <li>Iam sure it happen during the shipping process.</li>
            <li>so this hold a lot more than 96 bottles.</li>
            <li>It was good to put some nail polish in a useful way to see them.</li>
            <li>One that showcases the nail polish and is creative and efficient with space.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it, it fits every size bottle she has and it was easy to mount it on a wall with her collection of polish</li>
            <li>My husband screwed it into the wall and two of them (with a third on the way) proudly display my organized collection of polish.</li>
            <li>Mounts very nicely to the back of the bedroom door.</li>
            <li>the only good thing is they did refund me my shiping and purchase price..</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.just need more polish now</li>
            <li>Just what I expected... Very nice..</li>

            <li> This is the second one I have purchased.  I really like it. It did come in the pink Fuji box; well packaged and protected with Styrofoam. I personally like the &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34; sign and this did come with it. Definitely would recommend purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, it fits every size bottle she has and it was easy to mount it on a wall with her collection of polish</li>
            <li> Just what I expected... Very nice..</li>
            <li> my wife uses these in her salon. its pretty simple she has hers attached to the wall. its well made, no problems</li>
            <li> Loved... Better than I expected. Very much Satisfied... My nail polish are very well organized now .. Thank you :)</li>

            <li> The top section with the wording is not permanently attached which I love because I got this for my beauty room and it looks so much better without the wording. Love it! If my polish collection grows anymore I&#x27;m going to have to buy another one!! ;)</li>
            <li> When i recived the item it was broken also it was not in a pink box like they said to make sure that it is. And it does not look like the rack in the Picture, But the only good thing is they did refund me my shiping and purchase price..</li>
            <li> the rack looks great but mine came broken on the corner. Nothing that super glue couldn&#x27;t fix. Iam sure it happen during the shipping process. Otherwise The product itself it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this display. She has a ton of polish and most are different shapes and sizes so this hold a lot more than 96 bottles. She is a...becoming nail art professional.</li>
            <li> With 2 daughters that are addicted to nail color and art, this filled up very quickly and now we don&#x27;t have drawers and messy baggies filled with polish!

            <li> I first took the sign off and it doesn&#x27;t look like it is missing anything. It was good to put some nail polish in a useful way to see them. I might get another one, or design one myself out of this material. One that showcases the nail polish and is creative and efficient with space. Maybe a spiral spinning tower? One day.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my teenager!  I loved it!  Nice quality and I did not have to add the polish station sign unless we wanted to.  We did not, super cute!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.just need more polish now</li>
            <li> looks very cute on wall and space for polish is pretty good size</li>
