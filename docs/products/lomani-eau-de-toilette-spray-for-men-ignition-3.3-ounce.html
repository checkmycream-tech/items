            <li> Awesome, fast shipping... Definitely would recommend...</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;under $20\\&quot; price tag for a generous 3.4 oz. belies the extremely high quality of this fragrance, which is from a well-known Paris-based design house.  Folks, this stuff is pure class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is similar in many ways to PI by Givenchy.  This fragrance doesn&#x27;t have great sillage or projection after about an hour, kind of like Rochas Man, but with a 3.4 oz., you can afford to put a little more on ;)</li>
            <li> This was a great gift for my friend.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY HUSBANDS FAVORITE COLOGNE.  IT&#x27;S PRETTY HARD TO FIND SO WE WERE THRILLED TO FIND IT HERE FOR SUCH A GOOD PRICE.</li>
            <li> excellent as expected..</li>
            <li> This was the first time using this fragrance.  It has a light scent, but still smells like a men&#x27;s cologne.  The item received was just as described.  I will definitely order this cologne again.</li>
            <li> This is a really subtle scent but it hangs around all day. Sweet vanilla, I think a man or woman could wear this one.</li>
            <li> The right cologne, but seems watered down or something. The one I&#x27;ve bought before would stay on me all day. I feel no one can smell this after 45 min or so, but it was $15..get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> My grandson has bought this in the past from a vendor ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is very happy with the product we purchased from this company .. Same quality , and better price !</li>
            <li> I like this Eau De Toilette since it is different then most of the others out there.  One of the things I like about it is that it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;Floral\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> Love the scent  and price which made day .received many compliments from family and friends.i believe I found a new fragrance</li>
            <li> If you like or love  the smell of vanilla you will at the very least like this.. vanilla is it&#x27;s strongest note but not it&#x27;s only note .</li>
            <li> The only problem with this item is that always come with damaged top or broken bottle. In may 2014 I ordered three bottles and two of them were broken...I couldn´t return because the bottles were broken in three pieces, and amazon did charge me...lost my money!!!!!!!!!!! I loved the perfume....give two stars because of problems with broken bottles and waisting my money in two bottles.</li>
            <li> Item was open and cap was broke in half. Cologne had not leaked an sprayer was intack so we kept it</li>
            <li> Product as advertised. On time delivery</li>
            <li> Fast shipper. Great Price. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this cologne!!! Everytime I wear it, the ladies always ask what I have on because they love it. No complaints!</li>
            <li> i have purchased this fragrance before.  i really like the smell, but the only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t stay very long</li>
            <li> a good option they recommend and good delivery time&lt;br /&gt;but the article I came with some broken breakdowns and spilled into the factory packaging</li>
            <li> I like very well and good to have on hand .favorite spray for my needs. Thanks!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not better than the one I purchase at the mall. It doesn&#x27;t have the sweet smell like the one i purchase at the mall.</li>
