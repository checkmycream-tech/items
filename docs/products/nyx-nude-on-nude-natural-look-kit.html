            <li>I was also told I could return it if I wasnt happy.</li>
            <li>So the customer service was great regarding this company and what they sell through amazon.</li>
            <li>I loooove all NYX eye shadows, so its no surprise that these eye shadows are great and well pigmented.</li>
            <li>Oh and the lip glosses aren&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>My wife loves it and it looks great too.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy with that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li>Great selection.</li>
            <li>great pigmentation and lasts all day, even w/o a primer.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows had a great consistency and went on very nicely.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, compact eye shadow and gloss kit.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors, and good quality.</li>
            <li>I am not a youngster any more and the blues, greens and purples of my youth are no longer the best for me, although I still wear them at times.  </li>
            <li>I wish the shadows were a bit more pigmented, but all in all, this is a great product to pack for a day at the beach or on a weekend trip!</li>
            <li>the eyeshawdows are amazingly pigmented and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Colors are beautiful and blend out nicely.</li>
            <li>Win win :)</li>
            <li>The shadows are great, blend well, and i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be great for travel.</li>
            <li>The compact box can literally fit in the palm of my hand, so its perfect for on the go.</li>
            <li>Tad sticky but doesn&#x27;t bother me since some glosses are and it seemed to have good staying power.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li>Colors disappear on my medium skin tone, good for an almost nude look over eyelid primer.</li>
            <li>There is a good selection of colors in this palette.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good palette.</li>
            <li>No a fan of the lip products included in it, but the set is good for the price.</li>
            <li>Good assortment of neutrals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfect for travel or just keeping it compact!&lt;br /&gt;Colors are gorgeous and NYX is quality on a budget!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>but I find it good to cary in my purse.</li>
            <li>The colors are good if you want to wear makeup but without overdoing it.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and i love this brand.</li>
            <li>Otherwise great colors just wish the case was better made.</li>
            <li>Im very glad to buy it</li>
            <li>Cute, almost identical to the higher-priced equivalent, and it won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li>That being said, I love these colors!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>love this set and was very happy to see the photo was a true representation of the eye color palette.  </li>
            <li>The pigmentation was not as great, but like MAC - you could easily blend the colors.</li>
            <li>Purchases this on a whim, and was suprised on how awesome the colors are, how long the color lasts on my skin, but most of all the lip gloss is superb!  </li>
            <li>The colors are great for daytime wear and a nice compact size for easy travel.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;m thrilled with this.  </li>
            <li>The lip colors are nice too.</li>
            <li>But the color was nice.  </li>
            <li>the eye-shadows are placental with nice shimmer ..</li>
            <li>the shimmery colors are nice and goes on well.</li>
            <li>I like the colors and they were shipped nicely with nothing broke</li>
            <li>and the packaging is nice.</li>
            <li>I think for the money, this set is a bargain and also nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in my purse and there when I need it.</li>
            <li>She liked it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but wish the quality of the shadow was a bit richer</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>I am generally a popular drugstore brand user and never had to use primer with those.</li>
            <li>But I like it because it fits into any purse I own or can slip into a pocket with no problems.  </li>
            <li>I used this with a primer and had nice, 12 hour wear (even with my somewhat oily eyelids).</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t replace my MAC core colors, but when I want a nice, cheaper palette or some trendy colors</li>
            <li>Nice case.</li>
            <li>But this kit has shades of light to medium browns and some very nice taupe shades.</li>
            <li>Great product and not expensive!</li>
            <li>The color is natural and beautiful.i am very happy</li>
            <li>True - it&#x27;s not as good, but it&#x27;s a nice, cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li>Love love love this palette!</li>
            <li>Its the perfect size for a purse, and does come with really pretty earthy colors that do go on nice and stay if you prime your lids right.</li>
            <li>(and I have very light skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>FOR All WOMEN super good</li>
            <li>Love how it goes on, very smooth</li>
            <li>&quot; I am pleased with colors, although I don&#x27;t like copper</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>They are more transparent than opaque.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I use the bottom two rows most of the time plus the lightest color for highlighting.</li>
            <li>Love the color pallette.</li>
            <li>Their eyeshadow primer pot is better than UD&#x27;s Primer Potion imo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad  I bought it</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>nyx nude on look kit,i love it.</li>
            <li>I like the colors and wish the product was better.</li>
            <li>I Love all of the colors in this look kit</li>
            <li>I love this make up collection</li>
            <li>The shadows more than make up for the lip colors.</li>
            <li>I do love this palette.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>The prices here are better than anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>I recommend these as cute stocking stuffers for Christmas for your friends</li>
            <li>I love how the lip colors slide out underneath.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to be there when she received it</li>
            <li>I love NYX make up.</li>
            <li>Also the lip balms are my favorite ever.</li>
            <li>Will buy this forever until I run out of these favorite colors.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a bit buffer but offset than that I love this.the colours</li>
            <li>This tiny palette is perfect to carry around in your purse if you need a touch up on eye makeup and or lip gloss</li>
            <li>need anything else, just add mascara! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Was hoping for a more subdued pallet</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s what happens when one shops online :-)</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that someone could ramp up the drama with this, however, so</li>
            <li>The top three colors are matte; the remaining six are shimmery</li>
            <li>Love the colors and stays on without caking</li>
            <li>Grand daughters lived them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I do not like the lips stuff..but its ok i can ignore them.</li>
            <li>2nd purchase of this eyeshadow from Amazon, both times, arrived in perfect sealed condition.</li>
            <li>Then she found them &amp; was very excited.  </li>
            <li>It came in the mail quickly and I even got called and emailed from the Purfume Station to make sure my order was correct and that I liked it.</li>
            <li>The colors are wonderful for that natural look and the gloss is a nice touch (even though I don&#x27;t really use it).</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>BEAUTIFUL, NATURAL COLORS</li>
            <li>The colors are great for me, i always love doing a natural makeup look.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s always a good thing when the eyeshadows are not broken in the shipping process :)  </li>
            <li>The two in the top right corner are not that nice.</li>
            <li>All other colors are awesome too though! :)</li>
            <li>Oh well, maybe it&#x27;ll be the most fantastic eyeshadow there is.  </li>
            <li>My gf love it and enjoy it.</li>
            <li>A bit small but great product for a great price</li>
            <li>Not wanting to spend a great deal of money replacing items I don&#x27;t use frequently, I decided to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the colors are so great and natural looking</li>
            <li>NYX is really good, thanks.</li>
            <li>I was worried, but on the colors are also very nice and natural.  </li>
            <li>i love the way it came nothing broking came great and on time the only thing i did not  like was the lip gloss that it came with</li>
            <li>They come off too easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to store and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>- they blend easily and stay all day.  </li>
            <li>Really surprised it has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>To be honest, when I first saw this, I thought they were blush colors, not lip gloss.</li>
            <li>This is also a great way to try new colors but you will run out quickly</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, dark hair and eyebrows, and hazel eyes and was looking for a good palette to experiment with the \\&quot;smoky eye look.\\</li>
            <li>Loved the darker lip gloss because it is more of a natural dark strawberry lip color :) and the eye shadow is very lovely!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge MAC eyeshadow fan...</li>
            <li>i bought this because it was cheap and portable...</li>
            <li>it was cheap</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I gave one as a stocking stuffer for a friend at Christmas.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and the color is layerable.</li>
            <li>are wonderful and I use it about everyday</li>
            <li>Can barley fit a eye liner brush in it and as for the lip color part....</li>
            <li>dare I say a cheap filler.</li>
            <li>Great for basic daytime looks</li>
            <li>Altogether, I loved the product and I recommend this to anyone who is looking for nude natural colors to wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised because I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with NYX products.</li>
            <li>I bought this eyeshadow for my wedding, actually, and it was very nice.</li>
            <li>This is a great product very pigmented, great quality and such lovely neutral colours for such a affordable price.</li>
            <li>the lip colors are super light goes on smooth not sticky.</li>
            <li>Excellent everyday palette!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be perfect if it weren&#x27;t for the small size....</li>
            <li>I used the same palette on the mother of the bride, who is in her fifties, with successful results.</li>
            <li>I am asian 5\\&quot;4 (1.64m to be precise) and I have fair to tanned skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After purchasing this it is the only palate that I use out of the many that I own.</li>
            <li>Shadows very pigmented :)</li>
            <li>Nice colors with a natural look.  </li>
            <li>eye color have good opacity and last.</li>
            <li>and it is a good back up.</li>
            <li>They say it&#x27;s a good knock off for the naked pallette.</li>
            <li>I have tried most of the colors and they all are very flattering.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good set of neutrals, look no further.</li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>Colors are nice for lips, some eye colors are a bit too natural, need a lot to even show at all.  </li>
            <li>* Great little box of NYX eyeshadows for the price, they glide on easily and I like the pigmentation  </li>
            <li>Lovely colors and a very cheap alternative to the Naked Palettes.</li>
            <li>I am going to order the other color kits because I&#x27;m so happy with this.  </li>
            <li>but the shadows wear off quickly</li>
            <li>cute colors, the palette is tiny though so make sure you realize that when buying.</li>
            <li>QUEDO SUPER FASCINADA CON EL PRODUCTO,DE MUY BUENA</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>None the less, this is still a great quality NYX product.</li>
            <li>I wanted a more natural look and I got it!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I never got around to using it all!</li>
            <li>It is a great little kit for on the go just do not expect a well made case and</li>
            <li>Lip gloss is great, lip colors are a little darker than they look here.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products all mainly because of the first color on there.</li>
            <li>NYX is of course a good brand of makeup, which is why this item costs as much as it does considering the entire box is the size of a Post-It.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the lip</li>
            <li>The shadows go on nicely and seemed to stay put.i did not use primer, but was only using for evening wear.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re lovely, light, and sheer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li>I only wear natural colors  for eyeshadow and this palette is perfect and did I mention how small and cute it is it could fit in the tiniest bag.</li>
            <li>The sleek, charming little box fits perfectly in any handbag or makeup bag, and its contents are most definitely comparable to Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked palette.</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s eyeshadow is not as good as other brands.</li>
            <li>but it went right over her head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and compact but has great quality eye shadows and lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Colors I received looked darker than pictured but it is a very nice little compact!  </li>
            <li>Buying solely based on these 3 parts :) The mirror and shape of the square box makes it easy to hold and what I use when applying any other product.</li>
            <li>Still, I can&#x27;t complain too much, because this palate was a good deal and offers a good selection of pretty, subtle colors.</li>
            <li>There are also 2 lip colors which are kind of glossy and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very very transparent.</li>
            <li>But it works for just fine for a natural look for school or just going to the mall.</li>
            <li>Wet or dry, this eyeshadow glides on smoothly, pigment is beautiful, and its very blendable.</li>
            <li>The shadows, on the other hand, apply nicely with a dry or wet brush, and are pretty subdued despite being fairly shimmery (most of the shadows, not all).</li>
            <li>I got this product for my mother, and will most likely order another for myself.</li>
            <li>but just be aware of the size.</li>
            <li>Great pigment in the shadow and gives a bit of delicate color to the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Colors are pretty in eye shadow buy not it lip colors.</li>
            <li>I love the neutral colors and goes with corporate attire.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was really fast too!</li>
            <li>blonde / light skin / green eyes and all the colors are great</li>
            <li>Also, when I first looked at the lip gloss</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love NYX stuff, typically they are a cheap brand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very small and the shadows aren&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li>I should probably be using some kind of primer, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my oily eyelids that are to blame, but I&#x27;ve had other (also cheap) eye shadows stay in place a little longer.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought...but overall good product.</li>
            <li>I love the colors in this palate, however I&#x27;ve found that they don&#x27;t stay in place for as long as I would like.</li>
            <li>I loved all the colors that came in the palette, however, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be that small.</li>
            <li>One thing that would be nice would be if there was a black or darker brown for the crease</li>
            <li>The shadows are less than dime sized but they are nice shadows.</li>
            <li>The staying power of the shadows is good, as long as you use a primer (this is key).</li>
            <li>Nice little thing to have in my makeup collection....  </li>
            <li>The shadow isn&#x27;t very pigmented.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use two of the eyeshadows very often.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the lip gloss stuff</li>
            <li>Fast arrived.  </li>
            <li>I like the size of this set as I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often.</li>
            <li>I often reach for this palette when I&#x27;m getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY PERFECTS</li>
            <li>thank you so much ,fast shipped.</li>
            <li>I really should have,</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t stand the lip glosses, but I absolutely adore the colors and sheen of the eye shadows.</li>
            <li>havent really used it since i bought it because its not too pigmented and the lip product isnt too</li>
            <li>Not very pigmented but cute</li>
            <li>The lip gloss really doesn&#x27;t apply too much color to your lips.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product is just what I was hoping for: the eyeshadows are natural nude colors that have a reasonable amount of pigmentation, and the lip glosses are cute!</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really get around needing to carry those and a mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hoping this is a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li>You really have to pack on the color.</li>
            <li>I originally was looking for Urban Decay&#x27;s Nude palette and it was sold out.</li>
            <li>I really like the bronze colored lip gloss, very flattering on me and not something I would&#x27;ve normally picked for myself</li>
            <li>I always seem to run out of specific colors too quickly while barely touching other shades.</li>
            <li>AND it is a nice small compact that will slip into a purse or tote.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one for super dramatic eyes, so this works really nicely for me.  </li>
            <li>This particular set doesn&#x27;t include blusher</li>
            <li>This is super tiny.</li>
            <li>I think the colors could be a little more pigmented, but other than that, a great little box.</li>
            <li>I love this little NYX Nude on</li>
            <li>The kit itself is smaller than I expected, but I really like the colors :)  </li>
            <li>Its great for beginners, possibly if you needed something small to travel with and not take your entire makeup collection with you.</li>
            <li>I love this little palette!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s even better when you put it on at night, with a little added glitter to your eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;Sexy!</li>
            <li>The shadows are very soft and pigmented but while still making every-day looks.</li>
            <li>The first 2 rows are matte colors and then the last row has a shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>The naked basic palette is a lot better and it&#x27;s only like 27$. if u want qualty buy that.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows blend well and are all pretty useful for everyday looks.</li>
            <li>This kit was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but once I got past that I really liked it.</li>
            <li>The compact design is handy, small enough for your pocket .....</li>
            <li>wife says its OK, not very good quality though..</li>
            <li>If you folded a US dollar in half and placed the compact on top of it, the compact is smaller.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a tiny mirror on the top lid, as well as 2 shimmery pink/coral lip gloss&#x27;s in the little slide out drawer.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this palette.  </li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m liking the colors.  </li>
            <li>but this product changed my mind completely.</li>
            <li>The glass was completely shattered all over the makeup.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>I have the bronze, natural, and smokey eye palettes  </li>
            <li>While I was expecting the package to be slightly bigger, I don&#x27;t really have any complaints about the product itself.</li>
            <li>Nude Natural Look Kit!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, i pretty much have the exact same shades in my Sephora products, and various other palettes I have.</li>
            <li>i was thinking will be bigger but is very small , i like the natural shadows , and the lip gloss is nice also and semi opaque ..</li>
            <li>It is small and compact, easy to put inside my bag</li>
            <li>its small that can put in my bag easily and convenient.</li>
            <li>They also include a small eye shadow brush and lip brush in the slide out drawer as well, but i most likely wont use those unless its an emergency.</li>
            <li>this was supposed to be a gift, now I have to pay return shipping wait for a refund and then wait for a new one to be shipped back.</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow brush nearly fills the whole pan, so it&#x27;s harder than necessary to pick up product.</li>
            <li>I have a background in cosmetology, so I my expectations of a product may be higher than the average consumer.</li>
            <li>, the hard case makes it travel friendly.</li>
            <li>The pink on the right is closer to a carnation pink but that could just be me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, small enough to fit into a clutch purse for an evening.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy little container.</li>
            <li>I really like this little pallette.</li>

            <li> This is a very nice, compact eye shadow and gloss kit.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, and good quality.</li>
            <li> I am not a youngster any more and the blues, greens and purples of my youth are no longer the best for me, although I still wear them at times.  </li>
            <li> I wish the shadows were a bit more pigmented, but all in all, this is a great product to pack for a day at the beach or on a weekend trip!</li>
            <li> the eyeshawdows are amazingly pigmented and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful and blend out nicely.</li>
            <li> Win win :)</li>
            <li> The shadows are great, blend well, and i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be great for travel.</li>
            <li> The compact box can literally fit in the palm of my hand, so its perfect for on the go.</li>
            <li> Tad sticky but doesn&#x27;t bother me since some glosses are and it seemed to have good staying power.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li> Colors disappear on my medium skin tone, good for an almost nude look over eyelid primer.</li>
            <li> There is a good selection of colors in this palette.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good palette.</li>
            <li> No a fan of the lip products included in it, but the set is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Good assortment of neutrals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfect for travel or just keeping it compact!&lt;br /&gt;Colors are gorgeous and NYX is quality on a budget!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> but I find it good to cary in my purse.</li>
            <li> The colors are good if you want to wear makeup but without overdoing it.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and i love this brand.</li>
            <li> Otherwise great colors just wish the case was better made.</li>
            <li> Im very glad to buy it</li>
            <li> Cute, almost identical to the higher-priced equivalent, and it won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> That being said, I love these colors!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> love this set and was very happy to see the photo was a true representation of the eye color palette.  </li>
            <li> The pigmentation was not as great, but like MAC - you could easily blend the colors.</li>
            <li> Purchases this on a whim, and was suprised on how awesome the colors are, how long the color lasts on my skin, but most of all the lip gloss is superb!  </li>
            <li> The colors are great for daytime wear and a nice compact size for easy travel.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;m thrilled with this.  </li>
            <li> The lip colors are nice too.</li>
            <li> But the color was nice.  </li>
            <li> the eye-shadows are placental with nice shimmer ..</li>
            <li> the shimmery colors are nice and goes on well.</li>
            <li> I like the colors and they were shipped nicely with nothing broke</li>
            <li> and the packaging is nice.</li>
            <li> I think for the money, this set is a bargain and also nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my purse and there when I need it.</li>
            <li> She liked it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but wish the quality of the shadow was a bit richer</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> I am generally a popular drugstore brand user and never had to use primer with those.</li>
            <li> But I like it because it fits into any purse I own or can slip into a pocket with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I used this with a primer and had nice, 12 hour wear (even with my somewhat oily eyelids).</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t replace my MAC core colors, but when I want a nice, cheaper palette or some trendy colors</li>
            <li> Nice case.</li>
            <li> But this kit has shades of light to medium browns and some very nice taupe shades.</li>
            <li> Great product and not expensive!</li>
            <li> The color is natural and beautiful.i am very happy</li>
            <li> True - it&#x27;s not as good, but it&#x27;s a nice, cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> Love love love this palette!</li>
            <li> Its the perfect size for a purse, and does come with really pretty earthy colors that do go on nice and stay if you prime your lids right.</li>
            <li> (and I have very light skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> FOR All WOMEN super good</li>
            <li> Love how it goes on, very smooth</li>
            <li> &quot; I am pleased with colors, although I don&#x27;t like copper</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> They are more transparent than opaque.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I use the bottom two rows most of the time plus the lightest color for highlighting.</li>
            <li> Love the color pallette.</li>
            <li> Their eyeshadow primer pot is better than UD&#x27;s Primer Potion imo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad  I bought it</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> nyx nude on look kit,i love it.</li>
            <li> I like the colors and wish the product was better.</li>
            <li> I Love all of the colors in this look kit</li>
            <li> I love this make up collection</li>
            <li> The shadows more than make up for the lip colors.</li>
            <li> I do love this palette.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> The prices here are better than anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> I recommend these as cute stocking stuffers for Christmas for your friends</li>
            <li> I love how the lip colors slide out underneath.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to be there when she received it</li>
            <li> I love NYX make up.</li>
            <li> Also the lip balms are my favorite ever.</li>
            <li> Will buy this forever until I run out of these favorite colors.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a bit buffer but offset than that I love this.the colours</li>
            <li> This tiny palette is perfect to carry around in your purse if you need a touch up on eye makeup and or lip gloss</li>
            <li> need anything else, just add mascara! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a more subdued pallet</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what happens when one shops online :-)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that someone could ramp up the drama with this, however, so</li>
            <li> The top three colors are matte; the remaining six are shimmery</li>
            <li> Love the colors and stays on without caking</li>
            <li> Grand daughters lived them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I do not like the lips stuff..but its ok i can ignore them.</li>
            <li> 2nd purchase of this eyeshadow from Amazon, both times, arrived in perfect sealed condition.</li>
            <li> Then she found them &amp; was very excited.  </li>
            <li> It came in the mail quickly and I even got called and emailed from the Purfume Station to make sure my order was correct and that I liked it.</li>
            <li> The colors are wonderful for that natural look and the gloss is a nice touch (even though I don&#x27;t really use it).</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL, NATURAL COLORS</li>
            <li> The colors are great for me, i always love doing a natural makeup look.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s always a good thing when the eyeshadows are not broken in the shipping process :)  </li>
            <li> The two in the top right corner are not that nice.</li>
            <li> All other colors are awesome too though! :)</li>
            <li> Oh well, maybe it&#x27;ll be the most fantastic eyeshadow there is.  </li>
            <li> My gf love it and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> A bit small but great product for a great price</li>
            <li> Not wanting to spend a great deal of money replacing items I don&#x27;t use frequently, I decided to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the colors are so great and natural looking</li>
            <li> NYX is really good, thanks.</li>
            <li> I was worried, but on the colors are also very nice and natural.  </li>
            <li> i love the way it came nothing broking came great and on time the only thing i did not  like was the lip gloss that it came with</li>
            <li> They come off too easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to store and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> - they blend easily and stay all day.  </li>
            <li> Really surprised it has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> To be honest, when I first saw this, I thought they were blush colors, not lip gloss.</li>
            <li> This is also a great way to try new colors but you will run out quickly</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, dark hair and eyebrows, and hazel eyes and was looking for a good palette to experiment with the \\&quot;smoky eye look.\\</li>
            <li> Loved the darker lip gloss because it is more of a natural dark strawberry lip color :) and the eye shadow is very lovely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge MAC eyeshadow fan...</li>
            <li> i bought this because it was cheap and portable...</li>
            <li> it was cheap</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I gave one as a stocking stuffer for a friend at Christmas.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and the color is layerable.</li>
            <li> are wonderful and I use it about everyday</li>
            <li> Can barley fit a eye liner brush in it and as for the lip color part....</li>
            <li> dare I say a cheap filler.</li>
            <li> Great for basic daytime looks</li>
            <li> Altogether, I loved the product and I recommend this to anyone who is looking for nude natural colors to wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised because I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with NYX products.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeshadow for my wedding, actually, and it was very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a great product very pigmented, great quality and such lovely neutral colours for such a affordable price.</li>
            <li> the lip colors are super light goes on smooth not sticky.</li>
            <li> Excellent everyday palette!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be perfect if it weren&#x27;t for the small size....</li>
            <li> I used the same palette on the mother of the bride, who is in her fifties, with successful results.</li>
            <li> I am asian 5\\&quot;4 (1.64m to be precise) and I have fair to tanned skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After purchasing this it is the only palate that I use out of the many that I own.</li>
            <li> Shadows very pigmented :)</li>
            <li> Nice colors with a natural look.  </li>
            <li> eye color have good opacity and last.</li>
            <li> and it is a good back up.</li>
            <li> They say it&#x27;s a good knock off for the naked pallette.</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the colors and they all are very flattering.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good set of neutrals, look no further.</li>
            <li> Good product overall.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice for lips, some eye colors are a bit too natural, need a lot to even show at all.  </li>
            <li> * Great little box of NYX eyeshadows for the price, they glide on easily and I like the pigmentation  </li>
            <li> Lovely colors and a very cheap alternative to the Naked Palettes.</li>
            <li> I am going to order the other color kits because I&#x27;m so happy with this.  </li>
            <li> but the shadows wear off quickly</li>
            <li> cute colors, the palette is tiny though so make sure you realize that when buying.</li>
            <li> QUEDO SUPER FASCINADA CON EL PRODUCTO,DE MUY BUENA</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> None the less, this is still a great quality NYX product.</li>
            <li> I wanted a more natural look and I got it!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I never got around to using it all!</li>
            <li> It is a great little kit for on the go just do not expect a well made case and</li>
            <li> Lip gloss is great, lip colors are a little darker than they look here.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products all mainly because of the first color on there.</li>
            <li> NYX is of course a good brand of makeup, which is why this item costs as much as it does considering the entire box is the size of a Post-It.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the lip</li>
            <li> The shadows go on nicely and seemed to stay put.i did not use primer, but was only using for evening wear.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re lovely, light, and sheer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li> I only wear natural colors  for eyeshadow and this palette is perfect and did I mention how small and cute it is it could fit in the tiniest bag.</li>
            <li> The sleek, charming little box fits perfectly in any handbag or makeup bag, and its contents are most definitely comparable to Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked palette.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s eyeshadow is not as good as other brands.</li>
            <li> but it went right over her head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact but has great quality eye shadows and lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Colors I received looked darker than pictured but it is a very nice little compact!  </li>
            <li> Buying solely based on these 3 parts :) The mirror and shape of the square box makes it easy to hold and what I use when applying any other product.</li>
            <li> Still, I can&#x27;t complain too much, because this palate was a good deal and offers a good selection of pretty, subtle colors.</li>
            <li> There are also 2 lip colors which are kind of glossy and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very very transparent.</li>
            <li> But it works for just fine for a natural look for school or just going to the mall.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry, this eyeshadow glides on smoothly, pigment is beautiful, and its very blendable.</li>
            <li> The shadows, on the other hand, apply nicely with a dry or wet brush, and are pretty subdued despite being fairly shimmery (most of the shadows, not all).</li>
            <li> I got this product for my mother, and will most likely order another for myself.</li>
            <li> but just be aware of the size.</li>
            <li> Great pigment in the shadow and gives a bit of delicate color to the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Colors are pretty in eye shadow buy not it lip colors.</li>
            <li> I love the neutral colors and goes with corporate attire.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was really fast too!</li>
            <li> blonde / light skin / green eyes and all the colors are great</li>
            <li> Also, when I first looked at the lip gloss</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love NYX stuff, typically they are a cheap brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small and the shadows aren&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li> I should probably be using some kind of primer, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my oily eyelids that are to blame, but I&#x27;ve had other (also cheap) eye shadows stay in place a little longer.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought...but overall good product.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this palate, however I&#x27;ve found that they don&#x27;t stay in place for as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> I loved all the colors that came in the palette, however, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be that small.</li>
            <li> One thing that would be nice would be if there was a black or darker brown for the crease</li>
            <li> The shadows are less than dime sized but they are nice shadows.</li>
            <li> The staying power of the shadows is good, as long as you use a primer (this is key).</li>
            <li> Nice little thing to have in my makeup collection....  </li>
            <li> The shadow isn&#x27;t very pigmented.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use two of the eyeshadows very often.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the lip gloss stuff</li>
            <li> Fast arrived.  </li>
            <li> I like the size of this set as I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often.</li>
            <li> I often reach for this palette when I&#x27;m getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY PERFECTS</li>
            <li> thank you so much ,fast shipped.</li>
            <li> I really should have,</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t stand the lip glosses, but I absolutely adore the colors and sheen of the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> havent really used it since i bought it because its not too pigmented and the lip product isnt too</li>
            <li> Not very pigmented but cute</li>
            <li> The lip gloss really doesn&#x27;t apply too much color to your lips.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product is just what I was hoping for: the eyeshadows are natural nude colors that have a reasonable amount of pigmentation, and the lip glosses are cute!</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really get around needing to carry those and a mascara.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping this is a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> You really have to pack on the color.</li>
            <li> I originally was looking for Urban Decay&#x27;s Nude palette and it was sold out.</li>
            <li> I really like the bronze colored lip gloss, very flattering on me and not something I would&#x27;ve normally picked for myself</li>
            <li> I always seem to run out of specific colors too quickly while barely touching other shades.</li>
            <li> AND it is a nice small compact that will slip into a purse or tote.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for super dramatic eyes, so this works really nicely for me.  </li>
            <li> This particular set doesn&#x27;t include blusher</li>
            <li> This is super tiny.</li>
            <li> I think the colors could be a little more pigmented, but other than that, a great little box.</li>
            <li> I love this little NYX Nude on</li>
            <li> The kit itself is smaller than I expected, but I really like the colors :)  </li>
            <li> Its great for beginners, possibly if you needed something small to travel with and not take your entire makeup collection with you.</li>
            <li> I love this little palette!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s even better when you put it on at night, with a little added glitter to your eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;Sexy!</li>
            <li> The shadows are very soft and pigmented but while still making every-day looks.</li>
            <li> The first 2 rows are matte colors and then the last row has a shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> The naked basic palette is a lot better and it&#x27;s only like 27$. if u want qualty buy that.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows blend well and are all pretty useful for everyday looks.</li>
            <li> This kit was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but once I got past that I really liked it.</li>
            <li> The compact design is handy, small enough for your pocket .....</li>
            <li> wife says its OK, not very good quality though..</li>
            <li> If you folded a US dollar in half and placed the compact on top of it, the compact is smaller.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a tiny mirror on the top lid, as well as 2 shimmery pink/coral lip gloss&#x27;s in the little slide out drawer.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this palette.  </li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m liking the colors.  </li>
            <li> but this product changed my mind completely.</li>
            <li> The glass was completely shattered all over the makeup.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised.</li>
            <li> I have the bronze, natural, and smokey eye palettes  </li>
            <li> While I was expecting the package to be slightly bigger, I don&#x27;t really have any complaints about the product itself.</li>
            <li> Nude Natural Look Kit!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, i pretty much have the exact same shades in my Sephora products, and various other palettes I have.</li>
            <li> i was thinking will be bigger but is very small , i like the natural shadows , and the lip gloss is nice also and semi opaque ..</li>
            <li> It is small and compact, easy to put inside my bag</li>
            <li> its small that can put in my bag easily and convenient.</li>
            <li> They also include a small eye shadow brush and lip brush in the slide out drawer as well, but i most likely wont use those unless its an emergency.</li>
            <li> this was supposed to be a gift, now I have to pay return shipping wait for a refund and then wait for a new one to be shipped back.</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow brush nearly fills the whole pan, so it&#x27;s harder than necessary to pick up product.</li>
            <li> I have a background in cosmetology, so I my expectations of a product may be higher than the average consumer.</li>
            <li> , the hard case makes it travel friendly.</li>
            <li> The pink on the right is closer to a carnation pink but that could just be me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, small enough to fit into a clutch purse for an evening.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy little container.</li>
            <li> I really like this little pallette.</li>
            <li> But for the price and half the colors where too dark to where to work (for me)it wasn&#x27;t worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Also the case is cumbersome to get into, it wont last long.</li>
            <li> First, my only complaint is that this compact is smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give this a higher rating is the colors are very small.  </li>
            <li> Definitely smaller than the average shadow compact, and the shadow sizes are smaller as well.</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t stay on as long.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, looking for the UD&#x27;S palette but not ready to spend double the amount of the asking price of $40</li>
            <li> Though I have to say for as long as I have had it</li>
            <li> Kit is much smaller than expected, fits in the palm of my hand</li>
            <li> It is much smaller than expected and for the price</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The color does not stay long, and lipstick is very dry.</li>
            <li> She usually does not wear make up and was looking for a natural look.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I was expecting something a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Wish the shadows were a little larger though.</li>
            <li> I expected that before I purchased it though.</li>
            <li> but there is not much of each one.</li>
            <li> Have only had it for a few days</li>
            <li> I would of spent $12 on this.  </li>
            <li> Also comes with a few tiny applicators so you can take it with you.</li>
            <li> Despite the small size, I would likely re-purchase this item.</li>
            <li> It mixes well with the other color</li>
            <li> It is advertised in a way that guarantees a full \\&quot;look\\&quot; in a small package but it fails on delivery.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had like a really dark eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I usually hate potted lip gloss, but these are okay -</li>
            <li> The package is very small, but for the price, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> this is a very small investment vs. the Naked Palette though the eyeshadow are not super pigmented.</li>
            <li> Some are a little less pigmented than others</li>
            <li> I have come to like the little compact.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it makes the eyes seems to be a little dropsy</li>
            <li> It helps keep the color on if you put a little bit of concealer on your eyelids before applying.</li>
            <li> I do think the lip colors are a little off in the photo.  </li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not happy about the sizing i thought it would be bigger.</li>
            <li> Talk about small and not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday palette.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I had recently cleaned out my cosmetics and threw a lot of outdated items away.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt have enough pigmentation and its so small its hard to apply so i hardly used it and gave it away</li>
            <li> &amp;#62;w&amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mean the palette with 10 other colors just as small.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re a little hard and colorless for my taste.</li>
            <li> This product is small.</li>
            <li> Had I of realized how small the compact was, there I is no way</li>
            <li> The shades are small and don&#x27;t seem to stay on the skin too well.</li>
            <li> colors are a bit off from the picture, unfortunately will only wear a couple of the eyeshadows but do like the glosses</li>
            <li> I like this product but its so darn small.</li>
            <li> Might as well forget the applicators they are too small.  </li>
            <li> It is really small, fits in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> so I use it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s so small that it fits in the palm of your hand) but</li>
            <li> The glosses are mediocre, hard to put on / get out to put on and have a really really sheer finish.</li>
            <li> I mean really small.  </li>
            <li> but gosh I&#x27;m amazed at how small it is!</li>
            <li> Each little square is so tiny :(</li>
            <li> I mean, make the size a bit bigger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use this for my travels!</li>
            <li> It is very small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find shadows that cater to just about every skin tone and isn&#x27;t too flashy.</li>
            <li> This is a very small compact!</li>
            <li> I was just a little disappointed with the size, but I suppose that is my fault for not paying closer attention to the dimensions.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> cant go wrong w this product.  </li>
            <li> The lipstick/gloss is useless and the colors are not pigmented at all.</li>
            <li> In Brasil is very expensive.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m bitterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I use the NYX eyeshadow base in Skin Tone</li>
            <li> The lipglosses in this kit are worthless, as is the lip brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Terrible colors, terrible quality, and they irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smaller than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> I was trying this as a dupe for the Naked pallett. The shadow isn&#x27;t very pigmented. And doesn&#x27;t stay on as long. But it works for just fine for a natural look for school or just going to the mall.</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette because I wanted nude eyeshadow colors that I could wear to work and for an evening out. I was pleasantly surprised with this palette.  When I use the NYX eyeshadow base in Skin Tone my eyeshadow stays on for around 8 or 9 hours without creasing.  Pretty good.</li>
            <li> NYX is of course a good brand of makeup, which is why this item costs as much as it does considering the entire box is the size of a Post-It. I&#x27;m not kidding, its the size of a sticky note! I have fair skin, dark hair and eyebrows, and hazel eyes and was looking for a good palette to experiment with the \\&quot;smoky eye look.\\&quot; I am pleased with colors, although I don&#x27;t like copper so I don&#x27;t use two of the eyeshadows very often. I don&#x27;t really like the lip gloss stuff and the applicators are lower quality than what I had hoped. I expected that before I purchased it though. I was just a little disappointed with the size, but I suppose that is my fault for not paying closer attention to the dimensions.</li>
            <li> I was looking at Urban Decay&#x27;s nude pallet as well.  But for the price and half the colors where too dark to where to work (for me)it wasn&#x27;t worth the price.  I was expecting a pallet about the size of NYX&#x27;s Morocco pallet.  It is smaller, but plenty of product.  If they redo it, make it in the image of that.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m thrilled with this.  The lip glosses are great too.</li>
            <li> Shadows very pigmented :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. I originally was looking for Urban Decay&#x27;s Nude palette and it was sold out. After reading reviews about NYX&#x27;s Nude on Nude on different blogs, I decided to try it. The package is very small, but for the price, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me. The eye shadow colors are almost the same as Urban Decay&#x27;s. Please remember I said almost. About two of them are not. If you are like me, looking for the UD&#x27;S palette but not ready to spend double the amount of the asking price of $40 (yeah, some people were selling the palettes for over $100 on Ebay)then try NYX. The staying power of the shadows is good, as long as you use a primer (this is key). With a primer, the eyeshadow stayed on for eight hours and I have oily lids. The lip colors are nice too. They are more transparent than opaque. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this again! Love how it goes on, very smooth and it lasts all day, no creasing or clumping. The first 2 rows are matte colors and then the last row has a shimmer to it. There are also 2 lip colors which are kind of glossy and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips. Great product and not expensive!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I was expecting something a little bigger. Its the perfect size for a purse, and does come with really pretty earthy colors that do go on nice and stay if you prime your lids right. It came in the mail quickly and I even got called and emailed from the Purfume Station to make sure my order was correct and that I liked it. I was also told I could return it if I wasnt happy. So the customer service was great regarding this company and what they sell through amazon. I would order from them again ..</li>
            <li> Excellent everyday palette!</li>
            <li> I loooove all NYX eye shadows, so its no surprise that these eye shadows are great and well pigmented. The compact box can literally fit in the palm of my hand, so its perfect for on the go. The colors are great for me, i always love doing a natural makeup look. It also comes with a tiny mirror on the top lid, as well as 2 shimmery pink/coral lip gloss&#x27;s in the little slide out drawer. They also include a small eye shadow brush and lip brush in the slide out drawer as well, but i most likely wont use those unless its an emergency. There are 3 matte neutral colors and 6 shimmery neutral colors. All will look great on anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this little palette! It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, small enough to fit into a clutch purse for an evening. Beautiful colors, and good quality.</li>
            <li> Fast arrived.  This product is small. But the color was nice.  Since I&#x27;m a starter, I felt this totally meets my needs.</li>
            <li> i was thinking will be bigger but is very small , i like the natural shadows , and the lip gloss is nice also and semi opaque .. the eye-shadows are placental with nice shimmer ..</li>
            <li> I loved all the colors that came in the palette, however, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be that small. Altogether, I loved the product and I recommend this to anyone who is looking for nude natural colors to wear.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  The sleek, charming little box fits perfectly in any handbag or makeup bag, and its contents are most definitely comparable to Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked palette. I would purchase this product over&amp;over again!! Cute, almost identical to the higher-priced equivalent, and it won&#x27;t break the bank! Win win :)</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful and blend out nicely.</li>
            <li> Bought his for my fiancé! She loved it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. the eyeshawdows are amazingly pigmented and beautiful. I might get another one so i dont run out.</li>
            <li> some colors are pigmented and some are not. the shimmery colors are nice and goes on well. the lip glosses are sticky and stingy, which i did not like. also again about the colors, they are very similar to the urban decay naked palette. i bought this because it was cheap and portable...but i would invest my money on the naked palette. to see a review i did on this check it out here.[...]</li>
            <li> I like the size of this set as I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often. I think the colors could be a little more pigmented, but other than that, a great little box. I use the bottom two rows most of the time plus the lightest color for highlighting. The two in the top right corner are not that nice.</li>
            <li> I wanted a more natural look and I got it!  Nice colors with a natural look.  I don&#x27;t care for the lip stains they are too sticky but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not pigmented AT ALL! (and I have very light skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible colors, terrible quality, and they irritate my eyes.  Horrible.</li>
            <li> eye color have good opacity and last. perfect for caring in your makeup bag for your purse</li>
            <li> The kit itself is smaller than I expected, but I really like the colors :)  And it&#x27;s always a good thing when the eyeshadows are not broken in the shipping process :)  I got this product for my mother, and will most likely order another for myself.</li>
            <li> I like the colors on this but there is not much of each one. I have had this only 1 month and one color I use often ( lightest for the brow bone area) is already gone. Just not enough of it. I don&#x27;t use this every day either.</li>
            <li> Love the color pallette. Perfect range of colors and matte vs shimmer. I only wish it was bigger for the $$$ since this is a dupe of the \\&quot;Naked\\&quot; by Urban Decay. Oh and the lip glosses aren&#x27;t great but the shadows make up for it</li>
            <li> It is a great little kit for on the go just do not expect a well made case and the lip colors are super light goes on smooth not sticky. Otherwise great colors just wish the case was better made.</li>
            <li> i love the way it came nothing broking came great and on time the only thing i did not  like was the lip gloss that it came with it was cheap</li>
            <li> Eyeshadows were chalky and the lipglosses were low quality. I&#x27;m surprised because I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with NYX products. Their eyeshadow primer pot is better than UD&#x27;s Primer Potion imo. I only bought this because I was looking at UD&#x27;s Naked palette that was sold out. It is advertised in a way that guarantees a full \\&quot;look\\&quot; in a small package but it fails on delivery. I gave this a go because of the price and I&#x27;m bitterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small and the shadows aren&#x27;t that great.  Lots of fallout and the colors don&#x27;t stand out.  They come off too easily.  The lipgloss is alright.</li>
            <li> I often reach for this palette when I&#x27;m getting ready for work. Though I have to say for as long as I have had it I have never used the lip glosses in the second drawer. The eyeshadows blend well and are all pretty useful for everyday looks.</li>
            <li> Excellent. My wife loves it and it looks great too. Worth every penny I paid for it. Will buy from again and again!</li>
            <li> Have only had it for a few days but I&#x27;ve used it twice and so far I&#x27;m liking the colors.  Haven&#x27;t used them all but I&#x27;m happy with that I&#x27;ve tried. I really like the bronze colored lip gloss, very flattering on me and not something I would&#x27;ve normally picked for myself so I&#x27;d think about repurchasing just that in the future. Tad sticky but doesn&#x27;t bother me since some glosses are and it seemed to have good staying power.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Smaller than I thought.. Picture makes it look like it is 5 inches tall but it&#x27;s really only 1.5 ish. Lip gloss is great, lip colors are a little darker than they look here.</li>
            <li> I do like this but gosh I&#x27;m amazed at how small it is! Really surprised it has so many good reviews. Each little square is so tiny :( I&#x27;m glad  I bought it but just be aware of the size.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT REALLY PERFECTS FOR SEMI BROWN SMOKY MAKEUP IT&#x27;S REALLY GOOD FOR All WOMEN super good</li>
            <li> I like the colors and they were shipped nicely with nothing broke but the shadows wear off quickly and I wasn&#x27;t doing anything physical to sweat it off. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Im very glad to buy it</li>
            <li> Kit is much smaller than expected, fits in the palm of my hand and I wear XS gloves. Colors disappear on my medium skin tone, good for an almost nude look over eyelid primer. I don&#x27;t do the nude look often so this is a very small investment vs. the Naked Palette though the eyeshadow are not super pigmented.</li>
            <li> nyx nude on look kit,i love it.The color is natural and beautiful.i am very happy thank you so much ,fast shipped.</li>
            <li> Had I of realized how small the compact was, there I is no way I would of spent $12 on this.  Oh well, maybe it&#x27;ll be the most fantastic eyeshadow there is.  If so, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> But I guess it will do as a cheaper alternative to some pricey make ups. The shades are small and don&#x27;t seem to stay on the skin too well. I like the colors and wish the product was better.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeshadow for my wedding, actually, and it was very nice. Unfortunately, I never got around to using it all! I really should have, but after two years of holding on to it...I would recommend this product, yes.</li>
            <li> I Love all of the colors in this look kit wish the shadows were bigger in size. Shadows stay on all day.</li>
            <li> Make it bigger! &amp;#62;w&amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mean the palette with 10 other colors just as small. I mean, make the size a bit bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stand the lip glosses, but I absolutely adore the colors and sheen of the eye shadows. It&#x27;s so hard to find shadows that cater to just about every skin tone and isn&#x27;t too flashy. It&#x27;d be perfect if it weren&#x27;t for the small size.... I always seem to run out of specific colors too quickly while barely touching other shades.</li>
            <li> I love this make up collection and I bring it everywhere with me. It is small and compact, easy to put inside my bag pocket.&lt;br /&gt;It is also perfect for my skin. I am asian 5\\&quot;4 (1.64m to be precise) and I have fair to tanned skin.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin glow and it&#x27;s even better when you put it on at night, with a little added glitter to your eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;Sexy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big NYX person but this product changed my mind completely. The shadows are very soft and pigmented but while still making every-day looks. I&#x27;m not crazy about the lip colors- they&#x27;re a little hard and colorless for my taste. The shadows more than make up for the lip colors. There are a ton of combinations you can do. One thing that would be nice would be if there was a black or darker brown for the crease but these are perfectly sufficient. Also comes with a few tiny applicators so you can take it with you. Very sturdy little container. There&#x27;s a mirror, too. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice little thing to have in my makeup collection....  Great pigment in the shadow and gives a bit of delicate color to the eyes.  Recommend!!</li>
            <li> havent really used it since i bought it because its not too pigmented and the lip product isnt too well.&lt;br /&gt;i use some of the colors when i contour because i dont have a blush and it is a good back up. and the packaging is nice. I just dont think i&#x27;d buy it again. They say it&#x27;s a good knock off for the naked pallette. The naked basic palette is a lot better and it&#x27;s only like 27$. if u want qualty buy that.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and in great condition.  I like the color choices of the eye shadows and lip glosses.  Wish the shadows were a little larger though.</li>
            <li> The shadows are great, blend well, and i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be great for travel. The glosses are mediocre, hard to put on / get out to put on and have a really really sheer finish. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, i pretty much have the exact same shades in my Sephora products, and various other palettes I have. Its great for beginners, possibly if you needed something small to travel with and not take your entire makeup collection with you. I am not that enthused about this.</li>
            <li> This kit is very tiny and it probably will travel well but you would need a tiny brush to get the color of choice without getting all the colors at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again.  I bought this as a Christmas gift/stocking stuffer for my daughter.  It is much smaller than expected and for the price I could have just gone to Walmart and pick up several name brand products and she and I would have both been happier.  Also the case is cumbersome to get into, it wont last long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to do a friends make up for her wedding. She usually does not wear make up and was looking for a natural look. I have a background in cosmetology, so I my expectations of a product may be higher than the average consumer. This product did not disappoint. The colors were pigmented enough for photography without the bride looking &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;.  I used the same palette on the mother of the bride, who is in her fifties, with successful results. I did not try the lip colors, so I can&#x27;t evaluate them. I think for the money, this set is a bargain and also nicely packaged. I liked it so much I gave one as a stocking stuffer for a friend at Christmas.</li>
            <li> Not very pigmented but cute</li>
            <li> I do love this palette. I use it all the time.  The cream blushes/lipstick are also great.  I just wish it had like a really dark eyeshadow so it would be perfect to bring for day to night look.</li>
            <li> This came in a timely fashion and in excellent condition!!! I Would buy from Perfume Station again!!!!</li>
            <li> The glass was completely shattered all over the makeup.  this was supposed to be a gift, now I have to pay return shipping wait for a refund and then wait for a new one to be shipped back. I just want my money back and throw it away. Such a pain!</li>
            <li> cute colors, the palette is tiny though so make sure you realize that when buying. I was surprised.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, compact eye shadow and gloss kit. The shadows go on nicely and seemed to stay put.i did not use primer, but was only using for evening wear.</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I have tried most of the colors and they all are very flattering.  I am not a youngster any more and the blues, greens and purples of my youth are no longer the best for me, although I still wear them at times.  But this kit has shades of light to medium browns and some very nice taupe shades. I wore the taupe ones today and they are the ones that suit me best.  AND it is a nice small compact that will slip into a purse or tote.  The two lip colors are creamy and wear well.  If you are looking for a good set of neutrals, look no further.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give this a higher rating is the colors are very small.  I didn&#x27;t realized that when I ordered.  I do like NYX products for the money they can&#x27;t be beat.  The prices here are better than anywhere else.  There is a good selection of colors in this palette.</li>
            <li> My gf love it and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This product was received on time and in perfect condition. The colors are great for daytime wear and a nice compact size for easy travel.</li>
            <li> * Great little box of NYX eyeshadows for the price, they glide on easily and I like the pigmentation  * I like to keep these in my purse or at work  * I have the bronze, natural, and smokey eye palettes  * I recommend these as cute stocking stuffers for Christmas for your friends</li>
            <li> First, my only complaint is that this compact is smaller than I expected. Definitely smaller than the average shadow compact, and the shadow sizes are smaller as well. That being said, I love these colors! The shadows blend well and are perfect for layering, smoky eye or worn alone. They last throughout the day and I have not noticed any caking or clumping of the powder during the day. Despite the small size, I would likely re-purchase this item.</li>
            <li> colors are a bit off from the picture, unfortunately will only wear a couple of the eyeshadows but do like the glosses</li>
            <li> This kit was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but once I got past that I really liked it. The eye shadows are great. Very pretty. The lip gloss really doesn&#x27;t apply too much color to your lips. Very sheer, but sometimes that&#x27;s all I need. I have come to like the little compact. Fits nicely in my purse and there when I need it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good palette. I got this product for my daugther.She liked it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but wish the quality of the shadow was a bit richer it&#x27;s very very transparent.</li>
            <li> The lipglosses in this kit are worthless, as is the lip brush. The shadows, on the other hand, apply nicely with a dry or wet brush, and are pretty subdued despite being fairly shimmery (most of the shadows, not all).</li>
            <li> After purchasing this it is the only palate that I use out of the many that I own. The shades are perfect. It goes on smooth and the color is layerable.</li>
            <li> There is some shining powder in it. Sometimes it makes you shining but sometimes it makes the eyes seems to be a little dropsy</li>
            <li> Colors I received looked darker than pictured but it is a very nice little compact!  The lip colors especially &amp; I don&#x27;t agree with her wearing any makeup at 11 but not my child so I was trying to find the lightest colors I could.  My niece loved it!  I love how the lip colors slide out underneath.  I wasn&#x27;t able to be there when she received it so we were on FaceTime &amp; I told her about them but it went right over her head.  Then she found them &amp; was very excited.  Took the the 1 star off for the color only!</li>
            <li> Loved the darker lip gloss because it is more of a natural dark strawberry lip color :) and the eye shadow is very lovely! Would look good on anyone !</li>
            <li> I love NYX make up. This eyeshadow palette i bought it for a gift and the person i gave them to justloves it! Very happy</li>
            <li> GOOD product, the pigmentation is on point!, the hard case makes it travel friendly. No a fan of the lip products included in it, but the set is good for the price.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products all mainly because of the first color on there. Also the lip balms are my favorite ever. Buying solely based on these 3 parts :) The mirror and shape of the square box makes it easy to hold and what I use when applying any other product. Will buy this forever until I run out of these favorite colors. All other colors are awesome too though! :)</li>
            <li> Purchases this on a whim, and was suprised on how awesome the colors are, how long the color lasts on my skin, but most of all the lip gloss is superb!  Been trying to find it in a larger size. The compact design is handy, small enough for your pocket .....cant go wrong w this product.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a bit buffer but offset than that I love this.the colours are wonderful and I use it about everyday</li>
            <li> Great selection. Goes on nicely. Good assortment of neutrals.</li>
            <li> Great colors !! Must have for everyone</li>
            <li> I got this for a trip and it had all the color I needed.</li>
            <li> very good and pratical palette</li>
            <li> I like this product but its so darn small. Not happy about the sizing i thought it would be bigger. Bummer</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL, NATURAL COLORS</li>
            <li> This tiny palette is perfect to carry around in your purse if you need a touch up on eye makeup and or lip gloss I only wear natural colors  for eyeshadow and this palette is perfect and did I mention how small and cute it is it could fit in the tiniest bag.</li>
            <li> Talk about small and not worth the price at all. Can barley fit a eye liner brush in it and as for the lip color part....dare I say a cheap filler. Will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this palette! Great for basic daytime looks</li>
            <li> QUEDO SUPER FASCINADA CON EL PRODUCTO,DE MUY BUENA CVALIDAD Y SU PRECIO EXCELENTE,RECOMIENDO AMPLIAMENTE AL VENDEDOR POR SU SERIEDAD Y RESPONSABILIDAD</li>
            <li> Might as well forget the applicators they are too small.  Colors are pretty in eye shadow buy not it lip colors.</li>
            <li> While I was expecting the package to be slightly bigger, I don&#x27;t really have any complaints about the product itself. The colors are wonderful for that natural look and the gloss is a nice touch (even though I don&#x27;t really use it). I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description, because I was expecting the product to be bigger. It is really small, fits in the palm of my hand. Other than that the product is just what I was hoping for: the eyeshadows are natural nude colors that have a reasonable amount of pigmentation, and the lip glosses are cute! Good product overall.</li>
            <li> It doesnt have enough pigmentation and its so small its hard to apply so i hardly used it and gave it away</li>
            <li> This is my everyday palette.  I love the neutral colors and goes with corporate attire.  It&#x27;s easy to store and easy to use.  All I need to get now is a brush with a lid so the bristles are kept neatly.  I recommend to the daily worker who doesn&#x27;t want to step out of the house without a &amp;#34;face&amp;#34;.  Do it!</li>
            <li> I love this little NYX Nude on Nude Natural Look Kit!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for travel or just keeping it compact!&lt;br /&gt;Colors are gorgeous and NYX is quality on a budget!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t need anything else, just add mascara! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;THANKS NYX Cosmetics USA, Inc. ! YOUR AWESOME!</li>
            <li> This is a very small compact! The shadows are less than dime sized but they are nice shadows. Some are a little less pigmented than others But with primer they go on we&#x27;ll and last all day. If you&#x27;re looking for a grab and go this is great! This is also a great way to try new colors but you will run out quickly</li>
            <li> These colors are DARKER than they appear. Was hoping for a more subdued pallet but that&#x27;s what happens when one shops online :-)</li>
            <li> Great product on a perfect size to carry on my bag.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice for lips, some eye colors are a bit too natural, need a lot to even show at all.  I also have to use primer to get the shadow to stick. I am generally a popular drugstore brand user and never had to use primer with those.</li>
            <li> wife says its OK, not very good quality though..</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought...but overall good product.</li>
            <li> A bit small but great product for a great price</li>
            <li> I really like this little pallette. It is very small but I find it good to cary in my purse. The colors are good if you want to wear makeup but without overdoing it. It helps keep the color on if you put a little bit of concealer on your eyelids before applying. The delivery was really fast too! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The colors are well pigmented and coordinate well together.  I&#x27;m not one for super dramatic eyes, so this works really nicely for me.  I&#x27;m sure that someone could ramp up the drama with this, however, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after it is possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the lip colors.  They&#x27;re lovely, light, and sheer.  I usually hate potted lip gloss, but these are okay - they&#x27;re well separated from the eyeshadow, so you don&#x27;t get chunks of shadow in your gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the size; if it were just a bit bigger, it would be easier to access.  My eyeshadow brush nearly fills the whole pan, so it&#x27;s harder than necessary to pick up product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had recently cleaned out my cosmetics and threw a lot of outdated items away.  Not wanting to spend a great deal of money replacing items I don&#x27;t use frequently, I decided to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this set and was very happy to see the photo was a true representation of the eye color palette.  The top three colors are matte; the remaining six are shimmery but it&#x27;s soft so I don&#x27;t feel like I just borrowed a glitter pen from my friend&#x27;s kid.  I do think the lip colors are a little off in the photo.  The pink on the right is closer to a carnation pink but that could just be me.  It mixes well with the other color so I use it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small. I mean really small.  If you folded a US dollar in half and placed the compact on top of it, the compact is smaller.  But I like it because it fits into any purse I own or can slip into a pocket with no problems.  The drawback is the applicators.  They are too tiny.  And I prefer brush applicators for everything so you can&#x27;t really get around needing to carry those and a mascara.  This particular set doesn&#x27;t include blusher but I can get around that.</li>
            <li> I love it! The colors are beautiful and i love this brand. NYX is really good, thanks. In Brasil is very expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge MAC eyeshadow fan...great pigmentation and lasts all day, even w/o a primer. When I heard about NYX, I thought there was no way it would rival my MAC eyeshadow. True - it&#x27;s not as good, but it&#x27;s a nice, cheaper alternative. I used this with a primer and had nice, 12 hour wear (even with my somewhat oily eyelids). The pigmentation was not as great, but like MAC - you could easily blend the colors. This won&#x27;t replace my MAC core colors, but when I want a nice, cheaper palette or some trendy colors I know I won&#x27;t wear next season, I&#x27;ll be buying NYX.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and stays on without caking</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this palate, however I&#x27;ve found that they don&#x27;t stay in place for as long as I would like. I should probably be using some kind of primer, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my oily eyelids that are to blame, but I&#x27;ve had other (also cheap) eye shadows stay in place a little longer. Still, I can&#x27;t complain too much, because this palate was a good deal and offers a good selection of pretty, subtle colors.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. She enjoys it &amp; was very happy with the colors. She doesn&#x27;t like anything but nude tones.</li>
            <li> I bought this intending to take it on my summer travels (it&#x27;s so small that it fits in the palm of your hand) but the colors are so great and natural looking I use it every day!  I am blonde / light skin / green eyes and all the colors are great - they blend easily and stay all day.  I am going to order the other color kits because I&#x27;m so happy with this.  Also, when I first looked at the lip gloss I was worried, but on the colors are also very nice and natural.  The lipgloss brings out the tan in your skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping this is a counterfeit product. I love NYX stuff, typically they are a cheap brand yes, but they have a very good quality for the price. This is super tiny. The lipstick/gloss is useless and the colors are not pigmented at all. You really have to pack on the color. Not the norm for NYX products. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this keeping in mind I would bring it on vacations. It&#x27;s small and compact but has great quality eye shadows and lip gloss. To be honest, when I first saw this, I thought they were blush colors, not lip gloss. None the less, this is still a great quality NYX product. I wish the shadows were a bit more pigmented, but all in all, this is a great product to pack for a day at the beach or on a weekend trip!</li>
            <li> Grand daughters lived them. Lots of variety. Nice case.</li>
            <li> This is a great product very pigmented, great quality and such lovely neutral colours for such a affordable price. It came earlier than expected. It was meant to come on the 14th but came on the 5th of June just in time give to my friend for her birthday!</li>
            <li> Great pigmentation! I usually use this for my travels! Will buy again</li>
            <li> I wanna find some product like this before. its small that can put in my bag easily and convenient. It also have enough colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do not like the lips stuff..but its ok i can ignore them.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s eyeshadow is not as good as other brands. The color does not stay long, and lipstick is very dry.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows had a great consistency and went on very nicely. Lovely colors and a very cheap alternative to the Naked Palettes. I&#x27;d recommend this!</li>
            <li> Go to eyeshadow for any eye color. Wet or dry, this eyeshadow glides on smoothly, pigment is beautiful, and its very blendable. 2nd purchase of this eyeshadow from Amazon, both times, arrived in perfect sealed condition. Thanks Amazon!</li>
