            <li>This mascar is really nice , it really is high impact .</li>
            <li>compre desde venezuela, original es pequeño</li>
            <li>You have to make sure the wand doesn&#x27;t have to much product on it</li>
            <li>I use it with one other mascara and it works great, no smudging or smearing.  </li>
            <li>QUICK</li>
            <li>It stays nicely on my eyes for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t come off easily by itself.</li>
            <li>I expected better, even cheap cheap mascara doesn&#x27;t give me those goopy strings anymore</li>

            <li>In general, I love the High Impact mascara.</li>
            <li>It does an alright job on lashes, very crisp and clear</li>
            <li>I prefer the small &#x27;sample&#x27; sizes (more like a deluxe sample, they last me 2-3 months</li>
            <li>Even its a Mini, it doesnt take too much to get the look you want either.</li>
            <li>It does not do enhance the eyelashes as much as it advertises.</li>
            <li>And it looks like I had too much on my eye.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively cheap compared to other high quality mascaras.</li>
            <li>I would try the sample size first before spending the money on the larger size.</li>
            <li>This is a natural looking mascara.</li>
            <li>I will stick to the Clinique naturally glossy mascara.</li>

            <li> I like that it was compact and intense black.  </li>
            <li> I buy some regular price makeup and get a whole bag of goodies, which usually includes this mascara.</li>
            <li> and I wear 1-2 coats of mascara a day) because they last just long enough til the brush starts to dry out.</li>
            <li> Bought this in the store and plan to stick with this mascara as long as I can get it!</li>
            <li> It also lasts for a very long time -- even the mini one.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s still wet</li>
            <li> I like , just thought it would be bigger, is small and helped me a lot to give volume to my lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of brands; this is not clumpy and does not end up under my eyes by mid-day as other brands do.</li>

            <li> so why does this expensive stuff do that?</li>
            <li> ...clumped like crazy.  </li>
            <li> ...too bad.</li>
            <li> This one at Amazon burns my eyes and smears so bad.</li>
            <li> (My worst part about mascara is when it gets all over my face during the day.)</li>

            <li> Do Not buy make up on Amazon.  It has given me multiple eye infections</li>
            <li> I like , just thought it would be bigger, is small and helped me a lot to give volume to my lashes</li>
            <li> very dry，like somebody used it before or it&#x27;s been stocked a long time after it produced. It&#x27;s not as good as I expect before.</li>
            <li> Item shows as delivered but it was not.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I prefer the small &#x27;sample&#x27; sizes (more like a deluxe sample, they last me 2-3 months and I wear 1-2 coats of mascara a day) because they last just long enough til the brush starts to dry out. I think they&#x27;re a better deal than the full size, which runs $16-17... Fast shipping &amp; great product! Definitely will purchase again!</li>

            <li> I really love this mascara! It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake off, and I have really small eyelashes and this really makes them look good. It&#x27;s relatively cheap compared to other high quality mascaras. I&#x27;d recommend this :)</li>
            <li> Nice and handy. Exactly what I wanted. No problems at all. Beautifull as all Clinique procducts.&lt;br /&gt;would order it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> It works nicely.  I use it with one other mascara and it works great, no smudging or smearing.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a natural looking mascara. If that is what you&#x27;re looking for, then look no further.</li>
            <li> i love this product... it&#x27;s amazine, I like this product because I suffer from allergies and is the only one that does not give me allergies in my eyes!</li>
            <li> Great mascara. I&#x27;ve tried lots of brands; this is not clumpy and does not end up under my eyes by mid-day as other brands do.</li>
            <li> surprisingly not impressed, it&#x27;s clumpy. I like Clinique and was glad to find this mini wand to carry along, but it is clumpy just like revlon or loreal&#x27;...too bad.</li>

I expected better, even cheap cheap mascara doesn&#x27;t give me those goopy strings anymore so why does this expensive stuff do that?</li>
            <li> Clinique is a great company. I can&#x27;t use a lot of their products though but this I can because it doesn&#x27;t bug my eyes like other mascaras. Even its a Mini, it doesnt take too much to get the look you want either. Great buy, for a GREAT price.</li>
            <li> I will stick to the Clinique naturally glossy mascara. This one was clumpy and irritated my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Think this must either be a counterfeit or just old...clumped like crazy.  I threw it out after one use...</li>
            <li> This mascar is really nice , it really is high impact . But very easy to clump . You have to make sure the wand doesn&#x27;t have to much product on it or else it will for sure clump</li>
            <li> The black is very dark which I love and I can get length , thickness and colour for my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product. Got here super fast.</li>

            <li> ძალიან კარგი ტუშია.წამწამებს კარგ მოცულობას აძლევს და კარგადაც აგრძელებს. დაბანისას ადვილად შორდება. რეკომენდაციას ვუწევ...ყველას გირჩევთ შეიძინოთ.  .სრულიად დაიმსახურა ხუთი ქულა. მიყვარს ეს ტუში</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara! I have sensitive eyes and this is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t bother me. It looks great on and doesn&#x27;t clump. Lashes are still soft after applying too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara</li>
            <li> great in small package</li>
            <li> recomendado 100% me encanto era lo que queria me riza las pestañas como lo esperaba, compre desde venezuela, original es pequeño</li>
            <li> AvERY VERY CUTE IT CAME QUICK AND WAS BOXED WELLI RECOMMEND TO ALL GoD BLESS + AND pEACE : )</li>
            <li> This mascara is perfect for me, it compliments my eyelashes wonderfully. I would not buy a different brand after using this one. You should give it a try, I highly doubt that you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my female friend. She was very happy. She said it is a good product</li>
            <li> my teenage daughter loves it, guess thats enough for any mother - buy it and try it. glad i did</li>
            <li> Great quality and great price without out having to go look&lt;br /&gt;for it!  This is my favorite mascara.  Always buy this.</li>
            <li> This mascara wand is great!  Separates lashes and coats well.  Perfect for find lashes.  I recomend this product in both the mini or regular size.</li>
            <li> Sucks really bad. Maybe the formula is off. I had one before at Macy&#x27;s. This one at Amazon burns my eyes and smears so bad.</li>
            <li> Love clinique. Bought this in the store and plan to stick with this mascara as long as I can get it!</li>
            <li> I like that it was compact and intense black.  The only thing is that it was runny. Like, I put it on and then it&#x27;s still wet and then I end up with it on my lower lid. It&#x27;s runny.  And it looks like I had too much on my eye.  Not sure how to explain it. So what I do is remove the excess, almost removing all the mascara from the brush.  If I don&#x27;t do that, it will run and it will look like I have racoon eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara often comes in gift bags (given by Clinique usually for purchases over $30.00). In general, I wait until Clinique has one of these bonuses (probably twice a yr.) I buy some regular price makeup and get a whole bag of goodies, which usually includes this mascara. In general, I love the High Impact mascara. It stays nicely on my eyes for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t come off easily by itself. (My worst part about mascara is when it gets all over my face during the day.) This mascara stays put. It also lasts for a very long time -- even the mini one. If you&#x27;re the type of person who throws out mascaras often due to bacteria contamination, then the mini should suit you perfectly.</li>
