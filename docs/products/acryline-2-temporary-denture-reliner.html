            <li>I too miss my beloved Denturite liners.  </li>
            <li>I had to use it twice to build up a good layer.</li>
            <li>Superior Shipping and service from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The product is great, easy to use, and I have used it every since I went to the dentist for a reline and was charged $135.00!  </li>
            <li>product is good but instructions need more  timing information on preparation</li>
            <li>works as good as what i used before, at a much better price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the acryline from the makers online and liked it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Acryline 2 has its own advantages-</li>
            <li>Acryline 2 is a good product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have used the original Denturite many times on mine and my wifes teeth with great results.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best temporary denture reliner that is on the market.</li>
            <li>or more - you&#x27;ll get the hang of it) before placing denture in mouth.  </li>
            <li>Ever since they quit making the Sea Bond DIY liner kit, this is the Very Next Best Product that I have been able to find.</li>
            <li>love this stuff have tried many others that didn&#x27;t work as well as</li>
            <li>I even buy it when I don&#x27;t need it , just to make sure I&#x27;ve got some around...</li>
            <li>love the comfort and feeling of security I get with this.</li>
            <li>It had been packed with 2 plastic packing balloons, but both were ON TOP of the box, no cushioning underneath to protect it in the mail.  </li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t been able to use all of what was ordered.  </li>
            <li>The Acryline worked OK.</li>
            <li>Great and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years with good success.</li>
            <li>but you might want to replace it more often than that</li>
            <li>but it is more of a temporary measure.</li>
            <li>Great product fast service</li>
            <li>If you can deal with that, like I said it works ok.  </li>
            <li>if anybody has been able to reduce the minty \\&quot;taste\\</li>
            <li>&quot; I would love to hear how you did it...</li>
            <li>My husband uses this product and he feels he can align his denture better than at the dentist</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re still as good as the first day they were relined.  </li>
            <li>the reliner works fine, and will order more as needed.</li>
            <li>I also have not used any adhesive since I have applied it to my dentures and it seems to make them fit much better.</li>
            <li>I have used all the relines kits available and I believe this is my favorite..</li>
            <li>a true blessing!</li>
            <li>It is not so easy to mix or spread.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and stays in place even through the cleanser soaking.</li>
            <li>easy to use and leaves</li>
            <li>That is, without spending a huge amount of money.</li>
            <li>Cheap and quality products.</li>
            <li>This product is just the thing for a denture that doesn&#x27;t fit correctly.  </li>
            <li>Use it all the time, fantastic item.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one that really works best for me.</li>
            <li>I an pretty happy with it so far...</li>
            <li>The reliner of the top denture, worked very well.</li>
            <li>If you have lose fitting dentures, I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>well as a good fix for loose dentures.</li>
            <li>some of the bottles were have full and some leaked, couldn&#x27;t get the right mixture to do it right</li>
            <li>Then gently place your teeth together in a manner that&#x27;s comfortable for you.  </li>
            <li>Came right on time.</li>
            <li>but they sent me a complete new set no charge really nice people.</li>
            <li>Cuz it&#x27;s better than nothing, but just barely.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to use, and feel like it makes my upper plate fit very well, never slides.</li>
            <li>Both times I&#x27;ve only been able to use 1. @</li>
            <li>This product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I am accustomed to first hand delivery to my door.  </li>
            <li>I will just have to rely on Cushion Grip till I can afford the real thing!</li>
            <li>its; basically the same as the store brand reliner kit walgreens sells-and the store brand is cheaper and there is usually a walgreens in your neighborhood-the best reline kit I have ever used-</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>have been fighting this stuff,m since I got it -  after a few days the rubber compresses and the fit it originally had goes away leading to a poorer fit, discomfort and some pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am amazed by the positive reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li>(The instructions are much better than the single sheet that comes with PermaSoft.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Made my old dentures fit like new again.</li>
            <li>This product works ok for fitting my upper plate better, but it is infused with some kind of weird \\&quot;mint\\&quot; flavoring that ruins the taste of everything I eat or drink.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks much  </li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>fast derlivery THANKS</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Following their directions, it only takes ten mminutes or so to reline  your dentures, and now they fit and feel 100% better.  </li>
            <li>The mixing tray they give you is so cheap and shallow that product easily spills over the side and an alcohol cleanup must follow.  </li>
            <li>just needs a little more in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Although I have been hesitant to clean them the way I would normally clean my dentures, putting them in a solution overnight, I have recently done this a few times and have seen no evidence of deterioration or damage.</li>
            <li>Now I will have to reorder and hope this doesn&#x27;t happen again, unfortunately it is not in the budget until next month.  </li>
            <li>, They fit tight, no complaints.</li>
            <li>Acryline most are gooey or hard making them a pain</li>
            <li>Husband will have to order twice as much to do both plates next time</li>
            <li>and it cures to a soft rubbery</li>
            <li>The reliner started pealing off after 3 days and was completely peeled off on day five.</li>
            <li>It is soft and keeps these temporary plates from hurting .  </li>
            <li>Perma Soft Denture Reliner Kit--Reline 2 Denture Plates]]</li>
            <li>Took me over 2 hours to clean up the mess on my hands in my mouth and my dentures.  </li>
            <li>Because my gums are old and relatively worn down, I was pleasantly surprised to have enough of the product available from one application!</li>
            <li>Overall, this was a quick fix for my problem dentures, but it leaves a rough surface that can be tolerated.</li>
            <li>The place I normally order from stop carrying this item and several that I checked had also.</li>
            <li>which is what they&#x27;d likely do if you went there complaining about their fit--that or wanting you to get an entirely new set of dentures</li>
            <li>The reason I is because the Acryline is too soft and the pro soft turns really hard by mixing them they turn out just right and last about 8months thank you</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to use it at first because I didn&#x27;t want it to ruin my teeth</li>
            <li>If you will also need a deeper fill, alow extra time for it to set, to firm up, before inserting and you will have less waste and a good experience as well.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this product, I was surprised at the price, since WalMart carried it for a long time at 1/2 that.  </li>
            <li>The product was fine but one liquid bottle was broken during shipment</li>

            <li> Highly recommend to anyone with bad fitting dentures like mine.</li>
            <li> I mix the ProSoft half and half with Acryline 2 the first one I got one of the glass bottles</li>
            <li> Last but not least, this stuff gets as hard as a rock after a relatively short time.  </li>
            <li> In my experience denture adhesives like Fixadent don&#x27;t adhere to this product so it is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I am going back to the other company that I ordered from on Amazon.</li>
            <li> not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It does keep them from slipping and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit, so my problem with loose dentures might be helped.</li>
            <li> This is not easy to use nor is it long lasting.</li>
            <li> I did the same procedure for the bottom, but it did not hold as tight.</li>
            <li> When I mix the second batch, I will use one of my little ceramic dishes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product and tried it this morning with absolutely no results at all.  </li>
            <li> Then carefully spoon material onto denture.  </li>
            <li> This time I was surprised to open my door to one of the neighborhood kids holding MY PACKAGE that had been torn open, the child said, &amp;#34;Daddy told me to bring this to you and to tell you he was sorry to have opened it, but he was expecting a package so he didn&#x27;t check to see whom it was addressed to&amp;#34;, then the kid got on their bike and rode off.  </li>
            <li> Not as stated, this is not for partial plates containing metal, yet it does not say so in the info page, trying to return product</li>
            <li> Could not get it to turn pink like it has before.</li>
            <li> But 1 of the liquid bottles is empty.</li>
            <li> One of the vials was empty.</li>
            <li> Just a warning to women with nail polish on - wear rubber gloves when using this, the product gets all over your nails and damages your polish and is then difficult to get off.&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest lining your sink with paper towel, it&#x27;s greasy and not easy to clean the sink afterwards, and you also don&#x27;t want bits of acrylic getting into your drain</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going out to try one of the other liner kits in hopes of finding something to make life with dentures bearable again.</li>
            <li> i lined mine over a year ago and the liner is still holding up pretty well like all products of this nature it will taste and feel weird for a couple of days</li>
            <li> The reason for the poor rating is that I feel it was not done with the professionalism that is normal.  </li>
            <li> There are other denture reliners on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of reliners, but they&#x27;re inferior to this product.  </li>
            <li> The 1st time I thought it was a fluke, the 2nd time I wrote a complaint letter asking for remedy.</li>
            <li> Just keep stirring the muck until it begins to hold together sorta like firm pudding.  </li>
            <li> A MESS!    </li>
            <li> I had trouble finding it in the drug store, by luck at Amazon!</li>
            <li> The cap-like that one is to use for mixing the two substances is too small, when I tried to mix the two,  some of it seeped over the edge.  </li>
            <li> Acryline 2 has the most horrible taste I have ever tasted.</li>
            <li> The product works for a temporary reline if not able to get an appointment at a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Also could be used for a temporary repair.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging - One of the glass vials containing the liquid broke in transit, made a mess &amp; wasted 1 usage.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bite hard or goop will squeeze out everywhere.    </li>
            <li> However when I went to the dentist they had a hard time getting it off my dentures.</li>
            <li> I have tried soaking them over night, brushing them with baking soda and sucking on hard candy</li>
            <li> recliner.that sucks</li>
            <li> And the lining will be so thin you&#x27;ll need to do it again in a few days.  </li>
            <li> No more using goop to hold them in!</li>
            <li> It even works on my broken dentures that are superglued together... ...</li>
            <li> When it arrived, everything it there was broken.  </li>
            <li> Agree the taste is horrible,  I have soaked my in several baths of denture cleanser, which helped.  </li>
            <li> , that can be quite expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great! This id the best product on the market!!!!</li>
            <li> This works really great for a softer liner. Made my old dentures fit like new again. No more using goop to hold them in!</li>
            <li> I have used the original Denturite many times on mine and my wifes teeth with great results.  I purchased this product and tried it this morning with absolutely no results at all.  Took me over 2 hours to clean up the mess on my hands in my mouth and my dentures.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> just needs a little more in the bottle. Husband will have to order twice as much to do both plates next time</li>
            <li> I too miss my beloved Denturite liners.  Needed SOMETHING for my lowers so tried Acryline2.  VERY EXPENSIVE!  Poor packaging - One of the glass vials containing the liquid broke in transit, made a mess &amp; wasted 1 usage.    If you get the product, whatever you do, DON&#x27;T follow the directions! DO NOT pour immediately into dentures &amp; immediately place dentures in mouth.  WHAT A MESS!    I&#x27;ve got over 25 years&#x27; experience relining my lower plate so please believe me when I tell you to wait about 30 seconds after mixing.  Just keep stirring the muck until it begins to hold together sorta like firm pudding.  Then carefully spoon material onto denture.  Wait another 30 to 45 seconds (or more - you&#x27;ll get the hang of it) before placing denture in mouth.  Then gently place your teeth together in a manner that&#x27;s comfortable for you.  Don&#x27;t bite hard or goop will squeeze out everywhere.    If you follow the package directions, you&#x27;ll end up with sticky strands of goo all over your teeth, lips, fingers ... blah!  And the lining will be so thin you&#x27;ll need to do it again in a few days.  Last but not least, this stuff gets as hard as a rock after a relatively short time.  So, why did I even give it 2 stars?  Cuz it&#x27;s better than nothing, but just barely.  Now I&#x27;m going out to try one of the other liner kits in hopes of finding something to make life with dentures bearable again.</li>
            <li> Works very well. It is a substitute to getting into the dentist. I had trouble finding it in the drug store, by luck at Amazon!</li>
            <li> Ever since they quit making the Sea Bond DIY liner kit, this is the Very Next Best Product that I have been able to find. That is, without spending a huge amount of money. Would (&amp; do) recommend this product to friends &amp; family.</li>
            <li> the product didn&#x27;t come with a container to mix it in. I notified the company and they said they don&#x27;t send a container with it. I am going back to the other company that I ordered from on Amazon. You get what you pay for !!!</li>
            <li> The cap-like that one is to use for mixing the two substances is too small, when I tried to mix the two,  some of it seeped over the edge.  When I mix the second batch, I will use one of my little ceramic dishes.  Agree the taste is horrible,  I have soaked my in several baths of denture cleanser, which helped.  Doubt I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Acryline2 from America RX twice. Acryline2 definately alters the taste &amp; smell of everything for the 1st fews days. But I have become acustomed to the difference. Seems to be an issue working the bubbles out of the mixture. Both shipments I received from AmericaRX was damaged. The 1st time I thought it was a fluke, the 2nd time I wrote a complaint letter asking for remedy. You receive 2 applications in each box. Both times I&#x27;ve only been able to use 1. @ $20 a box, that can be quite expensive. I wrote the company on Jan 4. It is now the 18th. The auto response says an answer within 72hrs. I have yet to receive anything. I think I&#x27;ve been blown off. I will seek another company to order from. I&#x27;ll find out if the problem lies within AmericaRX or Acryline2.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit, so my problem with loose dentures might be helped. The reliner of the top denture, worked very well. I did the same procedure for the bottom, but it did not hold as tight. Overall, this was a quick fix for my problem dentures, but it leaves a rough surface that can be tolerated. Thank you for this product as it will help until I can have it done by a dentist.</li>
            <li> Came right on time. Cheap and quality products. Thanks much  Now I&#x27;m just filling the required ammount of words for this stupid review</li>
            <li> love this stuff have tried many others that didn&#x27;t work as well as Acryline most are gooey or hard making them a pain</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for temporary fixes ....It even works on my broken dentures that are superglued together... ...You can&#x27;t beat it . I even buy it when I don&#x27;t need it , just to make sure I&#x27;ve got some around...</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well. It is not so easy to mix or spread. I have used it for a month now and have no complaints. I also have not used any adhesive since I have applied it to my dentures and it seems to make them fit much better. Although I have been hesitant to clean them the way I would normally clean my dentures, putting them in a solution overnight, I have recently done this a few times and have seen no evidence of deterioration or damage. I an pretty happy with it so far...I hope it lasts the amount of time it states it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times and it saves a trip to the dentist and the expense of getting your teeth relined.I have dental insurance and of course it doesn&#x27;t cover relining. but this stuff saves money and a trip</li>
            <li> I am amazed by the positive reviews for this product.  In my experience denture adhesives like Fixadent don&#x27;t adhere to this product so it is a complete waste of money.  The mixing tray they give you is so cheap and shallow that product easily spills over the side and an alcohol cleanup must follow.  The setup time is really short, maybe 15 seconds so you have to use it immediately and it cures to a soft rubbery consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would never buy this again and the reviews are misleading for this terrible product.</li>
            <li> I think I have tried all the products on the market to try and get my teeth to stay in and nothing works as well as this product. I was a little hesitant to use it at first because I didn&#x27;t want it to ruin my teeth but it didn&#x27;t. As a matter of fact it is very easy to use. Just follow directions. If you don&#x27;t like it you can remove it. But I have not had to remove it since I put it on. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> tasted bad didnn&#x27;t leave until cleaned off</li>
            <li> Works really well I mix the ProSoft half and half with Acryline 2 the first one I got one of the glass bottles was broke but they sent me a complete new set no charge really nice people. The reason I is because the Acryline is too soft and the pro soft turns really hard by mixing them they turn out just right and last about 8months thank you</li>
            <li> This product is just the thing for a denture that doesn&#x27;t fit correctly.  It is easy to use and stays in place even through the cleanser soaking.</li>
            <li> Just a warning to women with nail polish on - wear rubber gloves when using this, the product gets all over your nails and damages your polish and is then difficult to get off.&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest lining your sink with paper towel, it&#x27;s greasy and not easy to clean the sink afterwards, and you also don&#x27;t want bits of acrylic getting into your drain hole.&lt;br /&gt;For the bottom dentures - I had to use it twice to build up a good layer. Let it set for about 10 seconds longer than the package suggests, pour it into the bottom denture and let it sit for another 10 or so seconds before putting it in your mouth, or it will pour out into your lower jaw.</li>
            <li> I have been using Acryline for 35 years and nothing else does the job like this product,&lt;br /&gt;I love the comfort and feeling of security I get with this.</li>
            <li> this product takes the place of going to the dentist in a hurry.  It works as described. will buy again</li>
            <li> i lined mine over a year ago and the liner is still holding up pretty well like all products of this nature it will taste and feel weird for a couple of days but as it dries and cures it goes away</li>
            <li> I do not like have to go to dentist every 6 months to get dentures relined . prefer to do them myself . This product is great . I reline about every 5 months myself at home . I tried other brands and the taste was awful  . These have an after taste but not as bad as others . And it only takes a couple soakings and its gone .</li>
            <li> The product is great, easy to use, and I have used it every since I went to the dentist for a reline and was charged $135.00!  The reason for the poor rating is that I feel it was not done with the professionalism that is normal.  I am accustomed to first hand delivery to my door.  This time I was surprised to open my door to one of the neighborhood kids holding MY PACKAGE that had been torn open, the child said, &amp;#34;Daddy told me to bring this to you and to tell you he was sorry to have opened it, but he was expecting a package so he didn&#x27;t check to see whom it was addressed to&amp;#34;, then the kid got on their bike and rode off.  I FEEL SO VIOLATED!!!  Now I will have to reorder and hope this doesn&#x27;t happen again, unfortunately it is not in the budget until next month.  I will just have to rely on Cushion Grip till I can afford the real thing!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I was surprised at the price, since WalMart carried it for a long time at 1/2 that.  then I ordered it anyway, thinking maybe it was bigger or something.  When it arrived, everything it there was broken.  It had been packed with 2 plastic packing balloons, but both were ON TOP of the box, no cushioning underneath to protect it in the mail.  Why wasn&#x27;t wrapped in bubble wrap, or in those cornstarch packing peanuts?  then to add insult to injury, it cost me $4.00 to send it back!  I&#x27;ll stick to ordering books.</li>
            <li> Acryline 2 has the most horrible taste I have ever tasted. The taste lasted longer than the reliner lasted. The reliner started pealing off after 3 days and was completely peeled off on day five.</li>
            <li> Great will buy it  again. fast derlivery THANKS</li>
            <li> The product was fine but one liquid bottle was broken during shipment so I haven&#x27;t been able to use all of what was ordered.  Acryline 2 is a good product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Superior Shipping and service from Amazon.  Acryline-2  works as advertised.  Would have made 5 stars if it lasted just a bit longer for economy reasons.  But I tend to be overly thrifty.  Still the best choice out there.</li>
            <li> product is good but instructions need more  timing information on preparation</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mind paying for something that works well..especially if it fits i my mailbox&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to re-order the shampoo without difficulty.</li>
            <li> the reliner works fine, and will order more as needed.</li>
            <li> Not as stated, this is not for partial plates containing metal, yet it does not say so in the info page, trying to return product</li>
            <li> The product works for a temporary reline if not able to get an appointment at a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Also could be used for a temporary repair.</li>
            <li> There are other denture reliners on the market. I have used/tried them all. This is the only one that really works best for me. Highly recommend to anyone with bad fitting dentures like mine.</li>
            <li> Have been using this stuff for years! Works great!</li>
            <li> its; basically the same as the store brand reliner kit walgreens sells-and the store brand is cheaper and there is usually a walgreens in your neighborhood-the best reline kit I have ever used-and I have used lots of different brands-is sensi-dent which I ordered from one of the catalog only companies. not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This stuff had horrible smell I could not get rid of had to trow it away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of reliners, but they&#x27;re inferior to this product.  Following their directions, it only takes ten mminutes or so to reline  your dentures, and now they fit and feel 100% better.  It&#x27;s been about a week since I put the relined dentures to work and they&#x27;re still as good as the first day they were relined.  If you had your dentures relined by your dentist--which is what they&#x27;d likely do if you went there complaining about their fit--that or wanting you to get an entirely new set of dentures--you&#x27;d be out 2-4 hundred dollars, likely.  I&#x27;m no dentist, but this seems the way to go.</li>
            <li> Could not get it to turn pink like it has before. Might be an accelarater problem, any way i could not use it.</li>
            <li> The Acryline worked OK. When I received the package there were2 bottles of powder and 2 bottles liquid. But 1 of the liquid bottles is empty. So I will only get 1 recliner.that sucks</li>
            <li> This is not easy to use nor is it long lasting. However when I went to the dentist they had a hard time getting it off my dentures.</li>
            <li> Great and fast shipping</li>
            <li> it is easy to use, and feel like it makes my upper plate fit very well, never slides. i am very happy with it. thank you</li>
            <li> the taste is horrible and would not go away I soaked it in baking soda over and over again Taste like I was eating fake finger nails</li>
            <li> This is the only way to go when you don&#x27;t have insurance to take care of your dentures., You do have to do it again but that is only time. Thanks</li>
            <li> works as good as what i used before, at a much better price.&lt;br /&gt;works well as a good fix for loose dentures. would order again.</li>
            <li> This product, like others allows one to add a rubber payer to one&#x27;s dentures&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been fighting this stuff,m since I got it -  after a few days the rubber compresses and the fit it originally had goes away leading to a poorer fit, discomfort and some pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to buy this stuff again.</li>
            <li> One of the vials was empty. Could not use. have been using your product for years, this batch flaked and did not stay in.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best temporary denture reliner that is on the market. I have used it for many years with good success.</li>
            <li> I bought the acryline from the makers online and liked it.  It is soft and keeps these temporary plates from hurting .  I recently stopped at Walgreen and they had a product for denture relining that they compare to acryline.  The price was $5.59 per box which contains an application for an upper and one for the lower.  I must say this is stickier than reline it but the same as acryline 2,  but when placed  in water,  the stickiness goes away.  I have used all the relines kits available and I believe this is my favorite..</li>
            <li> I have used both Acryline 2 and PermaSoft- if you are looking for something like a $305 chairside reline at the dentist office PermaSoft is what you want. It can last up to 2 years but you might want to replace it more often than that if the dentures are no longer comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acryline 2 has its own advantages- if your dentures need some cushioning it works well for that since it is softer than PermaSoft but it is more of a temporary measure. (The instructions are much better than the single sheet that comes with PermaSoft.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00158J0EI Perma Soft Denture Reliner Kit--Reline 2 Denture Plates]]</li>
            <li> Great product fast service</li>
            <li> This product works ok for fitting my upper plate better, but it is infused with some kind of weird \\&quot;mint\\&quot; flavoring that ruins the taste of everything I eat or drink. I have tried soaking them over night, brushing them with baking soda and sucking on hard candy but the bad taste persists. If you can deal with that, like I said it works ok.  if anybody has been able to reduce the minty \\&quot;taste\\&quot; I would love to hear how you did it...</li>
            <li> Because my gums are old and relatively worn down, I was pleasantly surprised to have enough of the product available from one application! If you will also need a deeper fill, alow extra time for it to set, to firm up, before inserting and you will have less waste and a good experience as well.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product and he feels he can align his denture better than at the dentist, They fit tight, no complaints.</li>
            <li> A great item and I had a difficult time obtaining. The place I normally order from stop carrying this item and several that I checked had also. I was very happy to see &amp;#34;no worrys from Amazon&amp;#34;.....a true blessing!</li>
            <li> some of the bottles were have full and some leaked, couldn&#x27;t get the right mixture to do it right</li>
            <li> If you have lose fitting dentures, I highly recommend this.  It does keep them from slipping and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. When it arrived the liquid had leaked out of the bottles.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time, fantastic item.  Reasonably priced and worth every penny.  I use it probably three time a year and recently bought extras so as not to caught short when needed.  easy to use and leaves no after taste.</li>
            <li> Worked just like it was supposed to This was my 3rd time ordering and using and will order it again when needed.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Since the denturite has been discontinued it is the closest product that you can purchase that even compares to the quality.</li>
