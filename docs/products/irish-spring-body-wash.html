            <li> Even after a long 14 hour days I can still smell the scent of this body wash.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and smells like typical Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way to make lots of foamy cleaner for your body.</li>
            <li> Some customers have argued this is a moisturizing soap, let me tell you, it is anything but moisturizing, as a matter of fact, my skin has become worse after using this product, it leaves your body feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Irish Spring .. too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with Jameson and a leprechaun.</li>

            <li> My husband likes to use this body wash during his showers.  The price was good, and it should last him for many showers.</li>
            <li> The soap is fine but I will never buy it online again.  When it got to me there was body wash all over everything in the box.  I was irate.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice.  A little goes a long way to make lots of foamy cleaner for your body.</li>
            <li> We love the fragrance. We started ordering from Amazon rather than the stores. Nice to have it delivered to the house.</li>
