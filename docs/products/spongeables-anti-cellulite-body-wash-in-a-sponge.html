            <li>I was really looking forward to this product - it does smell wonderful, and scuffs off the bottom of my feet quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Okay, I will be honest.</li>
            <li>It smells great too and the soap is just right-</li>
            <li>I love these things...</li>
            <li>I like body sponged with soap in them :)&lt;</li>
            <li>has a nice light grapefruit smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;Anti</li>
            <li>but I use olay bodywash with it.i love this damn spongable.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more ðŸ˜†</li>
            <li>AT TJ MAXX MUCH MORE INEXPENSIVE ($4.99 +TAX</li>
            <li>I love the shape of the sponge and</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Like it :)</li>
            <li>use it for more than the 20 washes recommended.</li>
            <li>They last along time &amp; have a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>The only cons I found in this almot perfect item.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>You will feel a difference in the softness and suppleness  of your skin more and more each day after just one use.</li>
            <li>The lather is creamy and plentiful for quite a while before it starts to diminish and the scent is refreshing but not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these spongeables.  </li>
            <li>Have been using them for over a year, and have also gifted many to friends and family.  </li>
            <li>This is nothing more than the title of my review.  </li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend asked if I had been working out more because my butt area looked firmer.</li>
            <li>I have already gone through 5 and just purchsed 3 more.</li>
            <li>The smell is great too and it also a good exfoliator for dry patches.</li>
            <li>I love the light scent of grape fruit.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!!!</li>
            <li>i like this so far, it just works as a good exfoliator and nothing more.</li>
            <li>Still getting a great larger</li>
            <li>It is important to me that these are cruelty free.</li>
            <li>And for as cheap as it is, I will continue to buy it, and recommend to it to friends and family</li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very, very sweet and fresh.</li>
            <li>I first fell in love with the foot scrubs---</li>
            <li>If you are interested in riding yourself of cellulite, better to try diet...</li>
            <li>not too drying but still gets you clean.</li>
            <li>and although I felt clean.</li>
            <li>Good as a simple scrubbing sponge thou.</li>
            <li>I love how much foam it makes.</li>
            <li>One side of it is soft and nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they do anything to reduce my cellulite, but I love these handy, little bath sponges that can be used over and over again.</li>
            <li>Smell is also great, haven&#x27;t tried The green one yet.</li>
            <li>Skin feels so fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>It does good job for cleaning but not very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>In general, I definitely have noticed a difference, and I also love that as a double this product is a great exfoliant for the skin.</li>
            <li>Lathers perfectly, scrubbing side is just the right amount of roughness to exfoliate without being too harsh, and it lasts a lot longer than the advertised 20 washes if you let it dry between uses and protect it from water when not being used.</li>
            <li>FIRST</li>
            <li>I NOTICED IMPROVEMENT BY THE FIRST SPONGE..</li>
            <li>Really like it but time will tell if it helps my cellulite!</li>
            <li>It has made my skin so soft, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this little sponge.</li>
            <li>They feel good and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>BUT, it really irritates my &amp;#34;privates&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li>It looks very comfy</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES WORK..</li>
            <li>I really like spongeables products.  </li>
            <li>I really believe it is working to reduce my cellulite .</li>
            <li>As I desperately fight the effects of aging, this soaped-up buff puff is a great find!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it since January and can really see the difference!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Some of the foam got in and really burned and caused an unfortable itch.</li>
            <li>Besides that it lathers so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this sponge</li>
            <li>But they work really well on my feet.</li>
            <li>These sponges actually really work to reduce the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>but seems to dry my skin out more than normal, but I have lotion and a moisturizing gel to combat that problem.</li>
            <li>It is super-packed with a pink grapefruit scented soap, and it sloughs away the top layers of dead skin to leave a lovely result.  </li>
            <li>I really had no expectations in that area as this sort of topical solution rarely does anything in my experience to fat/cellulite ...</li>
            <li>Both the Pink and Green ones smell amazing!</li>
            <li>I love these but not sure its really working on my cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without my spongeables.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The dual surface makes it an all purpose body sponge; soft side for gentle cleansing and a loofa like side for more serious scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>Good body scrubber not sure if it actually works on cellulite only time will tell</li>
            <li>and the grapefruit in this product clear it up</li>
            <li>I cannot use this product, as it accidentally gets where I don&#x27;t want it, and I have to use a sensitive soap (Olay) on that area.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after using this in the shower.</li>
            <li>good product but too expensive for only one week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>Generally it is a sponge with a cleansing compound built in.</li>
            <li>Shape of the sponge is hard to hold in smaller hands like mine and slips out easily.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My skin is so soft after using this in the shower.</li>
            <li> good product but too expensive for only one week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Generally it is a sponge with a cleansing compound built in.</li>
            <li> Shape of the sponge is hard to hold in smaller hands like mine and slips out easily.</li>
            <li> It smells incedible and after following the instructions in the shower, my skin feels so soft and firm.</li>
            <li> Lasts so long!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard on the touch at first, so I had to soak it in water for a litlte bit to soften.</li>
            <li> Have been using for several times and ,last order, the sponge turned black after a few tines.  </li>
            <li> I always get the Zest Pink Pepper for cellulite.  </li>
            <li> You do have to keep using it though or the rough patches and cellulite will return.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it actually does anything for cellulite...</li>
            <li> Therefore, I only use the sponge daily for a week before I feel like it is too icky to use which is less than half of the advertised &amp;</li>
            <li> but actually when I use it, I feel hard and rough.</li>
            <li> complaint is that it is difficult to rinse it adequately without squeezing out all of the soap and, because it can&#x27;t be hung anywhere to dry out, it has to sit in some water no matter how I store it.  </li>
            <li> And the other a little scratchy.</li>
            <li> since I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a little too scratchy for my liking.</li>
            <li> It may be a little painful to scrub with, but worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> waste of money..just buy cellulite cream and skip this</li>
            <li> Exfoliates dead skin.</li>
            <li> What a pointless product.</li>
            <li> as there is no magic cure.</li>
            <li> I had a Rash  on my lower legs that was hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I hardly have any now.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not work, it also is painful and dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> ) THIS IS A MUST PRODUCT IF YOU ARE REALLY SERIOUS, MUST BE PATIENT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely addicted to them.</li>
            <li> That makes it an expensive option for showering.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the scent is not detectable.</li>
            <li> its up to me to lose that nasty stuff...</li>

            <li> I love these things... Not sure if it actually does anything for cellulite...I really had no expectations in that area as this sort of topical solution rarely does anything in my experience to fat/cellulite ...but regardless...maybe it does help with cellulite/maybe not...  Who cares this is an amazing body wash product! Lathers perfectly, scrubbing side is just the right amount of roughness to exfoliate without being too harsh, and it lasts a lot longer than the advertised 20 washes if you let it dry between uses and protect it from water when not being used. It smells great too and the soap is just right- not too drying but still gets you clean. I buy these as presents to that&#x27;s how great they are!  The pedi one is amazing too! (great travel size as well)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!! And work great!!</li>
            <li> I LUV this product! It smells incedible and after following the instructions in the shower, my skin feels so soft and firm. In fact, after a couple of weeks, I lost a bunch of cellulite from my thighs!!! It&#x27;s amazing! And I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I like body sponged with soap in them :)&lt;br /&gt;This has a nice light grapefruit smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;Anti cellulite..... hmmm..... its up to me to lose that nasty stuff...&lt;br /&gt;I like the product tho</li>
            <li> I had a Rash  on my lower legs that was hard to get rid of. and the grapefruit in this product clear it up and it&#x27;s gone. no creams or ointments on the market cleared it up until I thought to myself what if I use this product and bam it was gone over time. even, thru it was not made to do this. also, this amazing product tones your skin up if you have slacking skin anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge, it exfoliates my skin perfectly, my skin feels like baby skin. The smell is perfect, it always smells good, after so many uses the soap runs out but I use olay bodywash with it.i love this damn spongable. I just ordered more ðŸ˜†</li>
            <li> I have  been using this sponge for a couple weeks now. I love it so much!!! Still getting a great larger and I have definitely noticed a reduction in cellulite.</li>
            <li> NICE SMELL AND WORKS GOOD IN CELLULITE</li>
            <li> I LOVE their products!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, feels great and lathers beautifully. Smell is also great, haven&#x27;t tried The green one yet. Just plce another order of thus.</li>
            <li> This anti-cellulite  scrub works fantastically to help trim and tone while diet &amp; exercise still are necessary. Mrs. J. Caiazzo</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product - it does smell wonderful, and scuffs off the bottom of my feet quite nicely. BUT, it really irritates my &amp;#34;privates&amp;#34;. I cannot use this product, as it accidentally gets where I don&#x27;t want it, and I have to use a sensitive soap (Olay) on that area. So, why use two soaps? I was trying to replace the Olay, but this isn&#x27;t the product to do that. Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> These are a must-have in my house! I don&#x27;t know if they do anything to reduce my cellulite, but I love these handy, little bath sponges that can be used over and over again.</li>
            <li> These things are the best!! Lasts so long!</li>
            <li> It looks very comfy but actually when I use it, I feel hard and rough. It does good job for cleaning but not very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES WORK.. DONT BUY HERE. LOOK FOR IT FIRST AT TJ MAXX MUCH MORE INEXPENSIVE ($4.99 +TAX) THIS IS A MUST PRODUCT IF YOU ARE REALLY SERIOUS, MUST BE PATIENT YOUR RESULTS MAY VARY... I NOTICED IMPROVEMENT BY THE FIRST SPONGE.. IM ON MY 2ND.</li>
            <li> I really like spongeables products.  They contain good soaps and emollients. I don&#x27;t think this has value as anti-cellulite product, but wasn&#x27;t looking for that anyway. They feel good and last a long time.  It is important to me that these are cruelty free. I&#x27;ve given several to family &amp; friends who like them too.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on these things.  I love the shape of the sponge and the soap is really good. This thing last a lon time.</li>
            <li> Good body scrubber not sure if it actually works on cellulite only time will tell</li>
            <li> What a pointless product. Not only does it not work, it also is painful and dried out my skin. Will not buy again and recommend you save your money.</li>
            <li> but seems to dry my skin out more than normal, but I have lotion and a moisturizing gel to combat that problem.</li>
            <li> Bought this product in Hawaii and now bought it again from amazon. I really believe it is working to reduce my cellulite .</li>
            <li> Really like it but time will tell if it helps my cellulite!</li>
            <li> As I desperately fight the effects of aging, this soaped-up buff puff is a great find!  It is super-packed with a pink grapefruit scented soap, and it sloughs away the top layers of dead skin to leave a lovely result.  Glad I latched onto this one!</li>
            <li> Have been using for several times and ,last order, the sponge turned black after a few tines.  I should have contacted Amazon because they are Terrific.  But life interferes. And would not reorder.</li>
            <li> good product, will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> i like this so far, it just works as a good exfoliator and nothing more.</li>
            <li> Okay, I will be honest. I have been using this product majority of the time every time I shower, but I have not been taking pictures and comparing before and after cellulite detection. In general, I definitely have noticed a difference, and I also love that as a double this product is a great exfoliant for the skin. And for as cheap as it is, I will continue to buy it, and recommend to it to friends and family</li>
            <li> Shape of the sponge is hard to hold in smaller hands like mine and slips out easily. Good scrub though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I always get the Zest Pink Pepper for cellulite.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and I can&#x27;t imagine a shower without it.  Although I also use a anti-cellulite lotion, I do feel this zest sponge has helped smoothed my tush and thighs.  It also helps folliculitis which I&#x27;ve had on my thighs etc... since I was a little girl.  The scent is very, very sweet and fresh.</li>
            <li> Really good for cellulite</li>
            <li> this smells great.  however I don&#x27;t see any change in cellulite...does not work...waste of money..just buy cellulite cream and skip this</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell. Like it :)</li>
            <li> My niece recommended this product. I have been using it since January and can really see the difference!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it for more than the 20 washes recommended.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this ! Love the smell and how it makes my skin feel ! I use the scrubber side when i need to exfoliate for self tanner</li>
            <li> It wont do what it says. Good as a simple scrubbing sponge thou.</li>
            <li> I first fell in love with the foot scrubs--- I&#x27;m completely addicted to them. So, I thought I&#x27;d try the cellulite sponges. I don&#x27;t know how legitimate the claim is (to reduce noticeable cellulite), but I do know these sponges are wonderful. They last along time &amp; have a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I love these but not sure its really working on my cellulite.  Its a great loofah and lathers up well.</li>
            <li> Hope it works, too soon to tell but it is wonderful to use and I feel sure it is going to help all the dimples</li>
            <li> I use this product every day. I love it! Both the Pink and Green ones smell amazing! I have being using them for like 5 months now and I can&#x27;t shower withouth them. They do everything that the label says. It has made my skin so soft, smooth and silky. I did notice, it reduce my cellulite a lot. I hardly have any now. The scrubbing side gives me a soothing massage while it cleanses and exfoliates. I can&#x27;t live without my spongeables. I just order 10 can&#x27;t I don&#x27;t want to ever run out. The only cons I found in this almot perfect item. Is that be careful using it near your privates. Some of the foam got in and really burned and caused an unfortable itch. Besides that it lathers so much. I love how much foam it makes. No sponge compares to this ones. I have thrown away all my sponges, mesh sponge, foam sponge, and loofah. I did the comparison of using my loofah with Aveeno body wash and although I felt clean. I can tell the difference when I washed with the spongeables. Your skin immediately feels so soothing. Love, love, love this product. Buy it. You will love it too!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful! I love the light scent of grape fruit. You will feel a difference in the softness and suppleness  of your skin more and more each day after just one use. You do have to keep using it though or the rough patches and cellulite will return. My skin looks, feels and smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  Let me explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;The dual surface makes it an all purpose body sponge; soft side for gentle cleansing and a loofa like side for more serious scrubbing.  The lather is creamy and plentiful for quite a while before it starts to diminish and the scent is refreshing but not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is that it is difficult to rinse it adequately without squeezing out all of the soap and, because it can&#x27;t be hung anywhere to dry out, it has to sit in some water no matter how I store it.  I&#x27;ve tried a variety of soap dishes and none of them satisfactorily &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; the sponge between uses.  Therefore, I only use the sponge daily for a week before I feel like it is too icky to use which is less than half of the advertised &amp;#34;20 uses&amp;#34;.  That makes it an expensive option for showering.  I don&#x27;t think it would work to reduce cellulite but that&#x27;s not what I bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, good product but too expensive for only one week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Love these spongeables.  Have been using them for over a year, and have also gifted many to friends and family.  Skin feels so fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I use these on my arms and legs. But they work really well on my feet. My skin is so soft after using this in the shower. Exfoliates dead skin. It may be a little painful to scrub with, but worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> Generally it is a sponge with a cleansing compound built in. It&#x27;s a little hard on the touch at first, so I had to soak it in water for a litlte bit to soften. It acts just like a sponge with soap. One side of it is soft and nice. And the other a little scratchy. Maybe a little too scratchy for my liking. It exfoliates well through. I can&#x27;t attest for anti-cellulite purposes of this product, but exfoliating part probably helps circulation some. I would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am always on a quest to find soap products with a grapefruit scent.  I was hoping this product would fit the bill.  Unfortunately the scent is not detectable. This is nothing more than the title of my review.  If you are interested in riding yourself of cellulite, better to try diet...as there is no magic cure.</li>
            <li> These sponges actually really work to reduce the appearance of cellulite. Even my boyfriend asked if I had been working out more because my butt area looked firmer. The smell is great too and it also a good exfoliator for dry patches. I have already gone through 5 and just purchsed 3 more. Very pleased with this little sponge.</li>
