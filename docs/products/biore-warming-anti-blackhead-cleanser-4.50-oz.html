            <li>A really good product.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s good marketing that makes you buy.</li>
            <li>The delivery was on time and the product quality is good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it did a good job cleaning away pore-clogging dirt as I would have expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>Feels good after use.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s this stubborn place on my chin that always seemed resistant to being cleaned, and this cleanser has done good results on that area already.</li>

            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Product smells amazing and warms immediately when on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i used it soon as it arrived and it works amazingly well</li>
            <li>It is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>Really amazing product, can do beyond what I paid.</li>
            <li>Made my face feel AMAZING ....</li>
            <li>The warming sensation in the mornings feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice feel.</li>
            <li>I apply it to, because I credit the the nice glow my skin gets from it to the heat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d just be nice not to have to apply over and over again to get the warming sensation...</li>
            <li>gets warm as stated but does not do anything for cleaning your face or helping with blackheads</li>
            <li>but it sure does feel good</li>
            <li>the heat adds a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received some nice things through the Amazon Vine review program, this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received some nice things through the Amazon review program, this is one of them, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The warming aspect is nice, but I don&#x27;t understand it&#x27;s value, or what chemicals are used to create it.  </li>
            <li>i cant wait to add others from the line and say good bye to my acne :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best at taking off makeup (because it&#x27; doesn&#x27;t really foam or anything), but I like to use it in the morning when I don&#x27;t have makeup on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use a foaming cleanser at night, but this face wash is really nice.</li>
            <li>The wetter your face is, the faster it will warm up.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for my skin, but it does warm up like it says it does.</li>
            <li>and ive noticed my face having a nice glow to it / without a baby</li>
            <li>Nice warm feeling, scrub for a minute and it does remove some blackheads.</li>
            <li>I rub in a circular motion a good minute after the warming of the product has stopped making sure to get into the areas where my skin gets clogged pores</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling nicely cleaned without over drying it.  </li>
            <li>Acne lotions are probably better at treating acne, but this cleanser is a good product to try.</li>
            <li>It is unique and feels great.</li>
            <li>You have to quickly place it on your face to get the warming sensation, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is amazing :)</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>A very pleasant warming sensation occurs at first, then disappears while lightly re-washing the face.  </li>
            <li>It heats up and goes on very warm, and does a good job keeping my complexion clear.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The warming part is interesting upon first use since the product feels very warm on your fingers for about 2 seconds but isn&#x27;t at all noticeable on your face.</li>
            <li>Love it, I&#x27;m oily skin</li>
            <li>Love it will purchase it again and again</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My kids LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t conclude conclusively that it works just because my blackheads seem to have gotten better.  </li>
            <li>I can tell you that the warming sensation is interesting every time.  </li>
            <li>We love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>And I get rid of blackheads while I&#x27;m enjoying a few-second spa treatment?</li>
            <li>the job a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the warming sensation of this product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something with salicylic acid in it, there are better products than this one.  </li>
            <li>Some people may find it refreshing.</li>
            <li>No sense adding one more thing that may cause an allergic reaction in some people.  </li>
            <li>I love cleaning my face with warming cleansers.</li>
            <li>I have used this cleanser for many years now, and I love the warming sensation it gives you.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I like this cleanser a lot more</li>
            <li>but no worries, it&#x27;s a comfortable warm, not a burning</li>
            <li>If you follow these instructions, I believe this product will work well for most people...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>and I started breaking out more.</li>
            <li>- this cleans the skin without drying but it did not seem to be efefctive against existing blackheads - it is more of a preventative product.  </li>
            <li>I think I had more breakouts</li>
            <li>I also love Biore ultra pore strips and love those too.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and warm.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure that you dont rub the product between your hands before applying.</li>
            <li>I keep it on for what I think is about a minute, so the salicylic acid gets a chance to work its magic.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff</li>
            <li>and it smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an excellent product that has helped brighten my skin during these last lingering days of winter.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it warms when you are spreading it on your face.</li>
            <li>it did not get rid of my blackheads and it made my face break out even more than my one or two pimples</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead cleanser any more.</li>
            <li>The warming sensation of this product along with the exfoliation were most notable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom-line: This is an &#x27;OK&#x27; product but the price makes it worthy of four respectable Amazon stars!</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up really fast and feels wonderful if you like hot.</li>
            <li>I love how clean my skin feels afterwards!</li>
            <li>Warms up really nice and smells good and the little beads are great.</li>
            <li>(If you have super sensitive skin and/or heat sensitivity issues, this might not be the best product for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like almost hot but in a good way.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in trying it for those aspects, it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed, and I have not had any breakouts since I have been using it!</li>
            <li>But if you start with a mostly makeup free face</li>
            <li>I loved how the Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser warmed my skin so the cleanser could really get into my pores.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It rinses off fairly easily, and I don&#x27;t notice any dryness.</li>
            <li>In the summer, when I sweat a lot I will be able to see how effective this cleanser really is.</li>
            <li>Acts great as a general exfoliant too.</li>
            <li>At first, when you put it on your face in the shower, it does have a noticeable warm feeling.  </li>
            <li>I find this works best if I place a nice amount in my hands and then gently message all over a wet face in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It gets really warm and my face feels so clean and calm after using it.  </li>
            <li>My blackheads have become less and my skin feels great!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I enjoy the warm feeling when you first put it on your skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is great for me, clean well, not dry.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using the Biore Warming cleanser.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it each morning but for some it may be overpowering.</li>
            <li>her face and nose is so smooth</li>
            <li>and I may be blackhead free.   </li>
            <li>They feel so good at the end of a busy day.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, warming sensation is short but still nice.</li>
            <li>the warming micro beads will make your skin feel so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a great cleanser if you&#x27;re starting with a face full of makeup</li>
            <li>I experienced a much cleaner face verses using normal soap.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great afterwards with a slight glow, warming sensation is nice, just wish it lasted longer, the warmth begins on contact with the skin and then quickly fades out, so I end up using more to warm the next area on my face</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite cleanser!</li>
            <li>this face wash is so much fun!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price pd!  </li>
            <li>I think the warmth is just so much fun!</li>
            <li>My original review is below.</li>
            <li>Original Review</li>
            <li>It really does have a nice warming sensation that helps to open your pores in order to get a good clean scrub.</li>
            <li>Seems to clean well.</li>
            <li>The oil-free formula does keep the skin clean and helps combat the blackheads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very mild, but useful product.</li>
            <li>Your face feels so clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I think my problem is mostly that I have large pores.  </li>
            <li>firstly thought it would work, because I really felt warm when I used it.</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser smells good and has exfoliating beads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, if the circumstances are unusual you might be able to conclude reliably that this product works.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they really haven&#x27;t, or maybe they would have gotten better anyway.  </li>
            <li>The warming cleanser from Biore, over the last two weeks, has done a good job at reducing the number of them on my nose.</li>
            <li>After rinsing off, it definitely dries out my skin - which is good for breakout/oily areas.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and use a specialized routine that works fairly well, but I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new products.</li>
            <li>It does heat like it says it will and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin</li>
            <li>it also performs adequately well.</li>
            <li>but you quickly get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clears up breakouts quickly.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with large pores that clog with dirt easily.</li>
            <li>It has nice small microbeads and does a nice job exfoliating.</li>
            <li>So, I tried it, and true enough, it didn&#x27;t get warm until I started rubbing it on my face.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin that gets irritated by many cleansers.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Gets hot and makes my face tingle, but doesn&#x27;t actually clean it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a must, don&#x27;t apply directly to your face – this heats up pretty strongly and can give off a strong burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this face wash, and I try a lot of face washes, and am happy with few.</li>
            <li>This actually does warm, and it works.  </li>
            <li>The Biore mask is a better choice if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good term product, but I&#x27;ve had others that get my pores clearer faster, although they didn&#x27;t stay that way for too long.</li>
            <li>Plus the warming sensation is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Will most likely add to auto order if available</li>
            <li>No, but it&#x27;s certainly worth mentioning to justify the three stars I gave this product.</li>
            <li>It gets quite warm when using it, but only lasts about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>delivery was super fast!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to everyone who wants to control their blackheads!</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m experiencing right now.</li>
            <li>But every day right after using it, I could see the blackheads still there.</li>
            <li>like that my face &amp; neck feel clean and the exfoliating is gentle.  </li>
            <li>It seems to clean out my pores very well.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I used to have major blackheads</li>
            <li>The warming sensation was pleasant and the beads and such in the cleanser made my face feel soft.</li>
            <li>it gets hot when applied and it eventually desolves some of the blackheads, it’s fun</li>
            <li>Seems to be working great on my sons nose, tried a few things but this seems to do the job!</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I absolutely recommend this cleanser from Biore not only because of price, but keeps the value warm, and the blackheads out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to actually find a drug store product that has warming to it for so much less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As disappointing as that it, it does feel nice on my skin (it really does warm up!), and I do (at first) feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>its good.i like it very much.</li>
            <li>This product really gets hot!  </li>
            <li>While it dries the skin a bit too much for use on my whole face, it worked great in targeting those trouble areas.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be alarmed the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>It gets REALLY hot.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it actually cleans out your poors any better than something else, but the warming sensation makes you think it does.  </li>
            <li>I love this and would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li>I just wish that they would sell it in a bigger portion size. :)</li>
            <li>Product gets warm as you smear it around your wet face.</li>
            <li>The more I open and close it, the messier it gets with product building up in the cap.  </li>
            <li>hot :</li>
            <li>I recommend rubbing the cleanser in your hands the first time to feel it heat up.</li>
            <li>The beads are potent enough that I feel them, so if you prefer a softer wash then this is probably not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time using this product and I like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>I started with one product from this brand and now I’m regular customer for most of their products.</li>
            <li>Aveeno is way better esp with its mini beads for facial scrub.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference even after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I wet my face first, put a nice sized dollop on the palm of my hand, added a bit of water to loosen it up, rubbed my hands together –-</li>
            <li>you want to increase the warming affects, try using this cleanser while you&#x27;re in a hot shower in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t convinced this would work, but two weeks in - I can say it does work.</li>
            <li>I love the cleansing beads in this and the overall warming sensation you get when using it.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that it&#x27;s been almost two years since I originally reviewed this product, and I expect that in that time this product has lost its scent because I don&#x27;t find it offensive at all.</li>
            <li>As for me, I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more tubes now, so they&#x27;ll be ready when my current supply runs out.  </li>
            <li>fixed it right away!  </li>
            <li>Love how it feels and then with a little extra water it feels warm again -- and it helps with my pores size</li>
            <li>and I do see positive effect on her</li>
            <li>We wash our faces with good cleansers, as usual.  </li>
            <li>This warmth opens up the pores, thereby allowing the scrub to get into my pores &amp; clean out the oil &amp; dirt, then I rinsed it with warm water again to make sure I got out all of the scrub, then followed with cold water to close my pores.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most products do</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply it with dry hands to a dry face, because the magic happens when you add water</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this works well, but I&#x27;ll just be using it on spot areas until my skin isn&#x27;t so dry already.</li>
            <li>The warming effect is really cool, though it seems more like a gimmicky way to entertain the consumer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty thick, so you don&#x27;t need a lot, so it lasts a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>(though the heat doesn&#x27;t last long) and it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin (incredibly oily t-zone and very dry cheeks) and found this had minimal impact on reducing pore size and preventing new pimples.</li>
            <li>I have occasional issues with acne, and the products that I was using before trying this Biore cleanser had all worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Hello clear skin for the first time in years!</li>
            <li>I like it a lot, and it has nice little exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li>I believe the old formula in the green tube was better, but this newer formula works fine.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,  It really works fast.</li>
            <li>- it is clearer, brighter, smoother - overall huge improvement..  </li>
            <li>and I used 3 times per week and my skin has change so much,</li>
            <li>I really like the way it warms up when I use it.</li>
            <li>I have been having some breakouts on my face and around my hairline, and this has really helped.</li>
            <li>I know it says &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; but that doesn&#x27;t do it justification, it is really really warming,</li>
            <li>It really shows that it&#x27;s working in getting my blackheads under control.</li>
            <li>This really warms up so you feel like it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>This scrub is gentle, unlike others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>but i think the product is not 4.5 ounce, its gone so fast</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t know when it was going to stop haha,</li>
            <li>: I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work well for me and the smell is nauseating</li>
            <li>and it really does the job.</li>
            <li>It warms up for maybe 3 sec and makes it feel like it works more</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>It really was &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li>it works really well for me and keeps oil to a min.</li>
            <li>The warming sensation is really relaxing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably use it just for those two things, but the cleanser really works too.  </li>
            <li>The steam from your shower, plus the warmth from the cleanser really does add to the cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really warms as it cleans.</li>
            <li>I would recommend washing your face before using this with another product because it does not lather real well</li>
            <li>but if so I don&#x27;t remember liking it this much.</li>
            <li>It gets a good chuck off, but I think only mechanical squeezing/sucking actually gets blackheads out completely.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the warming because it only stayed warm for maybe a second or two.</li>
            <li>The kind where you could destroy your face picking bc</li>
            <li>You only feel a quick burst of heat when you first begin to rub</li>
            <li>I have to use a bit more than other facial cleansers as it doesn&#x27;t smooth across my face well.</li>
            <li>and I live in hot &amp; humid FL.</li>
            <li>The action of 2% salicylic acid and active warming treats the skin effectively for acne.</li>
            <li>It is a cleanser that works very well on the face at getting rid of blackheads, mainly on the nose and removes them very well without hassles and problems.</li>
            <li>The scrub part itself felt like any other, but I specifically bought this as I enjoyed the warming sensation as I was scrubbing my face and not before.</li>
            <li>but this is even better than all their other products.</li>
            <li>This cleanser has synthetic micro-beads which help to exfoliate without being abrasive the many other scrubs can be.</li>
            <li>But like I said, I&#x27;m not sure what kind of job it does with blackheads, since I didnt really notice a difference with mine.</li>
            <li>Second of all, the warming cleanser does get your face clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You must be forewarned about the warming action; it will surprise you the first time you use this product.</li>
            <li>Third, the warmth is tolerable and comfy, not painfully scalding.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my nose does a really good job at keeping blackheads, and the Biore strips do a decent enough job at removing them, but I want to make sure that I have another weapon in fighting them.</li>
            <li>I just found my new go- to face cleanser!</li>
            <li>more or less makes my face feel cleaner, smoother, etc.</li>
            <li>He has had more improvement in his skin in the last 6 months than he has had in the last 6 years since I started using this product line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only redeeming quality is the warming effect it has, and even then is lasts only 5 seconds at the max.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It leaves my face clean but not dry, which is important as I have sensitive skin and live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li>If the scent doesn&#x27;t bother you, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love the sensation I get from using this product, but no significant change in skin condition.</li>
            <li>After four weeks I do see a little bit of a clear up but still have a good amount of blackheads left.</li>
            <li>It really cleans well and skin is so soft after cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Really warms your face, leaves skin soft, no over drying.</li>
            <li>The product is quite economical as you only need to use a nickel sized dollop.</li>
            <li>Overall worth the money.</li>
            <li>A few more weeks</li>
            <li>Biore not only is whole lot cheaper than most brands due to Amazon&#x27;s Add-on program</li>
            <li>Unlike other exfoliators, the grains are small and they really do a great job on keeping blackheads at bay.  </li>
            <li>While this product doesnt do anything magical for blackheads as no product really does, it does have alot of microbeads, the formula is thick, and</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I bought this from a local Walmart and while it overall is a good product I see little improvement in my completion.</li>
            <li>It actually made me nervous the first time because it kept getting warmer and warmer</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t rinse it with warm water 1st and you use cold water, you&#x27;ve just locked the scrub into your pores, possibly causing more irritation.</li>
            <li>The Biore does warm up a bit initially when it gets wet, but that only lasts for about 5 seconds before it cools off.</li>
            <li>It does warm up for about 3 second and very little scrubbing power.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at how well it seems to clean and get rid of dead skin without drying me out too much.</li>
            <li>It certainly stands out as different.  </li>
            <li>Not right for my skin type, but it felt cool when I used it.</li>
            <li>This works well to clear blackheads.</li>
            <li>so I prefer to use a brand that also keeps skin clear.</li>
            <li>If you know what chemical reaction causes this unexpected phenomenon, I hope you&#x27;ll let us all know in a Comment.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I can tell you that the product under review tastes absolutely</li>
            <li>Daughter loves the smell &amp; the warming action.</li>
            <li>the truth is you CANNOT completely eradicate the stubborn blackheads.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my face at all.</li>
            <li>BTW, I have sensitive, oily skin in the t-zone.</li>
            <li>Amazingly enough, this cleanser really does heat up when I rub it in my hands.  </li>
            <li>The warming was strange at first</li>
            <li>Directly after applying the cleanser, you will start feel it worming up your face</li>
            <li>I hope their quality still same along with the reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>Directly rub it on your face.</li>
            <li>Now if only they could absolutely expand themselves, and get zits and blackheads removed from the rest of your body.</li>
            <li>I have oily/combo sensitive skin, and if I can handle it, chances are you can too.</li>
            <li>But there is also a warming action to this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>My tween daughter who has developed some acne also uses it and it seems to help.</li>
            <li>Came a day early.</li>
            <li>the warming thing has me obsessed it feels soo good.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of warming products as they really feel like they are working hard to clean the skin.</li>
            <li>my particular experience with Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser, 4.5 Ounce was probably different from what yours would be.  </li>
            <li>However, my skin broke out more than usual and my blackheads were the same.</li>
            <li>Very grainy texture which makes it super hard to wash off my face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend product, especially if you have blackheads...  </li>
            <li>Having said that, it is genuinely a neat effect, though it wears out very quickly, usually before it hits your face.</li>
            <li>By the time you start scrubbing your face, the warming sensation is gone and you&#x27;re left with a normal face scrub.</li>
            <li>The blackheads I have (normal amount) are still there, although it does help the total look of my face.</li>
            <li>But after a short time, maybe a minute or so, the temperature goes to normal again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was not too much for my dry skin either.</li>
            <li>To be clear about blackheads, nothing short of mechanical squeezing will remove blackheads completely.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s likely to the point of absolute certainty is that after you use it for a while your blackheads will get better or they will stay the same or they will get worse.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I saw less black heads on my noise right away.</li>
            <li>The cream does indeed help with blackheads and acne in general.</li>
            <li>I have generally oily skin</li>
            <li>This stuff has actually helped clear up my blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>Clearasil Daily Clear Acne Treatment Face Wash, 6.5 Ounce (Pack of 4)]].</li>
            <li>And I believe the reason the warmth is so short lived,  is so it doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I help it along by holding a hottish wet cloth to my fast before using the cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better and worse.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that my blackheads didn&#x27;t seem to get much better or worse.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is also kind of tacky on the face and feels weird.</li>
            <li>It gets HOT for about two seconds then cools down to a manageable temperature.</li>
            <li>The only redeeming factor is that it&#x27;s priced a little lower than other scrubs.</li>
            <li>The active ingredient in this stuff is 1% salicylic acid, which is pretty much the active ingredient in all blackhead cleansers.</li>
            <li>And the changes, whether for better or worse, are often subtle and easy to misinterpret because assessing any such changes is</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t end with cold water, your pores are still open, leaving them to get more dirt into them, which defeats the whole purpose!</li>
            <li>I have dry, very sensitive skin, and this made me break out.</li>
            <li>He likes the warming sensation, we haven&#x27;t seen a major reduction in blackheads yet, but its only been 4 days.</li>
            <li>The important thing is that it does in fact cut down on acne and the appearance of black heads.</li>
            <li>to achieve the needs of daily face wash and general hygiene of face.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping this would clear some minor blackheads.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews that complained about the shortness and/or necessity of the warming aspect of this scrub.</li>
            <li>Maybe not like a prescription medicine would, but I see a lot less oils and large blackheads in the pores on my nose, and have NO blackheads on my chin.</li>
            <li>I definitely like this not only because of the value, but keeps on delivering to what Biore has promised for the past several years on keeping your face clean.</li>
            <li>I used it for a couple of weeks, and I broke out and actually had more black heads than usual.</li>
            <li>In fact, I have three separate bottles in my shower right now, including this Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser, which I have been using exclusively for the past two-to-three weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that tends to get a bit dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday after hot yoga to get out all the dirt and grime that builds up after 45 minutes of solid sweating.</li>
            <li>There is no question that when it has came down to skin care products, Biore is one definite brand that not only delivers in price, but delivers very well in quality at getting the job done.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s also likely, also to the point of absolute certainty, is that if you don&#x27;t use the product but just wash your face with soap in the usual way your blackheads will get better or they will stay the same or they will get worse.  </li>
            <li>Basically you apply the dollop to your palm, add a  little water, rub for a bit then gently apply it to your face.</li>
            <li>Before I proceed further, I must preface this review with my skin type and amount of acne: very oily skin, little acne.</li>

            <li> A really good product.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s good marketing that makes you buy.</li>
            <li> The delivery was on time and the product quality is good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did a good job cleaning away pore-clogging dirt as I would have expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> Feels good after use.</li>

            <li> Product smells amazing and warms immediately when on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i used it soon as it arrived and it works amazingly well</li>
            <li> It is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Really amazing product, can do beyond what I paid.</li>
            <li> Made my face feel AMAZING ....</li>
            <li> The warming sensation in the mornings feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> Nice feel.</li>
            <li> I apply it to, because I credit the the nice glow my skin gets from it to the heat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d just be nice not to have to apply over and over again to get the warming sensation...</li>
            <li> gets warm as stated but does not do anything for cleaning your face or helping with blackheads</li>
            <li> but it sure does feel good</li>
            <li> the heat adds a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received some nice things through the Amazon Vine review program, this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received some nice things through the Amazon review program, this is one of them, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The warming aspect is nice, but I don&#x27;t understand it&#x27;s value, or what chemicals are used to create it.  </li>
            <li> i cant wait to add others from the line and say good bye to my acne :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best at taking off makeup (because it&#x27; doesn&#x27;t really foam or anything), but I like to use it in the morning when I don&#x27;t have makeup on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use a foaming cleanser at night, but this face wash is really nice.</li>
            <li> The wetter your face is, the faster it will warm up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for my skin, but it does warm up like it says it does.</li>
            <li> and ive noticed my face having a nice glow to it / without a baby</li>
            <li> Nice warm feeling, scrub for a minute and it does remove some blackheads.</li>
            <li> I rub in a circular motion a good minute after the warming of the product has stopped making sure to get into the areas where my skin gets clogged pores</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling nicely cleaned without over drying it.  </li>
            <li> Acne lotions are probably better at treating acne, but this cleanser is a good product to try.</li>
            <li> It is unique and feels great.</li>
            <li> You have to quickly place it on your face to get the warming sensation, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing :)</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> A very pleasant warming sensation occurs at first, then disappears while lightly re-washing the face.  </li>
            <li> It heats up and goes on very warm, and does a good job keeping my complexion clear.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The warming part is interesting upon first use since the product feels very warm on your fingers for about 2 seconds but isn&#x27;t at all noticeable on your face.</li>
            <li> Love it, I&#x27;m oily skin</li>
            <li> Love it will purchase it again and again</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My kids LOVE this.  </li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t conclude conclusively that it works just because my blackheads seem to have gotten better.  </li>
            <li> I can tell you that the warming sensation is interesting every time.  </li>
            <li> We love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> And I get rid of blackheads while I&#x27;m enjoying a few-second spa treatment?</li>
            <li> the job a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the warming sensation of this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something with salicylic acid in it, there are better products than this one.  </li>
            <li> Some people may find it refreshing.</li>
            <li> No sense adding one more thing that may cause an allergic reaction in some people.  </li>
            <li> I love cleaning my face with warming cleansers.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for many years now, and I love the warming sensation it gives you.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser a lot more</li>
            <li> but no worries, it&#x27;s a comfortable warm, not a burning</li>
            <li> If you follow these instructions, I believe this product will work well for most people...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> and I started breaking out more.</li>
            <li> - this cleans the skin without drying but it did not seem to be efefctive against existing blackheads - it is more of a preventative product.  </li>
            <li> I think I had more breakouts</li>
            <li> I also love Biore ultra pore strips and love those too.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and warm.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure that you dont rub the product between your hands before applying.</li>
            <li> I keep it on for what I think is about a minute, so the salicylic acid gets a chance to work its magic.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff</li>
            <li> and it smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an excellent product that has helped brighten my skin during these last lingering days of winter.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it warms when you are spreading it on your face.</li>
            <li> it did not get rid of my blackheads and it made my face break out even more than my one or two pimples</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead cleanser any more.</li>
            <li> The warming sensation of this product along with the exfoliation were most notable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom-line: This is an &#x27;OK&#x27; product but the price makes it worthy of four respectable Amazon stars!</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up really fast and feels wonderful if you like hot.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my skin feels afterwards!</li>
            <li> Warms up really nice and smells good and the little beads are great.</li>
            <li> (If you have super sensitive skin and/or heat sensitivity issues, this might not be the best product for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like almost hot but in a good way.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in trying it for those aspects, it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed, and I have not had any breakouts since I have been using it!</li>
            <li> But if you start with a mostly makeup free face</li>
            <li> I loved how the Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser warmed my skin so the cleanser could really get into my pores.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It rinses off fairly easily, and I don&#x27;t notice any dryness.</li>
            <li> In the summer, when I sweat a lot I will be able to see how effective this cleanser really is.</li>
            <li> Acts great as a general exfoliant too.</li>
            <li> At first, when you put it on your face in the shower, it does have a noticeable warm feeling.  </li>
            <li> I find this works best if I place a nice amount in my hands and then gently message all over a wet face in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It gets really warm and my face feels so clean and calm after using it.  </li>
            <li> My blackheads have become less and my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I enjoy the warm feeling when you first put it on your skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great for me, clean well, not dry.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using the Biore Warming cleanser.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it each morning but for some it may be overpowering.</li>
            <li> her face and nose is so smooth</li>
            <li> and I may be blackhead free.   </li>
            <li> They feel so good at the end of a busy day.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, warming sensation is short but still nice.</li>
            <li> the warming micro beads will make your skin feel so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a great cleanser if you&#x27;re starting with a face full of makeup</li>
            <li> I experienced a much cleaner face verses using normal soap.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great afterwards with a slight glow, warming sensation is nice, just wish it lasted longer, the warmth begins on contact with the skin and then quickly fades out, so I end up using more to warm the next area on my face</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite cleanser!</li>
            <li> this face wash is so much fun!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price pd!  </li>
            <li> I think the warmth is just so much fun!</li>
            <li> My original review is below.</li>
            <li> Original Review</li>
            <li> It really does have a nice warming sensation that helps to open your pores in order to get a good clean scrub.</li>
            <li> Seems to clean well.</li>
            <li> The oil-free formula does keep the skin clean and helps combat the blackheads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very mild, but useful product.</li>
            <li> Your face feels so clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I think my problem is mostly that I have large pores.  </li>
            <li> firstly thought it would work, because I really felt warm when I used it.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser smells good and has exfoliating beads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, if the circumstances are unusual you might be able to conclude reliably that this product works.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they really haven&#x27;t, or maybe they would have gotten better anyway.  </li>
            <li> The warming cleanser from Biore, over the last two weeks, has done a good job at reducing the number of them on my nose.</li>
            <li> After rinsing off, it definitely dries out my skin - which is good for breakout/oily areas.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and use a specialized routine that works fairly well, but I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new products.</li>
            <li> It does heat like it says it will and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin</li>
            <li> it also performs adequately well.</li>
            <li> but you quickly get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clears up breakouts quickly.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with large pores that clog with dirt easily.</li>
            <li> It has nice small microbeads and does a nice job exfoliating.</li>
            <li> So, I tried it, and true enough, it didn&#x27;t get warm until I started rubbing it on my face.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin that gets irritated by many cleansers.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Gets hot and makes my face tingle, but doesn&#x27;t actually clean it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a must, don&#x27;t apply directly to your face – this heats up pretty strongly and can give off a strong burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this face wash, and I try a lot of face washes, and am happy with few.</li>
            <li> This actually does warm, and it works.  </li>
            <li> The Biore mask is a better choice if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good term product, but I&#x27;ve had others that get my pores clearer faster, although they didn&#x27;t stay that way for too long.</li>
            <li> Plus the warming sensation is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Will most likely add to auto order if available</li>
            <li> No, but it&#x27;s certainly worth mentioning to justify the three stars I gave this product.</li>
            <li> It gets quite warm when using it, but only lasts about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> delivery was super fast!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to everyone who wants to control their blackheads!</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m experiencing right now.</li>
            <li> But every day right after using it, I could see the blackheads still there.</li>
            <li> like that my face &amp; neck feel clean and the exfoliating is gentle.  </li>
            <li> It seems to clean out my pores very well.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I used to have major blackheads</li>
            <li> The warming sensation was pleasant and the beads and such in the cleanser made my face feel soft.</li>
            <li> it gets hot when applied and it eventually desolves some of the blackheads, it’s fun</li>
            <li> Seems to be working great on my sons nose, tried a few things but this seems to do the job!</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I absolutely recommend this cleanser from Biore not only because of price, but keeps the value warm, and the blackheads out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was thrilled to actually find a drug store product that has warming to it for so much less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As disappointing as that it, it does feel nice on my skin (it really does warm up!), and I do (at first) feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> its good.i like it very much.</li>
            <li> This product really gets hot!  </li>
            <li> While it dries the skin a bit too much for use on my whole face, it worked great in targeting those trouble areas.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> It gets REALLY hot.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually cleans out your poors any better than something else, but the warming sensation makes you think it does.  </li>
            <li> I love this and would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> I just wish that they would sell it in a bigger portion size. :)</li>
            <li> Product gets warm as you smear it around your wet face.</li>
            <li> The more I open and close it, the messier it gets with product building up in the cap.  </li>
            <li> hot :</li>
            <li> I recommend rubbing the cleanser in your hands the first time to feel it heat up.</li>
            <li> The beads are potent enough that I feel them, so if you prefer a softer wash then this is probably not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time using this product and I like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> I started with one product from this brand and now I’m regular customer for most of their products.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is way better esp with its mini beads for facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference even after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I wet my face first, put a nice sized dollop on the palm of my hand, added a bit of water to loosen it up, rubbed my hands together –-</li>
            <li> you want to increase the warming affects, try using this cleanser while you&#x27;re in a hot shower in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t convinced this would work, but two weeks in - I can say it does work.</li>
            <li> I love the cleansing beads in this and the overall warming sensation you get when using it.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that it&#x27;s been almost two years since I originally reviewed this product, and I expect that in that time this product has lost its scent because I don&#x27;t find it offensive at all.</li>
            <li> As for me, I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more tubes now, so they&#x27;ll be ready when my current supply runs out.  </li>
            <li> fixed it right away!  </li>
            <li> Love how it feels and then with a little extra water it feels warm again -- and it helps with my pores size</li>
            <li> and I do see positive effect on her</li>
            <li> We wash our faces with good cleansers, as usual.  </li>
            <li> This warmth opens up the pores, thereby allowing the scrub to get into my pores &amp; clean out the oil &amp; dirt, then I rinsed it with warm water again to make sure I got out all of the scrub, then followed with cold water to close my pores.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most products do</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply it with dry hands to a dry face, because the magic happens when you add water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works well, but I&#x27;ll just be using it on spot areas until my skin isn&#x27;t so dry already.</li>
            <li> The warming effect is really cool, though it seems more like a gimmicky way to entertain the consumer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick, so you don&#x27;t need a lot, so it lasts a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li> (though the heat doesn&#x27;t last long) and it smells so good.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin (incredibly oily t-zone and very dry cheeks) and found this had minimal impact on reducing pore size and preventing new pimples.</li>
            <li> I have occasional issues with acne, and the products that I was using before trying this Biore cleanser had all worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Hello clear skin for the first time in years!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, and it has nice little exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li> I believe the old formula in the green tube was better, but this newer formula works fine.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  It really works fast.</li>
            <li> - it is clearer, brighter, smoother - overall huge improvement..  </li>
            <li> and I used 3 times per week and my skin has change so much,</li>
            <li> I really like the way it warms up when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have been having some breakouts on my face and around my hairline, and this has really helped.</li>
            <li> I know it says &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; but that doesn&#x27;t do it justification, it is really really warming,</li>
            <li> It really shows that it&#x27;s working in getting my blackheads under control.</li>
            <li> This really warms up so you feel like it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> This scrub is gentle, unlike others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> but i think the product is not 4.5 ounce, its gone so fast</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t know when it was going to stop haha,</li>
            <li> : I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well for me and the smell is nauseating</li>
            <li> and it really does the job.</li>
            <li> It warms up for maybe 3 sec and makes it feel like it works more</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> It really was &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li> it works really well for me and keeps oil to a min.</li>
            <li> The warming sensation is really relaxing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably use it just for those two things, but the cleanser really works too.  </li>
            <li> The steam from your shower, plus the warmth from the cleanser really does add to the cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really warms as it cleans.</li>
            <li> I would recommend washing your face before using this with another product because it does not lather real well</li>
            <li> but if so I don&#x27;t remember liking it this much.</li>
            <li> It gets a good chuck off, but I think only mechanical squeezing/sucking actually gets blackheads out completely.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the warming because it only stayed warm for maybe a second or two.</li>
            <li> The kind where you could destroy your face picking bc</li>
            <li> You only feel a quick burst of heat when you first begin to rub</li>
            <li> I have to use a bit more than other facial cleansers as it doesn&#x27;t smooth across my face well.</li>
            <li> and I live in hot &amp; humid FL.</li>
            <li> The action of 2% salicylic acid and active warming treats the skin effectively for acne.</li>
            <li> It is a cleanser that works very well on the face at getting rid of blackheads, mainly on the nose and removes them very well without hassles and problems.</li>
            <li> The scrub part itself felt like any other, but I specifically bought this as I enjoyed the warming sensation as I was scrubbing my face and not before.</li>
            <li> but this is even better than all their other products.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has synthetic micro-beads which help to exfoliate without being abrasive the many other scrubs can be.</li>
            <li> But like I said, I&#x27;m not sure what kind of job it does with blackheads, since I didnt really notice a difference with mine.</li>
            <li> Second of all, the warming cleanser does get your face clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You must be forewarned about the warming action; it will surprise you the first time you use this product.</li>
            <li> Third, the warmth is tolerable and comfy, not painfully scalding.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my nose does a really good job at keeping blackheads, and the Biore strips do a decent enough job at removing them, but I want to make sure that I have another weapon in fighting them.</li>
            <li> I just found my new go- to face cleanser!</li>
            <li> more or less makes my face feel cleaner, smoother, etc.</li>
            <li> He has had more improvement in his skin in the last 6 months than he has had in the last 6 years since I started using this product line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only redeeming quality is the warming effect it has, and even then is lasts only 5 seconds at the max.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It leaves my face clean but not dry, which is important as I have sensitive skin and live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li> If the scent doesn&#x27;t bother you, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the sensation I get from using this product, but no significant change in skin condition.</li>
            <li> After four weeks I do see a little bit of a clear up but still have a good amount of blackheads left.</li>
            <li> It really cleans well and skin is so soft after cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Really warms your face, leaves skin soft, no over drying.</li>
            <li> The product is quite economical as you only need to use a nickel sized dollop.</li>
            <li> Overall worth the money.</li>
            <li> A few more weeks</li>
            <li> Biore not only is whole lot cheaper than most brands due to Amazon&#x27;s Add-on program</li>
            <li> Unlike other exfoliators, the grains are small and they really do a great job on keeping blackheads at bay.  </li>
            <li> While this product doesnt do anything magical for blackheads as no product really does, it does have alot of microbeads, the formula is thick, and</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I bought this from a local Walmart and while it overall is a good product I see little improvement in my completion.</li>
            <li> It actually made me nervous the first time because it kept getting warmer and warmer</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t rinse it with warm water 1st and you use cold water, you&#x27;ve just locked the scrub into your pores, possibly causing more irritation.</li>
            <li> The Biore does warm up a bit initially when it gets wet, but that only lasts for about 5 seconds before it cools off.</li>
            <li> It does warm up for about 3 second and very little scrubbing power.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at how well it seems to clean and get rid of dead skin without drying me out too much.</li>
            <li> It certainly stands out as different.  </li>
            <li> Not right for my skin type, but it felt cool when I used it.</li>
            <li> This works well to clear blackheads.</li>
            <li> so I prefer to use a brand that also keeps skin clear.</li>
            <li> If you know what chemical reaction causes this unexpected phenomenon, I hope you&#x27;ll let us all know in a Comment.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I can tell you that the product under review tastes absolutely</li>
            <li> Daughter loves the smell &amp; the warming action.</li>
            <li> the truth is you CANNOT completely eradicate the stubborn blackheads.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my face at all.</li>
            <li> BTW, I have sensitive, oily skin in the t-zone.</li>
            <li> Amazingly enough, this cleanser really does heat up when I rub it in my hands.  </li>
            <li> The warming was strange at first</li>
            <li> Directly after applying the cleanser, you will start feel it worming up your face</li>
            <li> I hope their quality still same along with the reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Directly rub it on your face.</li>
            <li> Now if only they could absolutely expand themselves, and get zits and blackheads removed from the rest of your body.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combo sensitive skin, and if I can handle it, chances are you can too.</li>
            <li> But there is also a warming action to this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> My tween daughter who has developed some acne also uses it and it seems to help.</li>
            <li> Came a day early.</li>
            <li> the warming thing has me obsessed it feels soo good.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of warming products as they really feel like they are working hard to clean the skin.</li>
            <li> my particular experience with Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser, 4.5 Ounce was probably different from what yours would be.  </li>
            <li> However, my skin broke out more than usual and my blackheads were the same.</li>
            <li> Very grainy texture which makes it super hard to wash off my face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend product, especially if you have blackheads...  </li>
            <li> Having said that, it is genuinely a neat effect, though it wears out very quickly, usually before it hits your face.</li>
            <li> By the time you start scrubbing your face, the warming sensation is gone and you&#x27;re left with a normal face scrub.</li>
            <li> The blackheads I have (normal amount) are still there, although it does help the total look of my face.</li>
            <li> But after a short time, maybe a minute or so, the temperature goes to normal again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was not too much for my dry skin either.</li>
            <li> To be clear about blackheads, nothing short of mechanical squeezing will remove blackheads completely.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s likely to the point of absolute certainty is that after you use it for a while your blackheads will get better or they will stay the same or they will get worse.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I saw less black heads on my noise right away.</li>
            <li> The cream does indeed help with blackheads and acne in general.</li>
            <li> I have generally oily skin</li>
            <li> This stuff has actually helped clear up my blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> Clearasil Daily Clear Acne Treatment Face Wash, 6.5 Ounce (Pack of 4)]].</li>
            <li> And I believe the reason the warmth is so short lived,  is so it doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I help it along by holding a hottish wet cloth to my fast before using the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better and worse.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that my blackheads didn&#x27;t seem to get much better or worse.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is also kind of tacky on the face and feels weird.</li>
            <li> It gets HOT for about two seconds then cools down to a manageable temperature.</li>
            <li> The only redeeming factor is that it&#x27;s priced a little lower than other scrubs.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this stuff is 1% salicylic acid, which is pretty much the active ingredient in all blackhead cleansers.</li>
            <li> And the changes, whether for better or worse, are often subtle and easy to misinterpret because assessing any such changes is</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t end with cold water, your pores are still open, leaving them to get more dirt into them, which defeats the whole purpose!</li>
            <li> I have dry, very sensitive skin, and this made me break out.</li>
            <li> He likes the warming sensation, we haven&#x27;t seen a major reduction in blackheads yet, but its only been 4 days.</li>
            <li> The important thing is that it does in fact cut down on acne and the appearance of black heads.</li>
            <li> to achieve the needs of daily face wash and general hygiene of face.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping this would clear some minor blackheads.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews that complained about the shortness and/or necessity of the warming aspect of this scrub.</li>
            <li> Maybe not like a prescription medicine would, but I see a lot less oils and large blackheads in the pores on my nose, and have NO blackheads on my chin.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this not only because of the value, but keeps on delivering to what Biore has promised for the past several years on keeping your face clean.</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of weeks, and I broke out and actually had more black heads than usual.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have three separate bottles in my shower right now, including this Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser, which I have been using exclusively for the past two-to-three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that tends to get a bit dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday after hot yoga to get out all the dirt and grime that builds up after 45 minutes of solid sweating.</li>
            <li> There is no question that when it has came down to skin care products, Biore is one definite brand that not only delivers in price, but delivers very well in quality at getting the job done.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s also likely, also to the point of absolute certainty, is that if you don&#x27;t use the product but just wash your face with soap in the usual way your blackheads will get better or they will stay the same or they will get worse.  </li>
            <li> Basically you apply the dollop to your palm, add a  little water, rub for a bit then gently apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> Before I proceed further, I must preface this review with my skin type and amount of acne: very oily skin, little acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my blackhead area; the end of my nose, but the area isn&#x27;t that bad right now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks of usage, I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is better or worse than another other salicylic acid product on the market.</li>
            <li> I felt it right away when I squeezed it on my hands, but it does settle down a little by the time you get it on your face so it doesn&#x27;t feel like your sking is burning.</li>
            <li> not sure how one can tell whether this product works except in unusual circumstances.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it doesn&#x27;t have an icky smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely clear on why it does that, and whether it&#x27;s necessary or just a marketing gimmick, but there you go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and really makes me feel like it&#x27;s getting deep into my pores~!</li>
            <li> It does heat, but after rubbing between your fingers (for as minimal time as possible) it doesn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> The results for me have been the same as every other product I&#x27;ve ever used and there are cheaper products in the supermarket that offer the same treatment.</li>
            <li> It works very well and hasn&#x27;t really dried my face as other products have.  </li>
            <li> Just because your blackheads got better or stayed the same or got worse doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the use of this product (or any similar product) had anything to do with the outcome.  </li>
            <li> face is typically clear with a lot of clogged looking pores on my chin and a round my noise.  </li>
            <li> Clearasil did help in controlling the pimples on my daughters face, but could not completely eradicate it.</li>
            <li> However, I have seen no improvement in my blackheads, not even minor improvement.</li>
            <li> Therefore this solution works to diminish the appearance but does not clear your face of them.</li>
            <li> The warming sensation lasts about half a second as you initially rub the product on your hands.</li>
            <li> My pores look smaller, and blackheads are shrinking, but without any of the drying, redness, flaking, and peeling that I get from some other salicylic acid cleansers.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to face wash as it cleans well but does not leave my face overly dry.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have dry skin with ocasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li> Rince and dry</li>
            <li> and I do not want my face to dry out.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I then moisturize afterwards and let that dry before I apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Crush up some aspirin tablets (which are salicylic acid, which is the only active ingredient in the Biore product)</li>
            <li> Crush up some aspirin tablets (which are salicylic acid, which is the only active ingredient in the Biore product)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40s with some adult acne but the typical teen acne products are too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this stuff where I live.</li>
            <li> Anyone with this problem knows these are difficult to clean from blackheads and closed and invisible.</li>
            <li> Nah, it warms and cools down instantly</li>
            <li> It heats up, then cools back down.</li>
            <li> If you read the directions, it says to &amp;#34; wet your face, but apply to DRY hands.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so I feel less gross.</li>
            <li> Teenage daughter was having trouble with clogged pores and blackheads--</li>
            <li> The heat last a few seconds.</li>
            <li> We then use Bioré Warming while the face is still wet.  </li>
            <li> We used this cleanser about a week before the pores disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;Please be careful of your clothes, as it can take some colour out.</li>
            <li> For me, the warming effect doesn&#x27;t last longer than a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Biore&#x27;s Anti-Blackhead Cleanser is absolutely no exception.</li>
            <li> My first impression was that the cleanser is very thick and not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> He gets a bath every other day and his skin is clearing up.  </li>
            <li> After about a week of using it I started getting small breakouts all over my face and especially on my forehead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Biore products that I felt did</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like it.</li>
            <li> Having said, It did not create any other problems either.</li>
            <li> individual skin is different, Acne treatment product might work like miracle for one while might completely fail for another with same symptoms.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works, and I&#x27;m not willing to find out.</li>
            <li> I use this about every other day, as it is an exfoliating</li>
            <li> Touted as a warming anti-blackhead cleanser - this cream goes on with an initial burst of warming heat and then feels like ordinary cream.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t feel as if you&#x27;re ripping your face off like with some other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I try to stay away from perfumed products due to the nature of my skin.</li>
            <li> and you need only use a small amount</li>
            <li> , so it should last a while, even if the bottle seems small.  </li>
            <li> The combined warming sensation and acne treating cleanser is something you don&#x27;t find in other products.  </li>
            <li> The beads would easily get into my eyes, which was painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a week of using this cleanser, I have had minimal breakouts and my blackheads are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The tough ones on my nose that I thought if have forever have shrank a considerable amount and on my cheeks, they&#x27;re almost gone.</li>
            <li> The tl;dr version of this review is it&#x27;s just your average cleanser.</li>
            <li> It is blue in color and thick in consistency.</li>
            <li> only minor issue is that AMAZON shipped me an outdated product.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s really thick, I decided to use it like a mask instead of a cleanser, and left it on my face for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Sacylic acid can cause you to break out worse, making your skin peel,  if you deplete your skin of all your natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I have never had bad facial acne or anything like that, but over the years my nose and chin have started to act up and have had some pretty big/deep black heads.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had bad blackheads for a long time and after a week of using this product they have cleared completely 100% up, and if discontinuing its use results in their reappearance and subsequent use clears them up again, you should probably keep using it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is a little viscous and the heat part of it doesn&#x27;t last, but in all, it&#x27;s a solid Biore product and less expensive on Amazon Prime than in the drug stores or in the grocer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my take on it: When you wash your face, you should ALWAYS start with HOT water and end with cold water.</li>
            <li> The reason being, that hot water opens your pores &amp; cold water closes them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since middle school and am now 20, needless to say, I still struggle with blackheads and minor acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> Has a little bit of scrub particles.</li>
            <li> I just wish the warming effect lasted a little longer than it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the heat does anything other than feel nice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Not sure what that accomplishes, but it is warmer on the face than other cleansers.</li>
            <li> The little micro beads in it make you feel like you are cleaning your face well.</li>
            <li> It had little beads in i that exfoliate.</li>
            <li> But between the semi-roughness of the cleansing beads and the sudden acne flare-up, I&#x27;m afraid I cannot offer this a solid recommendation.</li>
            <li> Clears the pore&#x27;s up in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I started using it everyday for the 1st week, then went to every over day.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a waste of money, I</li>
            <li> This product does not cause any unwanted side-effects and the skin does not get tarnished or crack nor make your face skin feel dried</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Another gimmicky product that just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but maybe a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> The warming level of this product is comparable with Boscia Detoxifying Black Cleanser that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I kept using the Biore cleanser - along with other post-shower creams - and the acne slowly went away.  </li>
            <li> After a few days using this product, however, small patches of acne formed on both my neck and face.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in the shower, but that feeling goes away after a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps with blackheads</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I only used this twice and tossed.</li>
            <li> She has been using it for past couple of weeks but</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I only used this twice, so</li>
            <li> Overall, this fails as a cleanser, but may have been because it was expired.</li>
            <li> There are small beads in this product so you should not use with a automatic cleaning brush like Clarisonic or the Olay Cleaning System.  </li>
            <li> I think I tried this product before in the past</li>
            <li> But not good for my skin in this harsh winter weather</li>
            <li> Hard to find on the shelf in the store.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not warm after application, it doesn&#x27;t seem to add anything to the cleansing</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be putting my trusty Noxzema away, as it serves a different purpose (soothing cold; this Biore is soothing hot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re worried about sensitivity issues, try using the product at night to see if you have problems, so that way if you do, you could at least sleep some of the damage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take my makeup off, scrub this into my entire face, leave on for 2 minutes, remove with cold water, and moisturize.   </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t necessarily notice my blackheads going away, but that might be because they aren&#x27;t THAT bad..</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I am disappointed overall.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Biore products yet this one disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The product is very thick.</li>
            <li> Feel like my skin is smoother since using the past couple of weeks!!</li>
            <li> This item dried my skin out badly.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gooey and difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> If I get any in my hairline, it&#x27;s difficult to get out.</li>
            <li> This scrub&#x27;s scent is  faint</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s what opens your pores but don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I was not impressed...</li>
            <li> I leave it on for about 2 minutes after rubbing it in and take it off with cold water.</li>
            <li> Has an unpleasant smell as well.  </li>
            <li> Highly disappointed by that.</li>
            <li> Heck, maybe this product actually retarded the embetterment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find it annoying, and my cat doesn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
            <li> He has no hair on 95 % of his body and has terrible acne and blackheads.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I loved how the Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser warmed my skin so the cleanser could really get into my pores. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most products do and I have very sensitive skin that gets irritated by many cleansers. The only con is the fact that Biore has reduced the size of the product, while keeping the same price. I would recommend this to a friend though.</li>
            <li> Love it, I&#x27;m oily skin and I used 3 times per week and my skin has change so much, Love it will purchase it again and again</li>
            <li> I really like the way it warms up when I use it. Nice feel.</li>
            <li> I have dry, very sensitive skin, and this made me break out. Not right for my skin type, but it felt cool when I used it.</li>
            <li> Product smells amazing and warms immediately when on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and have deep blackheads on my chin and nose. I have been using this wash for a month in conjunction with the biore pore strips. After four weeks I do see a little bit of a clear up but still have a good amount of blackheads left. I have been using the wash every morning and night. It does not irritate my skin. So for now I am going to continue to use the rest of the wash but when its all gone I am going to switch to something else.</li>
            <li> Feels so nice!  I&#x27;ve never had acne, but noticed enlarged pores!  Eeeccckkkkk!!  Nooooooooo!&lt;br /&gt;This fixed it right away!  Saw the difference in ONE use!</li>
            <li> This actually does warm, and it works.  Unlike other exfoliators, the grains are small and they really do a great job on keeping blackheads at bay.  Love it.</li>
            <li> this face wash is so much fun! its kind of crazy how much it actually warms up. My blackheads have become less and my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> The Biore mask is a better choice if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> My kids LOVE this.  Don&#x27;t be alarmed the first time you use it.  It gets REALLY hot.  It has nice small microbeads and does a nice job exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually cleans out your poors any better than something else, but the warming sensation makes you think it does.  Was not too much for my dry skin either.</li>
            <li> This product really gets hot!  It really cleans well and skin is so soft after cleaning.  I use all of the Biore products on myself and on my Chinese Crested/Terrier mixed dog.  He has no hair on 95 % of his body and has terrible acne and blackheads.  His hair follicles and pores get clogged with dirt and oil and then they get plugged and infected.  This is the best product that I have found.  He gets a bath every other day and his skin is clearing up.  He has had more improvement in his skin in the last 6 months than he has had in the last 6 years since I started using this product line.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff!  Clears the pore&#x27;s up in just a few days.  Love the warming sensation!  Well worth the price pd!  Hard to find on the shelf in the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better and worse. It&#x27;s a pretty good term product, but I&#x27;ve had others that get my pores clearer faster, although they didn&#x27;t stay that way for too long.</li>
            <li> After about a week of using it I started getting small breakouts all over my face and especially on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;Adding this cleanser was the only change in my routine, and my acne went away shortly after not using it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It brought on the acne but did not do a thing for the blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only redeeming quality is the warming effect it has, and even then is lasts only 5 seconds at the max.&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I like this face wash, and I try a lot of face washes, and am happy with few. That being said, I am actually purchasing this one again. My skin looks great afterwards with a slight glow, warming sensation is nice, just wish it lasted longer, the warmth begins on contact with the skin and then quickly fades out, so I end up using more to warm the next area on my face I apply it to, because I credit the the nice glow my skin gets from it to the heat. It&#x27;d just be nice not to have to apply over and over again to get the warming sensation...</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I have super oily skin and I use this warming effect cleanser twice a day and I don&#x27;t have rely on my acne meds.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser smells good and has exfoliating beads.  You have to quickly place it on your face to get the warming sensation, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li> gets warm as stated but does not do anything for cleaning your face or helping with blackheads</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend since he was jealous of all of my Biore products. He likes the warming sensation, we haven&#x27;t seen a major reduction in blackheads yet, but its only been 4 days.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Not sure if it helps with blackheads but it sure does feel good</li>
            <li> Really warms your face, leaves skin soft, no over drying.</li>
            <li> While this product doesnt do anything magical for blackheads as no product really does, it does have alot of microbeads, the formula is thick, and the warming thing has me obsessed it feels soo good. wish it lasted forever.</li>
            <li> Very good the customer love it and will try it again.</li>
            <li> ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how one can tell whether this product works except in unusual circumstances.  What&#x27;s likely to the point of absolute certainty is that after you use it for a while your blackheads will get better or they will stay the same or they will get worse.  What&#x27;s also likely, also to the point of absolute certainty, is that if you don&#x27;t use the product but just wash your face with soap in the usual way your blackheads will get better or they will stay the same or they will get worse.  Just because your blackheads got better or stayed the same or got worse doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the use of this product (or any similar product) had anything to do with the outcome.  And the changes, whether for better or worse, are often subtle and easy to misinterpret because assessing any such changes is so subjective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if the circumstances are unusual you might be able to conclude reliably that this product works.  If you&#x27;ve had bad blackheads for a long time and after a week of using this product they have cleared completely 100% up, and if discontinuing its use results in their reappearance and subsequent use clears them up again, you should probably keep using it.  I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I wouldn&#x27;t conclude conclusively that it works just because my blackheads seem to have gotten better.  Maybe they really haven&#x27;t, or maybe they would have gotten better anyway.  Heck, maybe this product actually retarded the embetterment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It so happens I have blackheads on my tongue, so my particular experience with Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser, 4.5 Ounce was probably different from what yours would be.  I can tell you that my blackheads didn&#x27;t seem to get much better or worse.  I can tell you that the warming sensation is interesting every time.  If you know what chemical reaction causes this unexpected phenomenon, I hope you&#x27;ll let us all know in a Comment.  Finally, I can tell you that the product under review tastes absolutely awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a bitterer but betterer-tasting substitute you can try.  Crush up some aspirin tablets (which are salicylic acid, which is the only active ingredient in the Biore product), mix them with water to the consistency of a runny gel, heat the gel in the microwave, and scrub it onto your blackheads.  I&#x27;m not saying this will work, I&#x27;m just saying it just might work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start with three stars and add one because this stuff, in case it works for you, is cheaper than competing products.olutely awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a bitterer but betterer-tasting substitute you can try.

            <li> We love this cleanser.  Just wish we could find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Good Product.  Fast shipping,  It really works fast.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to face wash as it cleans well but does not leave my face overly dry. Won&#x27;t use anything else. Plus the warming sensation is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I think the warmth is just so much fun! And I get rid of blackheads while I&#x27;m enjoying a few-second spa treatment? Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Biore products that I felt did the job a lot better. The warming sensation lasts about half a second as you initially rub the product on your hands. By the time you start scrubbing your face, the warming sensation is gone and you&#x27;re left with a normal face scrub. Highly disappointed by that. The scrub part itself felt like any other, but I specifically bought this as I enjoyed the warming sensation as I was scrubbing my face and not before. The only redeeming factor is that it&#x27;s priced a little lower than other scrubs. In the future, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have dry skin with ocasional breakouts. I use this is in the shower and have had wonderful results with it. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a great cleanser if you&#x27;re starting with a face full of makeup - it just doesn&#x27;t get everything washed off well. But if you start with a mostly makeup free face the warming micro beads will make your skin feel so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> This works well to clear blackheads.</li>
            <li> Purchased for by teenage daughter who has a problm with blackheads.  Shes uses 3 to 4 times a week and loves it.  Feels warn on her skin when she applies it.  Face ia a bit red after the treatment, but the next AM, such a difference in her skin - it is clearer, brighter, smoother - overall huge improvement..  Would recommend and will keep buying.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Nah, it warms and cools down instantly so I dont see any point of its function. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and I don;t see no notiable improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It heats up and goes on very warm, and does a good job keeping my complexion clear. It is blue in color and thick in consistency.</li>
            <li> This stuff has actually helped clear up my blackheads on my nose. I started using it everyday for the 1st week, then went to every over day. I finally have control over the blackheads.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little viscous and the heat part of it doesn&#x27;t last, but in all, it&#x27;s a solid Biore product and less expensive on Amazon Prime than in the drug stores or in the grocer&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t forget to look for the &amp;#34;clip free&amp;#34; coupons!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Definitely look forward to using this as a treat! Feel like my skin is smoother since using the past couple of weeks!!</li>
            <li> Teenage daughter was having trouble with clogged pores and blackheads-- this solved the problem. Will most likely add to auto order if available so she never runs out.</li>
            <li> The cream does indeed help with blackheads and acne in general. It heats up, then cools back down. I&#x27;m not entirely clear on why it does that, and whether it&#x27;s necessary or just a marketing gimmick, but there you go. The important thing is that it does in fact cut down on acne and the appearance of black heads. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> It does heat, but after rubbing between your fingers (for as minimal time as possible) it doesn&#x27;t last that long.  I do feel the beads help though and honestly it smells like starbursts to me!</li>
            <li> I have been having some breakouts on my face and around my hairline, and this has really helped. While it dries the skin a bit too much for use on my whole face, it worked great in targeting those trouble areas. The warming effect is really cool, though it seems more like a gimmicky way to entertain the consumer. Having said that, it is genuinely a neat effect, though it wears out very quickly, usually before it hits your face. Nice product!</li>
            <li> I love the warming sensation of this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome cleaning for your face. I know it says &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; but that doesn&#x27;t do it justification, it is really really warming, like almost hot but in a good way. Feels awesome on your face and I have noticed some clearing up on my face. Good Stuff</li>
            <li> I feel the warming of the product on my face. It really shows that it&#x27;s working in getting my blackheads under control. I love this and would totally buy it again. I just wish that they would sell it in a bigger portion size. :)&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was super fast!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to everyone who wants to control their blackheads!</li>
            <li> The tl;dr version of this review is it&#x27;s just your average cleanser. I have combination skin (incredibly oily t-zone and very dry cheeks) and found this had minimal impact on reducing pore size and preventing new pimples. As disappointing as that it, it does feel nice on my skin (it really does warm up!), and I do (at first) feel refreshed and clean. Is that enough to make me want to purchase this item again? No, but it&#x27;s certainly worth mentioning to justify the three stars I gave this product.</li>
            <li> Product gets warm as you smear it around your wet face. The heat last a few seconds. Has a consistency like honey. Nice clean smell. Has a little bit of scrub particles. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. Seems to clean well. Blackheads have not seemed to appear.</li>
            <li> This really warms up so you feel like it&#x27;s working and I actually see a difference in my pores (cleaner) in just one week.</li>
            <li> I like how it warms your face and opens your pores it us a good product.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Warming effect was 2 seconds tops! Very grainy texture which makes it super hard to wash off my face. Has an unpleasant smell as well.  Needless to say, I only used this twice and tossed. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, and it has nice little exfoliating beads. I just wish the warming effect lasted a little longer than it does. Other than that, I like it.</li>
            <li> Another great warming product from Biore! I am a fan of warming products as they really feel like they are working hard to clean the skin. Another must have Biore product. Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> the heat adds a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a waste of money, I but it might work for some. It does warm up for about 3 second and very little scrubbing power.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have visible pores in the T zone areas. Anyone with this problem knows these are difficult to clean from blackheads and closed and invisible. Now neither of us needs to fuss.  We wash our faces with good cleansers, as usual.  We then use Bioré Warming while the face is still wet.  A very pleasant warming sensation occurs at first, then disappears while lightly re-washing the face.  Rince and dry and the face feels wonderful. We used this cleanser about a week before the pores disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;Please be careful of your clothes, as it can take some colour out.</li>
            <li> Before using this product my teenage daughter was all fussy when it comes to using cleanser to take care of her numerous breakouts she has on monthly basis. We had settled with [[ASIN:B001U0ONNY Clearasil Ultra Acne Treatment Daily Face Wash]] to achieve the needs of daily face wash and general hygiene of face. Clearasil did help in controlling the pimples on my daughters face, but could not completely eradicate it. Having said, It did not create any other problems either. She also used [[ASIN:B000EPA4FW Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System]] to combat the breakouts but with minimal effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came this [[ASIN:B006RFZ98K Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser, 4.5 Ounce]]. Right off the bat Biore not only is whole lot cheaper than most brands due to Amazon&#x27;s Add-on program it also performs adequately well. Daughter loves the smell &amp; the warming action. The oil-free formula does keep the skin clean and helps combat the blackheads. She has been using it for past couple of weeks but the truth is you CANNOT completely eradicate the stubborn blackheads. This product does not cause any unwanted side-effects and the skin does not get tarnished or crack nor make your face skin feel dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each individual skin is different, Acne treatment product might work like miracle for one while might completely fail for another with same symptoms. This [[ASIN:B006RFZ98K Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser, 4.5 Ounce]] did give her a &#x27;confidence&#x27; boost and I do see positive effect on her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line: This is an &#x27;OK&#x27; product but the price makes it worthy of four respectable Amazon stars!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for a few weeks and I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results. The cleanser comes in  a chubby tube.  The product is quite economical as you only need to use a nickel sized dollop. Basically you apply the dollop to your palm, add a  little water, rub for a bit then gently apply it to your face. The cleanser has an immediate heating effect . I&#x27;m not sure if the heat does anything other than feel nice.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser cleans the face well without over drying it. I have oily skin with large pores that clog with dirt easily. I have sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my face at all.I experienced a much cleaner face verses using normal soap.The scent is pleasant without being overwhelming. The consistency of the product is similar to sticky gel toothpaste. However that might have been my experience because the product I was given to test was outdated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor issue is that AMAZON shipped me an outdated product. The tube has an expiration date of 06/2013, I received  the product 03/2014 .... 9 months over the expiration date!  I would recommend purchasing in the store rather than online so that you can check the products date code.</li>
            <li> 1/25/2016 My original review is below. Here&#x27;s the update. I saw this cleanser sitting on the shelf and decided to try it again as I&#x27;d forgotten why I didn&#x27;t like it. Since it&#x27;s really thick, I decided to use it like a mask instead of a cleanser, and left it on my face for 15 minutes. I&#x27;ve done that three times now in about six days. My pores look smaller, and blackheads are shrinking, but without any of the drying, redness, flaking, and peeling that I get from some other salicylic acid cleansers. I&#x27;m so happy with the results that I wanted to revise my review. I was surprised to see that it&#x27;s been almost two years since I originally reviewed this product, and I expect that in that time this product has lost its scent because I don&#x27;t find it offensive at all. If the scent doesn&#x27;t bother you, I highly recommend this product. As for me, I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more tubes now, so they&#x27;ll be ready when my current supply runs out.  Original Review I&#x27;ve received some nice things through the Amazon Vine review program, this isn&#x27;t one of them. This is smelly, blue (blue 1 lake), gooey stuff. If you&#x27;re looking for something with salicylic acid in it, there are better products than this one.  This has an ocean breeze scent. I don&#x27;t like it, and wonder why companies need to add any scent to their facial products. Some people may find it refreshing. I find it annoying, and my cat doesn&#x27;t like it either. And leave the dye out as well. No sense adding one more thing that may cause an allergic reaction in some people.  It&#x27;s gooey and difficult to spread. Water is needed to activate the warming affect, but when I add enough water to get it to spread, the warming affect is gone. If I get any in my hairline, it&#x27;s difficult to get out. If I was going to use this, I would only use it in the shower where I can rinse it out well. The tube is made to sit on the cap. When I open the cap, the product is stuck to the plug that goes in the opening. A string of it goes from the opening acrossthe top/bottom of the tube, across the hinge, and to the plug. The more I open and close it, the messier it gets with product building up in the cap.  Needless to say, I only used this twice, so I don&#x27;t know if it works, and I&#x27;m not willing to find out. Well, I think you get the picture. Not recommended.  I&#x27;ve received some nice things through the Amazon review program, this is one of them, [[ASIN:B001U0OQN6 Clearasil Daily Clear Acne Treatment Face Wash, 6.5 Ounce (Pack of 4)]].</li>
            <li> Awesome deal! Great product!</li>
            <li> I love cleaning my face with warming cleansers. They feel so good at the end of a busy day. I get occasional acne so I prefer to use a brand that also keeps skin clear. I really enjoy using the Biore Warming cleanser. It has the perfect temperature of warmth - not too hot. It leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed, and I have not had any breakouts since I have been using it!</li>
            <li> This scrub is gentle, unlike others I&#x27;ve used.  The warming aspect is nice, but I don&#x27;t understand it&#x27;s value, or what chemicals are used to create it.  I&#x27;d rather have a beautiful scent.  This scrub&#x27;s scent is  faint cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that my face &amp; neck feel clean and the exfoliating is gentle.  A really good product.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing! I use it in the shower every morning. It does heat like it says it will and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Amazon send me an expired product, so keep that in mind. The warming sensation was pleasant and the beads and such in the cleanser made my face feel soft. However, my skin broke out more than usual and my blackheads were the same. The cleanser is also kind of tacky on the face and feels weird. The beads would easily get into my eyes, which was painful. Overall, this fails as a cleanser, but may have been because it was expired.</li>
            <li> i used it soon as it arrived and it works amazingly well i cant wait to add others from the line and say good bye to my acne :)</li>
            <li> I bought this from a local Walmart and while it overall is a good product I see little improvement in my completion. The warming itself is a neat enough experience to purchase it. I didn&#x27;t read the &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; part on the tube so I has no idea until it hit my face. The feeling immediately took my breath away. Overall worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like this product, the warming sensation is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does not &amp;#34;destroy&amp;#34; blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It more or less makes my face feel cleaner, smoother, etc. The blackheads I have (normal amount) are still there, although it does help the total look of my face.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for many years now, and I love the warming sensation it gives you. Make sure you apply it with dry hands to a dry face, because the magic happens when you add water &#x3D;) It&#x27;s not the best at taking off makeup (because it&#x27; doesn&#x27;t really foam or anything), but I like to use it in the morning when I don&#x27;t have makeup on. I&#x27;ll use a foaming cleanser at night, but this face wash is really nice. It&#x27;s thick and really makes me feel like it&#x27;s getting deep into my pores~!</li>
            <li> I have a ton of blackheads on my nose that are visible up close and I thought this product would help them out. I use it daily and I even get rid of my blackheads beforehand to use this scrub to keep them from coming back, but they still appear! I see no difference with this product.</li>
            <li> i will recommend to my friend. its good.i like it very much. but i think the product is not 4.5 ounce, its gone so fast</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser a lot more then I thought I would. It smells great and has scrubby beads in it.</li>
            <li> I feel no added benefit of the warming effect. You only feel a quick burst of heat when you first begin to rub and it&#x27;s gone before you can rub it over your entire face.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I used to have major blackheads and it has definitely helped. Almost all of my blackheads have gone aways. It is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> The cleanser warms up when you put it on your face which I think is great.  However, I don&#x27;t think it does anything in terms of preventing or removing the blackheads.</li>
            <li> It does the job, which is cleaning your face.  I didn&#x27;t necessarily notice my blackheads going away, but that might be because they aren&#x27;t THAT bad.. I think my problem is mostly that I have large pores.  This stuff does get warm though!  It actually made me nervous the first time because it kept getting warmer and warmer and I didn&#x27;t know when it was going to stop haha, but no worries, it&#x27;s a comfortable warm, not a burning hot :P.  It&#x27;s pretty thick, so you don&#x27;t need a lot, so it lasts a good amount of time.  I don&#x27;t notice my face getting greasy throughout the day after using it, so it does do its job as a face cleanser.  But like I said, I&#x27;m not sure what kind of job it does with blackheads, since I didnt really notice a difference with mine.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great for me, clean well, not dry. Condition: I have very oily skin and I live in hot &amp; humid FL.</li>
            <li> As with 99% of all acne and blackhead products on the market, it&#x27;s yet another formulation of 2% salicylic acid in a mixture. The warming part is interesting upon first use since the product feels very warm on your fingers for about 2 seconds but isn&#x27;t at all noticeable on your face. Since it&#x27;s not warm after application, it doesn&#x27;t seem to add anything to the cleansing action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of usage, I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is better or worse than another other salicylic acid product on the market. The results for me have been the same as every other product I&#x27;ve ever used and there are cheaper products in the supermarket that offer the same treatment.</li>
            <li> Never used a self heating cleanser before...but this product is great. Nice smell, warming sensation is short but still nice. I would use it again.</li>
            <li> I use this about every other day, as it is an exfoliating and I do not want my face to dry out.  It works very well and hasn&#x27;t really dried my face as other products have.  I really recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> The action of 2% salicylic acid and active warming treats the skin effectively for acne. Before I proceed further, I must preface this review with my skin type and amount of acne: very oily skin, little acne. I also want to include that I use this product in the shower once daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must be forewarned about the warming action; it will surprise you the first time you use this product. It gets HOT for about two seconds then cools down to a manageable temperature. I enjoy it each morning but for some it may be overpowering. I recommend rubbing the cleanser in your hands the first time to feel it heat up. You must rub the solution to heat it up, pouring it on your hands will not heat it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of using this cleanser, I have had minimal breakouts and my blackheads are less noticeable. To be clear about blackheads, nothing short of mechanical squeezing will remove blackheads completely. Therefore this solution works to diminish the appearance but does not clear your face of them.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews that complained about the shortness and/or necessity of the warming aspect of this scrub. Here&#x27;s my take on it: When you wash your face, you should ALWAYS start with HOT water and end with cold water. The reason being, that hot water opens your pores &amp; cold water closes them. So, it&#x27;s actually a genius idea! If you read the directions, it says to &amp;#34; wet your face, but apply to DRY hands.&amp;#34; So, I tried it, and true enough, it didn&#x27;t get warm until I started rubbing it on my face. This warmth opens up the pores, thereby allowing the scrub to get into my pores &amp; clean out the oil &amp; dirt, then I rinsed it with warm water again to make sure I got out all of the scrub, then followed with cold water to close my pores. If you don&#x27;t rinse it with warm water 1st and you use cold water, you&#x27;ve just locked the scrub into your pores, possibly causing more irritation. If you don&#x27;t end with cold water, your pores are still open, leaving them to get more dirt into them, which defeats the whole purpose! And I believe the reason the warmth is so short lived,  is so it doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin. Sacylic acid can cause you to break out worse, making your skin peel,  if you deplete your skin of all your natural oils.  If you follow these instructions, I believe this product will work well for most people... it did for me!!  BTW, I have sensitive, oily skin in the t-zone. I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well for me and the smell is nauseating</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. it feels great when you put it on and it really does the job. My face feels awesome when I am done. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or dry.</li>
            <li> I like it but I think it&#x27;s good marketing that makes you buy. It warms up for maybe 3 sec and makes it feel like it works more but when I think about it I take hot/warm showers anyway so that&#x27;s what opens your pores but don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s a good scrub !</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of facial cleansers and scrubs over the years.  In fact, I have three separate bottles in my shower right now, including this Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser, which I have been using exclusively for the past two-to-three weeks.  It certainly stands out as different.  Amazingly enough, this cleanser really does heat up when I rub it in my hands.  The beads are potent enough that I feel them, so if you prefer a softer wash then this is probably not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I am disappointed overall.  I have occasional issues with acne, and the products that I was using before trying this Biore cleanser had all worked fine for me.  After a few days using this product, however, small patches of acne formed on both my neck and face.  From what I could tell, this was not an allergic reaction.  I kept using the Biore cleanser - along with other post-shower creams - and the acne slowly went away.  But between the semi-roughness of the cleansing beads and the sudden acne flare-up, I&#x27;m afraid I cannot offer this a solid recommendation.</li>
            <li> Does seem to help my stubborn blackheads area.</li>
            <li> This works really well. I help it along by holding a hottish wet cloth to my fast before using the cleanser.</li>
            <li> This was a dud for me. Another gimmicky product that just didn&#x27;t do it for me. Gets hot and makes my face tingle, but doesn&#x27;t actually clean it. Tried it daily for 2 weeks and I started breaking out more. I have generally oily skin and this didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and I like it. The delivery was on time and the product quality is good.</li>
            <li> This item dried my skin out badly.  I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my nose does a really good job at keeping blackheads, and the Biore strips do a decent enough job at removing them, but I want to make sure that I have another weapon in fighting them. The warming cleanser from Biore, over the last two weeks, has done a good job at reducing the number of them on my nose. The warming was strange at first but you quickly get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happier. It&#x27;s reduced, not eliminated, the number of blackheads on my nose so I feel less gross.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff! It gets quite warm when using it, but only lasts about 30 seconds. The wetter your face is, the faster it will warm up. Seemed to help my blackheads! They are lighter now. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> It feels great when you wash your face.</li>
            <li> Really amazing product, can do beyond what I paid. Directly after applying the cleanser, you will start feel it worming up your face this step is preparation for any facial cleaning steps. My skin is very sensitive so it’s worked with me. I started with one product from this brand and now I’m regular customer for most of their products. I hope their quality still same along with the reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> it gets hot when applied and it eventually desolves some of the blackheads, it’s fun</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Biore products yet this one disappointed.  Touted as a warming anti-blackhead cleanser - this cream goes on with an initial burst of warming heat and then feels like ordinary cream.  For me, the warming effect doesn&#x27;t last longer than a few seconds.  My skin type tends to be combination - this cleans the skin without drying but it did not seem to be efefctive against existing blackheads - it is more of a preventative product.  I don&#x27;t think it did a good job cleaning away pore-clogging dirt as I would have expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I prefer the Biore strips which have visible results and I prefer foaming cleansers to this product - but that may be personal preference.</li>
            <li> Dont work- I think I had more breakouts afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend to anyone. Aveeno is way better esp with its mini beads for facial scrub.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite cleanser! I won&#x27;t be putting my trusty Noxzema away, as it serves a different purpose (soothing cold; this Biore is soothing hot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really fast and feels wonderful if you like hot. I use it on my face, neck, chest, and under my arms (prior to shaving). I love how clean my skin feels afterwards! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either. I have dry skin but I can go all day without moisturizer after using this, if I want to. I hope they never discontinue this! I also love Biore ultra pore strips and love those too. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Biore but this is even better than all their other products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for my skin, but it does warm up like it says it does. I don&#x27;t like the feel of this stuff either. The texture reminds me of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Definitely not for me. I have very oily skin, and use a specialized routine that works fairly well, but I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new products. I tried this hoping that it would get rid of some of the blackheads I notice on my nose. I used it for a couple of weeks, and I broke out and actually had more black heads than usual.</li>
            <li> Made my face feel AMAZING .... and ive noticed my face having a nice glow to it / without a baby lol</li>
            <li> My first impression was that the cleanser is very thick and not easy to apply. I have to use a bit more than other facial cleansers as it doesn&#x27;t smooth across my face well. It really was &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; though. Not sure what that accomplishes, but it is warmer on the face than other cleansers. After rinsing off, it definitely dries out my skin - which is good for breakout/oily areas. But not good for my skin in this harsh winter weather I&#x27;m experiencing right now. I had to use extra moisturizer afterwards. I&#x27;m sure this works well, but I&#x27;ll just be using it on spot areas until my skin isn&#x27;t so dry already.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and it works well for my oily skin type. Does what it says. I love it.</li>
            <li> Clears up breakouts quickly. Love the warming affect! I use this everyday after hot yoga to get out all the dirt and grime that builds up after 45 minutes of solid sweating.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels and then with a little extra water it feels warm again -- and it helps with my pores size</li>
            <li> Good stuff it works really well for me and keeps oil to a min. And gives a nices scrub too.</li>
            <li> Nice warm feeling, scrub for a minute and it does remove some blackheads. Pretty good. Acts great as a general exfoliant too.</li>
            <li> This facewash warms your face immediately upon application. It is unique and feels great. The little micro beads in it make you feel like you are cleaning your face well. However, I have seen no improvement in my blackheads, not even minor improvement. I feel like a product should deliver what it promises. This is despite the fact that I didn&#x27;t believe it would work anyway. I will continue to buy this product just because I like the warmth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend product, especially if you have blackheads...  mine disappear every time I use the product. Goes on smooth and warm.  Easy to use.  Feels good after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since middle school and am now 20, needless to say, I still struggle with blackheads and minor acne breakouts. Nothing that I&#x27;ve ever tried in my 8 years of suffering from acne has worked. Until now! This cleanser is amazing :) after a week of using it every night in the shower, my blackheads have literally started to disappear before my eyes. The tough ones on my nose that I thought if have forever have shrank a considerable amount and on my cheeks, they&#x27;re almost gone. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will make sure that I always have this face wash with me. Hello clear skin for the first time in years!</li>
            <li> Like a spa every morning. Just make sure that you dont rub the product between your hands before applying. Directly rub it on your face. The warming sensation is really relaxing</li>
            <li> Seems to be working great on my sons nose, tried a few things but this seems to do the job!</li>
            <li> I use this as my only facial cleanser.  It leaves my face clean but not dry, which is important as I have sensitive skin and live in a dry climate.  It is the only cleanser I have used on my face for years.</li>
            <li> This immediately heats up which feels great (though the heat doesn&#x27;t last long) and it smells so good.  I&#x27;d probably use it just for those two things, but the cleanser really works too.  It contains 2% Salicylic Acid and definitely works the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; out of clogged pores.  I noticed a difference even after the first use.  It&#x27;s also not overly drying like some products.</li>
            <li> I have a teenager who has some acne and blackheads, and I have always had an on and off relationship with acne and blackheads, so I thought between the two of us, we could benefit from this product.  At first, when you put it on your face in the shower, it does have a noticeable warm feeling.  Not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in the shower, but that feeling goes away after a few seconds.  Or, it could be because the product I was shipped in 3/14 was expired as of 6/13.  In any case, you don&#x27;t need a lot of product to wash your face with this.  I keep it on for what I think is about a minute, so the salicylic acid gets a chance to work its magic.  It rinses off fairly easily, and I don&#x27;t notice any dryness. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but maybe a few times a week.  I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my blackhead area; the end of my nose, but the area isn&#x27;t that bad right now.  In the summer, when I sweat a lot I will be able to see how effective this cleanser really is.</li>
            <li> This product came on time, and when using it I found that it actually WARMS! I felt it right away when I squeezed it on my hands, but it does settle down a little by the time you get it on your face so it doesn&#x27;t feel like your sking is burning. The product is exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Works great for your pores and blackheads , great for oily skin</li>
            <li> It was like halfway gone when I got it.</li>
            <li> There is no question that when it has came down to skin care products, Biore is one definite brand that not only delivers in price, but delivers very well in quality at getting the job done. Biore&#x27;s Anti-Blackhead Cleanser is absolutely no exception. It is a cleanser that works very well on the face at getting rid of blackheads, mainly on the nose and removes them very well without hassles and problems. I definitely like this not only because of the value, but keeps on delivering to what Biore has promised for the past several years on keeping your face clean. Now if only they could absolutely expand themselves, and get zits and blackheads removed from the rest of your body. Nevertheless, I absolutely recommend this cleanser from Biore not only because of price, but keeps the value warm, and the blackheads out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convience: B 1/2+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: B</li>
            <li> The warming level of this product is comparable with Boscia Detoxifying Black Cleanser that I have used in the past.  This product retails for $30 for 5oz so I was thrilled to actually find a drug store product that has warming to it for so much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff and it smells fantastic!  The warming sensation in the mornings feels amazing.  There are small beads in this product so you should not use with a automatic cleaning brush like Clarisonic or the Olay Cleaning System.  I find this works best if I place a nice amount in my hands and then gently message all over a wet face in the shower.  I rub in a circular motion a good minute after the warming of the product has stopped making sure to get into the areas where my skin gets clogged pores (T-Zone area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is typically clear with a lot of clogged looking pores on my chin and a round my noise.  It leaves my skin feeling nicely cleaned without over drying it.  I just found my new go- to face cleanser!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that tends to get a bit dry in the winter. Well, this works. It had little beads in i that exfoliate. The beads are not  coarse so you don&#x27;t feel as if you&#x27;re ripping your face off like with some other products on the market. I also must say, the smell is great. I try to stay away from perfumed products due to the nature of my skin. But this didn&#x27;t harm it. The product is very thick. I wet my face first, put a nice sized dollop on the palm of my hand, added a bit of water to loosen it up, rubbed my hands together –- that&#x27;s a must, don&#x27;t apply directly to your face – this heats up pretty strongly and can give off a strong burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an excellent product that has helped brighten my skin during these last lingering days of winter.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this stuff is 1% salicylic acid, which is pretty much the active ingredient in all blackhead cleansers. The Biore does warm up a bit initially when it gets wet, but that only lasts for about 5 seconds before it cools off. If you want to feel the warmth on your face, wet your face and apply the cleanser directly to the face without mixing it in your hands first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my face feels cleaner and moisturized, this cleanser does not get rid of all the blackheads. It gets a good chuck off, but I think only mechanical squeezing/sucking actually gets blackheads out completely.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for helping you with those blackheads. I love the fact that it warms when you are spreading it on your face. This is a staple in my cleaning routine and I will be using this for years and years!</li>
            <li> I believe the old formula in the green tube was better, but this newer formula works fine. Heats up and deep cleans your face.</li>
            <li> I prefer alpha hydroxy over this. I didn&#x27;t like the warming because it only stayed warm for maybe a second or two. I will let my teenagers use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it her face and nose is so smooth and she loves the tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is a wonderful product. First of all, it doesn&#x27;t have an icky smell. Second of all, the warming cleanser does get your face clean.  There&#x27;s this stubborn place on my chin that always seemed resistant to being cleaned, and this cleanser has done good results on that area already. Third, the warmth is tolerable and comfy, not painfully scalding. I have oily/combo sensitive skin, and if I can handle it, chances are you can too. (If you have super sensitive skin and/or heat sensitivity issues, this might not be the best product for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re worried about sensitivity issues, try using the product at night to see if you have problems, so that way if you do, you could at least sleep some of the damage off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to increase the warming affects, try using this cleanser while you&#x27;re in a hot shower in the bathroom. The steam from your shower, plus the warmth from the cleanser really does add to the cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come in a larger size. Please, Bioré, consider making this product in a larger bottle. This product is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin type and I was hoping this would clear some minor blackheads.  I was not impressed...it did not get rid of my blackheads and it made my face break out even more than my one or two pimples I get a month.  Would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love the sensation I get from using this product, but no significant change in skin condition.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Warming as described.</li>
            <li> The best blackhead soap ever..</li>
            <li> Honesty! I am actually impressed. I have never had bad facial acne or anything like that, but over the years my nose and chin have started to act up and have had some pretty big/deep black heads. The kind where you could destroy your face picking bc they are SOO tempting. At first I wasn&#x27;t convinced this would work, but two weeks in - I can say it does work. Maybe not like a prescription medicine would, but I see a lot less oils and large blackheads in the pores on my nose, and have NO blackheads on my chin. A few more weeks and I may be blackhead free.   My procedure:  I use this every morning in my t-zone (forehead, nose, and chin). I leave it on for about 2 minutes after rubbing it in and take it off with cold water. I then moisturize afterwards and let that dry before I apply makeup. Also, I apply this on my face on the nights where I am not taking a shower before bed. I&#x27;ll take my makeup off, scrub this into my entire face, leave on for 2 minutes, remove with cold water, and moisturize.   It is not drying at all and the heat is not overpowering. It also doesn&#x27;t cause that &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; feeling some cleansers cause that make you want to stand in front of a fan after applying your facial lotion. It&#x27;s a very mild, but useful product.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this.  It really warms as it cleans.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  It really does have a nice warming sensation that helps to open your pores in order to get a good clean scrub.</li>
            <li> Biore products make my face feel awesome!</li>
            <li> I really love this product! It gets really warm and my face feels so clean and calm after using it.  I would recommend washing your face before using this with another product because it does not lather real well but it&#x27;s simply divine!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead cleanser any more. This product has totally no effect on cleaning blackhead. I used it once or twice every day. But every day right after using it, I could see the blackheads still there. And today I didn&#x27;t use it, only wash my face with water, the blackheads are the same as I used the cleanser. So don&#x27;t buy this cleanser, it is the same as water.&lt;br /&gt;I firstly thought it would work, because I really felt warm when I used it. But actually it has no effect on blackheads.</li>
            <li> This is a good cleanser.  I had some acne, not a lot, and the added acne fighting ingredient helped with that.  But there is also a warming action to this cleanser.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this before, that aspect will probably surprise you.  But after a short time, maybe a minute or so, the temperature goes to normal again.&lt;br /&gt;  It was a good cleanser and you need only use a small amount, so it should last a while, even if the bottle seems small.  The combined warming sensation and acne treating cleanser is something you don&#x27;t find in other products.  If you&#x27;re interested in trying it for those aspects, it is a good product.  Acne lotions are probably better at treating acne, but this cleanser is a good product to try.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I enjoy the warm feeling when you first put it on your skin. However, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at how well it seems to clean and get rid of dead skin without drying me out too much. I&#x27;m in my 40s with some adult acne but the typical teen acne products are too harsh for my skin. This cleanser has synthetic micro-beads which help to exfoliate without being abrasive the many other scrubs can be. My tween daughter who has developed some acne also uses it and it seems to help.</li>
            <li> Came a day early. Hard to find this stuff where I live. Warms up really nice and smells good and the little beads are great.</li>
            <li> I love the cleansing beads in this and the overall warming sensation you get when using it.  I keep on in the shower and one in the medicine cabinet.  Use it every day.  Awesome.  Your face feels so clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I think I tried this product before in the past but if so I don&#x27;t remember liking it this much. The first time I used it I saw less black heads on my noise right away. It seems to clean out my pores very well. I will but this product again.</li>
            <li> The warming sensation of this product along with the exfoliation were most notable.</li>
    </ol>
