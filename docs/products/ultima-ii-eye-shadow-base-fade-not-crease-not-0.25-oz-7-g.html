            <li>Highly recommend this great stuff.  </li>
            <li>As my last jar was about done, I decided to check on Amazon and was very happy when I found it available.  </li>
            <li>Makes your eyeshadow go on more smoothly and more evenly.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were more widely available.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply then shadow</li>
            <li>I was looking around trying to find a product for me a woman of color that would love to have eyeshadow show as true.  </li>
            <li>It helps eyeshadow go on smooth and even.  </li>
            <li>Use it alone to hide fine lines on lids too for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>but this one is worth</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress that even cheap eye shadow comes out beautiful and last all day long.  </li>
            <li>Now my shadow looks fresh even at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Each container lasts about 6 months and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This one is just right.  </li>

            <li>keeps my eye shadow in place and makes it look very vibrant!</li>
            <li>But after the first time I used it my fears were put to rest.  </li>
            <li>I use Mac eyeshadows so this product is a lifesaver for me as it allows me to use less of my eyeshadow as it keeps color true and easy to blend.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>

            <li>I have tried many bases over the years, even some of the most expensive and my eyeshadow would just  fade away.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is hard for me to find in the store anymore, so it&#x27;s nice to know I can get it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t crease, doesn&#x27;t fade and  keeps eye shadow as fresh as when applied earlier in the day.</li>
            <li>While it was a bit more expensive than at Ulta, I happily bought two--they last a long time--</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>your eyeshadow will not crease or fade, it will look fresh all day long.</li>

            <li> Finally a eyeshadow base that holds everything in place, no more faded color or creasing.....I have tried way to many to keep count but this one is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold....</li>
            <li> Ultima II Eye Shadow Base, Fade Not, Crease Not is well named, because it performs just as advertised. No matter what brand of shadow you use -- even the cheap stuff from the discount store -- it will give it a professionally applied look that will last all day. You won&#x27;t find yourself coming home at the end of the day with a smear of shadow under your eyes, making you look like a racoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful product that&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!</li>
            <li> I am happy that you carry this product!!</li>
            <li> After trying most all on the market over twenty years, this continues to perform the best.....it doesn&#x27;t crease, doesn&#x27;t fade and  keeps eye shadow as fresh as when applied earlier in the day.</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT product for anyone who has oily eyelids. It is the one and only product at all that controls the oil in my eyelids. Even without wearing makeup, it helps.  I can&#x27;t live without it. It helps eyeshadow go on smooth and even.  You will LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking around trying to find a product for me a woman of color that would love to have eyeshadow show as true.  And this has been an amazing addition to my makeup regime. I use it sparingly before applying my eye shadows and liner and it works wonders.  I can&#x27;t stress that even cheap eye shadow comes out beautiful and last all day long.  Great product.  Nothing but raves from me.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I will love to order more of this as it is the best eye coverage ever invented!</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and at first was worried about the amount of the base.  But after the first time I used it my fears were put to rest.  A little goes a very, very long way and keeps my eyeshadow looking fresh no matter how long I wear it.  I use Mac eyeshadows so this product is a lifesaver for me as it allows me to use less of my eyeshadow as it keeps color true and easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this great stuff.  Just need to use a tiny bit, so lasts a long time.  It evens out eyelid skin tone, eliminating sallow areas.  It stays in place all day and keeps eye shadow from fading.</li>
            <li> Always the best out there</li>
            <li> 10 years ago, I asked a friend of mine at the end of our 12 hour nursing night shift, how did she get her eye makeup to look like she just put it on, when did she have the time to re-apply eye makeup during the shift we just had - and she told me that she used Ultima II Fade Not, Crease Not. Ten years later I continue to use this product and sometimes alone just to have the luster of eye makeup and mascara and off I go.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply then shadow and it stays on all day, love this product!</li>
            <li> crease not fade not really does work.  your eyeshadow will not crease or fade, it will look fresh all day long. i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years as I have found this the best eye shadow base around.  I used to buy it at Ulta but they discontinued carrying it several years ago.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but never liked any as much as Ultima II Fade Not, Crease Not.  As my last jar was about done, I decided to check on Amazon and was very happy when I found it available.  While it was a bit more expensive than at Ulta, I happily bought two--they last a long time--so I should be in good shape.  I encourage people to try this product if you are searching for a good eye shadow base.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Used as a base keeps eye make up on all day looking fresh all day long. This was recommended by a friend in the cosmetic industry. She was spot on!</li>
            <li> Makes your eyeshadow go on more smoothly and more evenly.  I might have to buy more because my mom stole it. haha</li>
            <li> This is the best eye shadow base ever. Previous to using this product my eye shadow was always creased by the middle of the day.  Now my shadow looks fresh even at the end of the day.  The other thing that this helped with was the staying power of my eye liner.  It used to be that my eye liner would be gone by the end of the day but this product now helps it to stay on.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great buy! keeps my eye shadow in place and makes it look very vibrant! Purchase this product...You won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> The only eyeshadow base I have used that really works. It does not crease. Have been using it since 2003 when JC Penny carried Ultima II cosmetics.</li>
            <li> it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. as a base under eye shadow, it keeps shadow in place all day.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow base FADE NOT, CREASE NOT...out performs all other shadow bases...I&#x27;ve been using it for over twenty&lt;br /&gt;years...tried others on and off out of curiosity but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly on my lips because I get feathering of my lipstick even when I use lip liner. This not only keeps the feathering away, it also&lt;br /&gt;keeps lipstick on all day even when eating. Love this product. If you have trouble with lipstick feathering, give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is hard for me to find in the store anymore, so it&#x27;s nice to know I can get it through Amazon.  This product does an excellent job of preventing eyeshadow creasing and smudging eyeliner, even in humid temperatures.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money. One tub has lasted me over a year and still have plenty left. Never have a crease in my makeup. I&#x27;ve tries other shadow bases and this trumps them all.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 25 yrs, it keeps your eye makeup on all day, lasts a few months depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li> I usually but this product in Aus for three times the price but it is no longer available here great service</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeshadow base EVER.  I have tried many bases over the years, even some of the most expensive and my eyeshadow would just  fade away.  My shadow lasts all day now.  I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Still can be found.  Still one of the best eyelid primers.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. Cannot find in local stores, so always need to order from the internet.  Works so well as a shadow base and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The best eye primer EVER. Eyeshadow stays put 100% of the time until you take it off with remover. Use it alone to hide fine lines on lids too for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> this is the best product for keeping your eyeshadow on!!  I&#x27;ve used it for about 20 years.</li>
            <li> This is the best product of its kind.  I wish it were more widely available.  Each container lasts about 6 months and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase.  I&#x27;ve tried two other eyeshadow primers.  One didn&#x27;t do much of anything, and the other made the eyeshadow look gaudy.  This one is just right.  The eye shadow has just the right intensity without looking over done, and it stays on all day. As far as the jar being small, a little goes a long way.  Frequently, I have alergies to cosmetics.  Even if I like the product, many times, I can&#x27;t wear it becasue my eyes get itchy and swollen.  No problems with this one.</li>
            <li> Keeps eye shadow perfect all day. Even with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. I have tried others but none compare. This keeps your shadow on all day and the jar lasts forever... Just love it. Tried the Nars one that got rave reviews and found it to be awful.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fade Not Crease Not eyeshadow primer for many years now.  I&#x27;ve tried other eyeshadow primers - cheaper brands and more expensive brands - -and this is simply the best.  It performs great with cream eyeshadows and with mineral eyeshadows.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years..its the best !  So hard to find...so glad I can depend on Amazon to carry.</li>
            <li> Hard to find but so love this item.  It can be used alone or to help prolong the wear of eye makeup for a long day</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen this in the store&#x27;s in years and was glad to find it at Amazon.  This is the best product I have ever used for keeping my eyeshadow looking good all day!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for twenty years.  It really works.  Would recommend.  I have tried other products when I was unable to find it for a short while and nothing compares</li>
            <li> I have used this for over 15 years and I love it.</li>
            <li> Ultimate Eye shadow base is a great product. My eye shadow stays on my eyes the entire day&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li> I have very moist eyelids and this product works great.  My eye shadow lasts all day long.</li>
