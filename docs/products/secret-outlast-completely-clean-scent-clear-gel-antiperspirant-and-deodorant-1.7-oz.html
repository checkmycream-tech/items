            <li>However I still wanted to give this product a fair chance</li>
            <li>The scent smells good.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>perfect for when I travel, and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>but I received a free trial through the best product testing site ever; Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I tried this free for bzzagent and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try this product as part of a promotion brand with bzz agent and I loved it.</li>
            <li>in all, it was a good product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li>In the end it&#x27;s a good deodorant.</li>
            <li>I was in search of something that would be a perfect fit for my needs.  </li>
            <li>Good product that I am now switching to.</li>
            <li>Deodorant is something you are going to have to use every day, so it is important to use a brand that you are impressed with.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Smells so good for hours.</li>
            <li>, I told my mom this lady smells good.</li>
            <li>i always felt they went on &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; and it never felt like i was getting good protection...</li>
            <li>When my sample arrived I was very impressed with the look of the product and the pleasant fresh scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use for any situation, goes on great and washes off easily at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>so I could quickly plug this stuff as it is a great product!</li>
            <li>A perfect ending to my first postpartum shower!</li>
            <li>Amazing Amazing Amazing!</li>
            <li>And the scent is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is truly a great deodorant for sure.</li>
            <li>but I sure am happy to know that in an emergency I can count on its 48 hour protection and beyond.</li>

            <li>It feels nice on and isn&#x27;t sticky like some.</li>

            <li>and I honestly didn&#x27;t know I had an issue with it.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice.</li>
            <li>and the smell is really nice.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and it did not get on my clothing, so that is why I gave it 2 stars.  </li>
            <li>I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>so I loved that the odor protection lasted longer then 24 hours until I was able to get a shower later!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This also smells really nice and is not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>I received this deodorant from Bzzagent and this is my honest opinion about the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I was excited to try this!!</li>
            <li>It is not too strong but is pleasant and lasts all day (and night).</li>
            <li>The scent was very mild but pleasant.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong scent &amp; is very clean smelling!</li>
            <li>Well after using it for almost a week I can honestly say that I am very happy with this clear gel deodorant!  </li>
            <li>Also the clean scent has a very nice smell to it too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant out of the shower smell that lasts all day leaving me odor and wetness free.</li>
            <li>Wonderful light scent that keeps you fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I loved how easily it went on (with the solids I feel I&#x27;m gonna bruise</li>
            <li>She has very strong body odor</li>
            <li>It was very easy to come out and once applied</li>
            <li>It does better for me on cooler days than warm days when I am profusely sweating.</li>
            <li>so I was hoping for a nice and refreshing scent,</li>
            <li>The Completely Fresh scent is great.</li>
            <li>So far so good!!</li>
            <li>I Recieved this product free from bzz agent solely for testing purposes and its a really great product that smells great and drys fast</li>
            <li>It is the best of the line so far</li>

            <li>Im honestly amazed and in love with this product.</li>
            <li>The fresh scent is great also.</li>
            <li>The best thing is that it is clear</li>
            <li>Good protection, nice smell, dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The clear gel is very good and it didn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes and the nice fresh scent was great</li>
            <li>I liked the powder scent most about the deodorant I was using before this one, and this scent was just as enjoyable.</li>
            <li>It worked great for me, and that&#x27;s a lot to say because its been a hot Summer here.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong scent &amp; is very clean smelling.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong which is nice</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a gel deodorant</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s better on my shirts b/c</li>
            <li>As a Bzzagent, I received this deodorant as a sample in my latest Buzzkit.  </li>

            <li>I received free from Bzzagent campaign!  </li>
            <li>As a user of clinical strength deodorant, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work for me.  </li>
            <li>It does everything that I could ask for and more.</li>
            <li>Considering you use deodorant every day you better love it, and well I love mine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the floral scents and this is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>so I end up having to make more than one trip to the underarm to apply.</li>
            <li>Confident you&#x27;ll like this brand and be sweat free!</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this deodorant</li>

            <li>For those who aren&#x27;t very sweaty it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>After trying it, I have more Pro&#x27;s than Con&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It seems to eave a sticky feel, which I&#x27;m not too sure</li>
            <li>Also, the scent did not tickle my fancy as I am personally more attracted to floral scented deodorants.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was able to put it on at 4am,</li>
            <li>I simply love the scent</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got the chance to try it.</li>
            <li>I also loved the fresh scent that followed me all day.</li>
            <li>They are the stains that occur when sweat and deodorant collide; The stains that will not come out of your clothing no matter how many times you have attempted to &amp;#34;Shout&amp;#34; them out.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it would stain my top if I&#x27;m not wearing something sleeveless.  </li>
            <li>or else it would stain my top and make it look moist</li>
            <li>However, it was of course invisible as most gels always promise.  </li>
            <li>I Love it.</li>
            <li>I got to try this product for free!</li>
            <li>its not sticky like most gels</li>
            <li>and this is a gel I love</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>It does last for 48 hours, so I was impressed with that.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free from BzzAgent and giving my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this deodorant.  </li>

            <li>Got a free sample to try!</li>
            <li>definitely the best deodorant in the market.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I&#x27;m so glad that I discovered it.</li>
            <li>So I would buy this for sure</li>
            <li>Well, the best thing i can say is that it takes care of this big girls odor and sweat while working out or just being a mom.</li>
            <li>I received a sample from bzzagent to try and review this product, and I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed at how it didn&#x27;t leave any white residue or powdery marks on my clothes, which has always been a problem for me.</li>
            <li>Okay, people.</li>
            <li>Now I am in love.</li>
            <li>Finally a gel that is GREAT!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for anything more than something that can meet the expectations and claims.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>The scent is okay, but I prefer a sweeter smelling deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I love something that doesn&#x27;t leave a residue</li>
            <li>The clean scent was nice, I didn&#x27;t want anything was that was fruity or too potent.</li>
            <li>and it goes on clear, with this lovely cool sensation that is especially nice for the summer.</li>
            <li>The scent was nice, and well, clean.  </li>
            <li>and sometimes after!!&lt;br /&gt;Smell is great and natural, not overpowering, and best is that it last all day!!</li>
            <li>However I can see how this would be perfect for a long trip or maybe camping when you don&#x27;t always have access to a shower.</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and and smelling great!  </li>
            <li>The Completely Clean scent I was sent in my kit to try had a very strong smell that reminded me of my mother&#x27;s antiperspirant when I was growing up,</li>
            <li>The biggest issue for me is the &#x27;clean&#x27; smell!  </li>
            <li>What a lovely and clean refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent &amp; is very clean smelling.</li>
            <li>and when I had cooled off, took a quick whiff and didn&#x27;t smell anything but the clean smell of deodorant!!</li>
            <li>I am glad I received a free sample because I am BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>The product goes on clear and smells great, but I didn&#x27;t get the protection I was looking for.</li>

            <li>I loved that every time I really started to sweat, I could smell the deodorant,</li>
            <li>when I didn&#x27;t unintentionally apply  probably twice as much as I needed, it was actually really good.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it went on easily with no whiteness at all.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to twist and go on.  </li>

            <li>I totally love that it is a great smelling gel that glides on smooth and dries pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with his deodorant, it goes uneasy and dries fast.</li>
            <li>If you manage to remember to wear it before the B.O. starts, it&#x27;s pretty effective at keeping you smell-free.</li>
            <li>This is so perfect for dark and no-leaves clothes.</li>

            <li>The scent is very clean and fresh.</li>

            <li>MY NEW FAVORITE DEODORANT!</li>
            <li>Hi everyone new I receieve this product for free through a company for testing and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t super powerful either so don&#x27;t worry about it overpowering your favorite body splash or perfume.</li>
            <li>So, I found myself using various products, mostly Avon antiperspirant/deodorant which is cheap and mostly effective.</li>
            <li>It most certainly left no white residue on any of my clothing which was absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>i was pretty pleased with how well it</li>
            <li>I still prefer my original over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, odor protection is pretty important to me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dove Original Deoderant since I can remember but wanted to see what else is out there.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get this from BzzAgent to try out and review.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t plan on ever going back to another kind!</li>
            <li>I received a full size product to test from bzz agent for free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming this is so that it dries quickly, but I made sure to not use this deodorant right after shaving my arm</li>
            <li>When I first opened it I noticed the pleasant smell instantly (come on, you know that&#x27;s important!).</li>
            <li>Dry, Smelling great and</li>
            <li>It is called completely clean</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It keeps you smelling great and DRY without any staining.</li>
            <li>The smell was just like the name says CLEAN.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I can honestly say that while I love this product, I would not buy it, simply because its gel and I don&#x27;t like gel deodorants.  </li>
            <li>clean scent&lt;br /&gt;*Does</li>
            <li>I do like the Completely Clean scent</li>
            <li>It works great, I stay dry and clean all day.</li>
            <li>yet we want a strong antiperspirant to keep us fresh.  </li>
            <li>I have never been one to like gel deodorant, but thought the sound of no white residue sounded too good to be true, so</li>
            <li>, it has completely passed test after test and I am totally enjoying spreading the word and product!</li>
            <li>I am a bit fussy about deodorants and so far I love this one!</li>
            <li>By far, my favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li>The scent is not too much which I love and there is never that feeling of not being clean.  </li>
            <li>The scent was light and smelled fresh and clean like coming out of the shower and it lasts.</li>
            <li>First off the smell was amazing and it lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li>this one actually smells good and doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li>Any more really isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt cool and sticky for about 10 min of putting it on.  </li>
            <li>One good thing is no stains on your clothing as you do with a solid.  </li>
            <li>I received a full size deodorant as a Bzzz Agent, along with coupons to distribute.</li>
            <li>Tank tops, blouses, t-shirts, dresses etc etc are all now safe from those hideous and very distinguishable stripes.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, keeps my underarms hydrated, smells so fresh</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, it was like almost 90 degrees or better the whole time.  </li>
            <li>It smelled nice to me, and my 6yr old son agreed.  </li>
            <li>The product did last smell and wetness wise but the reason I gave it two stars was for the smell it has a chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable the way it works and it stays smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>When it is hot outside the cool feeling after applying feels great</li>
            <li>I gave it a full month to test</li>
            <li>so I could give it a full review</li>
            <li>, even went a night here and there without showering to get the full 48 hour effect and still felt like it worked well.</li>
            <li>The gel deodorant goes on nice and clear.</li>
            <li>It gave lasting protection even after a good bike ride.</li>
            <li>I loved that I could wear my sleeveless shirts or dresses and not have to worry about any white marks!</li>
            <li>I probably would have liked the scent when I was 12 or 13, but not now as an adult.</li>
            <li>One whole click is more than I want to put on.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good deodorant that does not leave white marks.</li>
            <li>It does not leave white marks on clothes so that is good.</li>
            <li>It works well, and the price is more than reasonable, I just seem to go thru a container rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It was great for the full 12 hour active day.  </li>
            <li>His other presentations are also welcome</li>
            <li>It has a great smell to it and they also offer other ones.</li>
            <li>It smells fine - the fragrance isn&#x27;t overwhelming and quickly goes away, but I just didn&#x27;t think it would be strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of the outlast is fresh and clean but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I was/am VERY impressed with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and clean, nothing overpowering on that end.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s great for my active schedule .</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>and it was smelling like fresh, clean</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky or goupy.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves no marks on clothes.</li>
            <li>I haved used it and put on my clothes really quickly</li>
            <li>When I apply the gel, it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel stickly like some gels do.  </li>
            <li>I want to be Super Mom.&lt;br /&gt;Secret</li>
            <li>The best part is that it lasted all day - even through my 30 day shred workout and left NO white residue on my work clothing.</li>
            <li>If it was ever on super sale then I probably would,</li>
            <li>It dries quickly upon application.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is a really good product it does go on clear and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Luckily it&#x27;s a liquid</li>
            <li>This one reminds me more of a men&#x27;s deodorant, and I definitely prefer something more fruity or floral.    </li>
            <li>Upon trying this product It didn&#x27;t fair well with myself, while it did smell great and it did soak in quickly and I had no white streaks, after a few hours of indoor and outdoor chores</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed Secrets new product and found it to have a fresh and clean scent.  </li>
            <li>An added bonus was that I was able to wear a light colored top without the deodorant itself leaving wet marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li>I love the clean smell of the deodorant, the ease of application and the clear tube</li>
            <li>It dries super fast, smells great-but not too strong.</li>
            <li>Changing shampoos for a couple weeks is an effective way to make my favorite shampoo work better when I switch back, so I tried the same technique for deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is seriously my favorite new deodorant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>I am not scared of staining my shirts, which is great since I wear a lot of black polos for work.</li>
            <li>it kept my pits dry, and smelled good doing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clear gel leaves a refreshing and cool feel</li>
            <li>Super fresh scent that lasts.</li>
            <li>It has an easily adjustable dial for pushing the gel out and even goes backwards in case you turn it too much.</li>
            <li>I was still going strong by the time I got ready for bed - even after work and two workouts.</li>
            <li>It keeps me odor free all day so that is a positive.</li>
            <li>My armpits were still pretty fresh!</li>
            <li>The actual anti-perspirant properties are great and really do keep sweat at bay through a range of activities even on hot days.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it it lasted all day!</li>
            <li>I kept me nice and clean and fresh all week long.</li>
            <li>I had love the Platinum Protection line they came out with in the early 2000&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This deodorant is definitely worth checking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I did feel fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>The fresh scent is not over powering and It didn&#x27;t stain clothes.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>though I received the product complimentary, the opinions are 100% mine)</li>
            <li>I put this deoderant to the true test of fate on a hot and humid day while visiting the zoo.</li>
            <li>I walked a mile in the sun and heat and no white marks and after doing a sniff test, still smelled nice.</li>
            <li>It is fresh but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I still smelled fresh too -- not just &amp;#34;not</li>
            <li>; but actually fresh.  </li>
            <li>Again, no sweat, no stains, all day, and still smelling fresh in the evening.  </li>
            <li>I love how it goes on clear and drys</li>
            <li>I love this product because it goes on clear as promised on the package.</li>
            <li>but the product fell short in more important areas for me and for those reasons I would not chose to use this product again.</li>
            <li>No fun!&lt;br /&gt;I am always on the search for products to keep me fresh.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly, smells fresh but not overpowering, does a decent job at controlling odor and doesn&#x27;t make a MARK on my clothes.</li>
            <li>Secret is already a great deoderant brand but now with Outlast they have taken the cake!</li>
            <li>Worth the $3.50&lt;</li>
            <li>it fresh 48-hour protection&amp;#34</li>
            <li>So obviously I liked that there were no white streaks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>its worth the time and money to try for yourself</li>
            <li>I also often use deodorants that are more &#x27;natural&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>but i was still fresh as flowers.</li>
            <li>I love the clear gel , it takes away any perspiration you may have .</li>
            <li>and i still smelled fresh.</li>
            <li>I love that it a clear gel</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need two clicks worth of deodorant.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no white streaks when I put on my dark clothes fr my previous deodorant-so I&#x27;m definitely a happy happy camper!!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and kept me dry and smelling fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>secret outlast is great protection to keep you clean and fresh all day even for 48 hours straight  could not ask for anything better  </li>
            <li>but I would buy it again for special occasions where I want to make sure I don&#x27;t have any chance of White Marks.</li>
            <li>There was also no irritation to my skin, even when applying right after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I did feel like I wanted to reapply right after my run</li>
            <li>I ran right out and bought this to replace</li>
            <li>I ad to play with the applicator to figure out how to get the right amount to come out</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try a clear gel deodorant as I have not had the best experiences with them in the past.</li>
            <li>love the protection it offers- between pregnancy,  a hot and humid East Coast summer,  and having to chase toddlers all day</li>
            <li>This accomplishes both of those tasks while smelling very, well, clean.</li>
            <li>The best part about it is it really does go on completely clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on any clothing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, and it really does keep smelling good.</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant but not overpowering scent, and I never felt like my underarms were consistently wet or sticky, which is normally the case when I use clear gels.  </li>
            <li>It is completely clear, it smells great, and the protection really does last!</li>
            <li>I really like floral, fruity, or sweet smelling deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Glides on smooth &amp; cool and is dry quickly!  </li>
            <li>It washes off easily in the shower but does not come off during the day, and I live in a hot, humid climate.</li>
            <li>This is amazing at keeping up with you all day in keeping you fresh and dry!</li>
            <li>First, the smell even though is supposed to be the same in both deodorant in the Clear Gel one is sooo smelly like my daughter said, it really have a great smell.</li>
            <li>With it being such a hot time of year and such a busy day I figured it&#x27;d be the perfect time to try it out.</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry, smelling amazing all day, and it doesn&#x27;t make any marks/stains on any clothing.</li>
            <li>No thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Bzzagent gave me some Secret Completely Clean Clear Gel to try out and review, and I&#x27;m honestly impressed.</li>
            <li>I do feel like you would go through this quickly, just because the Gel comes out so much with one click.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different types of deodorant and haven&#x27;t been that happy with any of them.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that I love not having to worry about deodorant marks on any of my clothes, and I feel fresh all day regardless of the temperature outside.  </li>
            <li>Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant is that the scent &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; actually smells good, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter if it does not last or work effectively.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I really like this brand of deodorant, have been using it for years because it really keeps me odor free.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant is awesome.</li>
            <li>I was truly exciting in hopes that I would find a better antiperspirant deodorant than what I have been using, I was iffy on gel because I&#x27;ve always used Solid.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it on your clothes.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with Secret Outlast from the very 1st day.</li>
            <li>I liked the 48 hour protection and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks which is nice when I&#x27;m wearing a dark colored tank.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very overwhelming like other deodorants.  </li>
            <li>BzzAgent send me this product few days ago, and so far, so good!</li>
            <li>Honestly, this doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent at all; I only smell it when I&#x27;m actually trying to smell my armpit.  </li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Clear Gel is the best it dries quickly after application and does not feel sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li>The Completely Clean scent isn&#x27;t too over powering, but it&#x27;s more floral than I expected with the name.</li>
            <li>The gel smelled good (not overpowering) and dried very fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel wet or sticky and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of the Completely Clean was much too strong, but I definitely wanted to test the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Better yet, it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my costumes and under my arms!</li>
            <li>it is so nice, not so much people really notice a different smell on you</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you get as many uses in the container as you would with a solid.  </li>
            <li>Never switching back :)</li>
            <li>well enough let alone for more than 7 hours unlike the 48 hours</li>
            <li>Overall this product does what it says and keeps any marks off of your clothes which I love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start with the pros of this product first.  </li>
            <li>used mine on really hot days (95+) while hiking and geocaching.</li>
            <li>I am able to try this product for free from BzzAgent, and so far I have been using it daily.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s clear and goes on smoothly without having to worry about having white marks on my clothes or under my arms.  </li>
            <li>but I tried a free sample of 48 hour clear gel</li>
            <li>This is the first deodorant that I have tried in gel form.</li>
            <li>i did receive this specific deodorant thru bzzagent.com to try which is my favorite for all you stay at home moms</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s packed and ready to go in my hospital bag!  </li>
            <li>it was hot and humid...</li>
            <li>and the fact it works and actually works for up to two days and sometimes more.</li>
            <li>The second application was much better-</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>But it goes on so much cleaner than the powdered stick that it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not cautious of putting too much on, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate freshly shaved skin.</li>
            <li>I had received this product as a trial from them and will definitely be buying more of it</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find a product that worked well enough</li>
            <li>even on extremely hot days.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this deodorant and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time .</li>
            <li>When I first applied this deodorant, I was suspicious that I would end up not liking it.</li>
            <li>it dries fast and leaves you feeling fresh for hours</li>
            <li>and I think this is a pretty close substitution.</li>
            <li>I just love that I can put it on &amp; change clothes 10 times-with no fear of getting white marks all along the bottom of my shirt!!!</li>
            <li>The scent is only okay.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This goes on smoothly and dries completely within seconds.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell and it is long lasting.</li>
            <li>The thing with solid deodorants is that it would leave a white build up under my arms which didn&#x27;t help me feel sexy when I lifted my arms while wearing a halter top.</li>
            <li>I was luckt enough to try this deoderant free from bzzagent!</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li>It does not leave white stains as most of the stick deodorants do.</li>
            <li>It was the first day of using it.</li>
            <li>Got to try this clear gel for free as a member of Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>surely buy and definitely recommend&lt;</li>
            <li>If you are a heavy sweater with good kidneys, it might be just what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>I like the clean scent but would love to try other scents.</li>
            <li>With &amp;#34;Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel&amp;#34; deodorant stains be gone!</li>
            <li>It also keeps me fresh and dry throughout the day and no awful residue on my clothes.</li>
            <li>I really like how the clear gel puts on easily, I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product and it does not feel sticky.</li>
            <li>I did find it best to let it dry for a few seconds before putting a shirt on.  </li>
            <li>Love that the scent is mild, not to strong but long lasting.</li>
            <li>Goodbye to my old invisible solid as I am now in love with another gel!</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the Secret</li>
            <li>I want to keep this product in my life so that I can enjoy life a little better knowing that I am protected.  </li>
            <li>I have never been a fan of clear gels because they always feel so wet for a long time to me, and I&#x27;ve never been all that impressed with the protection (or lack of) that they provide.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a wearer of perfumes, every now and again I&#x27;ll use body spray, but other than that I&#x27;m a wash and wear, no make up, ponytail kind of woman.  </li>
            <li>Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel.</li>
            <li>Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel sample from bzzagent</li>
            <li>I only apply after my shower and it lasts all day long and still smells amazing!</li>
            <li>It rates as a 5 star for me because by far this is the best Secret product out there.</li>
            <li>Outlast Completely clean clear gel.  </li>
            <li>Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel.</li>
            <li>It smelled soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Clear Gel is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used in years!</li>
            <li>I think Secret Outlast Clear gel deodorant is great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying so many different deodorants and haven&#x27;t really found one that works the way I like</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Clear Gel works incredible!</li>
            <li>and I have black top tested it, no marks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean, clear, confident dry.</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t like gel deoderants, but i was willing to check out anything that promises to keep up with louisiana heat and humidity!&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty run-of-the-mill, but if you&#x27;re about function over aesthetics, then it shouldn&#x27;t bother you too much.</li>
            <li>I was happy to receive a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant from BzzAgent to try out for free and I must say they have amazed me yet again.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel confident all day long.</li>
            <li>I used it the next day and decided to wear a tube top and felt so free with no worries of white build up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pretty excited to try a new deodorant, especially with summer here and in full heat, and if it claimed to do everything it said, this was going to be a match made in heaven.  </li>
            <li>No other deodorant has worked as well to keep me smelling and looking fresh!</li>
            <li>Ultimately it is less product you are wearing and the scent is just amazing to me.  </li>
            <li>and then it seemed they thinned that line out in favor of less effective varieties.</li>
            <li>Ok I will start by saying that it does keep me dry</li>
            <li>The gel feels alittle sticky and takes time to feel dry, smell is okay,</li>
            <li>And then - dry and comfortable all day!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin &amp; this deodorant</li>
            <li>I am super sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>By the end of the day I was still dry and odor free!</li>
            <li>But the fact that this dries completely and quickly, is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this antiperspirant -- always keeps me dry even during the hottest of days.  </li>
            <li>The liberating feeling of being free from white marks...for real!  </li>
            <li>However, the scent of the deodorant itself is so strong that it gave me an instant headache.</li>
            <li>(it was 105 yesterday, felt like 110) and you need something that is really strong and that will last!</li>
            <li>I love Secret brand deodorant anyways but Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gear Gel is awesome!</li>
            <li>What I love the most, is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks or residue on my dark clothes.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I don&#x27;t have to try that too often, but it is good to know that it is very long lasting as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzzagent.com and Secret for allowing me to try this great product for free.  :O)</li>
            <li>I love how this one works and keeps me dry!</li>
            <li>So this was my first time trying the secret outlast completely clean clear gel &amp; might I say this is a new favorite!!</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast clear gel deodorant in the Completely Clean Scent is amazing!  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent on this one isn&#x27;t overpowering, and the smaller sizes have been great to travel with (and yes these can go on the plane with you in the little baggie).</li>
            <li>I love gel because it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your clothes and for real, the Outlast version seems to really do what it promises - keep your pits dry!  </li>
            <li>I am really picky about the scent of my deodorant and</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Secret Outlast is great.</li>
            <li>This deodorant really does offer all day protection and freshness.</li>
            <li>I truly value the Secret Brand because they do have great products.</li>
            <li>in am, when I am running around gettting my kids ready and myself dressed thankfully no marks on my clothes</li>
            <li>It really works well.  </li>
            <li>i recommend it really</li>
            <li>... is way too much for me.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a deodorant that really lived up to</li>
            <li>This is absolutely something I would recommend to friends or anyone else.</li>
            <li>This was very unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s there because I do play soft ball and still smell fresh afterword&#x27;s, no marks on your clothes and also doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast, does not leave any marks and protects the user from sweat.</li>
            <li>and I found that I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much as I do with powdered deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to take and test the product as much as I could before I talked with anyone about it</li>
            <li>Compared to the 4-5 reapplications of some deodorants I have used, I really needed it once.</li>
            <li>and it is VERY noticeable if she skips using deodorant and when I approach the issue with her she tends to just get embarrassed and flustered</li>
            <li>didnt feel sticky and lasted the whole day</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t give up, figuring I probably just accidentally used too much.  </li>
            <li>get when I apply it, and the fact that way too much comes out at once.</li>
            <li>The gel drys fast.</li>
            <li>I purchased an &#x27;advanced&#x27; solid that had 48 hour odor protection.</li>
            <li>I recently got to try a sample for free as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li>I tried this deodorant recently for free through a promotion from the brand</li>
            <li>Product goes fast ...</li>
            <li>I wore it for 32 hours straight without reapplying it</li>
            <li>It dries SO fast.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and dries almost instantly.  </li>
            <li>So, I had gotten the Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try for free for being a BzzAnget and spread the good word.</li>
            <li>It works way better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>As a BzzAgent that recieved this product as a free sample to try, I&#x27;d like to start off this review by saying I only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like gel deoderants.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think this goes on with a scent or even dries with a scent.  </li>
            <li>do think this product goes by really fast.  </li>
            <li>the product for free thanks to Secret, but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need 48 hour protection since I shower every day.</li>
            <li>I am a person that loves scent so the scent was very pleasing to me and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Switched to this and have been very happen ever since</li>
            <li>I  have got this for a promotion from secret to try out its great</li>
            <li>It was better than expected.</li>
            <li>But this product is ABSOLUTELY none of those things.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s held up really well.</li>
            <li>Also, the way this dispenses helps you not to use too much.</li>
            <li>You can tell just how much you need</li>
            <li>hahaha.</li>
            <li>I really like this deo</li>
            <li>but I really do like the gels.</li>
            <li>I received this through a BzzCampaign and tried it for close to a month and have really like it.</li>
            <li>it dries fast.</li>
            <li>Also, it keeps my underarms smooth especially after shaving.</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work for me because I have never been one to like gel deodrant but to my suprize I absolutely love Secret</li>
            <li>&amp; I love how it goes on clear without leaving any white marks.  </li>
            <li>I will start off by saying that I was given this product from BzzAgent and Secret for free to try, in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>received this product for free from Secret through BzzAgent in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work for me because I have never been one to like gel deodorant but to my surprise I absolutely love Secret</li>
            <li>I was able to try this as a promotion from bzzagent &amp; secret :)</li>
            <li>I will sue the gel for days its hot and icky as this cools me down and works great!</li>
            <li>I loved that I could wear black and blue shirts, and I did not have any marks showing that I had put on my deodorant first.</li>
            <li>Have been using the clear gel product forever!!!</li>
            <li>Really love this deodorant, only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star was due to the fact it does burn when I put it on right after a fresh shave.</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry, smelling great, and I have one less thing to think about throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It kept me dry without being so dry that I was itchy, and I really loved the scent.</li>
            <li>One reviewer commented the smell wasn&#x27;t what they expected, but I think it smells clean and fresh</li>
            <li>yet it dries super fast, I can put on my clothes right away not having the need to wait for it to dry</li>
            <li>I would like to try the other scents to see if they suit me better.  </li>
            <li>The Secret Outlast Clear Gel was great at doing exactly what it says: no marks, odor and sweat protection.</li>
            <li>The Completely Clean scent is slightly strong at first, but as soon as it dries it just has a faint clean smell.  </li>
            <li>I thought for sure I was going to have that dreaded odor we all get when being overly active...</li>
            <li>There are a variety of scents available,but as of yet I have only tried the Completely Clean sent, I can&#x27;t wait to try the others out.</li>
            <li>Slightly larger than your average travel size so would be good to throw in your purse for emergencies as well.</li>
            <li>Its long lasting and a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I loved that it went on clear and dried within seconds, leaving me safe to put my arms down and not ruin my shirt!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it was strong enough without being clinical strength.  </li>
            <li>However, it IS a strong product, and if you have sensitive skin or if you wax/epilate, it definitely can burn when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>The deodorant does last for awhile, but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it for more than a day, especially for those who live in a hot climate like I do.</li>
            <li>not only did it have a pleasant, but not overpowering scent, but it went on smooth, dried fast without any white marks, and didnt make me feel wet for putting on a gel, and kept me smelling fresh!.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product a long time and enjoy it.</li>
            <li>All day long I don&#x27;t feel as comfortable as I did with the gel...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Secret was nice enough to let me try this #LifeHack for free!</li>
            <li>With two kids that makes going to the store a whole day event because of the heat!&lt;br /&gt;We normally are drenched with sweat by the time we get in or out of the car.</li>
            <li>I have no ugly white marks on my shirts.</li>
            <li>I received a sample size Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant stick for free from BzzAgent as a promotion to test and honestly review this product.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; deodorant fragrances, but this one is nice - not too manly or soap scented.</li>
            <li>Gel dries quickly, NO white marks on my clothing, love the scent, and it REALLY does last 48 hours!!!</li>
            <li>Many thanks to Secret and BzzAgent.com for the free sample.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product.  </li>
            <li>Little hard to remove in the shower best to use a washcloth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will be my new go to!</li>
            <li>Clean Fresh scent that never let&#x27;s you down.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and it lasted for a long time!</li>
            <li>a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com, but all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad too that the gel is colorless and doesn&#x27;t stain my black shirts.  </li>
            <li>claims to keep me odor free and dry for 48 hours</li>
            <li>Secret outlast has clear gel ,smooth and pleasant smell especially 48 hours odor production.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Secret Outlast and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and clear with no white marks!!  </li>
            <li>but, personally, I think it&#x27;s kinda gross to go without a shower for more than 24 hours</li>
            <li>The complete clean smell is good not to flowery or fake smelling and it&#x27;s only a mild smell too.  </li>
            <li>I love Secret Outlast Clear Gel Completely Clean scent!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the secret outlast clear gel deodorant as it is quick dying and last all day long.</li>
            <li>First of all, it really does dry quickly for a clear gel deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>All in all I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes that this would work</li>
            <li>In addition to the gel factor, it also lost points for its seemingly high alcohol content.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to secret I was able to try the Outlast clear gel deodorant for free.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh and clean scent to it, not very overwhelming at all like some deodorants.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh and clean scent to it, not very overwhelming at all like some deodorants.</li>
            <li>Right away, I was happy with Secret Outlast Clear Gel because it didn&#x27;t leave a white residue on my clothes.</li>
            <li>(if you drop it, it&#x27;s coming out of those little holes at the top).</li>
            <li>Also, Do not leave yucky white residue on pretty summer clothes!</li>
            <li>Unlike other deodorants, I found that this one gets used up pretty quickly; maybe it&#x27;s because it is in a gel-form.</li>
            <li>For me in my opinion I think it is better than any other brand too!!</li>
            <li>it dried so quickly, and really kept me feeling dry all day (even during days that were super hot!)</li>
            <li>I would recommend Secret Outlast to anyone looking for a deodorant free from white marks, stickiness, wetness and looking to be fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secret Outlast really does go on completely clear.  </li>
            <li>So far I really haven&#x27;t noticed any negatives about the product.</li>
            <li>Never going back to the solid again , not only does this smell amazing</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it as my normal deodorant</li>
            <li>Normally I have to apply deodorant two to three times a day.  </li>
            <li>It left no marks on any of my clothes and it kept me fresh on a weekend camping trip where my options to &amp;</li>
            <li>and I stay smelling fresh into the next day.  </li>
            <li>Its especially great in the summer when you wear short sleeves or tank tops and dont want to get the white deodorant on your clothes or worse</li>
            <li>i thought it was the normal size I always see at the drugstore</li>
            <li>but otherwise I&#x27;m sticking to my normal brand.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to use it without too much trouble.  </li>
            <li>I decided I would give it a try because I know that secret is a good brand.</li>
            <li>a member of one2one network, I received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from the clearly better challenge.</li>
            <li>I liked how the Secret Outlast deodorant, which I got as a free sample, from BzzAgent, dried quickly, so didn&#x27;t have to wait before finishing getting dressed.</li>
            <li>I packed my Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel in my hospital bag because I was looking forward to smelling clean and fresh after having my baby.</li>
            <li>and it is not hard to get the gel to come up.</li>
            <li>I sweat quite a bit, even without physical exertion and this kept me dry even in the most stressful of situations.</li>
            <li>It does go on wet, clear, &amp; drys very quickly (within minutes).</li>
            <li>It really does keep me dry and fresh even when I&#x27;m working in my garden.</li>
            <li>I put it to the ultimate test by keeping up with my kids all day outside and it held strong.</li>
            <li>have finally found the right deodorant for me.  </li>
            <li>I put on my invisible solid and right way</li>
            <li>It was easy to use - even though it was a wet gel, it dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gell works better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel product.  </li>
            <li>It leaves no residue on my clothing, which is a huge advantage over other deodorants.</li>
            <li>but I feel as though gel deodorant doesn&#x27;t last as long as the powder white kind, so</li>
            <li>very small, but it smells nice</li>
            <li>I prefer the Clinical Strength over this one because it offers just a little more wetness protection.</li>
            <li>Using gel deodorant was a new thing to me</li>
            <li>my new go to deodora#epic4#...</li>
            <li>I live this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always leery about trying a new deodorant.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida.</li>
            <li>Secret has always been a good brand in my opinion but the new clear gel product exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>It does dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent, I thought it held up well under harsh conditions of running outside in 90 degree weather.</li>
            <li>and I just wanna say I loved my secret outlast clear deodorant.</li>
            <li>This Secret was a great price, especially when I used the coupon for it.</li>
            <li>I felt like it never dried completely, and my underarms felt very sticky all day.</li>
            <li>As I got older I needed stronger wetness protection that clear gels just weren&#x27;t affording me.</li>
            <li>Where I live is very hot and humid and I like my deodorant  to keep me dry, for me</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells and this doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive armpits and can&#x27;t use a lot of deodorants.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Oh, another thing I love about this deodorant is that even is a gel it doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry.</li>
            <li>and I can say it dry pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Hello clear gel!</li>
            <li>I have never used clear gels!</li>
            <li>It also dries fast and feels clean and fresh after applying, the only thing I do not like is that it did not completely keep me dry every time I used it.</li>
            <li>and yay to those days that it is so hot outside</li>
            <li>That is when I realized that it was definitely too much!  </li>
            <li>I have, by accident, gone 48 hours without reapplying and I was surprised to find that the deodorant was indeed still working!</li>
            <li>I was however, pleasantly surprised with this!</li>
            <li>im feeling sticky, I can feel the deodorant on my skin, it just doesn&#x27;t feel natural!</li>
            <li>I am interested to see if it can last 48hours.  </li>
            <li>It offers protection for up to 48 hours, although I have not tested it for that lenght of time, but its does get me through the day and thats all that matters!</li>
            <li>First day I used it, there was a lady next to me</li>
            <li>I am now fresh all day long</li>
            <li>It really does go on clear, dries fast and does not leave white marks!</li>
            <li>It keeps you fresh all day long</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I think this was a good move for Secret because I can honestly say that me and my panel of Outlast users hadn&#x27;t used ANY Secret deo products for years, maybe because of lack of brand knowledge, freshness of name or in your face marketing</li>
            <li>I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean for free to test it out, as part of a promotion from Secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean deodorant for free for review courtesy of BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I was given Secret Outlast completely clean to try for free from Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>Thank you Secret and BzzAgent for my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li>I will say with trying this new clear gel, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that.</li>
            <li>As a BzzAgent, I received a Bzzkit with a free sample of the Secret Outlast completely clean clear gel.</li>
            <li>I received my free trail of Secret Outlast completely clean and clear gel deodorant as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>It can keep her odor free for over 48 hours, which means less time trying to get her to put deodorant on</li>
            <li>it dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li>it kept me dry and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>My apprehension was quickly soothed, as I noticed that while it did go on wet....</li>
            <li>It does go on wet, but dries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wet when you first put it on, but it dries really fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new mom and the last thing I need is to be a sweaty mess on top of being sleep deprived.</li>
            <li>dries fast last long and gives off a fresh scent when the heat is on</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and a little gel goes a long way!!</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, clean and subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Well it didn&#x27;t dry fast and too much gel coming out .But</li>
            <li>It not only held up to keeping me dry and odor free through a 12 hour shift</li>
            <li>I wear alot of black for work, and simply because I love the color.</li>
            <li>I wear black alot, and I was pleased to see that it doesnt leave any white streaks or residue.</li>
            <li>This deodorant left me dry and odor free.</li>
            <li>I love how you can wear black and not worry about getting white streaks on your clothes.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I was hesitant on a gel because they are usually messy and take an an eternity to dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands in the past that have advertised the same clear no marks application and after much searching</li>
            <li>It glides on slightly wet and cool but dries within a few seconds and the scent is very &amp;#34;just showered&amp;#34; fresh which seems to linger throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It does go on wet, but clear, and dries very quickly, and does not leave white marks.</li>
            <li>It does go on wet, but clear, and dries very quickly, and does not leave white marks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving Secret Outlast Clear Gel!</li>
            <li>Something else that really surprised me is how well it kept me dry even in super stressful situations including, but not limited to; working out, work meetings and presentations, meeting new people, babysitting etc etc.</li>
            <li>This is one you have to try to believe and honestly I am tempted to try more of this collection as I still have 1 coupon left, Secret was generous with the coupons and EVERYONE I gave a coupon to thanks to the average deo price point bought it to try because it was an entire $1 off which made it a no brainer to give it a whirl...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll trade the wet feeling any day for the amazing smelling, long lasting, and no wet marks!</li>
            <li>The Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant is amazing</li>
            <li>It should also be noted that this product does not leave a stain or film on your clothes, it&#x27;s is truly clear.</li>
            <li>it truly is clear.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear and protects all day and night.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and stays clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always seen this Clear Gel Deodorant on the shelves at the store</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s clear so there are no worries about making marks on clothes.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear so there was no transfer on my clothing.</li>
            <li>This one is a clear gel</li>
            <li>I like the clear gel</li>
            <li>it goes on clear</li>
            <li>Works well, clear, no staining.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a fan of clear gel but decided to give this one a whirl.  </li>
            <li>Let me just make this clear</li>
            <li>This product goes on clear, no residue just protected.</li>
            <li>and I just started using Outlast Clear with this order.</li>
            <li>I do like that it is a clear gel</li>
            <li>Goes on clear  </li>
            <li>I have never tried clear gel before this product and did not expect it to feel so sticky after applying.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Clear Gel Convert!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>it goes on clear</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a clear gel deodorant in about 15 years.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I was extremely surprised that</li>
            <li>It has never left a white mark on my shirt, which is so important to me because I wear tank tops daily!</li>
            <li>I also like how it was invisible and not messy.  </li>
            <li>After chasing a 2 &amp; 6yr old around I haven&#x27;t had to worry about sweating and re-apply deodorant because I was worried how I smelled.  </li>
            <li>but as far as the protection</li>
            <li>The first day I used this was a really long day.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised at how well this deodorant works.  </li>
            <li>I have thrown out my old deodorant and I will be using this from now on.</li>
            <li>I have a 6 month old who spits up a lot</li>
            <li>I was surprised how it held up</li>
            <li>So far, 29 hours in the Florida heat</li>
            <li>I like the gel antiperspirant as it doesn&#x27;t stain as much, and doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks.  </li>
            <li>I probably would have preferred something unscented, or just a faint more natural smell, like a powder fresh or something.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast and has not left any marks on my clothes!</li>
            <li>This product works and it really does last.  </li>
            <li>but I was surprised.</li>
            <li>I work in a busy hospital and do a lot of walking</li>
            <li>For the fast drying I don&#x27;t think it was any faster then my regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really try out the 48 hour protection because it&#x27;s the middle of summer</li>
            <li>But maybe my smeller isn&#x27;t as sensitive as the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being a busy mom of a newborn and toddler</li>
            <li>Although, the Outlast is a very close second in my favorites.</li>
            <li>As an adult, I wear clear gel instead of solids</li>
            <li>It lasts 48 hours for me so far as I shower each morning</li>
            <li>Makes laundry much easier to not have to worry about those pesky white streaks!</li>
            <li>it really does last 48 hours...</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for those with sensitive skin like myself.    </li>
            <li>I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel from Bzzagent to try and give my honest opinion about it.</li>
            <li>I love that their are no sticky or white messy marks when I put it on</li>
            <li>Secret has made a really nice product.</li>
            <li>After using it the next few days, I cut down to using one half of the gel that came out in one click on each side, and that seemed to be the perfect amount.</li>
            <li>I recently received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a single mom, full time teacher, daily runner, and church attendee 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Secret Outlast gel and am completely in love with it--no wet feeling, no sticky feeling, just clean.  </li>
            <li>I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean scent clear gel deodorant complimentary of BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Living in Tennessee, summers are hot and humid so I need an antiperspirant that will keep up with me and keep me dry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge on my black tank top, it doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry, and it stays put.</li>
            <li>but it dry&#x27;s quickly and don&#x27;t turn white after.</li>
            <li>just a clean, natural scent that stayed with me all day and even garnered a few compliments on my smell</li>
            <li>Long lasting scent, goes on smooth with no white marks and no follow up perfume needed!</li>
            <li>short, I like that it has a more prominent scent than the invisible solid, but I really don&#x27;t like the cold and wet feelings in my underarms, and the fact that so much comes out with each click.  </li>
            <li>short, I like that it has a more prominent scent than the invisible solid, but I really don&#x27;t like the cold and wet feelings in my underarms, and the fact that so much comes out with each click.  </li>
            <li>I usually use the original solid from secret but I loved the clear gel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this gel that dries absolutely clear and leaves no white residue on clothing!  </li>
            <li>I was able to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel  through Secret for free!!</li>
            <li>However, I truly still smell clean after a long, long day of running around after a classroom of kindergarteners and 4 hours of classes for my masters degree!</li>
            <li>I worked around the house, I painted outside in the hot sun, I participated in physical activity</li>
            <li>I rarely give anything 5 stars, but this product does what it says it will -- at least for the first 24hours.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, it does NOT provide wetness protection, it actually does the opposite.</li>
            <li>you defiantly don&#x27;t have to waste your time running around and reapplying deodorant  all day long like I have found with most deodorants  </li>
            <li>I tend to wear a lot of dark colors and have been on the hunt for a great antiperspirant that truly didn&#x27;t leave their mark behind.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and is long lasting, which is great when you don&#x27;t have any time for a shower.&lt;br /&gt;Trying this product for free thanks to Secret &amp; BzzAgent for the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel.</li>
            <li>I noticed that when I wore the deodorant with fabrics other than cotton, I wouldn&#x27;t have as much odor protection by the end of the day - particularly those fabrics that contain polyester.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a clean scent and doesn&#x27;t overpower other fragrances that I like to wear daily.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this</li>
            <li>Totally loving this new secret outlast gel deodorant!</li>
            <li>I love this new product from Secret.</li>
            <li>I really love this new product from Secret.</li>
            <li>Other things that I like from this deodorant is that it last long time, I can&#x27;t say it last 48 hours cause I take more than one shower a day since I live in the tropic and is super hot, but I use it for hard work such as helping my husband in his workshop and playing with my 6 year old girl</li>
            <li>It really lasts a long time</li>
            <li>would purchase this deodorant and recommend it because I believe in the Secret brand, and was impressed with how well Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant</li>
            <li>my normal white stick that leaves marks everywhere.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I spent the day walking through NYC, seeing a play and going to dinner.  </li>
            <li>I am normally a invisible solid type of girl</li>
            <li>When I put my baby in our carrier to go to the store I normally end up with white deodorant marks on the straps.</li>
            <li>If I get dressed first it is a lot harder to put this stuff on bc</li>
            <li>it was not to wet and seemed to dry pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I am assured that I will be clear, fresh, dry and smelling good no matter how busy, long or crazy</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t make my armpits cold like other gels.</li>
            <li>Each day offered a slightly different test of it&#x27;s ability to live up to it&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li>This will be my new go-to deodorant especially in the summer months!</li>
            <li>Second, I live in Texas,</li>
            <li>live in California where it has been between 101 and 110 for the last month and during that time I was given the opportunity to test and review this product courtesy of BzzAgent and Secret.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The gel did dry, but not all that fast.</li>
            <li>It dry fast.</li>
            <li>Not to big on it, I really like the solid invisible sticks.</li>
            <li>I was able to sample and review the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deoderant because I am a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s a long day working or a long day hiking, I always still smell fresh at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I received the Secret Outlast clear gel for FREE through bzzagent!</li>
            <li>I did tell them it was a gel and not a solid and was very surprised that people weren&#x27;t deterred</li>
            <li>I will be buying this product in the very near future.</li>
            <li>Received it free from BzzAgent; I&#x27;ve been using this for three weeks, and I will continue to buy this for it&#x27;s long-lasting protection, and freedom from white streaks on my black wardrobe!  </li>
            <li>I left the class with the smell of the clear gel instead of body odor!</li>
            <li>Also the gel isn&#x27;t too watery, it dries instantly and clear!</li>
            <li>and before I would notice white marks a lot but with the clear gel I dont have to worry about that!</li>
            <li>The major take-away point is the effectiveness of this</li>
            <li>With Mitchum the gel stayed pretty wet and sticky under my arm and despite going on clear, it would leave white streaks on my clothes.</li>
            <li>It kept to its claims about no white streaks, long lasting deodorant, and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Another thing i like about it is that it did not discolor my under arm area which is a major plus.</li>
            <li>No wet sticky residue from the gel and no leftover reminders on my clothes at the end of the night!  </li>
            <li>I live in southern Alabama and generally our weather is over 100</li>
            <li>It dries completely within minutes, offers great protection, and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my dark clothes or my black baby carrier (a major issue I&#x27;ve been having with my usual</li>
            <li>So far I have no complaint as I have not noticed any body odor and still feel dry.  </li>
            <li>The most common complaint I hear about the solids are that they aren&#x27;t suitable to wear with dark clothing, and that you can see that you are wearing it.</li>
            <li>After the first day, I was still unbelievably completely dry!!!  </li>

            <li>Within a week of using a new product (and even sometimes with an old one), I break out in tiny, red, itchy spots on my underarms.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to participate in a product testing and review program and got the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free from Secret.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and does feel very wet; However, it dries so fast.</li>
            <li>However, after using this particular product on several occasions I have come to the conclusion that it does have a favorable scent and does not leave white marks.</li>
            <li>First, I’ll start out with saying that I got to test this product ( Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel) for free from Secret and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had wonderful experiences with clear gel deodorants in the past, so I was a little apprehensive to try Secret Outlast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just had bad experiences with them, but after trying this one I am happy and will be replacing my stock.</li>
            <li>I usually steer clear of clear deodorant ;)</li>
            <li>I actually got to try this free, thanks to Secret and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I generally get unscented products whenever I can.</li>
            <li>It ACTUALLY went on clear and didn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>I already use secrect solid deodorant but had not tried thr clear gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the clear deodorant, since it can take a while for the wetness to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; before getting dressed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my clothing because of the clear gel technology of this product.</li>
            <li>With secret outlast clear gel I have no white marks at all on any of my shirts :)</li>
            <li>They advertise up to 48 &#x27;epic&#x27; hours of wetness protection, odor protection, and no white marks on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does outlast your busy schedule and provides the odor protection and white mark protection</li>
            <li>There is no wet or sticky feeling or even a residue that I can feel.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt as with traditional solid deodorants, but it still stained the underarm cuffs of my shirt with a clear/wet/shiny/glitter-like appearance, which was very unflattering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy mom of two with 2 big dogs and a husband who isn&#x27;t home a lot</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the deodorant, but I don&#x27;t know that I would be inclined to buy the Secret Outlast clear gel over the solid that I had already been accustomed to.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been close to 100 outside where I&#x27;m located</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel because it totally made me change my mind.  </li>
            <li>and I think I will give it a few more tries before I make up my mind to go from a solid to gel.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the wet feeling when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>i love about secret as i will always say, once it goes on</li>
            <li>and I still love the Secret brand.</li>
            <li>I got to try this as a promo from secret :) wouldn&#x27;t buy the gel again but might give the solids a run because I do like the smell.</li>
            <li>Thank you to secret and bzzagent for letting me try this free!</li>
            <li>The product does dry quickly, which I’ve noticed you might have to wait with other gel deodorants.  </li>
            <li>The Clear Gel formula really does dry clear and does not leave residue on clothes or a wet mark.</li>
            <li>I held on to my sample for a few days knowing I&#x27;d be starting my new job and figured there would be no bigger test then the first week at a new place, in the middle of summer mind</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite and will be until Secret stops selling it, which I don&#x27;t think is going to happen!</li>
            <li>The gel goes on cold but smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like too much is that it takes a while to dry once applied.</li>
            <li>Only thing I would change is you really need to let the product dry before putting your clothes on.  </li>
            <li>The only negative thing I have to say about this deodorant is that I went through it very quickly.</li>
            <li>It does go on wet, yet it dries very quickly (within a few minutes).</li>
            <li>It dried quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about looking like I sweated through my shirt before I even left the house.</li>
            <li>This one in particular smell very fresh, to get any product out for the first time you have to spin the bottom a few times, any other time I recommend spinning just half way otherwise you will get too much product out and it will take a long time to dry on your armpits.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive a Bzzagent campaign for Secret</li>
            <li>This gel dried right away.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised  to still be fresh and dry after my hour and a half work out.</li>
            <li>and I do not seem to be going through the product quickly although it is quite a small amount.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, but certainly not least, it does not take much at all, just a little swipe under each arm and you are through.</li>
            <li>But other then that, I noticed that I don&#x27;t sweat as much and as often.</li>
            <li>, that is not normally something I do with my normal deodorant.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this deodorant if you are looking for long lasting protection!</li>
            <li>Other than that i really love the cool and airy effect of this deodorant versus the solid version of this, I actually use secret everyday and its my main deodorant</li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like is that o seem to go through the clear gel faster than the solid.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying the clear gel as well and alternate it and the solid.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of secret outlast clear gel as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I was selected through a social media marketing agency to review this product.</li>
            <li>Prior to trying this product, I had been boycotting secret deodorant for about 5 years or more.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I didn&#x27;t like, was that the armpit areas of my shirts were not dry.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast in the solid is a lot better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It dried almost instantly and even in a black tank top</li>
            <li>I think this is a secret every female should know about love this formula  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Secret Outlast 48 hr Completely Clean gel thanks to Secret.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I did not enjoy the wet feeling when I first put on the deodorant, but the feeling quickly goes away.</li>
            <li>You can feel confident knowing that once it&#x27;s on and dried (in seconds), you won&#x27;t have any white mess on your clothing.  </li>
            <li>I applied this deodorant, I was initially pretty unimpressed, and honestly a little grossed out.  </li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive at first, as I have never used gel deodorant before.</li>
            <li>I included a photograph of my full-size Secret® Invisible Solids deodorants, that I use on a regular basis and the small sample-size Secret® Clear Gel deodorant BzzAgent sent me in the mail, as well as a photograph of the back of the deodorants showing the difference in the &#x27;active ingredients&#x27; list, I&#x27;m sure that has a lot to do with the effectiveness of the solid vs the gel.</li>
            <li>It is delicate, feminine and actually gives you a very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I was mostly excited to try the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant when I received it for FREE as a BzzCampaign thanks to Secret!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s sooooo cold early in the morning when I put it on that I do a little wiggle but feel great nonetheless within seconds  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s such a shame that Secret® hasput out such a bad deodorant when their solid deodorants are highly effective and on a much higher caliber than this crappy gel nonsense.</li>
            <li>I have tested the clear gel&#x27;s protection while doing a hour long Zumba class.</li>
            <li>I generally use regular stick deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Completely Clean gel not only doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes when I change three times a day, but it also keeps my pits as dry as the moment I first apply it in the morning.</li>
            <li>However the protection doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours, it barely lasted 7-8 hours on me.</li>
            <li>Not overwhelming, and it just smells fresh- not too girly or strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would just rather play it safe, especially since regular Secret has always done the job for me.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Completely Clean</li>
            <li>received the Completely Clean Secret Clear Gel to review through clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li>Thank you Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li>Here is where Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel comes in.    </li>
            <li>I tried out Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as a promo from Bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li>This hormone change in my body got me sweating a little more than usual.</li>
            <li>I have never been a fan of gel deodorants, but Secret&#x27;s new Outlast Clear Gel seems to be decent so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Dove regularly for years and was pleasantly surprised by this deodorant when I received a free sample of it from Secret in the mail last week.</li>
            <li>Things have definitely changed with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Gel!  </li>
            <li>My only complaint about the product is the scent to me it reminds of a very strong laundry detergent and some days it&#x27;s a little much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i was surprised at how well the deoderant worked in keeping me dry under my arms.</li>
            <li>Lasts so much longer than my previous antipers/deodorants.</li>
            <li>But, whether I used half a click, or a whole one, it still did what it was supposed to do...</li>
            <li>This deodorant slightly burns when applied immediately after shaving, but it really does OUTLAST the day.</li>
            <li>I just think I will stick to my usual powder fresh solid.</li>
            <li>I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel for free from Secret for review on BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from Secret.</li>
            <li>You might think that the clear gels are &amp;#34;too wet&amp;#34;, but that can be solved by simply letting yourself dry before putting on your shirt.</li>
            <li>It went on wet &amp; sticky but dried quickly.</li>
            <li>Outlast Clear Gel has kept me dry!</li>
            <li>The only downsides to the deodorant are that its gross to apply wet deodorant to wet armpits (I recommend drying the application area first), and if you&#x27;ve recently shaved like I am, it may sting for a minute until it dries.</li>
            <li>It also doesn’t leave those thick, chalk-like white marks on your shirts - so your black outfits are safe.  </li>
            <li>When first putting this product on I noticed that I didn&#x27;t get the wet sticky feeling that other gel deodorants have given me.</li>
            <li>Since receiving my free sample from Secret to test and review, I&#x27;ve actually already purchased another full size Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Price isn’t outstanding, but it isn’t really that bad</li>
            <li>Outlast clear gel because it was wet when I put it on.</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s not really invisible as they say it will be) for this clear gel.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am very impressed with this product, and have already purchased more.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant but somewhat overpowering scent to it, I deducted one star because I feel it may interfere or clash with one&#x27;s perfume or cologne.</li>

            <li> loved the scent that I received.</li>
            <li> It leaves no stains on your shirt and it smells good.</li>
            <li> However I still wanted to give this product a fair chance</li>
            <li> The scent smells good.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> perfect for when I travel, and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> but I received a free trial through the best product testing site ever; Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I tried this free for bzzagent and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this product as part of a promotion brand with bzz agent and I loved it.</li>
            <li> in all, it was a good product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> In the end it&#x27;s a good deodorant.</li>
            <li> I was in search of something that would be a perfect fit for my needs.  </li>
            <li> Good product that I am now switching to.</li>
            <li> Deodorant is something you are going to have to use every day, so it is important to use a brand that you are impressed with.</li>
            <li> and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Smells so good for hours.</li>
            <li> , I told my mom this lady smells good.</li>
            <li> i always felt they went on &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; and it never felt like i was getting good protection...</li>
            <li> When my sample arrived I was very impressed with the look of the product and the pleasant fresh scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use for any situation, goes on great and washes off easily at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> so I could quickly plug this stuff as it is a great product!</li>
            <li> A perfect ending to my first postpartum shower!</li>
            <li> Amazing Amazing Amazing!</li>
            <li> And the scent is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is truly a great deodorant for sure.</li>
            <li> but I sure am happy to know that in an emergency I can count on its 48 hour protection and beyond.</li>

            <li> 48 hour smells nice on its own.</li>
            <li> Thanks BzzAgent for another great product to review!</li>
            <li> Loving the gel it dries in a couple of seconds and works all day (and I have a stressful job</li>
            <li> , it does have a nice scent, and it does prevent you from sweating like a pig.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on and isn&#x27;t sticky like some.</li>
            <li> Now that that is out of the way let me continue with my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I honestly didn&#x27;t know I had an issue with it.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice.</li>
            <li> and the smell is really nice.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and it did not get on my clothing, so that is why I gave it 2 stars.  </li>
            <li> I liked the smell.</li>
            <li> so I loved that the odor protection lasted longer then 24 hours until I was able to get a shower later!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This also smells really nice and is not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant from Bzzagent and this is my honest opinion about the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I was excited to try this!!</li>
            <li> It is not too strong but is pleasant and lasts all day (and night).</li>
            <li> The scent was very mild but pleasant.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong scent &amp; is very clean smelling!</li>
            <li> Well after using it for almost a week I can honestly say that I am very happy with this clear gel deodorant!  </li>
            <li> Also the clean scent has a very nice smell to it too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant out of the shower smell that lasts all day leaving me odor and wetness free.</li>
            <li> Wonderful light scent that keeps you fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I loved how easily it went on (with the solids I feel I&#x27;m gonna bruise</li>
            <li> She has very strong body odor</li>
            <li> It was very easy to come out and once applied</li>
            <li> It does better for me on cooler days than warm days when I am profusely sweating.</li>
            <li> so I was hoping for a nice and refreshing scent,</li>
            <li> The Completely Fresh scent is great.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!</li>
            <li> I Recieved this product free from bzz agent solely for testing purposes and its a really great product that smells great and drys fast</li>
            <li> It is the best of the line so far</li>
            <li> It keeps me fresh and smelling great thought out the day.</li>
            <li> Im honestly amazed and in love with this product.</li>
            <li> The fresh scent is great also.</li>
            <li> The best thing is that it is clear</li>
            <li> Good protection, nice smell, dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The clear gel is very good and it didn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes and the nice fresh scent was great</li>
            <li> I liked the powder scent most about the deodorant I was using before this one, and this scent was just as enjoyable.</li>
            <li> It worked great for me, and that&#x27;s a lot to say because its been a hot Summer here.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong scent &amp; is very clean smelling.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong which is nice</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a gel deodorant</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s better on my shirts b/c</li>
            <li> As a Bzzagent, I received this deodorant as a sample in my latest Buzzkit.  </li>
            <li> Well, the verdict is in and I am in love with the protection and confidence</li>
            <li> Two clicks provides the perfect amount for each underarm, and it lasted through the entire day.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant that I tried courtesy of BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I received free from Bzzagent campaign!  </li>
            <li> As a user of clinical strength deodorant, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work for me.  </li>
            <li> It does everything that I could ask for and more.</li>
            <li> Considering you use deodorant every day you better love it, and well I love mine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the floral scents and this is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> so I end up having to make more than one trip to the underarm to apply.</li>
            <li> Confident you&#x27;ll like this brand and be sweat free!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this deodorant</li>

            <li> In Love</li>
            <li> , I just wish that there was more in the container.</li>

            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> but I really love this one.  </li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> Love Love Love it.    </li>

            <li> Love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> And best thing ever is no white marks!  </li>
            <li> I love the cooling sensation as I put it on.</li>
            <li> For those who aren&#x27;t very sweaty it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> After trying it, I have more Pro&#x27;s than Con&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It seems to eave a sticky feel, which I&#x27;m not too sure</li>
            <li> Also, the scent did not tickle my fancy as I am personally more attracted to floral scented deodorants.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to put it on at 4am,</li>
            <li> I simply love the scent</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got the chance to try it.</li>
            <li> I also loved the fresh scent that followed me all day.</li>
            <li> They are the stains that occur when sweat and deodorant collide; The stains that will not come out of your clothing no matter how many times you have attempted to &amp;#34;Shout&amp;#34; them out.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it would stain my top if I&#x27;m not wearing something sleeveless.  </li>
            <li> or else it would stain my top and make it look moist</li>
            <li> However, it was of course invisible as most gels always promise.  </li>
            <li> I Love it.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> its not sticky like most gels</li>
            <li> and this is a gel I love</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> It does last for 48 hours, so I was impressed with that.  </li>
            <li> I received this product for free from BzzAgent and giving my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I really love this</li>
            <li> Received this to review, and I&#x27;ll gladly buy it in the future!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I did receive this product free for testing purposes and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> so glad I got this to test from Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> And I was able to find it with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s one of my favorite scents in deodorants.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the scent on this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Got a free sample to try!</li>
            <li> definitely the best deodorant in the market.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m so glad that I discovered it.</li>
            <li> So I would buy this for sure</li>
            <li> Well, the best thing i can say is that it takes care of this big girls odor and sweat while working out or just being a mom.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from bzzagent to try and review this product, and I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed at how it didn&#x27;t leave any white residue or powdery marks on my clothes, which has always been a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Okay, people.</li>
            <li> Now I am in love.</li>
            <li> Finally a gel that is GREAT!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for anything more than something that can meet the expectations and claims.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> The scent is okay, but I prefer a sweeter smelling deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I love something that doesn&#x27;t leave a residue</li>
            <li> The clean scent was nice, I didn&#x27;t want anything was that was fruity or too potent.</li>
            <li> and it goes on clear, with this lovely cool sensation that is especially nice for the summer.</li>
            <li> The scent was nice, and well, clean.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes after!!&lt;br /&gt;Smell is great and natural, not overpowering, and best is that it last all day!!</li>
            <li> However I can see how this would be perfect for a long trip or maybe camping when you don&#x27;t always have access to a shower.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and and smelling great!  </li>
            <li> The Completely Clean scent I was sent in my kit to try had a very strong smell that reminded me of my mother&#x27;s antiperspirant when I was growing up,</li>
            <li> The biggest issue for me is the &#x27;clean&#x27; smell!  </li>
            <li> What a lovely and clean refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent &amp; is very clean smelling.</li>
            <li> and when I had cooled off, took a quick whiff and didn&#x27;t smell anything but the clean smell of deodorant!!</li>
            <li> I am glad I received a free sample because I am BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> The product goes on clear and smells great, but I didn&#x27;t get the protection I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was able to try it free through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and cool which I really liked.</li>
            <li> As a Bzz Agent, I was able to try this product free of charge to test out how it stacks up to the competition</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that #BzzAgent allowed me to try it for free.</li>
            <li> I loved that every time I really started to sweat, I could smell the deodorant,</li>
            <li> when I didn&#x27;t unintentionally apply  probably twice as much as I needed, it was actually really good.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it went on easily with no whiteness at all.  </li>

            <li> Thanks guys!!!</li>
            <li> I love the completely clean scent and how fresh it smells.</li>
            <li> The smell is clean and refreshing reminds me of fresh laundry</li>
            <li> The scent is very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> The smell is very clean, almost like freshly laundered clothes; but it isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li> so when i received this for free as part of a test group, i wasn&#x27;t too excited.</li>
            <li> I wasnt a huge fan of the Completely Clean scent which is why I gave it four stars.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t over powering, it&#x27;s a clean, lightly perfumed smell.  </li>

            <li> MY NEW FAVORITE DEODORANT!</li>
            <li> Hi everyone new I receieve this product for free through a company for testing and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t super powerful either so don&#x27;t worry about it overpowering your favorite body splash or perfume.</li>
            <li> So, I found myself using various products, mostly Avon antiperspirant/deodorant which is cheap and mostly effective.</li>
            <li> It most certainly left no white residue on any of my clothing which was absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> i was pretty pleased with how well it</li>
            <li> I still prefer my original over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, odor protection is pretty important to me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove Original Deoderant since I can remember but wanted to see what else is out there.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to get this from BzzAgent to try out and review.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t plan on ever going back to another kind!</li>
            <li> I received a full size product to test from bzz agent for free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming this is so that it dries quickly, but I made sure to not use this deodorant right after shaving my arm</li>
            <li> When I first opened it I noticed the pleasant smell instantly (come on, you know that&#x27;s important!).</li>
            <li> Dry, Smelling great and</li>
            <li> It is called completely clean</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It keeps you smelling great and DRY without any staining.</li>
            <li> The smell was just like the name says CLEAN.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I can honestly say that while I love this product, I would not buy it, simply because its gel and I don&#x27;t like gel deodorants.  </li>
            <li> clean scent&lt;br /&gt;*Does</li>
            <li> I do like the Completely Clean scent</li>
            <li> It works great, I stay dry and clean all day.</li>
            <li> yet we want a strong antiperspirant to keep us fresh.  </li>
            <li> I have never been one to like gel deodorant, but thought the sound of no white residue sounded too good to be true, so</li>
            <li> , it has completely passed test after test and I am totally enjoying spreading the word and product!</li>
            <li> I am a bit fussy about deodorants and so far I love this one!</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li> The scent is not too much which I love and there is never that feeling of not being clean.  </li>
            <li> The scent was light and smelled fresh and clean like coming out of the shower and it lasts.</li>
            <li> First off the smell was amazing and it lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li> this one actually smells good and doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> Any more really isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt cool and sticky for about 10 min of putting it on.  </li>
            <li> One good thing is no stains on your clothing as you do with a solid.  </li>
            <li> I received a full size deodorant as a Bzzz Agent, along with coupons to distribute.</li>
            <li> Tank tops, blouses, t-shirts, dresses etc etc are all now safe from those hideous and very distinguishable stripes.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, keeps my underarms hydrated, smells so fresh</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, it was like almost 90 degrees or better the whole time.  </li>
            <li> It smelled nice to me, and my 6yr old son agreed.  </li>
            <li> The product did last smell and wetness wise but the reason I gave it two stars was for the smell it has a chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable the way it works and it stays smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> When it is hot outside the cool feeling after applying feels great</li>
            <li> I gave it a full month to test</li>
            <li> so I could give it a full review</li>
            <li> , even went a night here and there without showering to get the full 48 hour effect and still felt like it worked well.</li>
            <li> The gel deodorant goes on nice and clear.</li>
            <li> It gave lasting protection even after a good bike ride.</li>
            <li> I loved that I could wear my sleeveless shirts or dresses and not have to worry about any white marks!</li>
            <li> I probably would have liked the scent when I was 12 or 13, but not now as an adult.</li>
            <li> One whole click is more than I want to put on.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good deodorant that does not leave white marks.</li>
            <li> It does not leave white marks on clothes so that is good.</li>
            <li> It works well, and the price is more than reasonable, I just seem to go thru a container rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It was great for the full 12 hour active day.  </li>
            <li> His other presentations are also welcome</li>
            <li> It has a great smell to it and they also offer other ones.</li>
            <li> It smells fine - the fragrance isn&#x27;t overwhelming and quickly goes away, but I just didn&#x27;t think it would be strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of the outlast is fresh and clean but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I was/am VERY impressed with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and clean, nothing overpowering on that end.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s great for my active schedule .</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> and it was smelling like fresh, clean</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky or goupy.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves no marks on clothes.</li>
            <li> I haved used it and put on my clothes really quickly</li>
            <li> When I apply the gel, it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel stickly like some gels do.  </li>
            <li> I want to be Super Mom.&lt;br /&gt;Secret</li>
            <li> The best part is that it lasted all day - even through my 30 day shred workout and left NO white residue on my work clothing.</li>
            <li> If it was ever on super sale then I probably would,</li>
            <li> It dries quickly upon application.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is a really good product it does go on clear and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Luckily it&#x27;s a liquid</li>
            <li> This one reminds me more of a men&#x27;s deodorant, and I definitely prefer something more fruity or floral.    </li>
            <li> Upon trying this product It didn&#x27;t fair well with myself, while it did smell great and it did soak in quickly and I had no white streaks, after a few hours of indoor and outdoor chores</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed Secrets new product and found it to have a fresh and clean scent.  </li>
            <li> An added bonus was that I was able to wear a light colored top without the deodorant itself leaving wet marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I love the clean smell of the deodorant, the ease of application and the clear tube</li>
            <li> It dries super fast, smells great-but not too strong.</li>
            <li> Changing shampoos for a couple weeks is an effective way to make my favorite shampoo work better when I switch back, so I tried the same technique for deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is seriously my favorite new deodorant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li> I am not scared of staining my shirts, which is great since I wear a lot of black polos for work.</li>
            <li> it kept my pits dry, and smelled good doing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clear gel leaves a refreshing and cool feel</li>
            <li> Super fresh scent that lasts.</li>
            <li> It has an easily adjustable dial for pushing the gel out and even goes backwards in case you turn it too much.</li>
            <li> I was still going strong by the time I got ready for bed - even after work and two workouts.</li>
            <li> It keeps me odor free all day so that is a positive.</li>
            <li> My armpits were still pretty fresh!</li>
            <li> The actual anti-perspirant properties are great and really do keep sweat at bay through a range of activities even on hot days.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it it lasted all day!</li>
            <li> I kept me nice and clean and fresh all week long.</li>
            <li> I had love the Platinum Protection line they came out with in the early 2000&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This deodorant is definitely worth checking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I did feel fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> The fresh scent is not over powering and It didn&#x27;t stain clothes.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> though I received the product complimentary, the opinions are 100% mine)</li>
            <li> I put this deoderant to the true test of fate on a hot and humid day while visiting the zoo.</li>
            <li> I walked a mile in the sun and heat and no white marks and after doing a sniff test, still smelled nice.</li>
            <li> It is fresh but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I still smelled fresh too -- not just &amp;#34;not</li>
            <li> ; but actually fresh.  </li>
            <li> Again, no sweat, no stains, all day, and still smelling fresh in the evening.  </li>
            <li> I love how it goes on clear and drys</li>
            <li> I love this product because it goes on clear as promised on the package.</li>
            <li> but the product fell short in more important areas for me and for those reasons I would not chose to use this product again.</li>
            <li> No fun!&lt;br /&gt;I am always on the search for products to keep me fresh.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly, smells fresh but not overpowering, does a decent job at controlling odor and doesn&#x27;t make a MARK on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Secret is already a great deoderant brand but now with Outlast they have taken the cake!</li>
            <li> Worth the $3.50&lt;</li>
            <li> it fresh 48-hour protection&amp;#34</li>
            <li> So obviously I liked that there were no white streaks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> its worth the time and money to try for yourself</li>
            <li> I also often use deodorants that are more &#x27;natural&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> but i was still fresh as flowers.</li>
            <li> I love the clear gel , it takes away any perspiration you may have .</li>
            <li> and i still smelled fresh.</li>
            <li> I love that it a clear gel</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need two clicks worth of deodorant.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no white streaks when I put on my dark clothes fr my previous deodorant-so I&#x27;m definitely a happy happy camper!!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and kept me dry and smelling fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> secret outlast is great protection to keep you clean and fresh all day even for 48 hours straight  could not ask for anything better  </li>
            <li> but I would buy it again for special occasions where I want to make sure I don&#x27;t have any chance of White Marks.</li>
            <li> There was also no irritation to my skin, even when applying right after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I did feel like I wanted to reapply right after my run</li>
            <li> I ran right out and bought this to replace</li>
            <li> I ad to play with the applicator to figure out how to get the right amount to come out</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try a clear gel deodorant as I have not had the best experiences with them in the past.</li>
            <li> love the protection it offers- between pregnancy,  a hot and humid East Coast summer,  and having to chase toddlers all day</li>
            <li> This accomplishes both of those tasks while smelling very, well, clean.</li>
            <li> The best part about it is it really does go on completely clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on any clothing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, and it really does keep smelling good.</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant but not overpowering scent, and I never felt like my underarms were consistently wet or sticky, which is normally the case when I use clear gels.  </li>
            <li> It is completely clear, it smells great, and the protection really does last!</li>
            <li> I really like floral, fruity, or sweet smelling deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Glides on smooth &amp; cool and is dry quickly!  </li>
            <li> It washes off easily in the shower but does not come off during the day, and I live in a hot, humid climate.</li>
            <li> This is amazing at keeping up with you all day in keeping you fresh and dry!</li>
            <li> First, the smell even though is supposed to be the same in both deodorant in the Clear Gel one is sooo smelly like my daughter said, it really have a great smell.</li>
            <li> With it being such a hot time of year and such a busy day I figured it&#x27;d be the perfect time to try it out.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry, smelling amazing all day, and it doesn&#x27;t make any marks/stains on any clothing.</li>
            <li> No thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Bzzagent gave me some Secret Completely Clean Clear Gel to try out and review, and I&#x27;m honestly impressed.</li>
            <li> I do feel like you would go through this quickly, just because the Gel comes out so much with one click.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different types of deodorant and haven&#x27;t been that happy with any of them.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that I love not having to worry about deodorant marks on any of my clothes, and I feel fresh all day regardless of the temperature outside.  </li>
            <li> Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant is that the scent &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; actually smells good, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter if it does not last or work effectively.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I really like this brand of deodorant, have been using it for years because it really keeps me odor free.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was truly exciting in hopes that I would find a better antiperspirant deodorant than what I have been using, I was iffy on gel because I&#x27;ve always used Solid.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with Secret Outlast from the very 1st day.</li>
            <li> I liked the 48 hour protection and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks which is nice when I&#x27;m wearing a dark colored tank.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very overwhelming like other deodorants.  </li>
            <li> BzzAgent send me this product few days ago, and so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Honestly, this doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent at all; I only smell it when I&#x27;m actually trying to smell my armpit.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel is the best it dries quickly after application and does not feel sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li> The Completely Clean scent isn&#x27;t too over powering, but it&#x27;s more floral than I expected with the name.</li>
            <li> The gel smelled good (not overpowering) and dried very fast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel wet or sticky and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of the Completely Clean was much too strong, but I definitely wanted to test the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Better yet, it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my costumes and under my arms!</li>
            <li> it is so nice, not so much people really notice a different smell on you</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you get as many uses in the container as you would with a solid.  </li>
            <li> Never switching back :)</li>
            <li> well enough let alone for more than 7 hours unlike the 48 hours</li>
            <li> Overall this product does what it says and keeps any marks off of your clothes which I love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the pros of this product first.  </li>
            <li> used mine on really hot days (95+) while hiking and geocaching.</li>
            <li> I am able to try this product for free from BzzAgent, and so far I have been using it daily.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s clear and goes on smoothly without having to worry about having white marks on my clothes or under my arms.  </li>
            <li> but I tried a free sample of 48 hour clear gel</li>
            <li> This is the first deodorant that I have tried in gel form.</li>
            <li> i did receive this specific deodorant thru bzzagent.com to try which is my favorite for all you stay at home moms</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s packed and ready to go in my hospital bag!  </li>
            <li> it was hot and humid...</li>
            <li> and the fact it works and actually works for up to two days and sometimes more.</li>
            <li> The second application was much better-</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> But it goes on so much cleaner than the powdered stick that it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not cautious of putting too much on, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate freshly shaved skin.</li>
            <li> I had received this product as a trial from them and will definitely be buying more of it</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find a product that worked well enough</li>
            <li> even on extremely hot days.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this deodorant and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time .</li>
            <li> When I first applied this deodorant, I was suspicious that I would end up not liking it.</li>
            <li> it dries fast and leaves you feeling fresh for hours</li>
            <li> and I think this is a pretty close substitution.</li>
            <li> I just love that I can put it on &amp; change clothes 10 times-with no fear of getting white marks all along the bottom of my shirt!!!</li>
            <li> The scent is only okay.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This goes on smoothly and dries completely within seconds.  </li>
            <li> It has a great smell and it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> The thing with solid deodorants is that it would leave a white build up under my arms which didn&#x27;t help me feel sexy when I lifted my arms while wearing a halter top.</li>
            <li> I was luckt enough to try this deoderant free from bzzagent!</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> It does not leave white stains as most of the stick deodorants do.</li>
            <li> It was the first day of using it.</li>
            <li> Got to try this clear gel for free as a member of Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> surely buy and definitely recommend&lt;</li>
            <li> If you are a heavy sweater with good kidneys, it might be just what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> I like the clean scent but would love to try other scents.</li>
            <li> With &amp;#34;Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel&amp;#34; deodorant stains be gone!</li>
            <li> It also keeps me fresh and dry throughout the day and no awful residue on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I really like how the clear gel puts on easily, I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product and it does not feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I did find it best to let it dry for a few seconds before putting a shirt on.  </li>
            <li> Love that the scent is mild, not to strong but long lasting.</li>
            <li> Goodbye to my old invisible solid as I am now in love with another gel!</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the Secret</li>
            <li> I want to keep this product in my life so that I can enjoy life a little better knowing that I am protected.  </li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of clear gels because they always feel so wet for a long time to me, and I&#x27;ve never been all that impressed with the protection (or lack of) that they provide.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a wearer of perfumes, every now and again I&#x27;ll use body spray, but other than that I&#x27;m a wash and wear, no make up, ponytail kind of woman.  </li>
            <li> Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel.</li>
            <li> Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel sample from bzzagent</li>
            <li> I only apply after my shower and it lasts all day long and still smells amazing!</li>
            <li> It rates as a 5 star for me because by far this is the best Secret product out there.</li>
            <li> Outlast Completely clean clear gel.  </li>
            <li> Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel.</li>
            <li> It smelled soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used in years!</li>
            <li> I think Secret Outlast Clear gel deodorant is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying so many different deodorants and haven&#x27;t really found one that works the way I like</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel works incredible!</li>
            <li> and I have black top tested it, no marks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean, clear, confident dry.</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t like gel deoderants, but i was willing to check out anything that promises to keep up with louisiana heat and humidity!&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty run-of-the-mill, but if you&#x27;re about function over aesthetics, then it shouldn&#x27;t bother you too much.</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant from BzzAgent to try out for free and I must say they have amazed me yet again.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel confident all day long.</li>
            <li> I used it the next day and decided to wear a tube top and felt so free with no worries of white build up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pretty excited to try a new deodorant, especially with summer here and in full heat, and if it claimed to do everything it said, this was going to be a match made in heaven.  </li>
            <li> No other deodorant has worked as well to keep me smelling and looking fresh!</li>
            <li> Ultimately it is less product you are wearing and the scent is just amazing to me.  </li>
            <li> and then it seemed they thinned that line out in favor of less effective varieties.</li>
            <li> Ok I will start by saying that it does keep me dry</li>
            <li> The gel feels alittle sticky and takes time to feel dry, smell is okay,</li>
            <li> And then - dry and comfortable all day!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin &amp; this deodorant</li>
            <li> I am super sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> By the end of the day I was still dry and odor free!</li>
            <li> But the fact that this dries completely and quickly, is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this antiperspirant -- always keeps me dry even during the hottest of days.  </li>
            <li> The liberating feeling of being free from white marks...for real!  </li>
            <li> However, the scent of the deodorant itself is so strong that it gave me an instant headache.</li>
            <li> (it was 105 yesterday, felt like 110) and you need something that is really strong and that will last!</li>
            <li> I love Secret brand deodorant anyways but Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gear Gel is awesome!</li>
            <li> What I love the most, is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks or residue on my dark clothes.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I don&#x27;t have to try that too often, but it is good to know that it is very long lasting as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent.com and Secret for allowing me to try this great product for free.  :O)</li>
            <li> I love how this one works and keeps me dry!</li>
            <li> So this was my first time trying the secret outlast completely clean clear gel &amp; might I say this is a new favorite!!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast clear gel deodorant in the Completely Clean Scent is amazing!  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent on this one isn&#x27;t overpowering, and the smaller sizes have been great to travel with (and yes these can go on the plane with you in the little baggie).</li>
            <li> I love gel because it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your clothes and for real, the Outlast version seems to really do what it promises - keep your pits dry!  </li>
            <li> I am really picky about the scent of my deodorant and</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast is great.</li>
            <li> This deodorant really does offer all day protection and freshness.</li>
            <li> I truly value the Secret Brand because they do have great products.</li>
            <li> in am, when I am running around gettting my kids ready and myself dressed thankfully no marks on my clothes</li>
            <li> It really works well.  </li>
            <li> i recommend it really</li>
            <li> ... is way too much for me.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a deodorant that really lived up to</li>
            <li> This is absolutely something I would recommend to friends or anyone else.</li>
            <li> This was very unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s there because I do play soft ball and still smell fresh afterword&#x27;s, no marks on your clothes and also doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast, does not leave any marks and protects the user from sweat.</li>
            <li> and I found that I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much as I do with powdered deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to take and test the product as much as I could before I talked with anyone about it</li>
            <li> Compared to the 4-5 reapplications of some deodorants I have used, I really needed it once.</li>
            <li> and it is VERY noticeable if she skips using deodorant and when I approach the issue with her she tends to just get embarrassed and flustered</li>
            <li> didnt feel sticky and lasted the whole day</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t give up, figuring I probably just accidentally used too much.  </li>
            <li> get when I apply it, and the fact that way too much comes out at once.</li>
            <li> The gel drys fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased an &#x27;advanced&#x27; solid that had 48 hour odor protection.</li>
            <li> I recently got to try a sample for free as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I tried this deodorant recently for free through a promotion from the brand</li>
            <li> Product goes fast ...</li>
            <li> I wore it for 32 hours straight without reapplying it</li>
            <li> It dries SO fast.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dries almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> So, I had gotten the Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try for free for being a BzzAnget and spread the good word.</li>
            <li> It works way better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent that recieved this product as a free sample to try, I&#x27;d like to start off this review by saying I only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like gel deoderants.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think this goes on with a scent or even dries with a scent.  </li>
            <li> do think this product goes by really fast.  </li>
            <li> the product for free thanks to Secret, but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need 48 hour protection since I shower every day.</li>
            <li> I am a person that loves scent so the scent was very pleasing to me and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Switched to this and have been very happen ever since</li>
            <li> I  have got this for a promotion from secret to try out its great</li>
            <li> It was better than expected.</li>
            <li> But this product is ABSOLUTELY none of those things.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s held up really well.</li>
            <li> Also, the way this dispenses helps you not to use too much.</li>
            <li> You can tell just how much you need</li>
            <li> hahaha.</li>
            <li> I really like this deo</li>
            <li> but I really do like the gels.</li>
            <li> I received this through a BzzCampaign and tried it for close to a month and have really like it.</li>
            <li> it dries fast.</li>
            <li> Also, it keeps my underarms smooth especially after shaving.</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work for me because I have never been one to like gel deodrant but to my suprize I absolutely love Secret</li>
            <li> &amp; I love how it goes on clear without leaving any white marks.  </li>
            <li> I will start off by saying that I was given this product from BzzAgent and Secret for free to try, in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> received this product for free from Secret through BzzAgent in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work for me because I have never been one to like gel deodorant but to my surprise I absolutely love Secret</li>
            <li> I was able to try this as a promotion from bzzagent &amp; secret :)</li>
            <li> I will sue the gel for days its hot and icky as this cools me down and works great!</li>
            <li> I loved that I could wear black and blue shirts, and I did not have any marks showing that I had put on my deodorant first.</li>
            <li> Have been using the clear gel product forever!!!</li>
            <li> Really love this deodorant, only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star was due to the fact it does burn when I put it on right after a fresh shave.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry, smelling great, and I have one less thing to think about throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It kept me dry without being so dry that I was itchy, and I really loved the scent.</li>
            <li> One reviewer commented the smell wasn&#x27;t what they expected, but I think it smells clean and fresh</li>
            <li> yet it dries super fast, I can put on my clothes right away not having the need to wait for it to dry</li>
            <li> I would like to try the other scents to see if they suit me better.  </li>
            <li> The Secret Outlast Clear Gel was great at doing exactly what it says: no marks, odor and sweat protection.</li>
            <li> The Completely Clean scent is slightly strong at first, but as soon as it dries it just has a faint clean smell.  </li>
            <li> I thought for sure I was going to have that dreaded odor we all get when being overly active...</li>
            <li> There are a variety of scents available,but as of yet I have only tried the Completely Clean sent, I can&#x27;t wait to try the others out.</li>
            <li> Slightly larger than your average travel size so would be good to throw in your purse for emergencies as well.</li>
            <li> Its long lasting and a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I loved that it went on clear and dried within seconds, leaving me safe to put my arms down and not ruin my shirt!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it was strong enough without being clinical strength.  </li>
            <li> However, it IS a strong product, and if you have sensitive skin or if you wax/epilate, it definitely can burn when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> The deodorant does last for awhile, but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it for more than a day, especially for those who live in a hot climate like I do.</li>
            <li> not only did it have a pleasant, but not overpowering scent, but it went on smooth, dried fast without any white marks, and didnt make me feel wet for putting on a gel, and kept me smelling fresh!.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a long time and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> All day long I don&#x27;t feel as comfortable as I did with the gel...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Secret was nice enough to let me try this #LifeHack for free!</li>
            <li> With two kids that makes going to the store a whole day event because of the heat!&lt;br /&gt;We normally are drenched with sweat by the time we get in or out of the car.</li>
            <li> I have no ugly white marks on my shirts.</li>
            <li> I received a sample size Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant stick for free from BzzAgent as a promotion to test and honestly review this product.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; deodorant fragrances, but this one is nice - not too manly or soap scented.</li>
            <li> Gel dries quickly, NO white marks on my clothing, love the scent, and it REALLY does last 48 hours!!!</li>
            <li> Many thanks to Secret and BzzAgent.com for the free sample.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product.  </li>
            <li> Little hard to remove in the shower best to use a washcloth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will be my new go to!</li>
            <li> Clean Fresh scent that never let&#x27;s you down.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and it lasted for a long time!</li>
            <li> a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com, but all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad too that the gel is colorless and doesn&#x27;t stain my black shirts.  </li>
            <li> claims to keep me odor free and dry for 48 hours</li>
            <li> Secret outlast has clear gel ,smooth and pleasant smell especially 48 hours odor production.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and clear with no white marks!!  </li>
            <li> but, personally, I think it&#x27;s kinda gross to go without a shower for more than 24 hours</li>
            <li> The complete clean smell is good not to flowery or fake smelling and it&#x27;s only a mild smell too.  </li>
            <li> I love Secret Outlast Clear Gel Completely Clean scent!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the secret outlast clear gel deodorant as it is quick dying and last all day long.</li>
            <li> First of all, it really does dry quickly for a clear gel deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> All in all I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes that this would work</li>
            <li> In addition to the gel factor, it also lost points for its seemingly high alcohol content.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to secret I was able to try the Outlast clear gel deodorant for free.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh and clean scent to it, not very overwhelming at all like some deodorants.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh and clean scent to it, not very overwhelming at all like some deodorants.</li>
            <li> Right away, I was happy with Secret Outlast Clear Gel because it didn&#x27;t leave a white residue on my clothes.</li>
            <li> (if you drop it, it&#x27;s coming out of those little holes at the top).</li>
            <li> Also, Do not leave yucky white residue on pretty summer clothes!</li>
            <li> Unlike other deodorants, I found that this one gets used up pretty quickly; maybe it&#x27;s because it is in a gel-form.</li>
            <li> For me in my opinion I think it is better than any other brand too!!</li>
            <li> it dried so quickly, and really kept me feeling dry all day (even during days that were super hot!)</li>
            <li> I would recommend Secret Outlast to anyone looking for a deodorant free from white marks, stickiness, wetness and looking to be fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secret Outlast really does go on completely clear.  </li>
            <li> So far I really haven&#x27;t noticed any negatives about the product.</li>
            <li> Never going back to the solid again , not only does this smell amazing</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it as my normal deodorant</li>
            <li> Normally I have to apply deodorant two to three times a day.  </li>
            <li> It left no marks on any of my clothes and it kept me fresh on a weekend camping trip where my options to &amp;</li>
            <li> and I stay smelling fresh into the next day.  </li>
            <li> Its especially great in the summer when you wear short sleeves or tank tops and dont want to get the white deodorant on your clothes or worse</li>
            <li> i thought it was the normal size I always see at the drugstore</li>
            <li> but otherwise I&#x27;m sticking to my normal brand.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to use it without too much trouble.  </li>
            <li> I decided I would give it a try because I know that secret is a good brand.</li>
            <li> a member of one2one network, I received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from the clearly better challenge.</li>
            <li> I liked how the Secret Outlast deodorant, which I got as a free sample, from BzzAgent, dried quickly, so didn&#x27;t have to wait before finishing getting dressed.</li>
            <li> I packed my Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel in my hospital bag because I was looking forward to smelling clean and fresh after having my baby.</li>
            <li> and it is not hard to get the gel to come up.</li>
            <li> I sweat quite a bit, even without physical exertion and this kept me dry even in the most stressful of situations.</li>
            <li> It does go on wet, clear, &amp; drys very quickly (within minutes).</li>
            <li> It really does keep me dry and fresh even when I&#x27;m working in my garden.</li>
            <li> I put it to the ultimate test by keeping up with my kids all day outside and it held strong.</li>
            <li> have finally found the right deodorant for me.  </li>
            <li> I put on my invisible solid and right way</li>
            <li> It was easy to use - even though it was a wet gel, it dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gell works better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel product.  </li>
            <li> It leaves no residue on my clothing, which is a huge advantage over other deodorants.</li>
            <li> but I feel as though gel deodorant doesn&#x27;t last as long as the powder white kind, so</li>
            <li> very small, but it smells nice</li>
            <li> I prefer the Clinical Strength over this one because it offers just a little more wetness protection.</li>
            <li> Using gel deodorant was a new thing to me</li>
            <li> my new go to deodora#epic4#...</li>
            <li> I live this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always leery about trying a new deodorant.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida.</li>
            <li> Secret has always been a good brand in my opinion but the new clear gel product exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> It does dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I liked the scent, I thought it held up well under harsh conditions of running outside in 90 degree weather.</li>
            <li> and I just wanna say I loved my secret outlast clear deodorant.</li>
            <li> This Secret was a great price, especially when I used the coupon for it.</li>
            <li> I felt like it never dried completely, and my underarms felt very sticky all day.</li>
            <li> As I got older I needed stronger wetness protection that clear gels just weren&#x27;t affording me.</li>
            <li> Where I live is very hot and humid and I like my deodorant  to keep me dry, for me</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells and this doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive armpits and can&#x27;t use a lot of deodorants.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Oh, another thing I love about this deodorant is that even is a gel it doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry.</li>
            <li> and I can say it dry pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Hello clear gel!</li>
            <li> I have never used clear gels!</li>
            <li> It also dries fast and feels clean and fresh after applying, the only thing I do not like is that it did not completely keep me dry every time I used it.</li>
            <li> and yay to those days that it is so hot outside</li>
            <li> That is when I realized that it was definitely too much!  </li>
            <li> I have, by accident, gone 48 hours without reapplying and I was surprised to find that the deodorant was indeed still working!</li>
            <li> I was however, pleasantly surprised with this!</li>
            <li> im feeling sticky, I can feel the deodorant on my skin, it just doesn&#x27;t feel natural!</li>
            <li> I am interested to see if it can last 48hours.  </li>
            <li> It offers protection for up to 48 hours, although I have not tested it for that lenght of time, but its does get me through the day and thats all that matters!</li>
            <li> First day I used it, there was a lady next to me</li>
            <li> I am now fresh all day long</li>
            <li> It really does go on clear, dries fast and does not leave white marks!</li>
            <li> It keeps you fresh all day long</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I think this was a good move for Secret because I can honestly say that me and my panel of Outlast users hadn&#x27;t used ANY Secret deo products for years, maybe because of lack of brand knowledge, freshness of name or in your face marketing</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean for free to test it out, as part of a promotion from Secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean deodorant for free for review courtesy of BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was given Secret Outlast completely clean to try for free from Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> Thank you Secret and BzzAgent for my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li> I will say with trying this new clear gel, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent, I received a Bzzkit with a free sample of the Secret Outlast completely clean clear gel.</li>
            <li> I received my free trail of Secret Outlast completely clean and clear gel deodorant as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> It can keep her odor free for over 48 hours, which means less time trying to get her to put deodorant on</li>
            <li> it dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li> it kept me dry and fresh all day.</li>
            <li> My apprehension was quickly soothed, as I noticed that while it did go on wet....</li>
            <li> It does go on wet, but dries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wet when you first put it on, but it dries really fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new mom and the last thing I need is to be a sweaty mess on top of being sleep deprived.</li>
            <li> dries fast last long and gives off a fresh scent when the heat is on</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and a little gel goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, clean and subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Well it didn&#x27;t dry fast and too much gel coming out .But</li>
            <li> It not only held up to keeping me dry and odor free through a 12 hour shift</li>
            <li> I wear alot of black for work, and simply because I love the color.</li>
            <li> I wear black alot, and I was pleased to see that it doesnt leave any white streaks or residue.</li>
            <li> This deodorant left me dry and odor free.</li>
            <li> I love how you can wear black and not worry about getting white streaks on your clothes.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I was hesitant on a gel because they are usually messy and take an an eternity to dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands in the past that have advertised the same clear no marks application and after much searching</li>
            <li> It glides on slightly wet and cool but dries within a few seconds and the scent is very &amp;#34;just showered&amp;#34; fresh which seems to linger throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It does go on wet, but clear, and dries very quickly, and does not leave white marks.</li>
            <li> It does go on wet, but clear, and dries very quickly, and does not leave white marks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving Secret Outlast Clear Gel!</li>
            <li> Something else that really surprised me is how well it kept me dry even in super stressful situations including, but not limited to; working out, work meetings and presentations, meeting new people, babysitting etc etc.</li>
            <li> This is one you have to try to believe and honestly I am tempted to try more of this collection as I still have 1 coupon left, Secret was generous with the coupons and EVERYONE I gave a coupon to thanks to the average deo price point bought it to try because it was an entire $1 off which made it a no brainer to give it a whirl...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll trade the wet feeling any day for the amazing smelling, long lasting, and no wet marks!</li>
            <li> The Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant is amazing</li>
            <li> It should also be noted that this product does not leave a stain or film on your clothes, it&#x27;s is truly clear.</li>
            <li> it truly is clear.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear and protects all day and night.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and stays clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always seen this Clear Gel Deodorant on the shelves at the store</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s clear so there are no worries about making marks on clothes.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear so there was no transfer on my clothing.</li>
            <li> This one is a clear gel</li>
            <li> I like the clear gel</li>
            <li> it goes on clear</li>
            <li> Works well, clear, no staining.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of clear gel but decided to give this one a whirl.  </li>
            <li> Let me just make this clear</li>
            <li> This product goes on clear, no residue just protected.</li>
            <li> and I just started using Outlast Clear with this order.</li>
            <li> I do like that it is a clear gel</li>
            <li> Goes on clear  </li>
            <li> I have never tried clear gel before this product and did not expect it to feel so sticky after applying.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Clear Gel Convert!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> it goes on clear</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a clear gel deodorant in about 15 years.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised that</li>
            <li> It has never left a white mark on my shirt, which is so important to me because I wear tank tops daily!</li>
            <li> I also like how it was invisible and not messy.  </li>
            <li> After chasing a 2 &amp; 6yr old around I haven&#x27;t had to worry about sweating and re-apply deodorant because I was worried how I smelled.  </li>
            <li> but as far as the protection</li>
            <li> The first day I used this was a really long day.  </li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised at how well this deodorant works.  </li>
            <li> I have thrown out my old deodorant and I will be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> I have a 6 month old who spits up a lot</li>
            <li> I was surprised how it held up</li>
            <li> So far, 29 hours in the Florida heat</li>
            <li> I like the gel antiperspirant as it doesn&#x27;t stain as much, and doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks.  </li>
            <li> I probably would have preferred something unscented, or just a faint more natural smell, like a powder fresh or something.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast and has not left any marks on my clothes!</li>
            <li> This product works and it really does last.  </li>
            <li> but I was surprised.</li>
            <li> I work in a busy hospital and do a lot of walking</li>
            <li> For the fast drying I don&#x27;t think it was any faster then my regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really try out the 48 hour protection because it&#x27;s the middle of summer</li>
            <li> But maybe my smeller isn&#x27;t as sensitive as the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being a busy mom of a newborn and toddler</li>
            <li> Although, the Outlast is a very close second in my favorites.</li>
            <li> As an adult, I wear clear gel instead of solids</li>
            <li> It lasts 48 hours for me so far as I shower each morning</li>
            <li> Makes laundry much easier to not have to worry about those pesky white streaks!</li>
            <li> it really does last 48 hours...</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for those with sensitive skin like myself.    </li>
            <li> I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel from Bzzagent to try and give my honest opinion about it.</li>
            <li> I love that their are no sticky or white messy marks when I put it on</li>
            <li> Secret has made a really nice product.</li>
            <li> After using it the next few days, I cut down to using one half of the gel that came out in one click on each side, and that seemed to be the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a single mom, full time teacher, daily runner, and church attendee 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Secret Outlast gel and am completely in love with it--no wet feeling, no sticky feeling, just clean.  </li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean scent clear gel deodorant complimentary of BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Living in Tennessee, summers are hot and humid so I need an antiperspirant that will keep up with me and keep me dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge on my black tank top, it doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry, and it stays put.</li>
            <li> but it dry&#x27;s quickly and don&#x27;t turn white after.</li>
            <li> just a clean, natural scent that stayed with me all day and even garnered a few compliments on my smell</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent, goes on smooth with no white marks and no follow up perfume needed!</li>
            <li> short, I like that it has a more prominent scent than the invisible solid, but I really don&#x27;t like the cold and wet feelings in my underarms, and the fact that so much comes out with each click.  </li>
            <li> short, I like that it has a more prominent scent than the invisible solid, but I really don&#x27;t like the cold and wet feelings in my underarms, and the fact that so much comes out with each click.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the original solid from secret but I loved the clear gel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this gel that dries absolutely clear and leaves no white residue on clothing!  </li>
            <li> I was able to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel  through Secret for free!!</li>
            <li> However, I truly still smell clean after a long, long day of running around after a classroom of kindergarteners and 4 hours of classes for my masters degree!</li>
            <li> I worked around the house, I painted outside in the hot sun, I participated in physical activity</li>
            <li> I rarely give anything 5 stars, but this product does what it says it will -- at least for the first 24hours.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, it does NOT provide wetness protection, it actually does the opposite.</li>
            <li> you defiantly don&#x27;t have to waste your time running around and reapplying deodorant  all day long like I have found with most deodorants  </li>
            <li> I tend to wear a lot of dark colors and have been on the hunt for a great antiperspirant that truly didn&#x27;t leave their mark behind.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and is long lasting, which is great when you don&#x27;t have any time for a shower.&lt;br /&gt;Trying this product for free thanks to Secret &amp; BzzAgent for the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> I noticed that when I wore the deodorant with fabrics other than cotton, I wouldn&#x27;t have as much odor protection by the end of the day - particularly those fabrics that contain polyester.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a clean scent and doesn&#x27;t overpower other fragrances that I like to wear daily.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this</li>
            <li> Totally loving this new secret outlast gel deodorant!</li>
            <li> I love this new product from Secret.</li>
            <li> I really love this new product from Secret.</li>
            <li> Other things that I like from this deodorant is that it last long time, I can&#x27;t say it last 48 hours cause I take more than one shower a day since I live in the tropic and is super hot, but I use it for hard work such as helping my husband in his workshop and playing with my 6 year old girl</li>
            <li> It really lasts a long time</li>
            <li> would purchase this deodorant and recommend it because I believe in the Secret brand, and was impressed with how well Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant</li>
            <li> my normal white stick that leaves marks everywhere.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I spent the day walking through NYC, seeing a play and going to dinner.  </li>
            <li> I am normally a invisible solid type of girl</li>
            <li> When I put my baby in our carrier to go to the store I normally end up with white deodorant marks on the straps.</li>
            <li> If I get dressed first it is a lot harder to put this stuff on bc</li>
            <li> it was not to wet and seemed to dry pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I am assured that I will be clear, fresh, dry and smelling good no matter how busy, long or crazy</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t make my armpits cold like other gels.</li>
            <li> Each day offered a slightly different test of it&#x27;s ability to live up to it&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li> This will be my new go-to deodorant especially in the summer months!</li>
            <li> Second, I live in Texas,</li>
            <li> live in California where it has been between 101 and 110 for the last month and during that time I was given the opportunity to test and review this product courtesy of BzzAgent and Secret.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The gel did dry, but not all that fast.</li>
            <li> It dry fast.</li>
            <li> Not to big on it, I really like the solid invisible sticks.</li>
            <li> I was able to sample and review the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deoderant because I am a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s a long day working or a long day hiking, I always still smell fresh at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast clear gel for FREE through bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I did tell them it was a gel and not a solid and was very surprised that people weren&#x27;t deterred</li>
            <li> I will be buying this product in the very near future.</li>
            <li> Received it free from BzzAgent; I&#x27;ve been using this for three weeks, and I will continue to buy this for it&#x27;s long-lasting protection, and freedom from white streaks on my black wardrobe!  </li>
            <li> I left the class with the smell of the clear gel instead of body odor!</li>
            <li> Also the gel isn&#x27;t too watery, it dries instantly and clear!</li>
            <li> and before I would notice white marks a lot but with the clear gel I dont have to worry about that!</li>
            <li> The major take-away point is the effectiveness of this</li>
            <li> With Mitchum the gel stayed pretty wet and sticky under my arm and despite going on clear, it would leave white streaks on my clothes.</li>
            <li> It kept to its claims about no white streaks, long lasting deodorant, and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Another thing i like about it is that it did not discolor my under arm area which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> No wet sticky residue from the gel and no leftover reminders on my clothes at the end of the night!  </li>
            <li> I live in southern Alabama and generally our weather is over 100</li>
            <li> It dries completely within minutes, offers great protection, and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my dark clothes or my black baby carrier (a major issue I&#x27;ve been having with my usual</li>
            <li> So far I have no complaint as I have not noticed any body odor and still feel dry.  </li>
            <li> The most common complaint I hear about the solids are that they aren&#x27;t suitable to wear with dark clothing, and that you can see that you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> After the first day, I was still unbelievably completely dry!!!  </li>
            <li> a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>

            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> Within a week of using a new product (and even sometimes with an old one), I break out in tiny, red, itchy spots on my underarms.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to participate in a product testing and review program and got the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free from Secret.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and does feel very wet; However, it dries so fast.</li>
            <li> However, after using this particular product on several occasions I have come to the conclusion that it does have a favorable scent and does not leave white marks.</li>
            <li> First, I’ll start out with saying that I got to test this product ( Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel) for free from Secret and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had wonderful experiences with clear gel deodorants in the past, so I was a little apprehensive to try Secret Outlast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just had bad experiences with them, but after trying this one I am happy and will be replacing my stock.</li>
            <li> I usually steer clear of clear deodorant ;)</li>
            <li> I actually got to try this free, thanks to Secret and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I generally get unscented products whenever I can.</li>
            <li> It ACTUALLY went on clear and didn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> I already use secrect solid deodorant but had not tried thr clear gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the clear deodorant, since it can take a while for the wetness to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; before getting dressed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my clothing because of the clear gel technology of this product.</li>
            <li> With secret outlast clear gel I have no white marks at all on any of my shirts :)</li>
            <li> They advertise up to 48 &#x27;epic&#x27; hours of wetness protection, odor protection, and no white marks on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does outlast your busy schedule and provides the odor protection and white mark protection</li>
            <li> There is no wet or sticky feeling or even a residue that I can feel.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt as with traditional solid deodorants, but it still stained the underarm cuffs of my shirt with a clear/wet/shiny/glitter-like appearance, which was very unflattering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy mom of two with 2 big dogs and a husband who isn&#x27;t home a lot</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the deodorant, but I don&#x27;t know that I would be inclined to buy the Secret Outlast clear gel over the solid that I had already been accustomed to.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been close to 100 outside where I&#x27;m located</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel because it totally made me change my mind.  </li>
            <li> and I think I will give it a few more tries before I make up my mind to go from a solid to gel.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the wet feeling when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> i love about secret as i will always say, once it goes on</li>
            <li> and I still love the Secret brand.</li>
            <li> I got to try this as a promo from secret :) wouldn&#x27;t buy the gel again but might give the solids a run because I do like the smell.</li>
            <li> Thank you to secret and bzzagent for letting me try this free!</li>
            <li> The product does dry quickly, which I’ve noticed you might have to wait with other gel deodorants.  </li>
            <li> The Clear Gel formula really does dry clear and does not leave residue on clothes or a wet mark.</li>
            <li> I held on to my sample for a few days knowing I&#x27;d be starting my new job and figured there would be no bigger test then the first week at a new place, in the middle of summer mind</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite and will be until Secret stops selling it, which I don&#x27;t think is going to happen!</li>
            <li> The gel goes on cold but smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like too much is that it takes a while to dry once applied.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would change is you really need to let the product dry before putting your clothes on.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about this deodorant is that I went through it very quickly.</li>
            <li> It does go on wet, yet it dries very quickly (within a few minutes).</li>
            <li> It dried quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about looking like I sweated through my shirt before I even left the house.</li>
            <li> This one in particular smell very fresh, to get any product out for the first time you have to spin the bottom a few times, any other time I recommend spinning just half way otherwise you will get too much product out and it will take a long time to dry on your armpits.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive a Bzzagent campaign for Secret</li>
            <li> This gel dried right away.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised  to still be fresh and dry after my hour and a half work out.</li>
            <li> and I do not seem to be going through the product quickly although it is quite a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, but certainly not least, it does not take much at all, just a little swipe under each arm and you are through.</li>
            <li> But other then that, I noticed that I don&#x27;t sweat as much and as often.</li>
            <li> , that is not normally something I do with my normal deodorant.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this deodorant if you are looking for long lasting protection!</li>
            <li> Other than that i really love the cool and airy effect of this deodorant versus the solid version of this, I actually use secret everyday and its my main deodorant</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like is that o seem to go through the clear gel faster than the solid.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying the clear gel as well and alternate it and the solid.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of secret outlast clear gel as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was selected through a social media marketing agency to review this product.</li>
            <li> Prior to trying this product, I had been boycotting secret deodorant for about 5 years or more.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I didn&#x27;t like, was that the armpit areas of my shirts were not dry.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast in the solid is a lot better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It dried almost instantly and even in a black tank top</li>
            <li> I think this is a secret every female should know about love this formula  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast 48 hr Completely Clean gel thanks to Secret.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I did not enjoy the wet feeling when I first put on the deodorant, but the feeling quickly goes away.</li>
            <li> You can feel confident knowing that once it&#x27;s on and dried (in seconds), you won&#x27;t have any white mess on your clothing.  </li>
            <li> I applied this deodorant, I was initially pretty unimpressed, and honestly a little grossed out.  </li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive at first, as I have never used gel deodorant before.</li>
            <li> I included a photograph of my full-size Secret® Invisible Solids deodorants, that I use on a regular basis and the small sample-size Secret® Clear Gel deodorant BzzAgent sent me in the mail, as well as a photograph of the back of the deodorants showing the difference in the &#x27;active ingredients&#x27; list, I&#x27;m sure that has a lot to do with the effectiveness of the solid vs the gel.</li>
            <li> It is delicate, feminine and actually gives you a very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I was mostly excited to try the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant when I received it for FREE as a BzzCampaign thanks to Secret!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s sooooo cold early in the morning when I put it on that I do a little wiggle but feel great nonetheless within seconds  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s such a shame that Secret® hasput out such a bad deodorant when their solid deodorants are highly effective and on a much higher caliber than this crappy gel nonsense.</li>
            <li> I have tested the clear gel&#x27;s protection while doing a hour long Zumba class.</li>
            <li> I generally use regular stick deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean gel not only doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes when I change three times a day, but it also keeps my pits as dry as the moment I first apply it in the morning.</li>
            <li> However the protection doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours, it barely lasted 7-8 hours on me.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming, and it just smells fresh- not too girly or strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would just rather play it safe, especially since regular Secret has always done the job for me.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Completely Clean</li>
            <li> received the Completely Clean Secret Clear Gel to review through clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> Thank you Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> Here is where Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel comes in.    </li>
            <li> I tried out Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as a promo from Bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> This hormone change in my body got me sweating a little more than usual.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of gel deodorants, but Secret&#x27;s new Outlast Clear Gel seems to be decent so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove regularly for years and was pleasantly surprised by this deodorant when I received a free sample of it from Secret in the mail last week.</li>
            <li> Things have definitely changed with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Gel!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint about the product is the scent to me it reminds of a very strong laundry detergent and some days it&#x27;s a little much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i was surprised at how well the deoderant worked in keeping me dry under my arms.</li>
            <li> Lasts so much longer than my previous antipers/deodorants.</li>
            <li> But, whether I used half a click, or a whole one, it still did what it was supposed to do...</li>
            <li> This deodorant slightly burns when applied immediately after shaving, but it really does OUTLAST the day.</li>
            <li> I just think I will stick to my usual powder fresh solid.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel for free from Secret for review on BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from Secret.</li>
            <li> You might think that the clear gels are &amp;#34;too wet&amp;#34;, but that can be solved by simply letting yourself dry before putting on your shirt.</li>
            <li> It went on wet &amp; sticky but dried quickly.</li>
            <li> Outlast Clear Gel has kept me dry!</li>
            <li> The only downsides to the deodorant are that its gross to apply wet deodorant to wet armpits (I recommend drying the application area first), and if you&#x27;ve recently shaved like I am, it may sting for a minute until it dries.</li>
            <li> It also doesn’t leave those thick, chalk-like white marks on your shirts - so your black outfits are safe.  </li>
            <li> When first putting this product on I noticed that I didn&#x27;t get the wet sticky feeling that other gel deodorants have given me.</li>
            <li> Since receiving my free sample from Secret to test and review, I&#x27;ve actually already purchased another full size Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Price isn’t outstanding, but it isn’t really that bad</li>
            <li> Outlast clear gel because it was wet when I put it on.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s not really invisible as they say it will be) for this clear gel.  </li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it was clear and didn&#x27;t leave behind any residues, but unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li> First, I hate white marks on my clothes; however, I am happy to say there isn&#x27;t an issue with white marks when you use Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant.</li>
            <li> I got secret outlast completely clean for free from Secret as a part of the promotion.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean for free to test out as part of a promotion from Secret.</li>
            <li> I do recommend it for typical women who have normal sweat glands.</li>
            <li> My typical morning is to hop out of the shower, do the normal hygiene routing - deodorant, hair, face, etc.</li>
            <li> I usually use various solid white brands, primarily because they have never created a problem other than white marks and they had a wide scent variety.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only are a very active family, but we live in the country, in Texas...</li>
            <li> I recently receive a trial of  The Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant feom BzzAgent and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I used to use clear gels in the past when I was young and carefree.</li>
            <li> It definitely worked well - no white marks on my clothes, odor protection for 48 hours (don&#x27;t ask me how I know it lasted this long), and no sweating.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested it through a few rounds of 93 degree weather disc golf in the hot Texas sun, yard work, and countless other strenuous tasks, and this product does everything</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, I bought a few to stock up just in case they sell out.  </li>
            <li> Quick note, you really only need one to two clicks of Secret Outlast.  </li>
            <li> No wet marks under arms, no grey marks on white shirts and no white marks on my dark stuff!</li>
            <li> It lasts long, that even after I shower the scent is still present.</li>
            <li> It held me up throughout my entire work day and long after my workout.</li>
            <li> , I need something that&#x27;s going to last and allow me to keep moving without worrying about if my deodorant gave up long before my kids did.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> However, it was a travel size bottle, so it was not intended to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I am usually not a fan of gel deodorants- as putting wet deodorant on my wet, sweaty armpit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally not a clear gel type of person, however this one was different.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, again about the wetness part, but was pleasantly surprised when the gel dried before I even put my top on.</li>
            <li> I had never used clear gel deodorant before because I always thought they would feel wet and sticky under my arms, take too long to dry, or get even wetter if I started sweating.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little wet when you first put it on, but it dries in seconds and keeps my dry ALL day long.</li>
            <li> On days that I do heavy cardio, I do not sweat or smell bad and that&#x27;s a great thing.</li>
            <li> and now when its empty I will be buysing more Secret Outlast to replace this one!</li>
            <li> Well I say, wait a second for it to dry and your shirts will thank you.  </li>
            <li> I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel thanks to BuzzAgent.</li>
            <li> It definitely keeps you dry for up to 48 hour...</li>
            <li> It took awhile to dry, but that is the only thing I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Since I wear professional clothing everyday, I didn&#x27;t have to deal with the embarrassing white marks.</li>
            <li> I felt clean and dry all day (yes, even compared to the holy grail of all deodorants, Secret Clinical Strength) and it dried quicker than other clear deodorants I have used in the past (you get used to that initial sticky, wet feeling because it goes away so quickly.)</li>
            <li> However, once the clear gel dried, the smell became more subtle and my armpits magically dried up!</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised by how well this held up to my very active lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use clear gel deodorants as I prefer solids, however, this Outlast Clear Gel from Secret just may get me to make the switch!  </li>
            <li> The one negative I found was that the gel doesn&#x27;t last as long, but it could be that I am putting on too much product.  </li>
            <li> but it also left no white marks on my dark nursing scrub shirts or leave clumps of white residue on my underarms.</li>
            <li> I will first start of by saying I got to try the secret outlast gel completely free from Secret.</li>
            <li> If you want a deodorant that will last all day long make the switch!!</li>
            <li> I have thrown away several key pieces due to staining and discoloration from my normal deodorants - Lady Speed Stick and Degree solids that both claimed no white residue (NOT true); and Dove and Degree spray deodorant that claims to last all day (again - NOT true).</li>
            <li> I am a personal trainer that is moving all day/working out, and this has helped me maintain dry and stink-free armpits!  </li>
            <li> It feels wet and slightly sticky for just a second then dries completely.</li>
            <li> and i can actually smell it all day, unlike other deodorants i have used, that you can only smell for an hour if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a 9 year old that unfortunately has developed at a very early age and getting her to use deodorant is like pulling teeth.</li>
            <li> It kept me dry all day &amp; was still dry the next morning.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t pushed it to the advertised 48 hour protection, but I can say it works really well for at least 24.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from Secret through Bzzagent!</li>
            <li> So when Buzzagent sent me this one free for review purposes I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> The most common complaint I hear about gels is that they&#x27;re too wet.  </li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the gel deodorants I used it before and every time I felt wet.  </li>
            <li> I have been a gel user for a long time</li>
            <li> It lasted for the rest of my stinky workout day and the long morning after through some Yoga.</li>
            <li> I do like this deodorant, the only issue I have is the wet feeling when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast went on smooth and dried almost instantly.</li>
            <li> i got my free secret outlast thanks to secret and bzzagent</li>
            <li> Then lets say we have a long weekend of running and running with no time for myself...</li>
            <li> However, I would not recommend it for long work days (since you will be reapplying it every 6 hours or so).</li>
            <li> I put it on feeling like sweat and felt that way all day long.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m not much of a sweater, but I&#x27;ve smelled the consequences of forgetting the occasional shower and it was not pretty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only downside is that it is wet when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> another complain was that they never lasted long and required re application.</li>
            <li> They left you feeling wet and sticky under the arms.  </li>
            <li> and I also played a hot game of Bocce at a local lake.  </li>
            <li> ® Clear Gel Deodorant, as I mainly use other antiperspirant/deodorants by the Secret® brand, unfortunately, I DID NOT like this clear gel deodorant one bit.</li>
            <li> I push so hard), and it dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple brands over the years but typically choose a solid even if it means white marks because gels I have tried tend to feel wet and sticky.  </li>
            <li> So far, a week and a half in, I have no itchiness or spots to report!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel didn&#x27;t live up to this.</li>
            <li> If I had any complaint at all it would be allowing my armpits to dry after reapplying but it really takes no time at all.</li>
            <li> This Secret Outlast Clear Gel really has outlasted all other deodorants that I have used.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing I have to say about the Secret</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with other gels doing just that but not Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li> You have to let it dry for a long time before you get dressed</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the Secret Outlast gel for 4 days straight now, and yesterday spent the majority of the day outside in 90 degree southern heat.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve been unsure about trying Secret Outlast Clear Gel (Completely Clean), fear no more!  </li>
            <li> but we all agreed it had been a long time since we had this in our bathrooms!</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to think of a gel vs solid, but I think overall I like a solid.  </li>
            <li> The other thing I don&#x27;t care for is the actual &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I used only this for 5 days and went hiking, running and all the other kinds of activities at the camp grounds.  </li>
            <li> With the type I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my bras or shirts, plus I don&#x27;t have little white clumps underneath my arm anymore.</li>
            <li> Unlike other deodorants I only had to apply this on once.</li>
            <li> but it just slips on and only takes a little bit and dries up instantly.</li>
            <li> It lasts as long as it state, 48 hours!</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry all day long and since odor was never an issue with me, I know it is keeping up with that, too!</li>
            <li> The biggest con for me was that initially the gel feels very wet</li>
            <li> Even after my Zumba class, my underarms are completely dry.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and does work for 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I have avoided gel deodorants because you have to wait for them to dry before putting on your shirt.</li>
            <li> When I put it on I feel like I need to keep my arms raised in the air to let it dry</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I was still dry.</li>
            <li> It keeps you dry and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It stays sticky all day no matter what, so I can&#x27;t say that it keeps you dry.</li>
            <li> I stay dry all day and all night.  </li>
            <li> I feel dry and odorless even at the end of my day.</li>
            <li> and I have to wait for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> it does its job of keeping you dry</li>
            <li> It takes a while for the product to dry and even after drying it still has a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have time to sit and wait for the deodorant to dry</li>
            <li> and I feel like it needs to dry before I get dressed.</li>
            <li> but i always had to wait for them to dry or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried aluminum-free varieties and found they failed to keep me dry or clean smelling.</li>
            <li> and it is dry.</li>
            <li> keeps you dry</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry even when I am outside and active</li>
            <li> I accidentally got some on the outside of my shirt one day and it dried within 5 minutes and didn&#x27;t leave any white residue like some deodorants do.</li>
            <li> Secret has always been my go to brand, but Outlast really goes above and beyond with protection.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I&#x27;d known about Secret Outlast before I tried the traditional &#x27;stick&#x27; deodorant and ruined my clothes.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is the same as clinical strength but is 16% as opposed to 20%.</li>
            <li> My main complaint with gels before this one was that they took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I would really like to see Secret offer an odor protection ONLY deodorant in a variety of scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i never really used the gel deodorants before because they just seemed like they would be wet and sticky, but this one actually is not.</li>
            <li> but this is definitely your bff if you have an active lifestyle a gym bag keeper.</li>
            <li> have used other brands in the past and they have left my sensitive skin feeling itchy and rashy.</li>
            <li> #34;freshen up&amp;#34; were limited.</li>
            <li> Im loving it that I haven&#x27;t felt sticky, sweaty and just plain dirty in my pits.</li>
            <li> Enter secret outlast - with the clear gel I didn&#x27;t have to worry about how fast I put on my shirt, though, it still does take a few minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> It truly does outlast my usual stick deodorant, goes on clear, and dries within seconds.</li>
            <li> I have tried the invisible solids and the clear gels before, and I have just always preferred the powder fresh feeling to the cold, sticky, wet gels.</li>
            <li> However, secret has multiple scents and even the regular clear gel</li>
            <li> No worries for white on my dark clothes.</li>
            <li> and it does not leave white stains in my dark clothes.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free to test out as part of a promotion from Secret and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise to discover that this Secret clear gel, that states no white marks, actually lives up to its promises.  </li>
            <li> I got to test Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free through BzzAgent and Secret.  </li>
            <li> When I first received my sample of Secret Outlast from Bzzagent, I had not used antiperspirant in months.</li>
            <li> I purposely wore it with a black tanktop to test it and not only did it take over two minutes to dry</li>
            <li> already am a fan of Secret deodorant, so of course I was excited to test Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a very long time!  </li>
            <li> and my black shirt didn&#x27;t have any white streaks!  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I&#x27;ve never needed a deodorant to last that long.</li>
            <li> The only downfall I found is that when applied immediately after shaving, it has a slight sting...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the gel version because I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling on my underarms while I wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I will probably spend half the money I do in deodorant because I won&#x27;t be constantly applying.</li>
            <li> There is no white mess whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I work part-time in a printing plant and during the summer it is very hot in there and needless to say I sweat.</li>
            <li> Upon application, it does feel a bit gross like your typical roll-on or gels should be expected to.</li>
            <li> It even stays all day, and doesn&#x27;t leave a single stain!</li>
            <li> Some of the clear gel&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past made me feel like I needed to use the hair drier to dry my pits before I could put them down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a dedicated user of stick deodorant in the past, but since trying Secret Outlast Completely Clean, I will be making the switch.  </li>
            <li> It goes on dry and dries about 2x faster than other deodorants.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free as a Bzzagent, and to tell you the truth I was a little skeptical of the claims.</li>
            <li> So when my sample arrived, I was skeptical, and not super excited to try it...</li>
            <li> Lastly, the deodorant looks like it&#x27;s a regular size, but it really is small (less than 3 oz., but then again, I put on only put on half of the suggested amount...</li>
            <li> so it does get used a little quicker than your standard stick, so that’s certainly not in its favor.</li>
            <li> I could ramble on and on about how well Secret Outlast Gel works, how it goes on wet, but dries quickly, is clear so leaves no white  marks on your clothing, but I won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say that the Secret Outlast Completely Clear is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This of course still happened with this Secret Outlast Clear Gel so it still didn&#x27;t totally change my opinion about gels.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear gel dries almost instantly</li>
            <li> As a busy mom of two boys, I sweat alot and have to reapply deodorant at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> I definitely will buy Secret Outlast Clear Gel again.  </li>
            <li> but I really like Secret Outlast gel.  </li>
            <li> you also cant use it for blister control on your heels, as it stays too wet-</li>
            <li> When I got this deodorant from BzzAgent, I expected to try it once and then trash it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Secret and BzzAgent that has all changed and</li>
            <li> Secret is the intimate of deodorants for women.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again to Secret and Bzzagent for this opportunity.</li>
            <li> , I just do not like that wet feeling.</li>
            <li> Halfway through dinner I realized that I hadn&#x27;t felt sweaty in my armpits all day -- and it was roughly 13 hours after I applied it.  </li>
            <li> I was winded, but the sweat was minimal.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that the gel can be a bit messy</li>
            <li> I have use Secret solid and Secret Invisible Solid before, I personally preferred the invisible solid over the regular solid one.</li>
            <li> I am just not a fan of anything that feels wet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it out the last few days</li>
            <li> but it also feels a bit wet.</li>
            <li> Though I wish this didn&#x27;t go on so wet</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you with a yucky wet feeling.  </li>
            <li> , I really, really wanted to like the Secret Outlast</li>
            <li> The Secret Outlast doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothing nor under my arms and it seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li> It goes on a bit wet feeling but dries within about a minute.</li>
            <li> It goes on wet, and when I sweat, it gets really wet.</li>
            <li> Thanks to secret</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days and a lot is already used up.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like that wet feeling at all.</li>
            <li> I never bought gel type deodorants because I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t have any wet stains or marks on the shirt</li>
            <li> I tried secret outlast thanks to bzzagent.</li>
            <li> The harder you work, the harder it seems to work for your body.</li>
            <li> When applying this product, it does go on wet, but just wait a minute or two</li>
            <li> One click glides on in a thin layer and lasts throughout the day and daily routine of my busy life.</li>
            <li> It seemed to dry pretty quickly, and it didn&#x27;t leave the sticky feeling behind, but it was still cold, and very wet feeling.</li>
            <li> With my other brand, I sometimes would have little white chunks of deodorant on my armpits after I was finished.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying a clear gel because of the slimy grossness of deodorants past, but Secret Clear Gel dries in a snap and kept me fresh and dry all day!  </li>
            <li> It took a bit longer to dry than a solid which I&#x27;m not sure I care for, but is something people who already use a gel wouldn&#x27;t be bothered by.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product at first simply because of the Secret brand name and me not having very much luck with their products in the past</li>
            <li> All I wear is black and grey</li>
            <li> gel goes on wet, and does take a few minutes to &#x27;dry&#x27;, but not as long as other gels i have tried before.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is a complete failure at the things it&#x27;s meant to do and claims to do.</li>
            <li> With my pervious brand of deodorant, I would have to twist and do little dance moves to avoid getting any white marks on the bottom of my dark shirts.  </li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T LIKE THE WET FEELING, OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product &amp; will definitely be switching to Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product &amp; will definitely be switching to Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a thick stick deodorant type, but I was asked to try the new SEcret Outlast Completely Clear Gel.  </li>
            <li> No white marks on my little black dress.  </li>
            <li> I will say that a little does go a long way and it does the job all day - whether in the heat or sweating profusely.</li>
            <li> no for those of you with larger chests, i would not recommend putting it under the bra line, as it didn&#x27;t dry well, and was a bit &#x27;icky&#x27; at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I work in retail and am active through out my shift and the Secret Outlast Clear Gel keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> Received it as part of a promotion but had purchased in the past and will continue to do so in the future!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use Secret or gel deodorant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the excessive heat, it doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours for me.  </li>
            <li> I will be switching to this one from now on and will also try the other scents in this line.</li>
            <li> the humidity is unbelievable, add into the baking in an oven type of temperature outside</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for other body parts because why would I put it on other body parts</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well  as other deodorants though.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to cover odor as well as other deodorants like Dove.</li>
            <li> but it is smaller (although not as small as the travel size).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it makes my underarms so wet!</li>
            <li> No more white marks for me to have to worry about.</li>
            <li> Anyways I usually wear an invisible solid one</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I haven’t seen any other scents</li>
            <li> After 3 days, I went back to my usual.  </li>
            <li> It leaves no white marks &amp; doesn&#x27;t ball up like some stick deodorants I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Did I mention NO MORE WHITE MARKS ON MY CLOTHES?!?!</li>
            <li> have used various stick deodorants in the past</li>
            <li> It also is extremely lightweight feels as if your not wearing deodorant.</li>
            <li> Container small and gel portion is even smaller.</li>
            <li> While other gel-like deodorants are sticky, this one isn’t.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering like some other deodorants.</li>
            <li> So probably in less humid and crazy hot places, it would last 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> and then you have very wet underarms.</li>
            <li> The deodorant feels very wet.</li>
            <li> Without Secret and BzzAgent I would not have a new deodorant that I use routinely after the gym.</li>
            <li> The deodorant lasted all day with no need to reapply, but as I am active at work, I did not put the 48 hours to test, I needed to shower before that.  </li>
            <li> When I got stuck after a snowstorm without a shower for 48 hrs, not my idea of fun, but at least the Secret outlasted my impatience....  </li>
            <li> but I might have found it after testing out Secret Outlast free as a promotional courtesy of Secret.</li>
            <li> it will get all over my clothes if I&#x27;m not super careful and again there is the drying time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m defiantly switching to Secret Outlast Clear Gel!</li>
            <li> Really stops the funk even through a tough, outdoor day!</li>
            <li> and you can see my previous almost empty bottle!</li>
            <li> I usually use a solid, so the stickiness of the gel took a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes when I twisted it, it seemed like to much came out.  </li>
            <li> I got to review this product as part of a promotion for the Secret Outlast Clear Gel because I am a Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> With Secret Outlast Clear Gel, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about that</li>
            <li> I received a sample size of this from bzzagent.com and Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant to test and review (complimentary).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it destroyed my dark clothes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Secret!</li>
            <li> I got to review this product as part of a promotion for the Secret Outlast Clear Gel because I am a Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Whether I was watching my oldest at football camp, out fishing on the lake, or cutting grass, the deodorant did its job, and the fresh scent remained throughout it all.</li>
            <li> I recommend Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant.</li>
            <li> In this Texas heat I needed a deodorant that could keep up with me and Secret Outlast Clear Gel does the job.</li>
            <li> Do I recommend the Secret Outlast Clear Gel?  </li>
            <li> My only negative is that when you twist to get the deodorant to come up either none comes or A TON comes</li>
            <li> I bought this so it wouldn&#x27;t stain the under arms of my dark shirts, like the \\&quot;invisible</li>
            <li> I had never liked gel deodorants because of the constant feel of wetness.</li>
            <li> Not the case with secret Clear Gel.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Secret!</li>
            <li> Instead of leaving the usual residue, it immediately dried and left no stain behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had used secret before but not the clear gel.</li>
            <li> I was using secret clinical strength sensitive before and I&#x27;m not a fan of overly smelly deodorants</li>
            <li> because I was running late I got to add in the element of running down the street outside in the summer.  </li>
            <li> Never using dry deodorant again, this product holds up to my crazy fast paced cabin lifestyle.</li>
            <li> This deodorant never let me down.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day I think it comes down to preference.</li>
            <li> I was using degree solid before this and after this trial run I am heavily considering switching!!</li>
            <li> that to me mean that it was working, possibly working overtime.</li>
            <li> So usually while I&#x27;m allowing to dry, I&#x27;m brushing my teeth or pulling out what clothes I plan to wear.  </li>
            <li> Secret is one I definitely recommend and will continue to use for a long time!!</li>
            <li> that cold of googy feeling going on.&lt;br /&gt;But secret really last the full day,&lt;br</li>
            <li> First thing I was like I hate the wet feel of gel and the white marks on my shirts.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean also does not leave behind a wet sticky mess, it dries almost instantly, you hardly even know its there!!</li>
            <li> The weather was over 90 degrees and slightly humid.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from Secret as a BzzAgent and have to admit I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get through half my work shift before I started to wreak</li>
            <li> It’s a typical price for a gel deodorant, so that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, I typically get dressed minutes after showering</li>
            <li> Sometimes i feel like i havent even had a shower about half way through my day.</li>
            <li> Aluminum content aside, another concern was that the product was not providing wetness protection for 48hrs, therefore not true to it&#x27;s word.</li>
            <li> I recently recieved Secret Outlast clear gel from Secret through a Bzzagent campaign and I put it to the test.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not all slimy and wet and slippery like the ones I have tried in my past.</li>
            <li> but instead it was kinda sour smelling like when you leave your clothes in the washer and forget about them for a few hours on accident.  </li>
            <li> I had already been using the Secret brand solid protection in powder scent, but I received a sample of the Secret Outlast clear gel to try and review for BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> The biggest test was putting on my black Tshirt after putting it on...and there were absolutely no marks on it!!!</li>
            <li> I was completely skeptical about trying a new deodorant</li>
            <li> Had it not been for that little flaw, I would give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I never got &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; just a little odorous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just still not sure about the cold, wet feeling that I get when I apply it, and the fact that way too much comes out at once.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be testing that little aspect of this product.  </li>
            <li> You have the option, to give yourself a little or a lot, just my turning the bottom of the product.</li>
            <li> I plan on using it for years to come and suggest anyone looking for and effective antiperspirant/deodorant switch to Secret Outlast Ge;!!!!</li>
            <li> The first application I was really disappointed, because it seemed to take forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are no secrets with secret deodorant other than a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I mean seriously dry!</li>
            <li> , I stated before, I always found clear gels to be cold, wet, and sticky, and that is not a feeling that I like in my arm pits.</li>
            <li> It felt sticky even after it dried.</li>
            <li> , I guess I am one of the few stuck in the &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> However, when I tried this product I was amazed by how quickly it dried.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast helps me get threw all my of my daily routines and errands.</li>
            <li> It does come out uneven</li>
            <li> Today is my third day using Secret Outlast.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not happy with your current deodorant, give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> seems rather redundant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on to try the Secret Clinical next!</li>
            <li> However, after a few hours the odor protection ended.</li>
            <li> I have always shied away from clear gels/roll-ons because in my experience, I have always hated that wet and slimy feeling in my armpits because it never dried.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a completely overpowering scent, but it was also not so faint</li>
            <li> It has dried.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy sweater and musty too.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to Secret Outlast instead of going back to the clinical strength formula; it works just as well for me!</li>
            <li> If you are tired of regular deodorant leaving stains on yours clothes, or over-powering scents than this is the deodorant you need to try before you keep wasting your money.  </li>
            <li> I always used Secret, but I always used invisible solid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already a recent deodorant switcher from degree to secret clinical strength.</li>
            <li> No need to re-apply after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> But it smells like those heavily scented lotions at Bath &amp; Body Works or The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> This worked under heavy stress for over 48 hours</li>
            <li> I have used Secret brand deodorant before but is was the solid powder that said it wouldn&#x27;t mark up my clothes, but it did</li>
            <li> , it is longer than a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> in the past i have had issues of dark stains in the armpit region of tops.</li>
            <li> Overall my experience with Secret outlast would be</li>
            <li> When I was younger, my mother used to buy nothing but Secret Deodorant and bought it for both of us.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t thought of secret since i was a teen.</li>
            <li> The deodorant itself works well, no streaks left behind on clothes and it gets me through my workouts.  </li>
            <li> ; claim by Secret® is completely false advertising, also they have no evidence/research to back it up, it&#x27;s just a marketing gimmick.</li>
            <li> Horrible, it was broken (the top part goes out) and looked used as it was much less product left.</li>
            <li> I have converted to Secret gel deodorant, no more solid for this girl!</li>
            <li> I was a sweaty mess everywhere else!</li>
            <li> It held up to the high muggy temps that we have had and genuinly lasted 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret brand deodorant for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving my old deodorant behind and stocking up on Secret Outlast.  </li>
            <li> Secret sent me a sample of their Secret Outlast® Clear Gel and asked me what I think.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with Secret.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Secret Outlast Gel when BzzAgent sent me a sample because I was getting frustrated with lots of others I had tried.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Secret brand in the past, actually I&#x27;m using the Secret Outlast invisible solid, but since I received the Secret</li>
            <li> I usually wear men&#x27;s deodorant and have to reapply it through the night.</li>
            <li> I usually have to reapply deodorant but don&#x27;t have to with this one.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like that feeling.  </li>
            <li> No more embarrassing mishaps at work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use either Degree or Suave.  </li>
            <li> Usually I apply deodorant in the morning and touch it up around 5 or 6.  </li>
            <li> This is what I usually use but in travel size.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have another deodorant in my purse how I carry as usual</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t like deodorants in gel form because it feels so moist after applying</li>
            <li> When I was younger I tried gel deodorant and was not impressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am amazed with this item, in the past I have always been against gel deodorant.</li>
            <li> I usually use one of the clinical strength deodorants</li>
            <li> but I always find that they left a film that made it difficult when shaving...</li>
            <li> im not sure if it works 48 hours</li>
            <li> No more having to put deodorant on AFTER I put on my shirt, or having to run over my clothes with a damp washcloth afterward.</li>
            <li> in the past, i have not been a fan of &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; deodorants.</li>
            <li> It stayed in place and dried in seconds, no more waiting to get dressed!  </li>
            <li> no streaks or marks on my black shirts!!</li>
            <li> My problem with regular rub-on deodorant, is that even if it advertises that it dries clear, it still tends to give my dark clothes awful deodorant stains.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast has outlasted all the other Antiperspirant I have ever used, and I have used a lot.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the one thing that I hate from the solid one I don&#x27;t need to worry about it anymore</li>
            <li> I used to hate gels so much!</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t sweat, I could tell I was starting to stink a little bit and was a little disappointed, until I went inside</li>
            <li> In the past, I have not had sucess with any of the other deodorants that I have tried in the past until I tried Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> I have used clear gels in the past with disastrous results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to find a deodorant that does the trick</li>
            <li> And I was working hard that day</li>
            <li> My sample package was a little on the empty side, which of course was disappointing, but I still had plenty to test.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also hate how hard it is to control how much I put on.</li>
            <li> this gel gives me...which is weird because although I have used gel before I have to admit I have never really been a fan.</li>
            <li> I shower at least once in a 24 hour period</li>
            <li> Well....at least in the armpit area.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t disprove that complaint, but it has never bothered me.</li>
            <li> But it is not effective as an antiperspirant for me because I have hyperhidrosis.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have the annoying white marks or residue left behind.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a thick residue under your arms</li>
            <li> but it RUINED all my bras and shirts by thickly coating them with goo.</li>
            <li> you, I work as a Bartender/Hostess and since I work the morning shift my days are usually slow.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any luck with any of the other deodorants that i&#x27;ve tried until I tried Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> I received this as a campaign for BzzAgent.com, and was skeptical due to the fact that I do not like gel deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any luck with any of the other deodorants that i&#x27;ve tried until I tried Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> I got this secret outlast sample for the brand,i have already tried another brands but that products  are not satisfied my expectations.</li>
            <li> so no more Secret for me until now.  </li>
            <li> My usual deodorant is Secret Clinical Strength because I tend to sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> first I was very skeptical, I have tried gel deodorants before and did not like the way it felt (cold and gooey).</li>
            <li> I usually purchase invisible solid and stay away from gel because the gel makes me feel like I&#x27;ve been sweating, and that feeling makes me sweat, so I was prepared to be disappointed, sticky and sweaty.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time with deodorant because it always leaves the white balls under my arms, white marks on my clothing, or doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I was a dedicated Degree deodorant user but was getting frustrated with all the white stains it was leaving on my clothes</li>
            <li> Not a good combination.  </li>
            <li> is totally dry before putting on my shirt and this doesn&#x27;t leave those awful white streaks on your clothes.  </li>
            <li> live in TX where the heat is brutal in the summer.</li>
            <li> I was sick &amp; tired of seeing white streaks leftover on my clothes from my existing deodorant.  </li>
            <li> so I bought a different brand gel deodorant and was extremely disappointed with the scent of it.  </li>
            <li> But the odor and wetness protection is weak.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have kidney disease, but I have diabetes, which is very hard on your kidneys…..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an invisible solid for the past couple of years but always hated the buildup it created on my armpits.</li>
            <li> I have never liked Secret before because I found the scent a little unpleasant</li>
            <li> so was not happy with the scent which is why I deducted a star.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast stood up to the 48 hour test and passed with flying colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With secret no matter it can be from working out or just relaxing around the house I will always feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li> have been using Secret Outlast for over a month now,&lt;br /&gt;when</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so irritating to have the spots that show where you put on deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast is my #momhack.</li>
            <li> but after I received a sample of this, courtesy of Secret, my mind has been changed.</li>
            <li> I have been using secret forever</li>
            <li> This products was received at no cost from Secret, for testing &amp; review purposes.</li>
            <li> Those folks at Secret may be on to something.....  </li>
            <li> As any of the others Secret deodorants that I had try I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that nasty buildup under my arms from applying too much.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than a scent that overpowers your perfume, who needs that?!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I like the smells secret</li>
            <li> I have used Secret Gel Deodorant for years</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than putting on deodorant, getting dressed and then feeling the coldness of moisture on your shirt or dress.</li>
            <li> got this for review from secret</li>
            <li> I received my secret outlast from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I got to try Secret Outlast Gel through a Sample Promotion Site #GotItFree, When I got picked for the Campaign</li>
            <li> If you ever thought you didn&#x27;t care for secret deodorant, it&#x27;s time to give them another chance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frustrating and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> that all changed when i received this product to try compliments of Secret and bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant has seriously been a lifesaver!  </li>
            <li> Makes your B.O. smell like slightly less bad B.O.</li>
            <li> I received this in a trial from BzzAgent, and I was rather skeptical about using Secret again.</li>
            <li> Secret is my never changing secret!</li>
            <li> I hated the last one I tried.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll hardly even know its there!!</li>
            <li> Always hated gels as they always made me feel slimy and wet</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical of the claims.</li>
            <li> I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with those nasty white deodorant lines that I had grown accustomed to when using the bar</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am always on the move.</li>
            <li> Thank you Secret!</li>
            <li> But still disappointed it was broken.    </li>
            <li> And I hated getting those nasty white marks on my clothes, well no more!!!</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m putting cold slime under my arms.  </li>
            <li> Day one I put on the gel and yes its cold to touch</li>
            <li> and that would just be crazy.</li>
            <li> I was using another product and was highly unhappy with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried gel deodorants in the past and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to admit I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you havent given secret a try- try them!!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m disappointed to say it did not meet any of them.</li>
            <li> cause I still sweated :(</li>
            <li> (I hate baby powder or flowery smells).  </li>
            <li> and I generally hate wearing deodorant.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s saying something because I hate almost all gels because of the stickiness</li>
            <li> I have used dozens of brands of deodorant and I have hated them all compared to this product.</li>
            <li> It feels nasty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Prior to trying this product, I had been boycotting secret deodorant for about 5 years or more. I had love the Platinum Protection line they came out with in the early 2000&#x27;s and then it seemed they thinned that line out in favor of less effective varieties. So, I found myself using various products, mostly Avon antiperspirant/deodorant which is cheap and mostly effective. I received this in a trial from BzzAgent, and I was rather skeptical about using Secret again. However, this product blew me away. Upon application, it does feel a bit gross like your typical roll-on or gels should be expected to. It does dry quickly. It has a pleasant but somewhat overpowering scent to it, I deducted one star because I feel it may interfere or clash with one&#x27;s perfume or cologne. The major take-away point is the effectiveness of this, I feel that one could wear this for 24 hours (without showering of course) and not have to worry about sweat or odor. I sweat quite a bit, even without physical exertion and this kept me dry even in the most stressful of situations. It should also be noted that this product does not leave a stain or film on your clothes, it&#x27;s is truly clear.</li>
            <li> Love it!  No staining and no burning.  Would buy this again in a heartbeat.  Received it as part of a promotion but had purchased in the past and will continue to do so in the future!</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the gel deodorants I used it before and every time I felt wet.  Well it didn&#x27;t dry fast and too much gel coming out .But after cleaning entire house I am still odor and sweat free!I recommending to try this deodorant!Because at the end you are 48-hour odor protection with no white marks. I got secret outlast completely clean for free from Secret as a part of the promotion.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this through Bzzagent to try. I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a gel deodorant but I really like Secret Outlast gel.  I am really picky about the scent of my deodorant and this one actually smells good and doesn&#x27;t bother me (I hate baby powder or flowery smells).  It dries quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky or goupy.  It keeps me dry even when I am outside and active and I really like it.  Also, it&#x27;s better on my shirts b/c it doesn&#x27;t leave that gross residue that my solid deodorant does.  I wish I had tried it earlier.  Overall, I really like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> As a Bzzagent, I received this deodorant as a sample in my latest Buzzkit.  I have never been one to like gel deodorant, but thought the sound of no white residue sounded too good to be true, so I should try it.  To my surprise, it went on easily with no whiteness at all.  It took a bit longer to dry than a solid which I&#x27;m not sure I care for, but is something people who already use a gel wouldn&#x27;t be bothered by.  The Completely Clean scent I was sent in my kit to try had a very strong smell that reminded me of my mother&#x27;s antiperspirant when I was growing up, so was not happy with the scent which is why I deducted a star.  I would like to try the other scents to see if they suit me better.  The deodorant lasted all day with no need to reapply, but as I am active at work, I did not put the 48 hours to test, I needed to shower before that.  It did however, preform for an entire day with no need to reapply!  It most certainly left no white residue on any of my clothing which was absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t like gel deoderants, but i was willing to check out anything that promises to keep up with louisiana heat and humidity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the gel goes on wet, and does take a few minutes to &#x27;dry&#x27;, but not as long as other gels i have tried before. i was surprised at how well the deoderant worked in keeping me dry under my arms. all day. no for those of you with larger chests, i would not recommend putting it under the bra line, as it didn&#x27;t dry well, and was a bit &#x27;icky&#x27; at the end of the day. you also cant use it for blister control on your heels, as it stays too wet- those are the only 2 reasons i give it 4 not 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise i was pretty pleased with how well it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li> When I first received my sample of Secret Outlast from Bzzagent, I had not used antiperspirant in months. The fragrance of the Completely Clean was much too strong, but I definitely wanted to test the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As luck would have it, our air conditioner quit working (90 degrees in the house), and I figured it was the perfect test for it. After the first day, I was still unbelievably completely dry!!!  Since Outlast claims 48 hour protection, I skipped the shower and tested it through day two. The fragrance faded, but the antiperspirant kept working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested it through a few rounds of 93 degree weather disc golf in the hot Texas sun, yard work, and countless other strenuous tasks, and this product does everything it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing the unscented for days when I need extra protection!</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the Secret Outlast clear gel because it was wet when I put it on. I also wondered if the protection would be enough. The gel did dry, but not all that fast. I accidentally got some on the outside of my shirt one day and it dried within 5 minutes and didn&#x27;t leave any white residue like some deodorants do. I have tested the clear gel&#x27;s protection while doing a hour long Zumba class. I left the class with the smell of the clear gel instead of body odor! I was a sweaty mess everywhere else! The scent isn&#x27;t over powering, it&#x27;s a clean, lightly perfumed smell.  I really like this product! I&#x27;m impressed and I will make sure I tell my fitness friends about it! I got this product free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean for free to test it out, as part of a promotion from Secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had wonderful experiences with clear gel deodorants in the past, so I was a little apprehensive to try Secret Outlast.  My apprehension was quickly soothed, as I noticed that while it did go on wet....it dried very quickly.  No sticky feeling at all.  Whew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast really does go on completely clear.  There is no white mess whatsoever.  You can feel confident knowing that once it&#x27;s on and dried (in seconds), you won&#x27;t have any white mess on your clothing.  The Completely Clean scent is slightly strong at first, but as soon as it dries it just has a faint clean smell.  No chemical smell, no perfume smell, just clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanting to give the &#x27;48 Hour Protection&#x27; an honest try, I really worked up a sweat.  I worked around the house, I painted outside in the hot sun, I participated in physical activity and I also played a hot game of Bocce at a local lake.  I thought for sure I was going to have that dreaded odor we all get when being overly active...but I did not.  I did sweat, but there was no wetness in my armpits at all.  Secret Outlast stood up to the 48 hour test and passed with flying colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a dedicated user of stick deodorant in the past, but since trying Secret Outlast Completely Clean, I will be making the switch.  I want to keep this product in my life so that I can enjoy life a little better knowing that I am protected.  Quick note, you really only need one to two clicks of Secret Outlast.  Any more really isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been unsure about trying Secret Outlast Clear Gel (Completely Clean), fear no more!  Give it a try and see for yourself that this deodorant can back up its claims!  5 Stars from this Arizona girl!</li>
            <li> When I got this deodorant from BzzAgent, I expected to try it once and then trash it. It smells fine - the fragrance isn&#x27;t overwhelming and quickly goes away, but I just didn&#x27;t think it would be strong enough for me. Lo and behold, it works like a champ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an acrobat and this baby kept my armpits dry and stink-free through a 3 hour performance, which is absolutely incredible. I usually wear men&#x27;s deodorant and have to reapply it through the night. Better yet, it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my costumes and under my arms! I&#x27;m never going back!</li>
            <li> I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel and really liked it.  I got it for free through a promotion of the brand.  It definitely worked well - no white marks on my clothes, odor protection for 48 hours (don&#x27;t ask me how I know it lasted this long), and no sweating.  The scent was nice, and well, clean.  I usually use a solid, so the stickiness of the gel took a little getting used to.  It felt sticky even after it dried.</li>
            <li> I usually steer clear of clear deodorant ;)&lt;br /&gt;I have used other brands in the past and they have left my sensitive skin feeling itchy and rashy. No thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Bzzagent gave me some Secret Completely Clean Clear Gel to try out and review, and I&#x27;m honestly impressed. I did not feel itchy or rashy at all. It does not leave any white marks or residue on my clothes. I felt clean and dry all day (yes, even compared to the holy grail of all deodorants, Secret Clinical Strength) and it dried quicker than other clear deodorants I have used in the past (you get used to that initial sticky, wet feeling because it goes away so quickly.) Secret has made a really nice product.</li>
            <li> Well, the verdict is in and I am in love with the protection and confidence this gel gives me...which is weird because although I have used gel before I have to admit I have never really been a fan. The gel can be sticky and this isnt, it doesnt feel like your rubbing the &amp;#34;blob&amp;#34; under your arms and the BEST part is the smell...it is so nice, not so much people really notice a different smell on you yet I have had compliments which is all chemistry, but I cant imagine anyone not liking this scent. It is delicate, feminine and actually gives you a very fresh feeling. This is one you have to try to believe and honestly I am tempted to try more of this collection as I still have 1 coupon left, Secret was generous with the coupons and EVERYONE I gave a coupon to thanks to the average deo price point bought it to try because it was an entire $1 off which made it a no brainer to give it a whirl...I did tell them it was a gel and not a solid and was very surprised that people weren&#x27;t deterred, I guess I am one of the few stuck in the &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; ages...lol! I am so thankful that BzzAgent gave me the chance to try this for free because I would have never known that you &amp;#34;grandmother&#x27;s&amp;#34; deo is no longer that, it has completely passed test after test and I am totally enjoying spreading the word and product! I am a customer for life now and so are many others, and I am not done! I think this was a good move for Secret because I can honestly say that me and my panel of Outlast users hadn&#x27;t used ANY Secret deo products for years, maybe because of lack of brand knowledge, freshness of name or in your face marketing but we all agreed it had been a long time since we had this in our bathrooms! Thanks to Secret and BzzAgent that has all changed and I did by another for the gym bag so I could quickly plug this stuff as it is a great product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I got this secret outlast sample for the brand,i have already tried another brands but that products  are not satisfied my expectations.Secret outlast has clear gel ,smooth and pleasant smell especially 48 hours odor production.I recommend to this everyone.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try a clear gel deodorant as I have not had the best experiences with them in the past. As a BzzAgent, I received a Bzzkit with a free sample of the Secret Outlast completely clean clear gel. I decided I would give it a try because I know that secret is a good brand. Well after using it for almost a week I can honestly say that I am very happy with this clear gel deodorant!  I put it to the test over the weekend by putting it on Saturday morning and not reapplying until Sunday night. I was extremely surprised that the odor protection held up to its name. My armpits were still pretty fresh! If I had any complaint at all it would be allowing my armpits to dry after reapplying but it really takes no time at all. I was using degree solid before this and after this trial run I am heavily considering switching!! With secret outlast clear gel I have no white marks at all on any of my shirts :)</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast is great. It dries quickly and leaves no marks on clothes. I usually have to reapply deodorant but don&#x27;t have to with this one. If you want a deodorant that will last all day long make the switch!!</li>
            <li> I could ramble on and on about how well Secret Outlast Gel works, how it goes on wet, but dries quickly, is clear so leaves no white  marks on your clothing, but I won&#x27;t. All I can say is this is a fantastic product and works way better than advertised!!!!! I plan on using it for years to come and suggest anyone looking for and effective antiperspirant/deodorant switch to Secret Outlast Ge;!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with his deodorant, it goes uneasy and dries fast. It has never left a white mark on my shirt, which is so important to me because I wear tank tops daily! I was fortunate enough to be given this deodorant to try out, and I can say I am very pleased! It smells nice, and a little gel goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use clear gel deodorants as I prefer solids, however, this Outlast Clear Gel from Secret just may get me to make the switch!  It has a very pleasant but not overpowering scent, and I never felt like my underarms were consistently wet or sticky, which is normally the case when I use clear gels.  Two clicks provides the perfect amount for each underarm, and it lasted through the entire day.  There was also no irritation to my skin, even when applying right after shaving.  Another bonus: no white marks on clothing!  This deodorant is definitely worth checking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com, but all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d this product to try from One2One network,  I was not sure what to think of a gel vs solid, but I think overall I like a solid.  It felt cool and sticky for about 10 min of putting it on.  Not sure I like that feeling.  It was easy to twist and go on.  Odor protection was great and I did feel fresh all day.  I don&#x27;t think you get as many uses in the container as you would with a solid.  Sometimes when I twisted it, it seemed like to much came out.  Where as a solid 1 or 2 swipes and your done.  One good thing is no stains on your clothing as you do with a solid.  I would recommend it and would purchase.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of gel deodorants, but Secret&#x27;s new Outlast Clear Gel seems to be decent so far. It goes on smoothly, and smells nice. The smell kind of reminds me of hairspray though. I like that this deodorant will not leave white marks on your clothing but I feel as though gel deodorant doesn&#x27;t last as long as the powder white kind, so I still prefer my original over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Completely Clean Secret Clear Gel to review through clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network. All opinions my own.</li>
            <li> I noticed that when I wore the deodorant with fabrics other than cotton, I wouldn&#x27;t have as much odor protection by the end of the day - particularly those fabrics that contain polyester. It does better for me on cooler days than warm days when I am profusely sweating. I do like the no streak or white marks on my clothes though! No more embarrassing mishaps at work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of one2one network, I received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from the clearly better challenge.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no secrets with secret deodorant other than a little goes a long way. Secret is the intimate of deodorants for women.  They know we don&#x27;t like lines or streaks yet we want a strong antiperspirant to keep us fresh.  With secret no matter it can be from working out or just relaxing around the house I will always feel refreshed.  it offer protection and being protected enhances our confidence when speaking or if we get to nervous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What i love about secret as i will always say, once it goes on it stays on. I don&#x27;t have to reapply and if I leave the gym I still feel refreshed as if I applied this morning.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this product - it is my new favorite deodorant!  Secret has always been my go to brand, but Outlast really goes above and beyond with protection.  I am assured that I will be clear, fresh, dry and smelling good no matter how busy, long or crazy my day my be!</li>
            <li> I am BzzAgent and received this product to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was very skeptical, I have tried gel deodorants before and did not like the way it felt (cold and gooey). I have always used invisible solids. However, when I tried this product I was amazed by how quickly it dried. The fresh scent is not over powering and It didn&#x27;t stain clothes. I will be purchasing this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant that I tried courtesy of BzzAgent. It goes on clear and does feel very wet; However, it dries so fast. You don&#x27;t have the annoying white marks or residue left behind. The scent is very clean and fresh. This deodorant really does offer all day protection and freshness. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> so awesome. last time i used a gel i was a teenager... so when i received this for free as part of a test group, i wasn&#x27;t too excited. After just a couple days... i was converted! LOVE this stuff! Lasts so much longer than my previous antipers/deodorants. Never switching back :)</li>
            <li> Horrible, it was broken (the top part goes out) and looked used as it was much less product left. I&#x27;ll never buy a antiperspirant online again.</li>
            <li> I received my free trail of Secret Outlast completely clean and clear gel deodorant as a BzzAgent. Unfortunately I have to admit I was disappointed. I truly value the Secret Brand because they do have great products. However, after using this particular product on several occasions I have come to the conclusion that it does have a favorable scent and does not leave white marks. Still though It isn&#x27;t for me because it didn&#x27;t fight my wetness or odor issues well enough let alone for more than 7 hours unlike the 48 hours it stated it would.</li>
            <li> Overall this product does what it says and keeps any marks off of your clothes which I love. It also dries fast and feels clean and fresh after applying, the only thing I do not like is that it did not completely keep me dry every time I used it. I do like this deodorant though and will consider purchasing it!</li>
            <li> Dry, Smelling great and no whites spots makes this girl happy,&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Secret Outlast for over a month now,&lt;br /&gt;when I received free from Bzzagent campaign!  I have been a gel user for a long time so I dont mind that cold of googy feeling going on.&lt;br /&gt;But secret really last the full day,&lt;br /&gt;and in am, when I am running around gettting my kids ready and myself dressed thankfully no marks on my clothes bc sometime I put it on before I dress and sometimes after!!&lt;br /&gt;Smell is great and natural, not overpowering, and best is that it last all day!! I am not worried about odor coming from this pits when I am using it!!! happy I got to try it out with Bzzagent and now when its empty I will be buysing more Secret Outlast to replace this one!</li>
            <li> I received a full size deodorant as a Bzzz Agent, along with coupons to distribute. As a user of clinical strength deodorant, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work for me.  IT DOES! Even after my Zumba class, my underarms are completely dry. I was pleasantly surprised that it was strong enough without being clinical strength.  It does go on wet, but clear, and dries very quickly, and does not leave white marks. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a thick stick deodorant type, but I was asked to try the new SEcret Outlast Completely Clear Gel.  It really works well.  When I got stuck after a snowstorm without a shower for 48 hrs, not my idea of fun, but at least the Secret outlasted my impatience....  Thankfully, I don&#x27;t have to try that too often, but it is good to know that it is very long lasting as advertised.  I&#x27;m glad too that the gel is colorless and doesn&#x27;t stain my black shirts.  It&#x27;s so irritating to have the spots that show where you put on deodorant.  The one negative I found was that the gel doesn&#x27;t last as long, but it could be that I am putting on too much product.  I&#x27;m not  used to using gels.</li>
            <li> it truly is clear. I can workout- and it works great. no streaks or white clumps- i recommend it really</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast and I&#x27;m in love. Secret Outlast helps me get threw all my of my daily routines and errands. From appointments, to a day at the beach, to just relaxing at home with my kids. It keeps me dry and does work for 48 hours. What I love the most, is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks or residue on my dark clothes. Secret Outlast is my #momhack.</li>
            <li> I got to review this product as part of a promotion for the Secret Outlast Clear Gel because I am a Bzzagent. I&#x27;ll start with the pros of this product first.  With my pervious brand of deodorant, I would have to twist and do little dance moves to avoid getting any white marks on the bottom of my dark shirts.  With Secret Outlast Clear Gel, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about that and my black shirt didn&#x27;t have any white streaks!  I also like how it was invisible and not messy.  With my other brand, I sometimes would have little white chunks of deodorant on my armpits after I was finished.  The cons of this product are that the smell was just not working for me. It is called completely clean so I was hoping for a nice and refreshing scent, but instead it was kinda sour smelling like when you leave your clothes in the washer and forget about them for a few hours on accident.  Another thing that worrys me is how the gel doesn&#x27;t come out evenly when you push it out. (see picture I posted to see what I&#x27;m talking about) I hope my review helps you out. Thanks again to Secret and Bzzagent for this opportunity.</li>
            <li> Ok I will start by saying that it does keep me dry and there is no body odor. However, the scent of the deodorant itself is so strong that it gave me an instant headache. I am used to the powder fresh scent, so this one, I am not even sure what scent it is... is way too much for me. If you don&#x27;t mind really strong almost floral scents, then this will be perfect for you. The other thing I don&#x27;t care for is the actual &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; part of it. It feels slimy and gross going on. I prefer the solid stick. This is just my opinion though and I still love the Secret brand. I just think I will stick to my usual powder fresh solid.</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from Secret through Bzzagent.com&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for a week, and I really liked it.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands in the past that have advertised the same clear no marks application and after much searching I couldn&#x27;t find a deodorant that really lived up to it&#x27;s hype. This does! It ACTUALLY went on clear and didn&#x27;t stain my clothes. All I wear is black and grey so I needed something to go on without an embarrassing white streak. It kept me dry without being so dry that I was itchy, and I really loved the scent. This is absolutely something I would recommend to friends or anyone else. It&#x27;s a clean, clear, confident dry. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am a member of BzzAgent and  received a trial size Secret Outlast Deodorant free to try.  I have tried multiple brands over the years but typically choose a solid even if it means white marks because gels I have tried tend to feel wet and sticky.  I had been using the Secret Outlast gel and am completely in love with it--no wet feeling, no sticky feeling, just clean.  I have been wearing the Secret Outlast gel for 4 days straight now, and yesterday spent the majority of the day outside in 90 degree southern heat.  While I didn&#x27;t sweat, I could tell I was starting to stink a little bit and was a little disappointed, until I went inside and when I had cooled off, took a quick whiff and didn&#x27;t smell anything but the clean smell of deodorant!! I love the clean smell of the deodorant, the ease of application and the clear tube so I can always know when I am running low.  I would recommend Secret Outlast to anyone looking for a deodorant free from white marks, stickiness, wetness and looking to be fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product at first simply because of the Secret brand name and me not having very much luck with their products in the past but after I received a sample of this, courtesy of Secret, my mind has been changed. I absolutely love that it dries so quickly after it is applied and no matter what you&#x27;re wearing you never have to worry about white marks on your clothes. Tank tops, blouses, t-shirts, dresses etc etc are all now safe from those hideous and very distinguishable stripes. The smell isn&#x27;t super powerful either so don&#x27;t worry about it overpowering your favorite body splash or perfume. Something else that really surprised me is how well it kept me dry even in super stressful situations including, but not limited to; working out, work meetings and presentations, meeting new people, babysitting etc etc. After finding this product I have no reason to look elsewhere. It does everything that I could ask for and more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to find a deodorant that does the trick but I might have found it after testing out Secret Outlast free as a promotional courtesy of Secret. My opinions are all my own. This actually keeps me from getting smelly all day, even with the heat and humidity. It smells good too and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product free from bzzagent.  I don&#x27;t normally use Secret or gel deodorant. I liked the scent, I thought it held up well under harsh conditions of running outside in 90 degree weather. I did feel like I wanted to reapply right after my run, that is not normally something I do with my normal deodorant. It goes on smoothly and dries quickly. I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to wait for it to dry. I do feel like you would go through this quickly, just because the Gel comes out so much with one click. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it as my normal deodorant but I would buy it again for special occasions where I want to make sure I don&#x27;t have any chance of White Marks.</li>
            <li> I received a sample size of this from bzzagent.com and Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant to test and review (complimentary).&lt;br /&gt;I already am a fan of Secret deodorant, so of course I was excited to test Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant. They advertise up to 48 &#x27;epic&#x27; hours of wetness protection, odor protection, and no white marks on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the scent that I received. The clean scent was nice, I didn&#x27;t want anything was that was fruity or too potent. My sample package was a little on the empty side, which of course was disappointing, but I still had plenty to test.&lt;br /&gt;I used mine on really hot days (95+) while hiking and geocaching. I loved that every time I really started to sweat, I could smell the deodorant, that to me mean that it was working, possibly working overtime. I loved that I could wear black and blue shirts, and I did not have any marks showing that I had put on my deodorant first. The one thing that I didn&#x27;t like, was that the armpit areas of my shirts were not dry. This was very unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this deodorant and recommend it because I believe in the Secret brand, and was impressed with how well Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant worked.&lt;br /&gt;(even though I received the product complimentary, the opinions are 100% mine)</li>
            <li> Considering you use deodorant every day you better love it, and well I love mine.  The most common complaint I hear about gels is that they&#x27;re too wet.  Well I say, wait a second for it to dry and your shirts will thank you.  I switched back temporarily to a &amp;#34;dark clothing approved&amp;#34; deodorant and it destroyed my dark clothes.  I ran right out and bought this to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent on this one isn&#x27;t overpowering, and the smaller sizes have been great to travel with (and yes these can go on the plane with you in the little baggie).</li>
            <li> LOVE this deodorant! It goes on smooth, keeps my underarms hydrated, smells so fresh (you&#x27;d wanna slap it! Lol) It keeps you smelling great and DRY without any staining. Would recommend! I have been using secret forever and you can see my previous almost empty bottle! Secret is my never changing secret! Only one thing, but it&#x27;s a gel problem, it&#x27;s sooooo cold early in the morning when I put it on that I do a little wiggle but feel great nonetheless within seconds  Disclaimer: This products was received at no cost from Secret, for testing &amp; review purposes. The opinion expressed is solely my own.</li>
            <li> I am able to try this product for free from BzzAgent, and so far I have been using it daily. I love the completely clean scent and how fresh it smells. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the floral scents and this is perfect for me.  I love that it&#x27;s clear and goes on smoothly without having to worry about having white marks on my clothes or under my arms.  After chasing a 2 &amp; 6yr old around I haven&#x27;t had to worry about sweating and re-apply deodorant because I was worried how I smelled.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is based off the price. WIth having 2 kids in daycare I tend to lean towards the cheaper products.  I do a lot of couponing so if I come across a coupon for this deodorant or it&#x27;s on sale I will be purchasing 1 or 2 sticks of.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free, to review from Secret &amp; BzzAgent. First off I really enjoyed the scent, very clean smelling. It worked great for me, and that&#x27;s a lot to say because its been a hot Summer here. I worked out using it, worked in the yard, and went to a couple fairs. I definitely will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Not to big on it, I really like the solid invisible sticks. The gel feels alittle sticky and takes time to feel dry, smell is okay, I&#x27;m not a big sweater so I couldn&#x27;t tell you how well it does in that department but as far as the protection it&#x27;s there because I do play soft ball and still smell fresh afterword&#x27;s, no marks on your clothes and also doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply. It does come out uneven so I end up having to make more than one trip to the underarm to apply. I got to try this as a promo from secret :) wouldn&#x27;t buy the gel again but might give the solids a run because I do like the smell.</li>
            <li> I was able to sample and review the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deoderant because I am a BzzAgent. I put this deoderant to the true test of fate on a hot and humid day while visiting the zoo. I loved that it went on clear and dried within seconds, leaving me safe to put my arms down and not ruin my shirt! After about 6 hours a the zoo, I noticed that the 48 hour odor protection wasn&#x27;t quite holding up anymore. Had it not been for that little flaw, I would give this product 5 stars. However, odor protection is pretty important to me!</li>
            <li> I used to use solid stick but I tried a free sample of 48 hour clear gel and it turned out to be the perfect deodorant. I usually use various solid white brands, primarily because they have never created a problem other than white marks and they had a wide scent variety. However, secret has multiple scents and even the regular clear gel 48 hour smells nice on its own. One twist and the perfect amount of gel comes out. It goes on smooth, clean, and is refreshing. It doesn&#x27;t leave a thick residue under your arms and I have black top tested it, no marks! I walked a mile in the sun and heat and no white marks and after doing a sniff test, still smelled nice. It lasted for the rest of my stinky workout day and the long morning after through some Yoga. It does outlast your busy schedule and provides the odor protection and white mark protection it says it does. Confident you&#x27;ll like this brand and be sweat free!</li>
            <li> This is the first deodorant that I have tried in gel form. It absorbs fast, does not leave any marks and protects the user from sweat. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and is long lasting, which is great when you don&#x27;t have any time for a shower.&lt;br /&gt;Trying this product for free thanks to Secret &amp; BzzAgent for the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I got a free sample of this deodorant from BzzAgent, an online product review website. I have avoided gel deodorants because you have to wait for them to dry before putting on your shirt. I liked how the Secret Outlast deodorant, which I got as a free sample, from BzzAgent, dried quickly, so didn&#x27;t have to wait before finishing getting dressed. The deodorant went on smoothly and did not leave any marks on my clothing. And then - dry and comfortable all day! I&#x27;m impressed. It washes off easily in the shower but does not come off during the day, and I live in a hot, humid climate.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing this product as part of a promotion via Bzzagent. I love the scent of this deodorant It is fresh but not overpowering. I had one concern before trying it and it was the fact that it is a gel. I have always used a solid and never had a reason to use anything else. The solids always worked great for me. Yes they left a white residue but I am a creature of habit. :). I do like this deodorant, the only issue I have is the wet feeling when I put it on. When I put it on I feel like I need to keep my arms raised in the air to let it dry, I just do not like that wet feeling. It does not leave any white residue/marks which I like and I think I will give it a few more tries before I make up my mind to go from a solid to gel.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel for free from Secret for review on BzzAgent.  I usually use either Degree or Suave.  I often sweat a lot under my armpits, especially when wearing anything with sleeves.  I am constantly fighting pit stain on shirts.  Usually I apply deodorant in the morning and touch it up around 5 or 6.  Today is my third day using Secret Outlast.  Each day offered a slightly different test of it&#x27;s ability to live up to it&#x27;s name.  Day 1 The first day I used this was a really long day.  I applied it around 7 a.m. after a post-workout shower.  My agenda for the day was an 8-hour conference, a trip to the mall, and a business dinner.  The weather was over 90 degrees and slightly humid.  Halfway through dinner I realized that I hadn&#x27;t felt sweaty in my armpits all day -- and it was roughly 13 hours after I applied it.  I still smelled fresh too -- not just &amp;#34;not smelly,&amp;#34; but actually fresh.  Those folks at Secret may be on to something.....  Day 2 The second day of the trial was a regular workday, which for me means an application around 7:15 to (hopefully) last all day.  The weather was again over 90 degrees, and my building has one of the hottest elevators on earth.  I wore a white dress, which would have totally shown pit stains had there been any.  Again, no sweat, no stains, all day, and still smelling fresh in the evening.  Day 3 Day 3 was another workday, but because I was running late I got to add in the element of running down the street outside in the summer.  I was winded, but the sweat was minimal.  And you know how sometimes when you get hot you start to smell the scent of your deodorant more strongly?  Nope!!  Honestly, this doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent at all; I only smell it when I&#x27;m actually trying to smell my armpit.  I&#x27;m really impressed by this.  This would be a perfect product for a camping trip.  I rarely give anything 5 stars, but this product does what it says it will -- at least for the first 24hours.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this since I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and I was pleasantly surprised at how well this deodorant works.  I live in southern Alabama and generally our weather is over 100*.  Normally I have to apply deodorant two to three times a day.  I&#x27;ve tried several different types of deodorant and haven&#x27;t been that happy with any of them.  Using gel deodorant was a new thing to me and I found that I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much as I do with powdered deodorant.  Give it about 20 seconds or so and it&#x27;s completely dry.  So usually while I&#x27;m allowing to dry, I&#x27;m brushing my teeth or pulling out what clothes I plan to wear.  I haven&#x27;t had any deodorant stains while using this, which has been AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the excessive heat, it doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours for me.  But I only have to apply it in the morning and it lasts all day, which is GREAT.  So probably in less humid and crazy hot places, it would last 48 hours.  If you&#x27;re not happy with your current deodorant, give this one a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a deodorant to help manage perspiration, odor, &amp; wetness. In the past, I have not had sucess with any of the other deodorants that I have tried in the past until I tried Secret Outlast! I absolutely love the smell of this deodorant! It has a very strong scent &amp; is very clean smelling!</li>
            <li> Hi everyone new I receieve this product for free through a company for testing and it was amazing. It leaves no stains on your shirt and it smells good.</li>
            <li> This will be my new go-to deodorant especially in the summer months! This stuff worked so well that one day I did forget to put on deodorant but I was still protected it seemed from the day before so yay to those mom days when your running low on memory and time. and yay to those days that it is so hot outside and now you don&#x27;t have to worry and keep putting spray or deodorant on cause this stuff here will make sure your protected ! I totally suggest to all you moms out there on the go to pick this up next time your on your deodorant run and trust me not only will you save time but money also cause you won&#x27;t have to buy deodorant for awhile ! (Well since you won&#x27;t have to use it a billion times thru out your days of on the go!)Oh btw i did receive this specific deodorant thru bzzagent.com to try which is my favorite for all you stay at home moms you should sigh up with them also!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from Secret. I had been using Mitchum Clear Gel for a while and was pretty happy with it but this definitely changed my mind. With Mitchum the gel stayed pretty wet and sticky under my arm and despite going on clear, it would leave white streaks on my clothes. Secret Outlast went on smooth and dried almost instantly. It left no marks on any of my clothes and it kept me fresh on a weekend camping trip where my options to &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; were limited. I have thrown out my old deodorant and I will be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product from BzzAgent and am so glad I tried it! I am a bit fussy about deodorants and so far I love this one! The Completely Fresh scent is great. It is not too strong but is pleasant and lasts all day (and night). The Clear Gel formula really does dry clear and does not leave residue on clothes or a wet mark. The actual anti-perspirant properties are great and really do keep sweat at bay through a range of activities even on hot days. I will be switching to this one from now on and will also try the other scents in this line.</li>
            <li> i got my free secret outlast thanks to secret and bzzagent and I just wanna say I loved my secret outlast clear deodorant. It lasts long, that even after I shower the scent is still present. Also the gel isn&#x27;t too watery, it dries instantly and clear! Always loved secret brand, but this is one of their best deodorant!!</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a buzz agent trail by the manufacturer.  I wanted to take and test the product as much as I could before I talked with anyone about it so, I took it with me on my camping trip.  I used only this for 5 days and went hiking, running and all the other kinds of activities at the camp grounds.  Oh yeah, it was like almost 90 degrees or better the whole time.  After this trip I was converted.  I love how it goes on clear and drys and I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my shirt as I go about my day.  I kept me nice and clean and fresh all week long.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is surprisingly effective!  I am usually not a fan of gel deodorants- as putting wet deodorant on my wet, sweaty armpit seems rather redundant. I actually got to try this free, thanks to Secret and Bzzagent. However, once the clear gel dried, the smell became more subtle and my armpits magically dried up! Compared to the 4-5 reapplications of some deodorants I have used, I really needed it once. But I put it on again because I&#x27;m hooked on the smell. I was also pretty impressed that the gel deodorant worked as well as my normal white stick that leaves marks everywhere. As for the packaging- it&#x27;s pretty run-of-the-mill, but if you&#x27;re about function over aesthetics, then it shouldn&#x27;t bother you too much. The only downsides to the deodorant are that its gross to apply wet deodorant to wet armpits (I recommend drying the application area first), and if you&#x27;ve recently shaved like I am, it may sting for a minute until it dries. But all in all, this is a deodorant I&#x27;d recommend for anyone who is on-the-go and needs reliable protection.</li>
            <li> I recieved a sample of this product free courtesy of Secret/BuzzAgent. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work for me because I have never been one to like gel deodrant but to my suprize I absolutely love Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel. I&#x27;ve been searching for a deodorant to help manage perspiration, odor, &amp; wetness. I haven&#x27;t had any luck with any of the other deodorants that i&#x27;ve tried until I tried Secret Outlast! I absolutely love the smell of this deodorant! It has a very strong scent &amp; is very clean smelling. It does go on wet, clear, &amp; drys very quickly (within minutes). It leaves no white marks &amp; doesn&#x27;t ball up. It does last all day with no need to reapply! I had no issues with perspiration, odor, or wetness under my arm pits! I highly recommend this product &amp; will definitely be switching to Secret Outlast! Bye- bye invisible solid! Hello clear gel! Thanks Secret!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel is the best it dries quickly after application and does not feel sticky afterwards. It also keeps me fresh and dry throughout the day and no awful residue on my clothes. I just love it! I&#x27;m hooked and have definitely changed brands.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product for free courtesy of Secret. I have bought the product since my sample has run out and will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean deodorant for free for review courtesy of BzzAgent. I had such high hopes for this and I&#x27;m disappointed to say it did not meet any of them. I purposely wore it with a black tanktop to test it and not only did it take over two minutes to dry but it left white marks. This is not a deodorant for a person with an on the go lifestyle.</li>
            <li> This is what I usually use but in travel size.  It&#x27;s packed and ready to go in my hospital bag!  Slightly larger than your average travel size so would be good to throw in your purse for emergencies as well.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has seriously been a lifesaver!  I have a 9 year old that unfortunately has developed at a very early age and getting her to use deodorant is like pulling teeth. She has very strong body odor and it is VERY noticeable if she skips using deodorant and when I approach the issue with her she tends to just get embarrassed and flustered and then I feel bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample of this to try for free and I love it!  It can keep her odor free for over 48 hours, which means less time trying to get her to put deodorant on and I don&#x27;t have to worry about her smelling of body odor.  Not only that, but I love it too.  I don&#x27;t always have the time to ensure my deodorant is totally dry before putting on my shirt and this doesn&#x27;t leave those awful white streaks on your clothes.  This is seriously my favorite new deodorant and I recommend it for teens and adults!</li>
            <li> I got to review this product as part of a promotion for the Secret Outlast Clear Gel because I am a Bzzagent. The Secret Outlast Clear Gel was great at doing exactly what it says: no marks, odor and sweat protection. The only downside is that the gel can be a bit messy (if you drop it, it&#x27;s coming out of those little holes at the top).</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant from BzzAgent to try out for free and I must say they have amazed me yet again. First, I hate white marks on my clothes; however, I am happy to say there isn&#x27;t an issue with white marks when you use Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant. Second, I live in Texas, the humidity is unbelievable, add into the baking in an oven type of temperature outside (it was 105 yesterday, felt like 110) and you need something that is really strong and that will last! I am happy to say this does its job! I am outside a lot during the summers and tend to drench myself in sweat by just walking out to the car (its that humid) not to mention while I am out hiking. Whether it&#x27;s a long day working or a long day hiking, I always still smell fresh at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Considering you use deodorant every day you better love it, and well I love mine.  It has a fresh and clean scent to it, not very overwhelming at all like some deodorants. There are a variety of scents available.  It does go on wet, but clear, and dries very quickly, and does not leave white marks.  The scent on this one isn&#x27;t overpowering, and the smaller sizes have been great to travel with.</li>
            <li> I received this product through bzz agent to sample and review.  I already use secrect solid deodorant but had not tried thr clear gel. It was very easy to come out and once applied it was not to wet and seemed to dry pretty fast. I have a 6 month old who spits up a lot so I change shirts often and before I would notice white marks a lot but with the clear gel I dont have to worry about that! The only thing I do not like is that o seem to go through the clear gel faster than the solid. All in all a great product with great protection.</li>
            <li> Received a sample of this product from bzzagent. I love it smelled great didnt feel sticky and lasted the whole day even tho it was hot and humid...my new go to deodora#epic4#...#momhack #odorshield #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Secret through BzzAgent and I&#x27;m really glad I did! Secret Outlast Clear Gel is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used in years! It truly does outlast my usual stick deodorant, goes on clear, and dries within seconds. One reviewer commented the smell wasn&#x27;t what they expected, but I think it smells clean and fresh and it works great with my body. Thank you Secret and BzzAgent for my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li> I was selected from Buzzagent to review this amazing product.I love this product because it goes on clear as promised on the package. And it kept me from sweating and it smelled great as well. I recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from the Secret company to try out. Firstly the smell is great! The gel goes on cold but smooth and dries quickly.Goes on clear and protects all day and night. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised by how well this held up to my very active lifestyle. I am always on the go and nothing can keep up with me, until now. An added bonus was that I was able to wear a light colored top without the deodorant itself leaving wet marks on my clothes. I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with other gels doing just that but not Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  It goes on clear and stays clear. No worries for white on my dark clothes. I love that it works great on odor and keeps me dry. This is definitely going to be my go to deodorant. I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of One2One Network</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.  I love this deodorant because it does indeed provide up to 48 hours of odor &amp; wetness protection. The scent is not too strong which is nice &amp; I love how it goes on clear without leaving any white marks.  I have super sensitive skin &amp; this deodorant didn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of a trial campaign and I have to say that I love not having to worry about deodorant marks on any of my clothes, and I feel fresh all day regardless of the temperature outside.  In Love</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve always seen this Clear Gel Deodorant on the shelves at the store but I never thought to try it before. But I received a free sample from BzzAgent to try and review and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever want to go back to the invisible solid again. The Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant is amazing and I am so glad I got to try it free first. With the type I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my bras or shirts, plus I don&#x27;t have little white clumps underneath my arm anymore. The smell is amazing; it lasts all day and I don&#x27;t have to keep checking to see if I stink; it is amazing! I cannot give it enough praises. I think this is a perfect deodorant to use with bathing suits strapless outfits or just anytime you want to feel fresh without worrying about white marks or clumps.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I just wish that there was more in the container. It works well, and the price is more than reasonable, I just seem to go thru a container rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I have use Secret solid and Secret Invisible Solid before, I personally preferred the invisible solid over the regular solid one. I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel from Bzzagent to try and give my honest opinion about it. As any of the others Secret deodorants that I had try I like the smell. This one in particular smell very fresh, to get any product out for the first time you have to spin the bottom a few times, any other time I recommend spinning just half way otherwise you will get too much product out and it will take a long time to dry on your armpits. Overall this is good deodorant, smell great and does its work. I still preferred the invisible solid over this one because of the gel part.</li>
            <li> I packed my Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel in my hospital bag because I was looking forward to smelling clean and fresh after having my baby. My sense of smell is so distorted during pregnancy. I am so happy to have had this product! What a lovely and clean refreshing smell. A perfect ending to my first postpartum shower! Long lasting scent, goes on smooth with no white marks and no follow up perfume needed! Simply divine! Thanks BzzAgent for another great product to review!</li>
            <li> Never using dry deodorant again, this product holds up to my crazy fast paced cabin lifestyle. Clean Fresh scent that never let&#x27;s you down. I have used dozens of brands of deodorant and I have hated them all compared to this product. It feels wet and slightly sticky for just a second then dries completely. I am very happy with this product and I generally hate wearing deodorant. Little hard to remove in the shower best to use a washcloth. Highly recommend. I recieved this product for free from Secret as part of a product test and used for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I got this Secret Outlast deodorant for free for trying it through bzzagent. I really like it. I shower at least once in a 24 hour period so I haven&#x27;t pushed it to the advertised 48 hour protection, but I can say it works really well for at least 24. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Makes your B.O. smell like slightly less bad B.O. If you manage to remember to wear it before the B.O. starts, it&#x27;s pretty effective at keeping you smell-free. Well....at least in the armpit area. I can&#x27;t vouch for other body parts because why would I put it on other body parts OMG STOP LOOKING AT ME I&#x27;M NOT A WEIRDO. You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li> I will not be buying this again. It&#x27;s ok and smells alright. Didn&#x27;t work as well  as other deodorants though.</li>
            <li> I was able to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel  through Secret for free!! &amp; I decided to take the opportunity. When my sample arrived I was very impressed with the look of the product and the pleasant fresh scent but I was put off by the fact that this product contains aluminum which for me is a big no no. However I still wanted to give this product a fair chance so I tried it for 3 days, but was unimpressed with the results so discontinued using it. Aluminum content aside, another concern was that the product was not providing wetness protection for 48hrs, therefore not true to it&#x27;s word. Where I live is very hot and humid and I like my deodorant  to keep me dry, for me Secret Outlast Clear Gel didn&#x27;t live up to this. The clear gel is very good and it didn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes and the nice fresh scent was great but the product fell short in more important areas for me and for those reasons I would not chose to use this product again.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the Outlast Secret as an BzzzAgent to try out and give my opinions.  I&#x27;ve been using Dove Original Deoderant since I can remember but wanted to see what else is out there.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the clear deodorant, since it can take a while for the wetness to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; before getting dressed.  However, it&#x27;s clear so there are no worries about making marks on clothes.  The biggest issue for me is the &#x27;clean&#x27; smell!  I would notice the scent throughout the day, whenever I would lift my arm and I was feeling selfconscious people close to me were also smelling it.  I do not want to notice any strong smell coming from my arms, pungent or otherwise.  I&#x27;m on to try the Secret Clinical next!</li>
            <li> I have used the Secret brand in the past, actually I&#x27;m using the Secret Outlast invisible solid, but since I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel sample from bzzagent I&#x27;m not changing my deodorant again. First, the smell even though is supposed to be the same in both deodorant in the Clear Gel one is sooo smelly like my daughter said, it really have a great smell. Other things that I like from this deodorant is that it last long time, I can&#x27;t say it last 48 hours cause I take more than one shower a day since I live in the tropic and is super hot, but I use it for hard work such as helping my husband in his workshop and playing with my 6 year old girl and I didn&#x27;t smell and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to put some more. Finally, the one thing that I hate from the solid one I don&#x27;t need to worry about it anymore cause this gel deodorant doesn&#x27;t leave any white mark. This is so perfect for dark and no-leaves clothes. Oh, another thing I love about this deodorant is that even is a gel it doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry. I haved used it and put on my clothes really quickly and it doesn&#x27;t stick to the clothes and I can say it dry pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Really love this deodorant, only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star was due to the fact it does burn when I put it on right after a fresh shave. Other than that i really love the cool and airy effect of this deodorant versus the solid version of this, I actually use secret everyday and its my main deodorant and I love it and the fact it works and actually works for up to two days and sometimes more. I only apply after my shower and it lasts all day long and still smells amazing! I plan on buying the clear gel as well and alternate it and the solid. I will sue the gel for days its hot and icky as this cools me down and works great! Thank you to secret and bzzagent for letting me try this free!</li>
            <li> This went on smooth and felt great.  However, after a few hours the odor protection ended. I never got &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; just a little odorous.  I believe for some people this product would be great it just did not work with my body&#x27;s chemicals.  I did receive this product free in order to review it, this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This stuff is totally awesome.  I&#x27;ve been using an invisible solid for the past couple of years but always hated the buildup it created on my armpits. Yuck.  I have always shied away from clear gels/roll-ons because in my experience, I have always hated that wet and slimy feeling in my armpits because it never dried.  Things have definitely changed with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Gel!  I am a convert!  I really love this product.  Everything is great about it.  The scent smells good. I have never liked Secret before because I found the scent a little unpleasant but I really love this one.  The product dries soon after you apply and there&#x27;s no slimy feeling and you feel protect for not only 24 hours but 48 hours!  Good to know if I decide not to shower one day. :)    I recommend this product.  Totally.  I am a convert.  I&#x27;m going to ditch my invisible solid (plus it&#x27;s not really invisible as they say it will be) for this clear gel.  Love Love Love it.    Please note I have received a free sample of this product to review from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I am a BZZagent and received this over a month ago.  I am completely impressed with it.  The protection lasts all day and leaves no white marks on my clothes.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off when I changed clothes either.  When I apply the gel, it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel stickly like some gels do.  The fragrance of the outlast is fresh and clean but not overpowering.  This is definitely my favorite deoderant!</li>
            <li> I think Secret Outlast Clear gel deodorant is great! I applied it before I went to work in the morning it kept me dry and fresh all day. It goes on clear so there was no transfer on my clothing. After work I went to the gym after my workout I was surprised how it held up I was still dry. I am impressed at how there was no odor, no transfer on my clothing and no wetness all day. It held me up throughout my entire work day and long after my workout. Overall, I am impressed with this deodorant. It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried. I am glad I received a free sample because I am BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was mostly excited to try the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant when I received it for FREE as a BzzCampaign thanks to Secret!  I have never been a fan of clear gels because they always feel so wet for a long time to me, and I&#x27;ve never been all that impressed with the protection (or lack of) that they provide.&lt;br /&gt;When I applied this deodorant, I was initially pretty unimpressed, and honestly a little grossed out.  I am just not a fan of anything that feels wet.  The first application I was really disappointed, because it seemed to take forever to dry.  But I didn&#x27;t give up, figuring I probably just accidentally used too much.  The second application was much better- when I didn&#x27;t unintentionally apply  probably twice as much as I needed, it was actually really good.  It dries completely within minutes, offers great protection, and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my dark clothes or my black baby carrier (a major issue I&#x27;ve been having with my usual deodorant).&lt;br /&gt;I love the protection it offers- between pregnancy,  a hot and humid East Coast summer,  and having to chase toddlers all day, I need something that&#x27;s going to last and allow me to keep moving without worrying about if my deodorant gave up long before my kids did.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing!  I have the &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; scent, and it is just perfect.  Not overwhelming, and it just smells fresh- not too girly or strong.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recently recieved Secret Outlast clear gel from Secret through a Bzzagent campaign and I put it to the test. Always hated gels as they always made me feel slimy and wet so I was skeptical of the claims. I was proven wrong. It not only held up to keeping me dry and odor free through a 12 hour shift but it also left no white marks on my dark nursing scrub shirts or leave clumps of white residue on my underarms. It dried fast when applied and lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I will start off by saying that I was given this product from BzzAgent and Secret for free to try, in exchange for an honest review. I have been using Secret brand deodorant for as long as I can remember.  I have tried the invisible solids and the clear gels before, and I have just always preferred the powder fresh feeling to the cold, sticky, wet gels. When I was invited to the campaign through BzzAgent, I thought, &amp;#34;why not? It won&#x27;t hurt anything to try it again&amp;#34; After all, don&#x27;t companies continue to perfect formulas, even after they market a product.&lt;br /&gt;Like, I stated before, I always found clear gels to be cold, wet, and sticky, and that is not a feeling that I like in my arm pits. So when my sample arrived, I was skeptical, and not super excited to try it... but I still did! Upon opening it, I noticed the scent.  It smelled nice to me, and my 6yr old son agreed.  It wasn&#x27;t a completely overpowering scent, but it was also not so faint that I had to actually smell my arm pit to get a whiff of it.  When I was winding it up to try it, I noticed that it went from none to a lot, in just one click. I shrugged it off and applied it. That is when I realized that it was definitely too much!  It seemed to dry pretty quickly, and it didn&#x27;t leave the sticky feeling behind, but it was still cold, and very wet feeling. After using it the next few days, I cut down to using one half of the gel that came out in one click on each side, and that seemed to be the perfect amount. But, whether I used half a click, or a whole one, it still did what it was supposed to do... it kept my pits dry, and smelled good doing it.&lt;br /&gt;Not only are a very active family, but we live in the country, in Texas... so we also have some outside chores to do as well.  Whether I was watching my oldest at football camp, out fishing on the lake, or cutting grass, the deodorant did its job, and the fresh scent remained throughout it all. I&#x27;m just still not sure about the cold, wet feeling that I get when I apply it, and the fact that way too much comes out at once.

            <li> Love this deodorant. It has a pleasant smell. The gel drys fast. Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, and it really does keep smelling good. I recommend you to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try and share my honest opinion. I really like how the clear gel puts on easily, I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product and it does not feel sticky. The clear gel leaves a refreshing and cool feel yet it dries super fast, I can put on my clothes right away not having the need to wait for it to dry and it does not leave white stains in my dark clothes. It has a pleasant out of the shower smell that lasts all day leaving me odor and wetness free. I recommend Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product as a free sample from secret. The product did last smell and wetness wise but the reason I gave it two stars was for the smell it has a chemical smell to it. I didn&#x27;t like that.&lt;br /&gt;Writing this review a bzz agent.</li>
            <li> So far so good!! Love the outlasting scent!! Goes on smooth and clear with no white marks!!  #bzzagent #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I got a free travel size sample of #secretoutlast deodorant from@bzzagent to try out. I&#x27;ve tried it out the last few days and im pretty impressed. This one is a clear gel but it dry&#x27;s quickly and don&#x27;t turn white after. It has dried.I&#x27;ve been trying so many different deodorants and haven&#x27;t really found one that works the way I like but I think this is the one. I feel comfortable the way it works and it stays smelling fresh. #lifehack you can also use it between or under your boobs or between your thighs to help control the sweat or Chaffing</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. However, all the stated opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with this product.  It was easy to use - even though it was a wet gel, it dried very quickly.  It kept to its claims about no white streaks, long lasting deodorant, and fresh scent.  I enjoyed this product and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a light scent that dies not over power your perfume. It keeps you dry and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I like the clear gel but it doesn&#x27;t seem to cover odor as well as other deodorants like Dove. Wish I had tried a different brand.</li>
            <li> Secret was nice enough to let me try this #LifeHack for free! Its my #MomHack of the summer!&lt;br /&gt;I live in TX where the heat is brutal in the summer. With two kids that makes going to the store a whole day event because of the heat!&lt;br /&gt;We normally are drenched with sweat by the time we get in or out of the car. No fun!&lt;br /&gt;I am always on the search for products to keep me fresh. I want to be Super Mom.&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast Clear Gel has kept me dry! I mean seriously dry! And non-smelly! No wet marks under arms, no grey marks on white shirts and no white marks on my dark stuff! Then lets say we have a long weekend of running and running with no time for myself... it keeps going with me! ROCK ON! Outlast!&lt;br /&gt;It will be my new go to!</li>
            <li> I love Secret brand deodorant anyways but Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gear Gel is awesome! I got it from bzzagent linking up with Secret to get this awesome product for free!! It rates as a 5 star for me because by far this is the best Secret product out there. For me in my opinion I think it is better than any other brand too!! What I don&#x27;t like is it advertises 48 hour protection. NO it doesn&#x27;t cover you. I am a heavy sweater and musty too. Trust me I have to apply multiple times a day. But it goes on so much cleaner than the powdered stick that it is worth it to me.Ultimately it is less product you are wearing and the scent is just amazing to me.  I have no ugly white marks on my shirts. I don&#x27;t have that nasty buildup under my arms from applying too much. Washing off in the shower is a breeze. So I ran out of my trial size and I had to go buy a regular size product, Like i said. This is my new favorite and will be until Secret stops selling it, which I don&#x27;t think is going to happen! Amazing Amazing Amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a clinical strength invisible solid for several months and my body &#x27;got used&#x27; to it. I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t working as well at keeping me odor-free. Changing shampoos for a couple weeks is an effective way to make my favorite shampoo work better when I switch back, so I tried the same technique for deodorant. I purchased an &#x27;advanced&#x27; solid that had 48 hour odor protection. It went on smoothly and did the job at keeping me odor free...but it RUINED all my bras and shirts by thickly coating them with goo. Even after several washings, the deodorant is still there. I recently received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from Bzzagent. I usually purchase invisible solid and stay away from gel because the gel makes me feel like I&#x27;ve been sweating, and that feeling makes me sweat, so I was prepared to be disappointed, sticky and sweaty. I can honestly say that I was/am VERY impressed with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. It dries very quickly, smells fresh but not overpowering, does a decent job at controlling odor and doesn&#x27;t make a MARK on my clothes. I really wish I&#x27;d known about Secret Outlast before I tried the traditional &#x27;stick&#x27; deodorant and ruined my clothes. I think I&#x27;ll stick to Secret Outlast instead of going back to the clinical strength formula; it works just as well for me!</li>
            <li> If you are tired of regular deodorant leaving stains on yours clothes, or over-powering scents than this is the deodorant you need to try before you keep wasting your money.  I was a dedicated Degree deodorant user but was getting frustrated with all the white stains it was leaving on my clothes so I bought a different brand gel deodorant and was extremely disappointed with the scent of it.  It was actually gross and almost stunk.  I was excited to try the Secret Outlast Gel when BzzAgent sent me a sample because I was getting frustrated with lots of others I had tried.  To my surprise this was a winner.  I did find it best to let it dry for a few seconds before putting a shirt on.  And the scent is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> perfect for when I travel, and glides on smoothly. I have been using this product a long time and enjoy it. Its long lasting and a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Totally loving this new secret outlast gel deodorant! I was using secret clinical strength sensitive before and I&#x27;m not a fan of overly smelly deodorants but I am liking this. The complete clean smell is good not to flowery or fake smelling and it&#x27;s only a mild smell too.  Loving the gel it dries in a couple of seconds and works all day (and I have a stressful job and I&#x27;m on the move most of the day)! And best thing ever is no white marks!  I got this product free to try from secret and BzzAgent and will definitely be buying it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving Secret Outlast Clear Gel! I got a free sample from Secret through Bzzagent! In this Texas heat I needed a deodorant that could keep up with me and Secret Outlast Clear Gel does the job. I love the cooling sensation as I put it on. I put it to the ultimate test by keeping up with my kids all day outside and it held strong. I did not have the nasty sweat stains and my pits still smelt great at the end of the day! I&#x27;m defiantly switching to Secret Outlast Clear Gel! Thanks Secret and thanks Bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free through bzz agent. The product goes on clear and smells great, but I didn&#x27;t get the protection I was looking for. For those who aren&#x27;t very sweaty it&#x27;s a great product. I had to use the product at night and morning to get the protection I needed. Otherwise,  I was happy with the no white marks. Since I wear professional clothing everyday, I didn&#x27;t have to deal with the embarrassing white marks.</li>
            <li> I always used Secret, but I always used invisible solid. I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel thanks to BuzzAgent. They sent me a free sample to give my feedback. I loved it. It is completely clear, it smells great, and the protection really does last! I don&#x27;t have anymore white marks left on my shirts after deodorant. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like too much is that it takes a while to dry once applied. It&#x27;s not a big deal though. When it is hot outside the cool feeling after applying feels great but it also feels a bit wet. But other then that, I noticed that I don&#x27;t sweat as much and as often. It really does keep me dry and fresh even when I&#x27;m working in my garden.</li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean scent clear gel deodorant complimentary of BzzAgent. After trying it, I have more Pro&#x27;s than Con&#x27;s. I enjoy that it it goes on clear, it does have a nice scent, and it does prevent you from sweating like a pig. The only Con that I can say about this product is that I do not like the way it feels once applied. It seems to eave a sticky feel, which I&#x27;m not too sure if it&#x27;s just me or if its supposed to feel like that. Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> I recently got to try a sample for free as part of a promotion from the brand. I&#x27;m already a recent deodorant switcher from degree to secret clinical strength. I have always been a solid girl until clinical strength&#x27;s only option was gel - however it was still white and still showed up when putting my clothes on. Enter secret outlast - with the clear gel I didn&#x27;t have to worry about how fast I put on my shirt, though, it still does take a few minutes to dry. The scent is not overbearing like some antiperspirants/deodorants on the market so I&#x27;m not cautious of putting too much on, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate freshly shaved skin. I will say that a little does go a long way and it does the job all day - whether in the heat or sweating profusely. I gave it a full month to test so I could give it a full review, even went a night here and there without showering to get the full 48 hour effect and still felt like it worked well. The active ingredient is the same as clinical strength but is 16% as opposed to 20%. No matter, it works just as well!</li>
            <li> I tried this deodorant recently for free through a promotion from the brand and I must say that I was not super impressed. I liked the fact that it was clear and didn&#x27;t leave behind any residues, but unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t last the whole day. Also, the scent did not tickle my fancy as I am personally more attracted to floral scented deodorants. Overall, I would say that the Secret Outlast Completely Clear is satisfactory. However, I would not recommend it for long work days (since you will be reapplying it every 6 hours or so).</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T LIKE THE WET FEELING, OTHER THAN THAT IT WORKS ! WILL ORDER DIFFERENT TYPE, BUT SAME BRAND SOON,</li>
            <li> Wonderful light scent that keeps you fresh throughout the day. No need to reapply. Also, Do not leave yucky white residue on pretty summer clothes!</li>
            <li> My go to antiperspirant all the time!  Have been using the clear gel product forever!!!</li>
            <li> I got to try this free and I am so glad that I did! Unlike other deodorants I only had to apply this on once. The biggest test was putting on my black Tshirt after putting it on...and there were absolutely no marks on it!!! It smells amazing too! All in all I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My problem with regular rub-on deodorant, is that even if it advertises that it dries clear, it still tends to give my dark clothes awful deodorant stains. The gel deodorant goes on nice and clear. Like other reviewers, I did not enjoy the wet feeling when I first put on the deodorant, but the feeling quickly goes away. The deodorant does last for awhile, but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it for more than a day, especially for those who live in a hot climate like I do. Lastly, the deodorant looks like it&#x27;s a regular size, but it really is small (less than 3 oz., but then again, I put on only put on half of the suggested amount...</li>
            <li> great product in general, but the travel size is great for several trips and nice fresh soft scent that doesn&#x27;t really have one, so great for guys and gals.</li>
            <li> Though I wish this didn&#x27;t go on so wet like, I must say its the best working deodorant I&#x27;ve used. The scent is not too much which I love and there is never that feeling of not being clean.  I had received this product as a trial from them and will definitely be buying more of it</li>
            <li> Works well, clear, no staining. Product goes fast ...</li>
            <li> I Recieved this product free from bzz agent solely for testing purposes and its a really great product that smells great and drys fast</li>
            <li> I was completely skeptical about trying a new deodorant but I received a free trial through the best product testing site ever; Bzzagent. I am so happy I tried it. It keeps me dry, smelling amazing all day, and it doesn&#x27;t make any marks/stains on any clothing. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am super sensitive to smells and I sweat a lot.  Not a good combination.  I have never been able to find a product that worked well enough that I wasn&#x27;t always asking my hubby to see if I smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From day 1 I was amazed.  I loved how easily it went on (with the solids I feel I&#x27;m gonna bruise I push so hard), and it dried quickly.  The smell was just like the name says CLEAN.  I was able to put it on at 4am, go to work for 12hrs, work out, go to bed, and when I woke up the next morning...nothing.  Not a smell.  It was amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have finally found the right deodorant for me.  Thanks to Bzzagent.com and Secret for allowing me to try this great product for free.  :O)</li>
            <li> BzzAgent sent me a free sample to review and here goes. Secret Outlast has outlasted all the other Antiperspirant I have ever used, and I have used a lot.  Secret is already a great deoderant brand but now with Outlast they have taken the cake! I wore it for 32 hours straight without reapplying it and I still was odor protected. Also I felt no presperation. Im telling you ladies, youll love it!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast clear gel deodorant in the Completely Clean Scent is amazing!  Wonderful fragrance that truly lasts!  So far, 29 hours in the Florida heat and it is still smelling strong.  No hint of B.O.  Highly recommend this gel that dries absolutely clear and leaves no white residue on clothing!  - Ghostbuster!</li>
            <li> I tried this free for bzzagent and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. You have to let it dry for a long time before you get dressed or it destroys your clothes. It stays sticky all day no matter what, so I can&#x27;t say that it keeps you dry. The Completely Clean scent isn&#x27;t too over powering, but it&#x27;s more floral than I expected with the name. I think this comes unscented so you may want to try that if scent is an issue. It keeps me odor free all day so that is a positive. I don&#x27;t know if it would last 48 hours or not. Fortunately I&#x27;ve never needed a deodorant to last that long. Secret Outlast in the solid is a lot better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of clear gel but decided to give this one a whirl.  It dries SO fast.  Doesn&#x27;t leave you with a yucky wet feeling.  Leaves no marks on your clothes.  I didnt feel sweaty or stinky all day!  And its been 90 degrees here in CA.  I wasnt a huge fan of the Completely Clean scent which is why I gave it four stars.  But I would definitely buy this product again, maybe just in the powder scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried gel deodorants in the past and was very disappointed. I received this as a free sample from Secret as a BzzAgent and have to admit I was skeptical. But I gave it a try, and I was really impressed! This gel dried right away. My main complaint with gels before this one was that they took forever to dry. I tried it out by going mountain biking. It gave lasting protection even after a good bike ride. The scent is nice without being overpowering. It leaves no residue on my clothing, which is a huge advantage over other deodorants. I highly recommend giving this a try. I&#x27;ve already switched over to using this every day.</li>
            <li> I got this sample from BuzzAgent to try out.  First of all, it really does dry quickly for a clear gel deodorant.  In seconds.  There is no wet or sticky feeling or even a residue that I can feel.  I have been using this every day for a while now, and it does what it says faithfully.  I&#x27;ve had NO white marks on my shirts.  I stay dry all day and all night.  I simply love the scent and I stay smelling fresh into the next day.  This stuff is really great. I&#x27;m leaving my old deodorant behind and stocking up on Secret Outlast.  Thanks guys!!! #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a review if a deodorant on Amazon of all places but I feel like I have to.  I love it.  It goes on smooth and dries almost instantly.  No white marks on my little black dress.  No need to re-apply after a few hours.  It&#x27;s awesome.  And I got it for free from Secret.  Go buzzagent!</li>
            <li> I can quit searching!  I&#x27;ve found my favorite antiperspirant!  Received it free from BzzAgent; I&#x27;ve been using this for three weeks, and I will continue to buy this for it&#x27;s long-lasting protection, and freedom from white streaks on my black wardrobe!  Thank you Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> I wear alot of black for work, and simply because I love the color. And I hated getting those nasty white marks on my clothes, well no more!!! Even if you do accidentally gets this on your clothes, no worries, doesn&#x27;t show up. Scents are light. Nothing worse than a scent that overpowers your perfume, who needs that?!&lt;br /&gt;And I think it works as well as clinical strength (by same company but MUCH more expensive). Worth the $3.50&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll purchase again....and again!</li>
            <li> I received a sample size Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant stick for free from BzzAgent as a promotion to test and honestly review this product.  Let me just make this clear, I really, really wanted to like the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant, as I mainly use other antiperspirant/deodorants by the Secret® brand, unfortunately, I DID NOT like this clear gel deodorant one bit. This deodorant is a complete failure at the things it&#x27;s meant to do and claims to do. First and foremost, it does NOT provide wetness protection, it actually does the opposite. Once I applied it, it made my underarms wet and never completely dried throughout the day, it just smeared onto my shirt. It didn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt as with traditional solid deodorants, but it still stained the underarm cuffs of my shirt with a clear/wet/shiny/glitter-like appearance, which was very unflattering. Secondly, this deodorant did not provide me with odor protection. I applied it in the morning, after taking a shower, before my 8 and 1/2-hour work shift and within 2 hours of being on the job my underarms were sweaty and starting to stink. I couldn&#x27;t even get through half my work shift before I started to wreak and I I didn&#x27;t have another deodorant in my purse how I carry as usual so I remained stinky throughout my entire work shift, mind you, I work as a Bartender/Hostess and since I work the morning shift my days are usually slow. As soon as I got home I took a shower and applied my regular deodorant. So the &amp;#34;keep it fresh 48-hour protection&amp;#34; claim by Secret® is completely false advertising, also they have no evidence/research to back it up, it&#x27;s just a marketing gimmick. The only positive thing I have to say about the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant is that the scent &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; actually smells good, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter if it does not last or work effectively. I use Secret® brand deodorants on a regular basis so it&#x27;s such a shame that Secret® hasput out such a bad deodorant when their solid deodorants are highly effective and on a much higher caliber than this crappy gel nonsense. Here&#x27;s a tip: stick to solids. I included a photograph of my full-size Secret® Invisible Solids deodorants, that I use on a regular basis and the small sample-size Secret® Clear Gel deodorant BzzAgent sent me in the mail, as well as a photograph of the back of the deodorants showing the difference in the &#x27;active ingredients&#x27; list, I&#x27;m sure that has a lot to do with the effectiveness of the solid vs the gel.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this product as part of a promotion brand with bzz agent and I loved it. This product goes on clear, no residue just protected. The scent is pleasant nothing too overpowering where you smell it every time you move. I truly recommend this product</li>
            <li> So, I had gotten the Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try for free for being a BzzAnget and spread the good word. This product is amazing. It works way better than I expected. It doesn&#x27;t feel wet or sticky and it smells amazing. It definitely keeps you dry for up to 48 hour... even on extremely hot days. Do I recommend the Secret Outlast Clear Gel?  I sure do!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Leaves no markings on my clothing. I feel dry and odorless even at the end of my day. I&#x27;m using a free product as part of a promotion for Secret and BzzAgent campaign. I&#x27;m glad I got the chance to try it. I will be buying this product in the very near future.</li>
            <li> I like the gel antiperspirant as it doesn&#x27;t stain as much, and doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks.  I like the smells secret has to offer.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this deodorant and was pleasantly surprised. It held up to the high muggy temps that we have had and genuinly lasted 48 hours. I loved that I could wear my sleeveless shirts or dresses and not have to worry about any white marks! I also loved the fresh scent that followed me all day. #freesample #bzzagent</li>
            <li> This is an awesome deodorant! Buy it!&lt;br /&gt;I live in California where it has been between 101 and 110 for the last month and during that time I was given the opportunity to test and review this product courtesy of BzzAgent and Secret.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works! I have had no issues with those nasty white deodorant lines that I had grown accustomed to when using the bar and I no longer worry about armpit stains. You know the stains I&#x27;m talking about.... They are the stains that occur when sweat and deodorant collide; The stains that will not come out of your clothing no matter how many times you have attempted to &amp;#34;Shout&amp;#34; them out. I have, by accident, gone 48 hours without reapplying and I was surprised to find that the deodorant was indeed still working! This Secret Outlast Clear Gel really has outlasted all other deodorants that I have used. No other deodorant has worked as well to keep me smelling and looking fresh!</li>
            <li> The scent of this deodorant is very pleasant and not overpowering. It feels nice on and isn&#x27;t sticky like some. I also have had no issues of it showing on my clothes! I am a big fan! #gotitfree #buzzagent</li>
            <li> I have used Secret Gel Deodorant for years and I just started using Outlast Clear with this order. It really lasts a long time and I LOVE IT! It is the best of the line so far and I will be using this one from now on.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time with deodorant because it always leaves the white balls under my arms, white marks on my clothing, or doesn&#x27;t work.  The Secret Outlast doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothing nor under my arms and it seems to work really well.  It goes on a bit wet feeling but dries within about a minute. A lot of antiperspirants make my underarms itch or even start to sweat as soon as I put it on, but this product doesn&#x27;t even feel like it is there. My only negative is that when you twist to get the deodorant to come up either none comes or A TON comes and then you have very wet underarms.</li>
            <li> I was selected through a social media marketing agency to review this product. I received a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Completely Clean fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a mother of 3, 2 of those children are under 5. Needless to say, I am always on the move. Living in Tennessee, summers are hot and humid so I need an antiperspirant that will keep up with me and keep me dry. This accomplishes both of those tasks while smelling very, well, clean. It doesn&#x27;t smudge on my black tank top, it doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry, and it stays put. I will be purchasing this from now on. I am very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t like deodorants in gel form because it feels so moist after applying and I have to wait for it to dry.  Otherwise, it would stain my top if I&#x27;m not wearing something sleeveless.  This of course still happened with this Secret Outlast Clear Gel so it still didn&#x27;t totally change my opinion about gels.  I did have to fan my underarms for a while or else it would stain my top and make it look moist/wet.  However, it was of course invisible as most gels always promise.  So obviously I liked that there were no white streaks on my clothes.  But I was not a big fan of the scent at all.  It was way too strong and smelled too sweet and fruity.  I probably would have liked the scent when I was 12 or 13, but not now as an adult. I probably would have preferred something unscented, or just a faint more natural smell, like a powder fresh or something.  But it smells like those heavily scented lotions at Bath &amp; Body Works or The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of Gel deodorants. So when Buzzagent sent me this one free for review purposes I was skeptical. Now that I&#x27;ve used it I Love it. It keeps me fresh and smelling great thought out the day. Plus it has 0 residue. I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks of build up.</li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast clear gel for FREE through bzzagent! I have never used clear gels! So I was excited to try this!! I have loved everything about it so far. The first day I used it it lasted all day! And I was working hard that day so it held up! I like the clean scent but would love to try other scents. It dries fast and has not left any marks on my clothes! Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I got this product from buzz agent to review.I tried it for the first time . With it being such a hot time of year and such a busy day I figured it&#x27;d be the perfect time to try it out. When I first opened it I noticed the pleasant smell instantly (come on, you know that&#x27;s important!). I&#x27;m normally not a clear gel type of person, however this one was different. It dried almost instantly and even in a black tank top I got zero residue on it! So far I really haven&#x27;t noticed any negatives about the product. By the end of the day I was still dry and odor free! I would def. recommend this product. I think this is my new favorite! . Its especially great in the summer when you wear short sleeves or tank tops and dont want to get the white deodorant on your clothes or worse get it clumped up under your arm</li>
            <li> This Secret was a great price, especially when I used the coupon for it. I didn&#x27;t realize it was the …ultra antiperspirant. I use it, but this will be the last time I buy it. If you read the label, it says consult doctor if you have kidney disease. I don&#x27;t have kidney disease, but I have diabetes, which is very hard on your kidneys…..I would just rather play it safe, especially since regular Secret has always done the job for me. If you are a heavy sweater with good kidneys, it might be just what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t look close enough to see the size of this product. i thought it was the normal size I always see at the drugstore but it is smaller (although not as small as the travel size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I really like this brand of deodorant, have been using it for years because it really keeps me odor free.</li>
            <li> This product works and it really does last.  I also liked the scent, and I&#x27;m really picky about smells.  I generally get unscented products whenever I can.</li>
            <li> I bought this so it wouldn&#x27;t stain the under arms of my dark shirts, like the \\&quot;invisible solids\\&quot; seem to do. It goes on wet, and when I sweat, it gets really wet. It feels nasty. I also hate how hard it is to control how much I put on. One whole click is more than I want to put on. Otherwise, it makes my underarms so wet! One time it slipped out of my hand while I was applying. When it landed on my cream colored carpet, a bunch if it spewed out on my carpet. Now there&#x27;s a white stain on the carpet. Hopefully it will wash out.</li>
            <li> Thanks to secret I got to try this product for free! When I was younger I tried gel deodorant and was not impressed. I put it on feeling like sweat and felt that way all day long. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes that this would work but I was surprised. First off the smell was amazing and it lasted the whole day. No more white marks for me to have to worry about. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the wet feeling when you first put it on. I&#x27;ll trade the wet feeling any day for the amazing smelling, long lasting, and no wet marks! I was so impressed.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from BzzAgent to try. When I first applied this deodorant, I was suspicious that I would end up not liking it. I sweat a lot and sometimes reapply my deodorant in the evening if I m heading back out.  I was however, pleasantly surprised with this! It does go on wet, but dries relatively quickly. The best part is that it lasted all day - even through my 30 day shred workout and left NO white residue on my work clothing. I have thrown away several key pieces due to staining and discoloration from my normal deodorants - Lady Speed Stick and Degree solids that both claimed no white residue (NOT true); and Dove and Degree spray deodorant that claims to last all day (again - NOT true). I usually don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; deodorant fragrances, but this one is nice - not too manly or soap scented. The smell is not overpowering - even when heated up. I plan to purchase the full-size stick.</li>
            <li> Super fresh scent that lasts.Really stops the funk even through a tough, outdoor day! #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
            <li> I recently receive a trial of  The Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant feom BzzAgent and is exactly what I was looking for. I had never liked gel deodorants because of the constant feel of wetness. But this one I most say that I love it from the first try. It dry fast. Smells awesome. It makes me feel confident all day long. I definitively recommended.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent that recieved this product as a free sample to try, I&#x27;d like to start off this review by saying I only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like gel deoderants.  I feel like I&#x27;m putting cold slime under my arms.  In addition to the gel factor, it also lost points for its seemingly high alcohol content.  I could feel it and smell it.  I&#x27;m assuming this is so that it dries quickly, but I made sure to not use this deodorant right after shaving my arm pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this deodorant lasts ALL.  DAY.  And THEN some.  I&#x27;m a busy mom of two with 2 big dogs and a husband who isn&#x27;t home a lot so showers get lost in the line-up sometimes.  This deodorant never let me down.  I work in a busy hospital and do a lot of walking and I never ever had pit stains or smells.  Granted, I&#x27;m not much of a sweater, but I&#x27;ve smelled the consequences of forgetting the occasional shower and it was not pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; scent was perfect as well.  I&#x27;m not a wearer of perfumes, every now and again I&#x27;ll use body spray, but other than that I&#x27;m a wash and wear, no make up, ponytail kind of woman.  This scent was great for that, it wasn&#x27;t flowery or overpowering, just a clean, natural scent that stayed with me all day and even garnered a few compliments on my smell lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that while I love this product, I would not buy it, simply because its gel and I don&#x27;t like gel deodorants.  If it was ever on super sale then I probably would, but otherwise I&#x27;m sticking to my normal brand.  If you like gels, this is the perfect brand!  It dries quickly, stays put, and won&#x27;t leave marks on your clothes!</li>
            <li> its not sticky like most gels it dries fast and leaves you feeling fresh for hours you defiantly don&#x27;t have to waste your time running around and reapplying deodorant  all day long like I have found with most deodorants  and this is a gel I love and that&#x27;s saying something because I hate almost all gels because of the stickiness but there is no stickiness here its worth the time and money to try for yourself I received mine to try in a bzz kit and I love it</li>
            <li> First off I want everyone to know I received this item free in exchange for an HONEST review from bzzagent. Now that that is out of the way let me continue with my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed with this item, in the past I have always been against gel deodorant. I&#x27;ve just had bad experiences with them, but after trying this one I am happy and will be replacing my stock. Anyways I usually wear an invisible solid one and I honestly didn&#x27;t know I had an issue with it. Day one I put on the gel and yes its cold to touch but it just slips on and only takes a little bit and dries up instantly. It felt great, smelled great. I didn&#x27;t even realize I was wearing deodorant. So I go on throughout my day and its great, Im loving it that I haven&#x27;t felt sticky, sweaty and just plain dirty in my pits. Day 2 I put on my invisible solid and right way I notice im feeling sticky! All day long I don&#x27;t feel as comfortable as I did with the gel... im feeling sticky, I can feel the deodorant on my skin, it just doesn&#x27;t feel natural! So I shower and reapply the gel and its like I applied nothing. I feel free with it on. Im honestly amazed and in love with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing.  I received this as a campaign for BzzAgent.com, and was skeptical due to the fact that I do not like gel deodorants.  To my amazement, my opinion has changed.  I am a personal trainer that is moving all day/working out, and this has helped me maintain dry and stink-free armpits!  I highly recommend this deodorant if you are looking for long lasting protection!</li>
            <li> First, I’ll start out with saying that I got to test this product ( Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel) for free from Secret and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty excited to try a new deodorant, especially with summer here and in full heat, and if it claimed to do everything it said, this was going to be a match made in heaven.  It does last for 48 hours, so I was impressed with that.  It also doesn’t leave those thick, chalk-like white marks on your shirts - so your black outfits are safe.  The scent is fresh and clean, nothing overpowering on that end.  The product does dry quickly, which I’ve noticed you might have to wait with other gel deodorants.  It is a gel - so it does get used a little quicker than your standard stick, so that’s certainly not in its favor. It’s a typical price for a gel deodorant, so that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Fresh and clean scent&lt;br /&gt;*Does last 48 hours like it claims&lt;br /&gt;*No white marks&lt;br /&gt;*Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Gel is used quickly&lt;br /&gt;*I haven’t seen any other scents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other:&lt;br /&gt;*Price isn’t outstanding, but it isn’t really that bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it was a good product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Secret sent me a sample of their Secret Outlast® Clear Gel and asked me what I think. I held on to my sample for a few days knowing I&#x27;d be starting my new job and figured there would be no bigger test then the first week at a new place, in the middle of summer mind you.&lt;br /&gt;They claim fast-drying, 48-hour protection and no white marks. For the fast drying I don&#x27;t think it was any faster then my regular deodorant. I do like that it is a clear gel and there are no white marks. I didn&#x27;t really try out the 48 hour protection because it&#x27;s the middle of summer and that would just be crazy. In the end it&#x27;s a good deodorant. I would recommend it to a friend. I usually use one of the clinical strength deodorants and I think this is a pretty close substitution.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deodorant! No fear of white marks on your clothes. It dries super fast, smells great-but not too strong. The odor &amp; wetness protection is great too! I just love that I can put it on &amp; change clothes 10 times-with no fear of getting white marks all along the bottom of my shirt!!!</li>
            <li> The scent is only okay.  I really like floral, fruity, or sweet smelling deodorants.  I really don&#x27;t think this goes on with a scent or even dries with a scent.  I would consider this product unscented.  But maybe my smeller isn&#x27;t as sensitive as the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on smoothly and dries completely within seconds.  Some of the clear gel&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past made me feel like I needed to use the hair drier to dry my pits before I could put them down.  That just feels gross.  But the fact that this dries completely and quickly, is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This claims to keep me odor free and dry for 48 hours but, personally, I think it&#x27;s kinda gross to go without a shower for more than 24 hours so I won&#x27;t be testing that little aspect of this product.  I can vouch for the product in the area of my cardio days.  On days that I do heavy cardio, I do not sweat or smell bad and that&#x27;s a great thing. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think this product goes by really fast.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days and a lot is already used up.  It seems my solids last forever.  For the price of this product, I&#x27;d expect it to last a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often use a odor protection only deodorant instead of an anti-antiperspirant/deodorant combo.  I also often use deodorants that are more &#x27;natural&#x27;.  I would really like to see Secret offer an odor protection ONLY deodorant in a variety of scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a BzzAgent and received this product to test and review.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this from BzzAgent to try out and review. The smell is nice. It goes on dry and dries about 2x faster than other deodorants. I love it!</li>
            <li> i never really used the gel deodorants before because they just seemed like they would be wet and sticky, but this one actually is not. it&#x27;s wet when you first put it on, but it dries really fast. and the smell is really nice. it does its job of keeping you dry and i can actually smell it all day, unlike other deodorants i have used, that you can only smell for an hour if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;trying the product for free thanks to Secret, but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love Secret Outlast Clear Gel Completely Clean scent! This worked under heavy stress for over 48 hours and I smelled great! I am picky when it comes to underarm protection and I break out alot from other brands so its so nice to have a great smelling protective deodorant I can use and that works so awesome! I love that their are no sticky or white messy marks when I put it on and it lasts a very long time!  I will be buying only this brand from now on!  #GotItFree from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from BzzAgent and giving my honest opinion. The deodorant smells very nice. However the protection doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours, it barely lasted 7-8 hours on me. The deodorant feels very wet. I felt like it never dried completely, and my underarms felt very sticky all day. It didn&#x27;t stained my clothes though. But the odor and wetness protection is weak.</li>
            <li> I have used Secret brand deodorant before but is was the solid powder that said it wouldn&#x27;t mark up my clothes, but it did and I still thought I had an odor to me at the end of the day.  Then I worried about ingredients and switched to Tom&#x27;s which never kept me from smelling, left marks on my clothes, and left clumps under my armpit.  I was in search of something that would be a perfect fit for my needs.  Here is where Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel comes in.    I love, love, love this deodorant.  I will day my only con is the drying time, it is longer than a few seconds.  Lets talk about the pros:    Goes on clear  Doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes  I have not had an odor even after a workout  It lasts as long as it state, 48 hours! I know because I forgot to put deodorant on one day and I had no odor.    I highly recommend this product, I bought a few to stock up just in case they sell out.  I am a BzzAgent and received this product for free.</li>
            <li> very small, but it smells nice</li>
            <li> #GotitFree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of this product. I was able to try it free through BzzAgent. It didn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes. I don&#x27;t really need 48 hour protection since I shower every day. However I can see how this would be perfect for a long trip or maybe camping when you don&#x27;t always have access to a shower. I would definitely purchase this product!</li>
            <li> I love this new product from Secret. It has a fresh, clean and subtle scent. Secret Outlast Clear gel dries almost instantly and you&#x27;ll hardly even know its there!! Its gets me through the busiest of days with out any problems and no white marks on my clothes. I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free to test out as part of a promotion from Secret and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> This product definitely lives up to 48 hours of underarm coverage! I totally love that it is a great smelling gel that glides on smooth and dries pretty fast.  I am a person that loves scent so the scent was very pleasing to me and not overpowering. I like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my clothing because of the clear gel technology of this product. It is not a bulky item so it fits really comfortable in m hand and it is not hard to get the gel to come up. I really love this antiperspirant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li> BzzAgent send me this product few days ago, and so far, so good! With &amp;#34;Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel&amp;#34; deodorant stains be gone! I love gel because it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your clothes and for real, the Outlast version seems to really do what it promises - keep your pits dry!  It keeps me dry and and smelling great!  It smells absolutely fantastic. It even stays all day, and doesn&#x27;t leave a single stain!</li>
            <li> in the past i have had issues of dark stains in the armpit region of tops. Switched to this and have been very happen ever since</li>
            <li> Received this to review, and I&#x27;ll gladly buy it in the future!&lt;br /&gt;This goes on smoothly, and dries very quick. Nothing worse than putting on deodorant, getting dressed and then feeling the coldness of moisture on your shirt or dress. This is different! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of deodorants, but will be going with this in the future. It&#x27;s got a clean scent and doesn&#x27;t overpower other fragrances that I like to wear daily. The best part about it is it really does go on completely clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on any clothing.</li>
            <li> secret outlast is great protection to keep you clean and fresh all day even for 48 hours straight  could not ask for anything better  I  have got this for a promotion from secret to try out its great</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive a Bzzagent campaign for Secret Outlast Completely clean clear gel.  I have a love hate relationship with Secret.  The solids have great odor protection and stop the sweating but I always find that they left a film that made it difficult when shaving...so no more Secret for me until now.  Honestly, I was hesitant on a gel because they are usually messy and take an an eternity to dry.  Not the case with secret Clear Gel.  It stayed in place and dried in seconds, no more waiting to get dressed!  The first time I used it I spent the day walking through NYC, seeing a play and going to dinner.  At no point did I feel like I was sweating or the odor protection stopped working.  It was great for the full 12 hour active day.  The only downfall I found is that when applied immediately after shaving, it has a slight sting...but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I think this is a secret every female should know about love this formula  dries fast last long and gives off a fresh scent when the heat is on</li>
            <li> I did not care for the free trial provided to me.  I have a different deodorant I&#x27;ve preferred to others for quite some time and I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot since I got it for free.  After 3 days, I went back to my usual.  It feels slimy and gooey to me.  The fragrance is nice and it did not get on my clothing, so that is why I gave it 2 stars.  I figure it does part of what is intended. I just don&#x27;t like that wet feeling at all.</li>
            <li> I used to use clear gels in the past when I was young and carefree. As I got older I needed stronger wetness protection that clear gels just weren&#x27;t affording me.I switched to clinical strength and have never looked back.  But the claims that this product gives, it lives up to. It keeps me dry all day long and since odor was never an issue with me, I know it is keeping up with that, too! I LOVE the fresh smell and it stays with me most of the morning and if I smell it again, its because I know it is working. I ad to play with the applicator to figure out how to get the right amount to come out and now we are in sync! Only thing I would change is you really need to let the product dry before putting your clothes on.  Since this is cheaper than clinical strength and covers my needs, I plan on making the switch! Thanks Secret! I did receive this product free for testing purposes and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Love this antiperspirant -- always keeps me dry even during the hottest of days.  Love the scent -- very fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it won&#x27;t get it again im not sure if it works 48 hours</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised  to still be fresh and dry after my hour and a half work out. My face was sweaty and beet red but i was still fresh as flowers. Definitely a keeper so glad I got this to test from Bzzagent.com I am normally a invisible solid type of girl but this is definitely your bff if you have an active lifestyle a gym bag keeper.</li>
            <li> Never going back to the solid again , not only does this smell amazing but it gives you odor protection for 48 hours and that&#x27;s great for my active schedule . I love the clear gel , it takes away any perspiration you may have . I love it !&lt;br /&gt;I got this for review from secret</li>
            <li> I have used clear gels in the past with disastrous results. Imagine my surprise to discover that this Secret clear gel, that states no white marks, actually lives up to its promises.  No sticky feeling under the arms, no white marks and as an added bonus, it smells great. I got this sample free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I tried out Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as a promo from Bzzagent.com. It smells real fresh and clean. I have never tried clear gel before this product and did not expect it to feel so sticky after applying. It takes a while for the product to dry and even after drying it still has a sticky feeling. However, I truly still smell clean after a long, long day of running around after a classroom of kindergarteners and 4 hours of classes for my masters degree! Added bonus...no streaks or marks on my black shirts!!</li>
            <li> The liberating feeling of being free from white marks...for real!  never going back to my &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solid</li>
            <li> Good protection, nice smell, dries quickly. I recommend Especially for physical activity. Does not stain clothes. His other presentations are also welcome</li>
            <li> I will first start of by saying I got to try the secret outlast gel completely free from Secret. I have been looking for a good deodorant that does not leave white marks. And I was able to find it with this deodorant. It has a great smell and it is long lasting. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Gel dries quickly, NO white marks on my clothing, love the scent, and it REALLY does last 48 hours!!! I am a BZZAGENT and absolutely love to get the opportunity to try and share amazing products! Hands down the best deodorant!!</li>
            <li> I never bought gel type deodorants because I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling. Additionally, I typically get dressed minutes after showering so I don&#x27;t have time to sit and wait for the deodorant to dry so I&#x27;ve always used solid type deodorants. The thing with solid deodorants is that it would leave a white build up under my arms which didn&#x27;t help me feel sexy when I lifted my arms while wearing a halter top. I often would have to wipe off the excess build up. I received a free sample of Secret Outlast 48 hr Completely Clean gel thanks to Secret. I was skeptical, again about the wetness part, but was pleasantly surprised when the gel dried before I even put my top on. At the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t have any wet stains or marks on the shirt and i still smelled fresh. I used it the next day and decided to wear a tube top and felt so free with no worries of white build up. Love that the scent is mild, not to strong but long lasting. I have converted to Secret gel deodorant, no more solid for this girl! Thank you Secret!</li>
            <li> When first putting this product on I noticed that I didn&#x27;t get the wet sticky feeling that other gel deodorants have given me. I liked the smell. When I put my baby in our carrier to go to the store I normally end up with white deodorant marks on the straps. With this product I did not have any of those marks! Being a busy mom of a newborn and toddler I do not get the opportunity to shower every morning so I loved that the odor protection lasted longer then 24 hours until I was able to get a shower later!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free from Secret through BzzAgent in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I generally use regular stick deodorant.  However, I had the opportunity as a BzzAgent to test this product for free.  I have been using it for around a week or two.  I use it in the same way I was using the stick deodorant.  I put it on in the evening after my shower before bed.  If forgotten I just put it on in the morning.  Yesterday, I made the mistake of rubbing it on my clothing. Instead of leaving the usual residue, it immediately dried and left no stain behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it is wet when you put it on.  However, you just wait a moment and it dries.  I only need one click per side and I do not seem to be going through the product quickly although it is quite a small amount.  I am interested to see if it can last 48hours.  Therefore, I am currently putting that to the test.  So far I have no complaint as I have not noticed any body odor and still feel dry.  I do plan on purchasing this product in the future as  have been trying to find an alternative to the solid stick deodorant.</li>
            <li> I tried secret outlast thanks to bzzagent. It was better than expected. It went on wet &amp; sticky but dried quickly. It kept me dry all day &amp; was still dry the next morning. It didnt leave any white marks on my shirts. Good product that I am now switching to.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from Secret through BzzAgent. My usual deodorant is Secret Clinical Strength because I tend to sweat a lot. I prefer the Clinical Strength over this one because it offers just a little more wetness protection. Although, the Outlast is a very close second in my favorites. I don&#x27;t care for the gel version because I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling on my underarms while I wait for it to dry. I do like the Completely Clean scent, it&#x27;s one of my favorite scents in deodorants. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for great odor and wetness protection without having to go clinical strength.</li>
            <li> As a busy mom of two boys, I sweat alot and have to reapply deodorant at least twice a day. I was luckt enough to try this deoderant free from bzzagent! With this deoderant, I applied once and that was all I needed. It smells wonderful and kept me dry and smelling fresh all day long. By far, my favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li> Deodorant is something you are going to have to use every day, so it is important to use a brand that you are impressed with. I had already been using the Secret brand solid protection in powder scent, but I received a sample of the Secret Outlast clear gel to try and review for BzzAgent. The most common complaint I hear about the solids are that they aren&#x27;t suitable to wear with dark clothing, and that you can see that you are wearing it. I can&#x27;t disprove that complaint, but it has never bothered me. I will say with trying this new clear gel, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that. You might think that the clear gels are &amp;#34;too wet&amp;#34;, but that can be solved by simply letting yourself dry before putting on your shirt. I really enjoyed the scent on this deodorant. It wasn&#x27;t too overpowering. It smelled soft and clean. I liked the powder scent most about the deodorant I was using before this one, and this scent was just as enjoyable. The only negative thing I have to say about this deodorant is that I went through it very quickly. It took me 7 days to use the bottle that I got sent through BzzAgent. However, it was a travel size bottle, so it was not intended to last a long time. At the end of the day I think it comes down to preference. I enjoyed the deodorant, but I don&#x27;t know that I would be inclined to buy the Secret Outlast clear gel over the solid that I had already been accustomed to.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for free courtesy of Secret. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work for me because I have never been one to like gel deodorant but to my surprise I absolutely love Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel. I&#x27;ve been searching for a deodorant to help manage perspiration, odor, &amp; wetness. I haven&#x27;t had any luck with any of the other deodorants that i&#x27;ve tried until I tried Secret Outlast! I absolutely love the smell of this deodorant! It has a strong scent &amp; is very clean smelling. It does go on wet, yet it dries very quickly (within a few minutes). It leaves no white marks &amp; doesn&#x27;t ball up like some stick deodorants I have used in the past. The gel does last all day with no need to reapply! I had no issues with perspiration, odor, or wetness under my arm pits! I highly recommend this product &amp; will definitely be switching to Secret Outlast! Goodbye to my old invisible solid as I am now in love with another gel!</li>
            <li> So this was my first time trying the secret outlast completely clean clear gel &amp; might I say this is a new favorite!! I love the smell, &amp; the protection!! There&#x27;s no white streaks when I put on my dark clothes fr my previous deodorant-so I&#x27;m definitely a happy happy camper!! I was able to try this as a promotion from bzzagent &amp; secret :)</li>
            <li> I really love this new product from Secret. It has a fresh and clean scent to it, not very overwhelming at all like some deodorants. There are a variety of scents available,but as of yet I have only tried the Completely Clean sent, I can&#x27;t wait to try the others out. Secret Outlast Completely Clean also does not leave behind a wet sticky mess, it dries almost instantly, you hardly even know its there!! It offers protection for up to 48 hours, although I have not tested it for that lenght of time, but its does get me through the day and thats all that matters! Lastly, but certainly not least, it does not take much at all, just a little swipe under each arm and you are through. I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean for free to test out as part of a promotion from Secret.</li>
            <li> I received my secret outlast from bzzagent.Let me tell you I had used secret before but not the clear gel. It works great, I stay dry and clean all day. Even when running erands in 100 degree weather. Smells great as well. And it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of secret outlast clear gel as a BzzAgent. Over all I liked how it kept me dry and smelling good through the day. I&#x27;m a new mom and the last thing I need is to be a sweaty mess on top of being sleep deprived. The biggest con for me was that initially the gel feels very wet and I feel like it needs to dry before I get dressed. If I get dressed first it is a lot harder to put this stuff on bc it will get all over my clothes if I&#x27;m not super careful and again there is the drying time. I do like that there isn&#x27;t the white residue on my clothes at the end the of the day. I have also used this for training runs (marathon in February!) and it does a good job. I would buy this to keep in my running bag.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deodorant!! It does feel a little wet when you first put it on, but it dries in seconds and keeps my dry ALL day long. I love that it a clear gel so I never have to worry about getting those unsightly white marks on my clothes like I do with a solid deodorant. This also smells really nice and is not overpowering at all. I am very sensitive to smells and this doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit. It smells fresh and clean. I have been solid deodorant user for years, but am definitely converting to this from now on. Thanks to Bzz Agent for providing me with a free stick to try out!!</li>
            <li> I liked the 48 hour protection and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks which is nice when I&#x27;m wearing a dark colored tank. My only complaint about the product is the scent to me it reminds of a very strong laundry detergent and some days it&#x27;s a little much.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant is awesome. It&#x27;s my new favorite deodorant. It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes. I have very sensitive armpits and can&#x27;t use a lot of deodorants. I haven&#x27;t had one problem with this. The fresh scent is great also. Best part? Got a free sample to try!</li>
            <li> I got to test Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free through BzzAgent and Secret.  I was a little apprehensive at first, as I have never used gel deodorant before. It took awhile to dry, but that is the only thing I don&#x27;t like. Overall, I love it. It goes on smooth and it lasted for a long time! 2 days later and I still smelled like my deodorant, no odor! I wear black alot, and I was pleased to see that it doesnt leave any white streaks or residue. I am very impressed with this product, and have already purchased more.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to participate in a product testing and review program and got the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free from Secret. I had never used clear gel deodorant before because I always thought they would feel wet and sticky under my arms, take too long to dry, or get even wetter if I started sweating. But this product is ABSOLUTELY none of those things. It feels great going on, dries unbelievably quickly, doesn&#x27;t transfer to my clothes or my kids if I&#x27;m picking them up, and best of all I don&#x27;t even realize I&#x27;m wearing it throughout the day. It keeps me dry, smelling great, and I have one less thing to think about throughout the day. Since receiving my free sample from Secret to test and review, I&#x27;ve actually already purchased another full size Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant and I don&#x27;t plan on ever going back to another kind! I&#x27;m a Clear Gel Convert!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S- Did I mention NO MORE WHITE MARKS ON MY CLOTHES?!?!</li>
            <li> I got to try Secret Outlast Gel through a Sample Promotion Site #GotItFree, When I got picked for the Campaign I was truly exciting in hopes that I would find a better antiperspirant deodorant than what I have been using, I was iffy on gel because I&#x27;ve always used Solid. Upon trying this product It didn&#x27;t fair well with myself, while it did smell great and it did soak in quickly and I had no white streaks, after a few hours of indoor and outdoor chores I was smelly again and had to reapply. Overall my experience with Secret outlast would be a No, I wouldn&#x27;t try this product again unless I was just sitting around and not doing strenious chores around the house.</li>
            <li> I received a full size product to test from bzz agent for free i have to say this is the best deodorant i have ever tried worked in 80 degree weather as i was push mowing my 2 acre yard</li>
            <li> I got this deodorant free from BzzAgent. It does not leave white marks on clothes so that is good. But it is not effective as an antiperspirant for me because I have hyperhidrosis. I do not recommend it for women who have hyperhidrosis. I do recommend it for typical women who have normal sweat glands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove regularly for years and was pleasantly surprised by this deodorant when I received a free sample of it from Secret in the mail last week. I&#x27;ve been using it daily since it arrived and it goes on clear, with this lovely cool sensation that is especially nice for the summer. So far, it&#x27;s been close to 100 outside where I&#x27;m located and it&#x27;s held up really well. I&#x27;ll probably purchase this when I run out of my sample.</li>
            <li> I live this product. I received it as a trial from bzz agent to review. This deodorant left me dry and odor free. The scent was very mild but pleasant. It dries quickly upon application. I plan to stick with this one.</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant from Bzzagent and this is my honest opinion about the product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used various stick deodorants in the past but i always had to wait for them to dry or another complain was that they never lasted long and required re application. I am very happy with the secret outlast clear gel deodorant as it is quick dying and last all day long. It does not leave white stains as most of the stick deodorants do. Another thing i like about it is that it did not discolor my under arm area which is a major plus. definitely the best deodorant in the market.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is a really good product it does go on clear and dries fast. It also is extremely lightweight feels as if your not wearing deodorant. After applying my armpit didn&#x27;t feel masked it could breathe through the deodorant i have never felt that way after applying deodorant. My only complaint is I need to apply this deodorant twice a day to feel and stay fresh. So to me it doesn&#x27;t stand up to the 48hrs of protection. I tried this product for free from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, my mother used to buy nothing but Secret Deodorant and bought it for both of us. She stopped when she said that the solid didn&#x27;t work for her. As an adult, I wear clear gel instead of solids but I find myself having to reapply them often. I received a free sample of this in the mail of this product and I was happy to try it again. I have to say that this product works so well. I sweat a lot and I am constantly moving and shaking and this product stays with you. The harder you work, the harder it seems to work for your body. I am a convert. I will probably spend half the money I do in deodorant because I won&#x27;t be constantly applying. Also, the way this dispenses helps you not to use too much. You can tell just how much you need and that&#x27;s all. I love this product and I&#x27;m so glad that I discovered it. If you ever thought you didn&#x27;t care for secret deodorant, it&#x27;s time to give them another chance.</li>
            <li> Thanks to secret I was able to try the Outlast clear gel deodorant for free. I will be using this deodorant from now on. It has a great smell to it and they also offer other ones. It dries super fast and you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it on your clothes. It lasts along time. It feels like you don&#x27;t even have any deodorant on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always leery about trying a new deodorant. I have very sensitive skin. Within a week of using a new product (and even sometimes with an old one), I break out in tiny, red, itchy spots on my underarms. It&#x27;s frustrating and embarrassing. I live in Florida. So, it&#x27;s not like I can go without odor protection. I&#x27;ve tried aluminum-free varieties and found they failed to keep me dry or clean smelling. Right away, I was happy with Secret Outlast Clear Gel because it didn&#x27;t leave a white residue on my clothes. No more having to put deodorant on AFTER I put on my shirt, or having to run over my clothes with a damp washcloth afterward. The gel smelled good (not overpowering) and dried very fast. I liked being able to control how much gel comes out, too. So far, a week and a half in, I have no itchiness or spots to report! Many thanks to Secret and BzzAgent.com for the free sample.</li>
            <li> MY NEW FAVORITE DEODORANT! I received a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel from Secret and loved it. It has an easily adjustable dial for pushing the gel out and even goes backwards in case you turn it too much. It goes on nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t make my armpits cold like other gels. I am not scared of staining my shirts, which is great since I wear a lot of black polos for work. I sweat easily, but with this deodorant I feel protected and don&#x27;t worry about smelling. It&#x27;s a must try in my book.</li>
            <li> Price might be more expensive than Walmart. I guess, I haven&#x27;t compared them. Smells so good for hours. First day I used it, there was a lady next to me and it was smelling like fresh, clean, I told my mom this lady smells good. After a while I noticed it was me.... hahaha. It was the first day of using it. I use this when I go out because I don&#x27;t want it to finish. I received my second one after 1 month but still have some. Container small and gel portion is even smaller.</li>
            <li> I really like this deo and I&#x27;m glad I could try it for free through bzzagent :D It goes on smooth and cool which I really liked. I would always just use the solid deo instead but I really do like the gels. Odor protection was spot on, it really worked for me, as for wetness protection, I might just sweat more than normal lol cause I still sweated :( however I didn&#x27;t smell! So I would buy this for sure, I know it works for me in the odor control department lol</li>
            <li> in the past, i have not been a fan of &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; deodorants. i always felt they went on &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; and it never felt like i was getting good protection... that all changed when i received this product to try compliments of Secret and bzzagent.  i was very impressed with this product. not only did it have a pleasant, but not overpowering scent, but it went on smooth, dried fast without any white marks, and didnt make me feel wet for putting on a gel, and kept me smelling fresh!. it dried so quickly, and really kept me feeling dry all day (even during days that were super hot!)</li>
            <li> Well, the best thing i can say is that it takes care of this big girls odor and sweat while working out or just being a mom. Sometimes i feel like i havent even had a shower about half way through my day. Not anymore. I am now fresh all day long and I thank Bzzagent for letting me try this product free . I hadn&#x27;t thought of secret since i was a teen. I was using another product and was highly unhappy with it but i thought it was me and not the product. If you havent given secret a try- try them!! I am very happy. #momhack #fatgirlgettingfit</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant. I received this through a BzzCampaign and tried it for close to a month and have really like it. It really does go on clear, dries fast and does not leave white marks! It always gave me the level of protection from wetness and odor that I was looking for, without the white marks. Also the clean scent has a very nice smell to it too.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product over solids.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from bzzagent to try and review this product, and I enjoyed it. I usually use the original solid from secret but I loved the clear gel. The scent was light and smelled fresh and clean like coming out of the shower and it lasts. I work in retail and am active through out my shift and the Secret Outlast Clear Gel keeps me dry. it goes on clear so I don&#x27;t have deodorant pits with white chalky stuff. It doesn&#x27;t get on my darks and I like that it dries fast. This is truly a great deodorant for sure.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed Secrets new product and found it to have a fresh and clean scent.  The scent is delicate, somewhat feminine and left me feeling fresh. It wasn&#x27;t very overwhelming like other deodorants.  While other gel-like deodorants are sticky, this one isn’t.  Unlike other deodorants, I found that this one gets used up pretty quickly; maybe it&#x27;s because it is in a gel-form. Without Secret and BzzAgent I would not have a new deodorant that I use routinely after the gym.</li>
            <li> Best in it&#x27;s class for dryness. I tried this product for free as a Bzzagent, and to tell you the truth I was a little skeptical of the claims. I work part-time in a printing plant and during the summer it is very hot in there and needless to say I sweat. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gell works better than anything I have ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t feel gummy when you put it on and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of gel deodorant and I stick to what I like my brand. I was given Secret Outlast completely clean to try for free from Bzz Agent. First thing I was like I hate the wet feel of gel and the white marks on my shirts.  I was impressed with Secret Outlast from the very 1st day. It dried quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about looking like I sweated through my shirt before I even left the house. This hormone change in my body got me sweating a little more than usual. This is a big deal to me as I do not have time to change shirts and start over in the morning. After getting everybody started on their day and myself.Time of the essence at my house in the mornings.  The smell is clean and refreshing reminds me of fresh laundry Very fresh but not overpowering or strong scented.  It lasts 48 hours for me so far as I shower each morning but I sure am happy to know that in an emergency I can count on its 48 hour protection and beyond. I am considering switching from my regular brand for this but if not definitely rotating.</li>
            <li> This is amazing at keeping up with you all day in keeping you fresh and dry! It glides on slightly wet and cool but dries within a few seconds and the scent is very &amp;#34;just showered&amp;#34; fresh which seems to linger throughout the day.  I was so impressed at how it didn&#x27;t leave any white residue or powdery marks on my clothes, which has always been a problem for me. I tend to wear a lot of dark colors and have been on the hunt for a great antiperspirant that truly didn&#x27;t leave their mark behind. As a Bzz Agent, I was able to try this product free of charge to test out how it stacks up to the competition and I have to say there is no competition!  Secret Outlast Clear Gel works incredible! I honestly have to say that this will no longer be a &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; for me.....will have to shout it from the mountaintops that this is a great product that works!</li>
            <li> I received this free as part of a promotion by the brand.  This stuff is great!  I was skeptical about trying a clear gel because of the slimy grossness of deodorants past, but Secret Clear Gel dries in a snap and kept me fresh and dry all day!  I was still going strong by the time I got ready for bed - even after work and two workouts. The smell is very clean, almost like freshly laundered clothes; but it isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.  I will definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> When I was contacted by BuzzAgent to try this product it was perfect timing!  I was sick &amp; tired of seeing white streaks leftover on my clothes from my existing deodorant.  Secret has always been a good brand in my opinion but the new clear gel product exceeded my expectations.  Glides on smooth &amp; cool and is dry quickly!  My typical morning is to hop out of the shower, do the normal hygiene routing - deodorant, hair, face, etc. then get dressed.  No wet sticky residue from the gel and no leftover reminders on my clothes at the end of the night!  Makes laundry much easier to not have to worry about those pesky white streaks!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a clear gel deodorant in about 15 years.  I hated the last one I tried.  They left you feeling wet and sticky under the arms.  I&#x27;m glad I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel because it totally made me change my mind.  It keeps you fresh all day long and it dries in just a.few seconds after putting it on.  I love how you can wear black and not worry about getting white streaks on your clothes.  I definitely will buy Secret Outlast Clear Gel again.  I&#x27;m glad that #BzzAgent allowed me to try it for free. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> wow! Okay, people. I used to hate gels so much! Like A LOTTT. Now I am in love. This stuff is not all slimy and wet and slippery like the ones I have tried in my past. The best part is...it really does last 48 hours... Also, it keeps my underarms smooth especially after shaving. I am amazed. Finally a gel that is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I got this product through a BzzAgent Campaign to try and guess what I put it to the test.  Yes 48 hours to see if the claim held up and I can say I did!  I also noticed that when I put it on after my shower/shaving there was NO BURNING!  Can&#x27;t ask for anything more than something that can meet the expectations and claims.</li>
            <li> I love how this one works and keeps me dry! The best thing is that it is clear and so there are no stains on my clothes.#GotItFree in a brand promotion.</li>
            <li> This deodorant slightly burns when applied immediately after shaving, but it really does OUTLAST the day. I&#x27;m a single mom, full time teacher, daily runner, and church attendee 3 times a week. I need my deodorant to outlast my day since I don&#x27;t get a break to reapply any. Secret Outlast Completely Clean gel not only doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes when I change three times a day, but it also keeps my pits as dry as the moment I first apply it in the morning. I don&#x27;t even need two clicks worth of deodorant. One click glides on in a thin layer and lasts throughout the day and daily routine of my busy life.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. I received a sample from buzzagent.com. When applying this product, it does go on wet, but just wait a minute or two and it is dry. The scent is not overpowering like some other deodorants. Will give you 48  hour protection. Will NOT leave white marks on your clothes either. Very affordable. You have the option, to give yourself a little or a lot, just my turning the bottom of the product. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Got to try this clear gel for free as a member of Bzz Agent. Giving it 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No scent overloading - for everyone to know you are wearing a deodorant!! yikes&lt;br /&gt;2. great value for money&lt;br /&gt;3. easy to use&lt;br /&gt;4. no stains&lt;br /&gt;5. no sticky feeling&lt;br /&gt;6. keeps you dry&lt;br /&gt;will surely buy and definitely recommend&lt;br /&gt;happy bzzzing</li>
            <li> I got this product through bzzagent.  Cheap packaging ended up being broken when it arrived.  The bottom wheel would not turn and push out the deodorant properly.  Luckily it&#x27;s a liquid so I just shook it a bit and I was able to use it without too much trouble.  But still disappointed it was broken.    The deodorant itself works well, no streaks left behind on clothes and it gets me through my workouts.  However, it IS a strong product, and if you have sensitive skin or if you wax/epilate, it definitely can burn when you put it on.  I would not recommend this product for those with sensitive skin like myself.    The scent is okay, but I prefer a sweeter smelling deodorant.  This one reminds me more of a men&#x27;s deodorant, and I definitely prefer something more fruity or floral.    Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel product.  It&#x27;s great to use for any situation, goes on great and washes off easily at the end of the day.  I love something that doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and you don&#x27;t have to have the worry of it not working.  Secret is one I definitely recommend and will continue to use for a long time!!</li>
