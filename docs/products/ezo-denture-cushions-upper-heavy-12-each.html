            <li>They are very forgiving and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for loose dentures.</li>
            <li>If I used the complete cushion I would not be able to remove the plate.  </li>
            <li>They work great no gooey mess run under hot water and it molds right to the denture.</li>
            <li>I just got my first plate</li>
            <li>I searched every store in my vicinity and most only carried the lowers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them daily for the past 2 months &amp; am very happy.</li>
            <li>It has never failed.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what i need.</li>
            <li>I used to buy them at Meijer, but for the last couple of years I have not been able to find them in any store.  </li>
            <li>This product is becoming more and more difficult to obtain, but hopefully Amazon will continue to stock them.  </li>
            <li>The secret is to spend time fitting them to meet your own need.</li>
            <li>I have used them for years as they make my dentures fit properly and prevent sore gums and mouth.  </li>
            <li>very \\&quot;neat.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>When we could not get any lowere for a spell was very worried.  </li>
            <li>Makes denture fit properly.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>When it wasn&#x27;t available for a while, she had me searching high and low for these.</li>
            <li>I use Ezo denture cushions to keep my lower teeth comfortable when playing my clarinet for a long time.</li>
            <li>Did not work in her particular circumstance.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I had built up a stash pile of them that lasted me until I finally found them online.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this item, 100%.  </li>
            <li>Made it possible for someone that I care about to be able to wear their dentures after a long illness when they had lost a lot of weight.  </li>
            <li>I have a Prosthetic plate with metal snapping into metal and cannot use other material available.  </li>
            <li>Some dentists required a complete mouth exam &amp; xrays before they&#x27;d do anything!</li>
            <li>these are the only things i have found to fit my loose dentures.</li>
            <li>I also received them quickly and well below the price I paid at other stores..</li>
            <li>I see that many people are having a hard time finding them.</li>
            <li>These wax based cushions really hold on and cushion the upper gum line as advertised.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have a sensitive gag reflex.</li>
            <li>My Canadian denturist just happened to email me &amp; I told him about this product &amp; he endorsed it completely.</li>
            <li>My 92 year old mom swears by them.</li>
            <li>Product way too big for my denture and had to cut off too much.  </li>
            <li>My mother has tried every other denture cushion and will not use anything else -- especially the cheap imitations from China.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to dentures as just had a temporary upper put in end September.</li>
            <li>I find the EZO Denture pads softer, cleaner, more pliable and without the sticky mess of other pads.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t seem as fresh as previous purchase</li>
            <li>I hope they never stop manufacturing these because no other cushions will do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard Ezo are great for people who have trouble with dentures slipping or when dentures are uncomfortable in the mouth.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve heard Ezo are great for people who have trouble with dentures slipping or when dentures are uncomfortable in the mouth.</li>
            <li> At first they were thick with a coating of wax that molded to your gums.</li>
            <li> My denturist added a soft liner in October before we came down to Florida for 6 months.</li>
            <li> Tried other ones but don&#x27;t work  the same so always went back to ezo for comfort</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom as she mentioned that it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;She really likes them.</li>
            <li> For some unknown reason, my local WalMart, CVS, Rite-Aide, etc.</li>
            <li> I have looked in many stores as this is the only product she likes for her dentures, however, they are impossible to find in stores now.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products, but they either don&#x27;t adhere properly, leave a taste, or are too bulky.  </li>
            <li> Have never used any other  similar product.</li>
            <li> no after taste left like the other &amp;#34;cut to fit&amp;#34; styles.</li>
            <li> I have used Ezo Denture Cushions for a very long time .</li>
            <li> Bought for elderly person with loose denture problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll mess up my denture &amp; not be able to get it off again.</li>
            <li> I received these in 2 days &amp; it came with 72 upper heavy cushions.</li>
            <li> I snip off an inch-long piece of Ezo and fold it over my lower center teeth.</li>
            <li> She tried a couple of other brands</li>
            <li> and they are very loose now that the swelling is going down.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and don&#x27;t have a bad taste.</li>
            <li> Heavy lower and Ezp Heavy Upper for at least fifteen years and will not try anything after all these years.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;keeps dentures tight  </li>
            <li> Keeps your denture tight and no ooze to deal with.</li>
            <li> I still use a little polident with them though.</li>
            <li> Never softened during entire day and just made things worse.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> My denture was starting to get sloppy</li>
            <li> Lately all they are is a mesh that you can see right through and they seem to have a salty/metallic taste to them that is exacerbating my asthma/emphysema so badly that I can&#x27;t do anything anymore.</li>
            <li> These products are hard to find in brick/mortar stores.</li>
            <li> Thick as cardboard box material.</li>
            <li> They are NO good.  </li>
            <li> Creams are messy and taste bad, this&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li> This product was very hard to find since they where sold out everywhere, but my Dad loves them and now he has a year supply!</li>
            <li> Sadly they don&#x27;t work for my problem dentures.  </li>
            <li> Then when my clarinet is in my mouth, my teeth aren&#x27;t cutting into my skin.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to mould.</li>
            <li> All I hear from them is about how bad this product is.</li>
            <li> Need them badly....</li>
            <li> Wish they did as I truly hate the goop.  :(</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this product to my worst enemy.  </li>

            <li> My Mother has had to depend on my sisters&#x27; use of the Amazon.com before this order of mine for her because I did not have a access or the know-how to work a computer before this order. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for loose dentures. I received them in mint condition. I also received them quickly and well below the price I paid at other stores.. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Have been using ezo pads for many years. At first they were thick with a coating of wax that molded to your gums. Lately all they are is a mesh that you can see right through and they seem to have a salty/metallic taste to them that is exacerbating my asthma/emphysema so badly that I can&#x27;t do anything anymore. I&#x27;ve had it with ezo, I won&#x27;t purchase them anymore.</li>
            <li> I just got my first plate and they are very loose now that the swelling is going down. I actually have to use the 2 pads: 1 Ezo and 1 of another brand.  After I get these relined I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that.</li>
            <li> For some unknown reason, my local WalMart, CVS, Rite-Aide, etc. do not carry the EZO Uppers Cushions.  They have the lower cushions, but not the upper.  For me, the only way to get the uppers is to order them on-line.  This is the best deal out there!  The product was delivered on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Ezos has the best line of denture cushions. The cushion and grip-ability properties are unsurpassed. These wax based cushions really hold on and cushion the upper gum line as advertised.</li>
            <li> Thick as cardboard box material. Very difficult to mould. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have a sensitive gag reflex. Stick to Sea Bond.</li>
            <li> These products are hard to find in brick/mortar stores. They are much better than those available. They are also durable and don&#x27;t have to  be changed every day, which is also a money saver. The delivery was as promised.</li>
            <li> Made it possible for someone that I care about to be able to wear their dentures after a long illness when they had lost a lot of weight.  Helped them to begin eating again and gaining streingth</li>
            <li> They work great no gooey mess run under hot water and it molds right to the denture. You can also put them in with your denture cup with the cleaner and refresh them for another use.</li>
            <li> I have used EZO pads for years. I used to purchase them in stores such as K-Mart, Walmart and Target. I can no longer find them. Can anyone explain why?    I found them as low as $2.47per package in WalMart.    I find the EZO Denture pads softer, cleaner, more pliable and without the sticky mess of other pads.    Earl K Merrow</li>
            <li> I searched every store in my vicinity and most only carried the lowers&lt;br /&gt;I was so glad to see that it was so easy to go online a order this product&lt;br /&gt;I recomend using amazon.com for searching and I totally recomend ezo as&lt;br /&gt;the best denture produt I have tried. Creams are messy and taste bad, this&lt;br /&gt;is my super choice</li>
            <li> These work real well am so glad to have found them. They are not carried by Walmart or target so online I went and there they were.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to dentures as just had a temporary upper put in end September. My denturist added a soft liner in October before we came down to Florida for 6 months. He told me I&#x27;d need a reline in January &amp; he said probably would be around $100cdn. I started calling around &amp; found that $200+ was more like it. Some dentists required a complete mouth exam &amp; xrays before they&#x27;d do anything! What can I say??? My denture was starting to get sloppy so turning to Amazon I discovered these cushions. I figured for $22 &amp; Prime shipping I had nothing to lose. I received these in 2 days &amp; it came with 72 upper heavy cushions. Very easy to put in ... just follow instructions. They work like a charm. I&#x27;ve been using them daily for the past 2 months &amp; am very happy. When away from home just rinse it off &amp; re-insert. My Canadian denturist just happened to email me &amp; I told him about this product &amp; he endorsed it completely. I will though be getting my PERMANENT upper plate when I return home in the spring.</li>
            <li> For my purpose the cushions are good.  I have a Prosthetic plate with metal snapping into metal and cannot use other material available.  If I used the complete cushion I would not be able to remove the plate.  I cut the cushion into small pieces, mold it into place with hot water and then snap it in.  The local stores use to carry them but over the years the only place to buy them is on the internet.</li>
            <li> My mother swears by these things. I have looked in many stores as this is the only product she likes for her dentures, however, they are impossible to find in stores now. She was excited to get them in a six-pack...she&#x27;s happy...I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Have used for many years and they are better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem as fresh as previous purchase</li>
            <li> These are the best thing I have found. I do not like to use the gel type ..your eating and swallowing that stuff all the time. I do not need that!! These you cut to fit your own dentures and thats it.. Use warm water to help mold them to your denture and put them in. If you need to take them out and trim some more you can. They are very forgiving and easy to use. I do not use anything with them.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my order and will be ordering from Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> These cushions work great makes dentures fit and feel great&lt;br /&gt;keeps dentures tight  I will be ordering more in the futher</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I could obtain this product through Amazon.com.  I have used them for years as they make my dentures fit properly and prevent sore gums and mouth.  I have tried other products, but they either don&#x27;t adhere properly, leave a taste, or are too bulky.  This product is becoming more and more difficult to obtain, but hopefully Amazon will continue to stock them.  They work great for me!</li>
            <li> I have tried many adhesives and cushions.  EZO Cushions are by far the best on the market.  The price is OUTSTANDING and I recommend them highly.  Will be reordering this product.  It has never failed.  Best thing..it&#x27;s not gooey...very \\&quot;neat.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Bought for elderly person with loose denture problems.  This did nothing to help.  Never softened during entire day and just made things worse.</li>
            <li> Always use them, they work the best of all. Tried other ones but don&#x27;t work  the same so always went back to ezo for comfort</li>
            <li> I have tried to use these but they all land in the garbage. They are NO good.  I will stick to my adhesive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this product to my worst enemy.  Purchased them for my grandparents.  All I hear from them is about how bad this product is.</li>
            <li> My 92 year old mom swears by them. They were unavailable im stores for a while glad we can purchase online</li>
            <li> very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Ok....but could be better.</li>
            <li> Keeps your denture tight and no ooze to deal with. Best denture product on the market once you try it you&#x27;ll never go back to paste or powders to hold dentures in place.</li>
            <li> great for uppers lowers pop loose</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mother. Did not work in her particular circumstance.  Have used the lower cushions with better results.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom.  No other good replacements on the market.  They fit her well, and are comfortable on her dentures.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Eso Heavy lower and Ezp Heavy Upper for at least fifteen years and will not try anything after all these years.  She tried a couple of other brands but, they dfid not cut the mustard.  When we could not get any lowere for a spell was very worried.  Keep manufacturing</li>
            <li> I like everything about this product. Exactly what i need. Makes denture fit properly. Have never used any other  similar product.</li>
            <li> Wife loves these thicker pads.  Work as well or better than anything she has ever used before, so we recommend!</li>
            <li> My mother has tried every other denture cushion and will not use anything else -- especially the cheap imitations from China. Nothing compares with this product. She has used it for over 40 years. When it wasn&#x27;t available for a while, she had me searching high and low for these. We were so happy when they were once again available. I hope they never stop manufacturing these because no other cushions will do.</li>
            <li> I have used Ezo Denture Cushions for a very long time . They are the best denture cusions I prefer them to all other products. They are easy to use and don&#x27;t have a bad taste. I hope you will give them a try if you need a denture liner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and the stores stopped stocking it a couple of years ago. Amazon is the only place I could find them. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Got them for my mom. She loves them, but can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used these many times, and have found them to be very helpful, in keeping your upper Dentures nice and snug. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and don&#x27;t know what I would do without them.  I used to buy them at Meijer, but for the last couple of years I have not been able to find them in any store.  Luckily, I had built up a stash pile of them that lasted me until I finally found them online.  Thanks goodness I found them.  I just can&#x27;t handle anything else but these EZO cushions.  I used them for my upper dentures.  I recently got lower dentures but have not tried them for my lower ones yet; however, I do plan on it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have both had radiation therapy on our throats (from 2 different diseases) and had our teeth removed because it&#x27;s said that the gums will not heal with teeth in place. The ezo cushions are better than anything I&#x27;ve tried to cushion the gums.</li>
            <li> Excellent item,  Great Price I really love it.  I highly recommend purchasing this item, 100%.  5 Star item Buy It</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom as she mentioned that it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;She really likes them.</li>
            <li> Sadly they don&#x27;t work for my problem dentures.  Wish they did as I truly hate the goop.  :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and totally depend on them....and then suddenly I couldn&#x27;t find them in stock at any stores anymore.  I even ran into the problem of having problems of finding them online!  I was so glad to find them &amp;#34;in stock&amp;#34; and at such a great price.</li>
            <li> I pray that they don&#x27;t EVER stop making these, by far the best nothing else compares or comes even close</li>
            <li> This product was very hard to find since they where sold out everywhere, but my Dad loves them and now he has a year supply!</li>
            <li> Could not find this product anyplace.  Have used this product for years and I love it.  This is the only place that I could get it.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. Just wish they still made the darn things. Bought a reliner kit but I haven&#x27;t used it yet. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll mess up my denture &amp; not be able to get it off again. These liners were terrific.</li>
            <li> I use Ezo denture cushions to keep my lower teeth comfortable when playing my clarinet for a long time. I snip off an inch-long piece of Ezo and fold it over my lower center teeth. Then when my clarinet is in my mouth, my teeth aren&#x27;t cutting into my skin. It works great. I see that many people are having a hard time finding them. I buy them from Walgreens, either in the store or at Walgreens.com. So if Amazon doesn&#x27;t have them some time, that&#x27;s another place to check. I&#x27;ve heard Ezo are great for people who have trouble with dentures slipping or when dentures are uncomfortable in the mouth.</li>
            <li> felt good in my mouth</li>
            <li> I have been using EZO denture cushions for years and cannot find in stores or on line.  Need them badly....Help!!</li>
            <li> these are the only things i have found to fit my loose dentures. cant find anywhere now except amazon. no after taste left like the other &amp;#34;cut to fit&amp;#34; styles. good price also.</li>
            <li> The secret is to spend time fitting them to meet your own need. They fit wonderfully now. I still use a little polident with them though.</li>
            <li> Product way too big for my denture and had to cut off too much.  Did not hold.</li>
            <li> These are very comfortable &amp; make my teethe hold all day. I recommend these for anyone who has dentures</li>
            <li> Meted all expectations</li>
            <li> the only problem is the amount I had to buy, I guess I will have enough for the rest of my life.</li>
