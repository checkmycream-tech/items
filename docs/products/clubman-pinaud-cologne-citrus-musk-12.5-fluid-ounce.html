            <li>a mild pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>Dirt cheap and smells good - what&#x27;s not to love?&#x27;</li>
            <li>An ear massage that left me in a happy, happy place.  </li>
            <li>The others are nice but way to strong smelling.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing....</li>
            <li>It is OK.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, it&#x27;s an ok product for the value.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>It is more musky than citrus-y in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awaken one with a spirited lime essence and then receeds&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
            <li>well pleased.</li>
            <li>Love the sent Will order again.</li>
            <li>but this is in the top 2 for me.</li>
            <li>Never tried this before, Glad</li>
            <li>This was ok.</li>
            <li>I love lime aftershave, and based upon reviews thought I would give this a shot.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t smell like you are trying to get laid, you will just smell confident that you will.</li>
            <li>Very clean refreshing citrus scent.</li>
            <li>When it  settles in and if I had to describe it would be like it has a classic hint of a very mild, fine pipe tobacco ( in a very good way</li>
            <li>I enjoy most of the Clubman scents and this is one of if not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>- Say it smells clean, bright, fresh, like summer....</li>
            <li>Quickly becoming a Clubman Pinaud fan.  </li>
            <li>It smells very clean and light, not what I consider an &amp;#34;evening&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>any scent that might be there disappears very quickly.</li>
            <li>I love all the clubman products, This is a great cologne last but not to strong.</li>
            <li>but I like it as it is very mild.</li>
            <li>It has a great citrus lime scent that settles into a soft, light musk.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as cologne, so body splash is how I would describe it.</li>
            <li>They do fade as the day progresses so that they are not overly strong.</li>
            <li>Some will find the flowery scent too strong....</li>
            <li>The Citrus musk has a great fresh lime scent with a touch of the old school barber shop that Pinaud is famous for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first musk scent that my girlfriend has ever liked.  </li>
            <li>Great for daily wear, and easy on the skin after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fresh lime scent and use it as a body splash after my shower.</li>
            <li>I have several or almost all the clubman aftershaves and this is a great one to add to the rotation.</li>
            <li>the Citrus Musk - light, not offensive, with hints of lime and orange/bergamot.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin, leaves me invigorated after my morning shaves, and has the smell of a professional.  </li>
            <li>This is right up there with clubman&#x27;s club royale which they dont make any more.</li>
            <li>Great price,  fresh and clean sweet citrus settling back into a comfortable top end musk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many Pinaud products and I like this one very much.  </li>
            <li>Have a lot of various cologne&#x27;s that I wear - I get more people saying nice things about this one - esp women</li>
            <li>The Musk goes on strong, tightens and sooths a freshly shaved face</li>
            <li>You can slash on liberally, the scent is strong at first and feels crisp and cool going on smelling mostly like citrus.</li>
            <li>I like this more thanks</li>
            <li>Too sweet, like lime candy.</li>
            <li>This has such a pleasant and fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Clubman delivered exactly the fresh feel and light aroma described in the description.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong, and very invigorating after shaving</li>
            <li>it is very manly without being strong or heady.</li>
            <li>Great citrus lime scent and drys down to a powdery fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Get positive comments every time I&#x27;m wearing this, smells fantastic not to overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>My wife like this one much better than clubman or other more classic products, I like most all of the Pinaud products</li>
            <li>Feels great after a shave and is soothing with little burn.</li>
            <li>just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, give it a try</li>
            <li>Smells nice enough</li>
            <li>It has a very clean, masculine scent with citrus tones throughout.</li>
            <li>Moreover, the price was right</li>
            <li>The lime is prominent when I first apply then fades to just a good clean smell that last longer than some other aftershaves.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last very long, but has a wonderful classic scent.</li>
            <li>but my wife seems to think its nice the way it is as she can only really smell it when she leans in</li>
            <li>Citrus Musk is a little more refreshing on hot spring or summer day in my opinion.</li>
            <li>the only problem was one of my bottles had a hole in the top of it.</li>
            <li>How they actually captured citrus and musk in the same scent is a mystery, but they did it nicely!  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of clubman products and this one did not quite measure up to most of the others.</li>
            <li>I felt like i smelled like a pez dispenser for the first hour</li>
            <li>Club Royale was my favorite and this is a close second.</li>
            <li>Thanks clubmman!</li>
            <li>I dismissed the negative reviews as greatly outweighed and therefore outliers.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and I would encourage anyone who likes a citrus cologne to at least try it.</li>
            <li>Hot towels.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased so far 3 Clubman Pinaud brand aftershaves and enjoy them all.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased - smells fresh and clean - strong initial scent soon fades to more subtle hints of citrus that are quite enjoyable and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and it instantly cools the skin after a shave.</li>
            <li>Good quality long lasting</li>
            <li>Got the best shave ever from a Russian woman who owns a small shop in Scottdale, near Decatur, Georgia.  </li>
            <li>The Clubman Citrus Musk arrived quickly (Prime 2 day shipping) and smells fantastic and was just as I expected.</li>
            <li>If only the scent was a little more long lasting I would give it a perfect 5.</li>
            <li>As for the musk, most are very heavy smelling, this cologne has a much lighter musk scent which is fantastic....</li>
            <li>Attractive odor, not long lasting, very short life on person.</li>
            <li>However it really does not seem to smell after being put on and</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the Lime option as much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and is a must have!</li>
            <li>Stops weepers and tightens skin without drying face too much.  </li>
            <li>Extremely light citrus and musk scent over the background of the standard Clubman scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Not my favorite smell but its fresh enough to use out of the shower and its lasting.  </li>
            <li>Really pleasent- floral and citrusy.</li>
            <li>Clean scent at low price.</li>
            <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t last all that long, but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li>I have worn Clubman aftershave, Lilac Veg, club man classic vanilla and Clubman speacial reserve and clubman club royale.</li>
            <li>Smells gret my boyfriend loves the nostalgic barber shop scent and it is also a great value, very inexpensive to buy</li>
            <li>I took a chance buying this and was very pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li>Not a favorite but good enough.</li>
            <li>Traditional and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a quality product and I&#x27;m glad I found a few bottles.</li>
            <li>The classic Clubman is great, I hated the Vegetal, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am new to DE shaving and making my rounds and trying all of the Pinaud products.</li>
            <li>Your nose will quickly assimilate the scent as non threatening and you won&#x27;t notice it for very long after you apply it.  </li>
            <li>My gf really likes the way it smells, so a definite plus.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to hold my adult son over on cologne until I could give him the &#x27;nicer&#x27; one I got him for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Like this scent, soft not overpowering</li>
            <li>yet there is a soft lingering scent that lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>Each reminds me of the old fashion barbershop experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>you want the smell of old barbershop shaving, get Clubman Pinaud</li>
            <li>Love the subtle, masculine, citrus aroma.  </li>
            <li>Not a second less or a second more.</li>
            <li>Decent lasting power.  </li>
            <li>This is a light and airy masculine cologne which refreshed throughout the day and was noticed but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes most of the powerful scent fades away leaving a light musk scent so don&#x27;t be afraid to use a lot.</li>
            <li>A little burn in spots with razor-burn but quickly turns to a soothing effect.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes the Bayrum is a bit heavy particular on hot or humid days.</li>
            <li>I enjoy other Clubman scents and so I expected to like this scent as well.</li>
            <li>and I like citrus scents in general.</li>
            <li>This is the only clubman scent my wife says does not make me smell like an old man.</li>
            <li>Same scent that will bring back the old barber shop memories.</li>

            <li> the Citrus Musk - light, not offensive, with hints of lime and orange/bergamot.  </li>
            <li> It feels good on the skin, leaves me invigorated after my morning shaves, and has the smell of a professional.  </li>
            <li> This is right up there with clubman&#x27;s club royale which they dont make any more.</li>
            <li> Great price,  fresh and clean sweet citrus settling back into a comfortable top end musk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many Pinaud products and I like this one very much.  </li>
            <li> Have a lot of various cologne&#x27;s that I wear - I get more people saying nice things about this one - esp women</li>
            <li> The Musk goes on strong, tightens and sooths a freshly shaved face</li>
            <li> You can slash on liberally, the scent is strong at first and feels crisp and cool going on smelling mostly like citrus.</li>
            <li> I like this more thanks</li>
            <li> Too sweet, like lime candy.</li>
            <li> This has such a pleasant and fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Clubman delivered exactly the fresh feel and light aroma described in the description.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong, and very invigorating after shaving</li>
            <li> it is very manly without being strong or heady.</li>
            <li> Great citrus lime scent and drys down to a powdery fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Get positive comments every time I&#x27;m wearing this, smells fantastic not to overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> My wife like this one much better than clubman or other more classic products, I like most all of the Pinaud products</li>
            <li> Feels great after a shave and is soothing with little burn.</li>
            <li> just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, give it a try</li>
            <li> Smells nice enough</li>
            <li> It has a very clean, masculine scent with citrus tones throughout.</li>
            <li> Moreover, the price was right</li>
            <li> The lime is prominent when I first apply then fades to just a good clean smell that last longer than some other aftershaves.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long, but has a wonderful classic scent.</li>
            <li> but my wife seems to think its nice the way it is as she can only really smell it when she leans in</li>
            <li> Citrus Musk is a little more refreshing on hot spring or summer day in my opinion.</li>
            <li> the only problem was one of my bottles had a hole in the top of it.</li>
            <li> How they actually captured citrus and musk in the same scent is a mystery, but they did it nicely!  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of clubman products and this one did not quite measure up to most of the others.</li>
            <li> I felt like i smelled like a pez dispenser for the first hour</li>
            <li> Club Royale was my favorite and this is a close second.</li>
            <li> Thanks clubmman!</li>
            <li> I dismissed the negative reviews as greatly outweighed and therefore outliers.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would encourage anyone who likes a citrus cologne to at least try it.</li>
            <li> Hot towels.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased so far 3 Clubman Pinaud brand aftershaves and enjoy them all.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased - smells fresh and clean - strong initial scent soon fades to more subtle hints of citrus that are quite enjoyable and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong and it instantly cools the skin after a shave.</li>
            <li> Good quality long lasting</li>
            <li> Got the best shave ever from a Russian woman who owns a small shop in Scottdale, near Decatur, Georgia.  </li>
            <li> The Clubman Citrus Musk arrived quickly (Prime 2 day shipping) and smells fantastic and was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> If only the scent was a little more long lasting I would give it a perfect 5.</li>
            <li> As for the musk, most are very heavy smelling, this cologne has a much lighter musk scent which is fantastic....</li>
            <li> Attractive odor, not long lasting, very short life on person.</li>
            <li> However it really does not seem to smell after being put on and</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the Lime option as much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and is a must have!</li>
            <li> Stops weepers and tightens skin without drying face too much.  </li>
            <li> Extremely light citrus and musk scent over the background of the standard Clubman scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Not my favorite smell but its fresh enough to use out of the shower and its lasting.  </li>
            <li> Really pleasent- floral and citrusy.</li>
            <li> Clean scent at low price.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last all that long, but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> I have worn Clubman aftershave, Lilac Veg, club man classic vanilla and Clubman speacial reserve and clubman club royale.</li>
            <li> Smells gret my boyfriend loves the nostalgic barber shop scent and it is also a great value, very inexpensive to buy</li>
            <li> I took a chance buying this and was very pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li> Not a favorite but good enough.</li>
            <li> Traditional and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a quality product and I&#x27;m glad I found a few bottles.</li>
            <li> The classic Clubman is great, I hated the Vegetal, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and making my rounds and trying all of the Pinaud products.</li>
            <li> Your nose will quickly assimilate the scent as non threatening and you won&#x27;t notice it for very long after you apply it.  </li>
            <li> My gf really likes the way it smells, so a definite plus.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to hold my adult son over on cologne until I could give him the &#x27;nicer&#x27; one I got him for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Like this scent, soft not overpowering</li>
            <li> yet there is a soft lingering scent that lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> Each reminds me of the old fashion barbershop experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> you want the smell of old barbershop shaving, get Clubman Pinaud</li>
            <li> Love the subtle, masculine, citrus aroma.  </li>
            <li> Not a second less or a second more.</li>
            <li> Decent lasting power.  </li>
            <li> This is a light and airy masculine cologne which refreshed throughout the day and was noticed but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes most of the powerful scent fades away leaving a light musk scent so don&#x27;t be afraid to use a lot.</li>
            <li> A little burn in spots with razor-burn but quickly turns to a soothing effect.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the Bayrum is a bit heavy particular on hot or humid days.</li>
            <li> I enjoy other Clubman scents and so I expected to like this scent as well.</li>
            <li> and I like citrus scents in general.</li>
            <li> This is the only clubman scent my wife says does not make me smell like an old man.</li>
            <li> Same scent that will bring back the old barber shop memories.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely one of my long time favorites.  </li>
            <li> Not bad but not great either.  </li>
            <li> But unfortunately it smells cheap &amp; my wife says it gives her a headache.</li>
            <li> Same for the Lime Sec!</li>
            <li> Not very much musk.</li>
            <li> and I finally broke down to buy myself a bottle of it.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way in the place of traditional cologne.</li>
            <li> I occasionally put about half of this inside a spray bottle as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Pinaud fragrances that were WAY overpowering, this on the other hand is different.  </li>
            <li> Everyone will have a little different experience.</li>
            <li> I would actually prefer if the scent was a little stronger</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really my thing.</li>
            <li> The fitness center where I work out provides this Citrus Musk their locker room.  </li>
            <li> No real musk, no real citrus.</li>
            <li> I decided that I was due for a change and bought the Clubman Citrus Musk instead.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, it is not an over powering smell that will fill a room.  </li>
            <li> basically it won&#x27;t give you a headache by the end of the day like some other musks do.</li>
            <li> Feels like a bit less alcohol than other Pinaud products as well.  </li>
            <li> The smell lasts, on average, 3-5 hours for myself.</li>
            <li> Like an old fashioned barber shop and the scent is not heavy enough to become annoying.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a while but tones down quite a bit in about an hour.</li>
            <li> F. Trumpers Lime Skin food immediately after shaving then splash on the Citrus musk after the Trumpers drys down.</li>
            <li> It stings when it hits the face a little after shaving.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in a few days and I have used it ever since.</li>
            <li> I put a few dashes in my hands after drying off from a shower and rub it on my chest and neck.</li>
            <li> I usually use  Clubman Bay Rum as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> She finished up with this scent, which is surprisingly subtle for something called &amp;#34;musk&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The musk is very subtle and the lime is at the forefront.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought expensive aftershaves and never got compliments on them.  </li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to, not for the faint of heart as it does sting, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Cold towels.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> you are a fan of lime, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

            <li> Perfectly unisex for haircuts.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.It has a Great Nice Lime smell.Asa you know musk works to each body differently.So it is awesome on me.Everyone will have a little different experience.It is refreshing....</li>
            <li> I usually use  Clubman Bay Rum as an aftershave. I decided that I was due for a change and bought the Clubman Citrus Musk instead. It arrived in a few days and I have used it ever since. It is OK. Nice colour and feels good after being applied. However it really does not seem to smell after being put on and any scent that might be there disappears very quickly. It might be that my nose is at fault but I am going back to Bay Rum after I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> Same as it was 50 years ago. I will buy it again.  All of their products are great. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I like this more thanks I thought I would. Very clean refreshing citrus scent. Not very much musk. Feels great after a shave and is soothing with little burn. It&#x27;s possible to use this as a body splash and not offend your co-workers. Lasts a while but tones down quite a bit in about an hour.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time! the only problem was one of my bottles had a hole in the top of it. It was leaking. However, it did not spoil the package because of how well it was packed.</li>
            <li> This has a very nice smell to it. It&#x27;s not too strong and it instantly cools the skin after a shave. I think the name is misleading because this is not a cologne. It is an after shave. That&#x27;s why I put it on after I shave. Not a second less or a second more. Immediately after I shave is when I apply this.... What was I saying? Oh yeah, it&#x27;s an ok product for the value.</li>
            <li> Very good product and worth the price</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It is light and great and have since bought some for my brother.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and smells awesome! I wish they sold this by the case. I didn&#x27;t like the Lime option as much.</li>
            <li> I enjoy other Clubman scents and so I expected to like this scent as well. Moreover, the price was right and I like citrus scents in general. But unfortunately it smells cheap &amp; my wife says it gives her a headache. I will not buy this scent again.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered 3 of these. I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to my cart when I hit the Buy Now button. Because the items are flammable you can&#x27;t return the unopened containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, it&#x27;s really a personal preference. It is more musky than citrus-y in my opinion. It&#x27;s not really my thing. I wear it once a week to 2 weeks just to change things up but it isn&#x27;t one of my favorites. My girlfriend said &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;. I agree with her.</li>
            <li> I enjoy most of the Clubman scents and this is one of if not my favorite.  Just a great manly scent from days gone by.  My gf really likes the way it smells, so a definite plus.  Not too strong, and very invigorating after shaving</li>
            <li> Good quality long lasting</li>
            <li> Great summer scent.  Works great as a splash and aftershave.  Where had this stuff been all my life?  I&#x27;ve bought expensive aftershaves and never got compliments on them.  This one gets compliments every time!  Had my brother try it and he bought it the same day.  Same for the Lime Sec!</li>
            <li> Clubman delivered exactly the fresh feel and light aroma described in the description.  Like an old fashioned barber shop and the scent is not heavy enough to become annoying.  Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> How they actually captured citrus and musk in the same scent is a mystery, but they did it nicely!  This is a great smelling cologne.  Like other reviewers have said, it is not an over powering smell that will fill a room.  Your nose will quickly assimilate the scent as non threatening and you won&#x27;t notice it for very long after you apply it.  I would say if you are a fan of the Clubman Pinaud products, this is a must have.</li>
            <li> What a great fresh aroma.  It&#x27;s awaken one with a spirited lime essence and then receeds&lt;br /&gt;to a mild pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love all the clubman products, This is a great cologne last but not to strong. Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Very well pleased. Love the sent Will order again.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and making my rounds and trying all of the Pinaud products. I find I like this Citrus Musk. I was scared because if the Musk in the title but I like it as it is very mild. The lime is prominent when I first apply then fades to just a good clean smell that last longer than some other aftershaves. When it  settles in and if I had to describe it would be like it has a classic hint of a very mild, fine pipe tobacco ( in a very good way and I am a non smoker). Just smells GOOD!  My wife like this one much better than clubman or other more classic products, I like most all of the Pinaud products but this is in the top 2 for me. This Citrus Musk is on my permanent rotation. Highly recommended and is a must have!</li>
            <li> Never tried this before, Glad I did. Gives a nice and refreshing feeling on the skin and had a great scent.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a nice potent citrus blend of scents.  A little bit goes a long way in the place of traditional cologne.</li>
            <li> Attractive odor, not long lasting, very short life on person. Would probaby buy this again. Not a favorite but good enough.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh lime scent and use it as a body splash after my shower. It&#x27;s not as strong as cologne, so body splash is how I would describe it. I put a few dashes in my hands after drying off from a shower and rub it on my chest and neck. Seems to last throughout the day...I can smell it on my t-shirt when I go to bed after work.</li>
            <li> This was ok. I am a big fan of clubman products and this one did not quite measure up to most of the others. I felt like i smelled like a pez dispenser for the first hour i wore it but it mellows out to be acceptable.</li>
            <li> Traditional and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Too sweet, like lime candy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many Pinaud products and I like this one very much.  Great citrus lime scent and drys down to a powdery fresh scent.  Decent lasting power.  It stings when it hits the face a little after shaving.  So now I use George. F. Trumpers Lime Skin food immediately after shaving then splash on the Citrus musk after the Trumpers drys down. The Citrus musk has a great fresh lime scent with a touch of the old school barber shop that Pinaud is famous for.  I&#x27;ll keep this one in my regular rotation.</li>
            <li> Have a lot of various cologne&#x27;s that I wear - I get more people saying nice things about this one - esp women - Say it smells clean, bright, fresh, like summer....Great product lasts well....</li>
            <li> This has such a pleasant and fresh fragrance.  I freshen up with it all day and always feel and smell like I just stepped out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Love the subtle, masculine, citrus aroma.  This goes on great after a close shave with a safety razor.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> outstanding service great product and love the easyness of use and smell just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great price,  fresh and clean sweet citrus settling back into a comfortable top end musk. This is a light and airy masculine cologne which refreshed throughout the day and was noticed but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Very pleased - smells fresh and clean - strong initial scent soon fades to more subtle hints of citrus that are quite enjoyable and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Dirt cheap and smells good - what&#x27;s not to love?&#x27; I bought it to hold my adult son over on cologne until I could give him the &#x27;nicer&#x27; one I got him for Christmas. If he doesn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;m putting it in the wax warmer for a home fragrance. If you like lime with a hint of musk undertone, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance but doesn&#x27;t last long. It seems like it is gone in an hour. Needless to say, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift, havent heard any complaints!</li>
            <li> I tried this clubman scent today and it is just wonderful! I have had it on for over 8 hours and I can still pickup hints of musk. This is the only clubman scent my wife says does not make me smell like an old man. I have worn Clubman aftershave, Lilac Veg, club man classic vanilla and Clubman speacial reserve and clubman club royale. This is right up there with clubman&#x27;s club royale which they dont make any more. Club Royale was my favorite and this is a close second. Thanks clubmman! and bring back club royale!</li>
            <li> Smells good; like barber fresh!</li>
            <li> Same scent that will bring back the old barber shop memories. Clean scent at low price. Used by barbers for over 100 years.</li>
            <li> Like this scent, soft not overpowering</li>
            <li> I love lime aftershave, and based upon reviews thought I would give this a shot.  I dismissed the negative reviews as greatly outweighed and therefore outliers.  However, I have to agree with them.  I could not wear it.  Does resemble some sort of institutional cleaning agent.</li>
            <li> Get positive comments every time I&#x27;m wearing this, smells fantastic not to overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;Very manly smell!</li>
            <li> This product is definitely one of my long time favorites.  My local barber shop uses this stuff and I finally broke down to buy myself a bottle of it.  It has a great citrus scent with an underlying musk that isn&#x27;t too strong.  It feels good on the skin, leaves me invigorated after my morning shaves, and has the smell of a professional.  The smell lasts, on average, 3-5 hours for myself. I occasionally put about half of this inside a spray bottle as well.  This is a great product and I would encourage anyone who likes a citrus cologne to at least try it.</li>
            <li> A little burn in spots with razor-burn but quickly turns to a soothing effect.  Stops weepers and tightens skin without drying face too much.  Scent does not linger so cologne can be used relativity quickly following without lasting effect.  Great for warm weather months!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 and my son is 37 and we both use it. Scent doesn&#x27;t last all that long, but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> The fitness center where I work out provides this Citrus Musk their locker room.  I use it every time I&#x27;m there.  I have been to all drug stores and many salons where I live and could not find this superb after shave/ cologne.  I finally found it on Amazon where I ordered a couple of bottles.  The Pinaud Citrus Musk is the BEST after shave cologne I&#x27;ve ever found.  The Musk goes on strong, tightens and sooths a freshly shaved face yet there is a soft lingering scent that lasts for hours.  My wife loves this on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality product and I&#x27;m glad I found a few bottles.</li>
            <li> I took a chance buying this and was very pleasently surprised. I&#x27;ve been an oldspice man for years but this is a welcome addition and is perfect for these warm Carolina days</li>
            <li> The bottle says cologne but I find it works well as an after shave or splash on as a skin refresher. I like it as an alternative from the Clubman  Bay Rum aftershave I use often. Sometimes the Bayrum is a bit heavy particular on hot or humid days. Citrus Musk is a little more refreshing on hot spring or summer day in my opinion. You can slash on liberally, the scent is strong at first and feels crisp and cool going on smelling mostly like citrus. After a few minutes most of the powerful scent fades away leaving a light musk scent so don&#x27;t be afraid to use a lot. I would actually prefer if the scent was a little stronger but my wife seems to think its nice the way it is as she can only really smell it when she leans in close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love both citrus scented aftershaves and Musk scented colognes so this one is a win win for me because for the price it adequately serves both purposes. If only the scent was a little more long lasting I would give it a perfect 5. but for the cost its definitely affordable to re-aply through out the day as necessary.</li>
            <li> Quickly becoming a Clubman Pinaud fan.  This stuff is cheap and smells great.  Wife approved!</li>
            <li> I have several or almost all the clubman aftershaves and this is a great one to add to the rotation.</li>
            <li> This is another great product from Pinaud.The lime musk will be a great cooling aftershave in the summer months.not cloying lasts for about six hours,can&#x27;t complain. Richard from Apex NC</li>
            <li> This comapny&#x27;s products are always excellent and fairly priced. I have never been unsatisfied with anything that I have purchased by them.</li>
            <li> The Clubman Citrus Musk arrived quickly (Prime 2 day shipping) and smells fantastic and was just as I expected. It has a very clean, masculine scent with citrus tones throughout. As for the musk, most are very heavy smelling, this cologne has a much lighter musk scent which is fantastic....basically it won&#x27;t give you a headache by the end of the day like some other musks do. The scent lasted from when I applied it in the morning until I went to bed and was never overpowering. Well worth the money, give it a try and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Got the best shave ever from a Russian woman who owns a small shop in Scottdale, near Decatur, Georgia.  Close shave.  Not one nick. A scalp massage.  Hot towels.  Cold towels.  An ear massage that left me in a happy, happy place.  She finished up with this scent, which is surprisingly subtle for something called &amp;#34;musk&amp;#34;.  Feels like a bit less alcohol than other Pinaud products as well.  My wife likes it as well, so i am a happy, happy customer.</li>
            <li> Smells Great. Nice Lime Musk scent!</li>
            <li> I have used Clubman products off and on over the years. The classic Clubman is great, I hated the Vegetal, but this is my favorite. The musk is very subtle and the lime is at the forefront. It smells very clean and light, not what I consider an &amp;#34;evening&amp;#34; scent. Great for daily wear, and easy on the skin after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you, this stuff is like catnip with the ladies. it is very manly without being strong or heady. You won&#x27;t smell like you are trying to get laid, you will just smell confident that you will.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell.  Extremely light citrus and musk scent over the background of the standard Clubman scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use bottle. Price is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this every day no problem.</li>
            <li> Unique fragrance smells great!</li>
            <li> I have purchased so far 3 Clubman Pinaud brand aftershaves and enjoy them all.  Each reminds me of the old fashion barbershop experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Citrus Musk - light, not offensive, with hints of lime and orange/bergamot.  They do fade as the day progresses so that they are not overly strong.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite smell but its fresh enough to use out of the shower and its lasting.  You may like it.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not great either.  Some will find the flowery scent too strong....I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the smell of old barbershop shaving, get Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion instead.</li>
            <li> Smells gret my boyfriend loves the nostalgic barber shop scent and it is also a great value, very inexpensive to buy</li>
            <li> Best pinaud product yet</li>
            <li> Really pleasent- floral and citrusy.</li>
            <li> Smells nice enough but that&#x27;s it. No real musk, no real citrus. No staying power. Not &amp;#34;Bad&amp;#34; by stretch but it has nothing to recommend it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long, but has a wonderful classic scent. Especially good for warm weather.</li>
            <li> The best Clubman aftershave. The others are nice but way to strong smelling.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am really impressed with the way this smells. I&#x27;ve tried other Pinaud fragrances that were WAY overpowering, this on the other hand is different.  It has a great citrus lime scent that settles into a soft, light musk.  It&#x27;s the first musk scent that my girlfriend has ever liked.  It is a really good buy.  I had not even heard of this scent before but happened to see it when searching for my goto cologne, Bay Rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a fan of lime, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Does what it is supposed to, not for the faint of heart as it does sting, but you get used to it. Great product!</li>
