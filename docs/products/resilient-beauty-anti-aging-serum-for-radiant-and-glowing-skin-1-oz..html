            <li> I have only had a chance to use this product going on three days and so far I like it. I do feel a slight tightening of the skin mins after applying and it absorbs right into the skin as described. I am anxiously waiting to see the positive effects of long term daily use. So far I am pleased enough that I will order again and would highly recommend giving it a try! &amp;#34;</li>

            <li> I used to use Cellex C-- a good product, but much more expensive for the same results as I get from Resilient Beauty Vitamin C serum and It left orange marks around my clothes necklines.

            <li> Recommended for skin.  Has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Hope it is doing what promised.  Bottle top screws on too tight.  I did order another bottle because the product is good. Hope the bottle top fits better.</li>

            <li> Feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> This serum is phenomenal! I have tried many different ones in the past but I have finally found one that’s great for my sensitive skin! My real problem is uneven color and the acne scars on my face. This definitely has helped and has really been fantastic this far!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders! It smells great and that little bottle is going to last you a long time and it&#x27;s worth the money! I have always had blotchy spots on my skin and I rarely wear makeup so I wanted something straight forward that I could use to improve the look of my skin and this does just that.

I grew up on a lake and lived in Florida for almost 10 years so when I started noticing hyper pigmentation I decided to give this a try and I am so glad I did!
