            <li>This product was perfect.</li>
            <li>This kit is perfect!</li>
            <li>Weren&#x27;t 100% perfect, but</li>
            <li>Product is excellent!</li>
            <li>I does its job but not in the best way.</li>
            <li>The colors were very good</li>
            <li>good quality product, it remains on the nails very good</li>
            <li>Thank you for a great deal.</li>
            <li>they look so very nice.  </li>
            <li>very happy with the speed of the product arrival as well :)</li>
            <li>Takes practice to get a good tip.</li>
            <li>Worked good.  </li>
            <li>I am obviously very pleased.  </li>
            <li>i love this!</li>
            <li>I love this product, you can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li>It was easy to paint my nails using this kit and my nails looked very nice after I painted them.  </li>
            <li>However, the stickers that are supposed to act as a barrier for applying the tip color aren&#x27;t really effective.</li>
            <li>and it looks good with any kind of clothing :-)</li>
            <li>But, I was used to really nice looking nails.  </li>
            <li>I can do my own nails</li>
            <li>This will keep your nails gorgeous and your purse filled.</li>
            <li>Hansen products and buy them great fun</li>
            <li>For some reason, this product makes it easy to do your nails!</li>
            <li>Dries very quick &amp; the stickers help with the line precision !</li>
            <li>This kit was easy to use and the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>I swabbed mine with a cotton ball dabbed in rubbing alcohol to be sure there was no soap/lotion/etc.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li>It takes a while to do it since u have to put so many coats but it looked okay.</li>
            <li>And since french manicures costs from $20-$40 dollars its a excellent investment!  </li>
            <li>If you apply ANY of the top coats too soon (including the nude color), you&#x27;ll get bubbles.</li>
            <li>So, ok, they were just growing out.</li>
            <li>I love the color and my nails</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Worked a lot better than i thought it was going to .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken me a bit of practice, but I can give myself a great (not to mention inexpensive) manicure that looks quite professional.</li>
            <li>I still need a little more practice, but I/m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Word of advice, be sure that your nails are absolutely clean.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>The results were pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>than that it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Just to be completely fair, my nails tend to be very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s cheap, and it gives you a pseudo-French manicure look.</li>
            <li>you are home free.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as an add on to get free shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;For the first time trying, I&#x27;m not super impressed, but I&#x27;m also not really disappointed,</li>
            <li>The white polish dries quick, making it easier and faster to apply the nude coat and the top coat is nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>i should quit trying to find a good home french manicure kit.</li>
            <li>This whole set costs less than one Essie bottle, too, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>Taking the stickers off too soon isn&#x27;t a great idea, since it&#x27;ll pull the tacky polish slightly away, leaving less-neat edges.</li>
            <li>I tried to add an additional clear top coat</li>
            <li>the white and clear polish are good, but the beige colored polish doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I recommend to everyone wanting to do their own French!!</li>
            <li>They look really close to what I would have had done at a saloon at a whole lot higher price !!</li>
            <li>Armor&amp;#34; as the final top coat.  </li>
            <li>so I could go to a salon to have the French look but not any more.</li>
            <li>, the white still chips in a few days which I have to keep touching up to keep it looking good.  </li>
            <li>The kit arrived on time, and was exactly as described on amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a very nice, subtle color, and I&#x27;ve used it outside of the kit, since it provides a nice toning-down effect to natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to do french manicure that was halfway decent- until now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a nail pro, and this was easy enough for me to handle.</li>
            <li>I have gave myself a French manicure two weeks ago and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Looks good, very affordable, and the pedicure will last a long time.</li>
            <li>The stickers are nice to have, but you have to REALLY adhere them tightly to avoid getting polish underneath.</li>
            <li>I am very satified.</li>
            <li>I do like the shades of white and nude polishes included, and the topcoat dries smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>i feel like a nail pro using this haha</li>
            <li>and it was really runny.</li>
            <li>I will never pay for a real manicure, and I like that with this</li>
            <li>You have to be VERY patient with the drying process.</li>
            <li>I am a real \\&quot;do</li>
            <li>thanks to this kit.</li>
            <li>and I really wish I had picked something else.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>With a little patience and practice they com out just as good and even more last just as long.  </li>
            <li>always look sharp and healthy.</li>
            <li>I tried the standard white nail pencil to try and whiten the nails as they grew out (sort of french look) but it didn&#x27;t look so great or at least not as nice as I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t matter if used more or less of the beige, it just came out lumpy.</li>
            <li>It lasts a decent amount of time</li>
            <li>I had been waiting for my nails to grow out a little more</li>
            <li>Would make a cute little gift.</li>
            <li>I even like the pale shade combined witht the top coat.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;nude\\&quot; coat dries nicely to even out the tone between the nail color and the white, though if it dries even slightly</li>
            <li>But then the next trick was, could I do this on my right hand, using my self hand to put the strips on, put the polish on etc.  </li>
            <li>I have been doing my own french manis for a long time, and I know how to work with different polishes with different consistencies, but this is unusable.</li>
            <li>The little strips that are supposed to help you create clean lines don&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li>I did not use the nude color, just the clear as my natural nails are pretty pink.  </li>
            <li>the white dries easily and the beige i wanted to be a little more pink but other</li>
            <li>If you want a decent French tip don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend it, as long as you understand that you will need to fix up the tip polish, even with the application of the stickers and that the polish may dry out fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I have walked around for 2 days looking at my new French</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better kits out there, but meh, I didn&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li>Also, although I haven&#x27;t had the polishes very long (maybe two months), the nude color is already getting that tacky consistency to it, so it doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly as it had originally, which is disappointing, since I really do like the shade and want to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The base is very sheer even for a french manicure and the white has not the best coverage.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I just sat around with the tips on for a good half hour, because those puppies prefer to stay tacky as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you put the strips on, attach from one side and gently stretch it to the other side of the nail, and really push down on the strip so it is completely adhered, this will keep the white polish from seeping under the strip.  </li>
            <li>My only problem with it is even though I put the clear coat over the white part</li>
            <li>The little sticker things don&#x27;t leave you with a clean line, the polish takes forever to dry, and the sheer color applies streaky.</li>
            <li>I had never really had an interest in French manicures (I just like to mix it up with colors, because I&#x27;m a bit of a color fiend, I&#x27;ll admit), but I&#x27;m doing a rotation in a professional setting where I need to have either nude nails, or natural polish.</li>
            <li>They are not long but ...</li>
            <li>I went through alot of this information so that someone who has had problems with their nails, or who is not confident they could do this by their selves, would see that it is really worth trying.  </li>

            <li> They are not long but ...</li>
            <li> I went through alot of this information so that someone who has had problems with their nails, or who is not confident they could do this by their selves, would see that it is really worth trying.  </li>
            <li> It was streaky and smeared the white polish that I had so painstakingly applied, even though the white polish was dry.</li>
            <li> And the white layer takes FOREVER to dry.</li>
            <li> (mine was about a week an a half to two weeks), and once you get the hang of it, it looks professional.</li>
            <li> The first nail I did got a little weird at first, but I removed the white and redid it.  </li>
            <li> I have had artificial nails for so many years</li>
            <li> No matter how careful I was when adhering, I would find that the white polish had run underneath the sticker.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to use a polish remover-soaked Q-tip to carefully remove the white that ran out of bounds.</li>
            <li> The only other thing I did was use &amp;#34;Pink</li>
            <li> so I am not very steady.  </li>
            <li> I put on a clear base coat, let it dry, and then put the guide stickers on over that, and it helped (a bit) to make sure the polish didn&#x27;t head under.</li>
            <li> me who usual make a mess out of everything it is so simply and looks professional</li>
            <li> For the last 14 years or so it was the full artificial nail from the nail salon.  </li>
            <li> I bought this little kit along with a French Manicure Clean-Up Brush.</li>
            <li> but I expected an easier to use product.</li>
            <li> Had to have antibiotic treatment and such, my nails were green and brown and peeled like onion skin.  </li>
            <li> Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> I like French manicures but don&#x27;t want to spend $20+ every few weeks on one.  </li>
            <li> Since my nails are HORRIBLY brittle (really, that&#x27;s the reason why I paint them in the first place), I decided to see what a French manicure would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put two thin coats of the white on, allowing each to dry thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, they don&#x27;t stick tightly to the nail.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with how long it lasts though.</li>
            <li> Took just a few days to arrive.</li>
            <li> Anyway, a few months ago we removed my artificial nails done by the salon, and found......not only fungus but a bacterial infection !!  </li>
            <li> As far as DIY nail kits go, this isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> the colors look average on the nails, I&#x27;m not impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> and you add another brushstroke, you can get some weird lines.</li>
            <li> This is a mediocre set.</li>
            <li> Disappointing experience for me this time. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>

            <li> This product was perfect. The white polish dries quick, making it easier and faster to apply the nude coat and the top coat is nice and shiny. There are even sticker guides for the french tips.</li>
            <li> It was easy to paint my nails using this kit and my nails looked very nice after I painted them.  However after just one day the white polish had peeled off.  As soon as you do anything with your hands it starts to peel.  I tried to add an additional clear top coat but it still peeled off. Just to be completely fair, my nails tend to be very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> Takes practice to get a good tip.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know but for some reason when I got this, the plastic cover was removed so I don&#x27;t know if it was used or it was just mishandled. I&#x27;m disappointed. I&#x27;m a Sally Hansen fan when it comes to nail polish. Grew up seeing it being used by my mom and aunts. Disappointing experience for me this time. :(</li>
            <li> the colors look average on the nails, I&#x27;m not impressed with the product. i should quit trying to find a good home french manicure kit. it&#x27;s just not possible yet</li>
            <li> For a one thrid the price of a french manicure.  I even like the pale shade combined witht the top coat.  With a little patience and practice they com out just as good and even more last just as long.  I am very satified.</li>
            <li> As far as DIY nail kits go, this isn&#x27;t bad. I do like the shades of white and nude polishes included, and the topcoat dries smooth and shiny. However, the stickers that are supposed to act as a barrier for applying the tip color aren&#x27;t really effective. In my opinion, they don&#x27;t stick tightly to the nail. No matter how careful I was when adhering, I would find that the white polish had run underneath the sticker. I ended up having to use a polish remover-soaked Q-tip to carefully remove the white that ran out of bounds. Also, although I haven&#x27;t had the polishes very long (maybe two months), the nude color is already getting that tacky consistency to it, so it doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly as it had originally, which is disappointing, since I really do like the shade and want to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend it, as long as you understand that you will need to fix up the tip polish, even with the application of the stickers and that the polish may dry out fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I have gave myself a French manicure two weeks ago and it is still going strong.  Word of advice, be sure that your nails are absolutely clean.  I swabbed mine with a cotton ball dabbed in rubbing alcohol to be sure there was no soap/lotion/etc. residue.  When you put the strips on, attach from one side and gently stretch it to the other side of the nail, and really push down on the strip so it is completely adhered, this will keep the white polish from seeping under the strip.  I put two thin coats of the white on, allowing each to dry thoroughly.  I did not use the nude color, just the clear as my natural nails are pretty pink.  The only other thing I did was use &amp;#34;Pink Armor&amp;#34; as the final top coat.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price but I expected an easier to use product. It takes a while to do it since u have to put so many coats but it looked okay. Not very happy with how long it lasts though. If you want a decent French tip don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> i love this! i feel like a nail pro using this haha but the polish stays on forever! very happy with the speed of the product arrival as well :)</li>
            <li> This kit is perfect! good quality product, it remains on the nails very good and it looks good with any kind of clothing :-)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t fully used it yet.  I have used the white polish that came with it and it was really runny.</li>
            <li> This will keep your nails gorgeous and your purse filled. The polish will probably lasts years. And since french manicures costs from $20-$40 dollars its a excellent investment!  Buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a nail pro, and this was easy enough for me to handle. Looks good, very affordable, and the pedicure will last a long time. I will never pay for a real manicure, and I like that with this I can look like I got my nails done, when actually every application cost me under a quarter. This whole set costs less than one Essie bottle, too, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> the white dries easily and the beige i wanted to be a little more pink but other than that it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> I had never really had an interest in French manicures (I just like to mix it up with colors, because I&#x27;m a bit of a color fiend, I&#x27;ll admit), but I&#x27;m doing a rotation in a professional setting where I need to have either nude nails, or natural polish. Since my nails are HORRIBLY brittle (really, that&#x27;s the reason why I paint them in the first place), I decided to see what a French manicure would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time trying, I&#x27;m not super impressed, but I&#x27;m also not really disappointed, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few things with the polish:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The stickers are nice to have, but you have to REALLY adhere them tightly to avoid getting polish underneath. I put on a clear base coat, let it dry, and then put the guide stickers on over that, and it helped (a bit) to make sure the polish didn&#x27;t head under. Took a couple times, but after I got the hang of it, I didn&#x27;t have issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) You have to be VERY patient with the drying process. Taking the stickers off too soon isn&#x27;t a great idea, since it&#x27;ll pull the tacky polish slightly away, leaving less-neat edges. If you apply ANY of the top coats too soon (including the nude color), you&#x27;ll get bubbles. And the white layer takes FOREVER to dry. Seriously, I just sat around with the tips on for a good half hour, because those puppies prefer to stay tacky as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The \\&quot;nude\\&quot; coat dries nicely to even out the tone between the nail color and the white, though if it dries even slightly and you add another brushstroke, you can get some weird lines. It&#x27;s actually a very nice, subtle color, and I&#x27;ve used it outside of the kit, since it provides a nice toning-down effect to natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s cheap, and it gives you a pseudo-French manicure look. It lasts a decent amount of time (mine was about a week an a half to two weeks), and once you get the hang of it, it looks professional. I&#x27;m sure there are better kits out there, but meh, I didn&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> I still need a little more practice, but I/m very happy with this product.  Thank you for a great deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this little kit along with a French Manicure Clean-Up Brush. It&#x27;s taken me a bit of practice, but I can give myself a great (not to mention inexpensive) manicure that looks quite professional.</li>

            <li> I have had artificial nails for so many years I cannot recall.  For the last 14 years or so it was the full artificial nail from the nail salon.  Prior to that for about 15 years I did it myself with nail tips (had to wear polish to cover up the place where the tip and my nail were glued together).  Anyway, a few months ago we removed my artificial nails done by the salon, and found......not only fungus but a bacterial infection !!  It was horrible. Had to have antibiotic treatment and such, my nails were green and brown and peeled like onion skin.  Terrible terrible ! anyway, they have started growing out.  I have used Nail Tec on them to try an increase their strength and taking Biotin.  So, ok, they were just growing out. But, I was used to really nice looking nails.  I tried the standard white nail pencil to try and whiten the nails as they grew out (sort of french look) but it didn&#x27;t look so great or at least not as nice as I wanted.  So I decided to try this.  I just did not have the confidence that I could do this. I do have a disability which causes weakness in the arms) so I am not very steady.  I have walked around for 2 days looking at my new French look nails.  They are not long but ... they look so very nice.  I went through alot of this information so that someone who has had problems with their nails, or who is not confident they could do this by their selves, would see that it is really worth trying.  The first nail I did got a little weird at first, but I removed the white and redid it.  I got the hang of it!!!  But then the next trick was, could I do this on my right hand, using my self hand to put the strips on, put the polish on etc.  Yep, I did it.  Once you have the hang of it you are home free.  They look really close to what I would have had done at a saloon at a whole lot higher price !! I am obviously very pleased.  I had been waiting for my nails to grow out a little more so I could go to a salon to have the French look but not any more.I am a real \\&quot;do it yourseler \\&quot; now  thanks to this kit.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an add on to get free shipping and I really wish I had picked something else. The little sticker things don&#x27;t leave you with a clean line, the polish takes forever to dry, and the sheer color applies streaky. I have been doing my own french manis for a long time, and I know how to work with different polishes with different consistencies, but this is unusable. I wish I could give it no stars at all.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Worked good.  Used it for my wedding &amp; did my nails myself.  Weren&#x27;t 100% perfect, but neither is the nail salon!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is so easy to use. For some reason, this product makes it easy to do your nails! A big plus for me. I love the color and my nails always look sharp and healthy.</li>
            <li> I like French manicures but don&#x27;t want to spend $20+ every few weeks on one.  So why not just spend $5 and get like 30 applications?  My only problem with it is even though I put the clear coat over the white part, the white still chips in a few days which I have to keep touching up to keep it looking good.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as described. The little strips that are supposed to help you create clean lines don&#x27;t help at all. Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent! Took just a few days to arrive. I would definitely recommend this product. Would make a cute little gift.</li>
            <li> the white and clear polish are good, but the beige colored polish doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly. It was streaky and smeared the white polish that I had so painstakingly applied, even though the white polish was dry. I didn&#x27;t matter if used more or less of the beige, it just came out lumpy. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this I can do my own nails me who usual make a mess out of everything it is so simply and looks professional I give two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This is a mediocre set. I does its job but not in the best way. The base is very sheer even for a french manicure and the white has not the best coverage.</li>
            <li> It comes with enough stickers for maybe 15 nail paintings. Once you do it once, you&#x27;re a pro! I haven&#x27;t been to a nail salon in close to a year, and still constantly get compliments on my nails. I love this product, you can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> Worked a lot better than i thought it was going to . Dries very quick &amp; the stickers help with the line precision ! I recommend to everyone wanting to do their own French!!</li>
            <li> The kit arrived on time, and was exactly as described on amazon. The colors were very good and so was the brush of the nail polish.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER been able to do french manicure that was halfway decent- until now.  This kit was easy to use and the results were amazing.  Everyone complimented me on my manicure and asked me where I had gotten my nails done.  The results were pretty amazing.</li>
