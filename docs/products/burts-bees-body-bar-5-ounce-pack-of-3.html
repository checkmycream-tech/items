            <li>This is the only soap that my wife will use I and if it makes her happy then she leaves me alone and that makes me very happy!.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it at Amazon!</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t expect was the fact that it would be better than ANY acne treatment I ever used.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that these products are not loaded with tons of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for more than 2 years now.</li>
            <li>I love this bar soap.</li>
            <li>I have not found anything that works any better.</li>
            <li>My grandchildren all use it for their acne and it helps clean the skin, getting rid of the excess oils, with out the harshness of so many popular acne products on the market today.</li>
            <li>Burt Bee&#x27;s is their natural product selection, and their stuff really is great.</li>
            <li>All natural and a great balance between moisturizing and clean feel/no residue.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for those people looking for amazing feeling skin and looking.</li>
            <li>Leaves no residue on skin and has a clean scent.</li>

            <li>I rarely have breakouts and It&#x27;s also lighting up my post acne marks.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey &amp; Shea Conditioning Body Bar is a lovely, honey-and-shea butter-filled natural bath</li>
            <li>Safe for young kid&#x27;s skin as well.</li>
            <li>so much in fact that on my original order I ordered two packs of it.  </li>
            <li>This soap is very reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>As long as you can stomach the price, you will likely be happy with every Burt&#x27;s Bees product you buy.</li>
            <li>The bar is a nice size (the common ones in the store are downsizing) &amp; the scent is light &amp; mellow.  </li>
            <li>For people, especially teenagers, who have acne and other skin problems, this soap is great.  </li>
            <li>This soap has a nice mild scent, rinses off easily and does not dry my skin or make me itch like Dial other similar soaps.  </li>
            <li>Your skin is so smooth with no greasy residue and its no big deal if you skip your body lotion.</li>
            <li>but I like is so much I might try it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to this product exclusively and my skin condition has im proved much.</li>
            <li>It works very well for both and saves a lot of space.</li>
            <li>It decent soap.  </li>
            <li>But if you have skin issues, you&#x27;re a little more selective (or you should be).  </li>
            <li>It also leaves behind a lovely honey smell close to your skin -- my partner noticed it. ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li>This used to be such a nice soap now its a big goopy mess that smells yuck!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I just hope they don&#x27;t start changing their formulas after they get a little success in sales.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, goes on smooth, and foams even in hard water.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hands conditioned and not dry at all.</li>

            <li> and they left my skin dry..</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin like other soaps, or leave a film.</li>
            <li> bar is big (5 oz) and doesn&#x27;t melt into oblivion when wet (let it dry between uses).</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin I would recommend that you try this product.</li>
            <li> It prevents flare-ups of dermatitis &amp; aids in dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t dry out with Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry the skin at all and no smell</li>
            <li> Body Bar lathers most luxuriously and cleanses well without stripping my skin of moisture or leaving behind an icky, soapy film.</li>
            <li> The only down side for me is that it is not fragrant.</li>
            <li> One of the only few soaps out there that does not cause me to have any form of allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Be careful it runs about $4.50 in the drugstore</li>
            <li> it is less expensive than liquid soap and last much longer.  </li>
            <li> (Ivory and Dove are the other two).</li>
            <li> My fear is that they are not making it anymore, very hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> not at all like it used to be not sure what Burts Bees has changed but for the price they are way of track.  </li>
            <li> It usually costs usually $5 or so.</li>
            <li> I could care less soap is soap as long as i dont smell too bad</li>
            <li> This soap is terrible....</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit boring, not that it stated it would be anything but what it is.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This soap is simply amazing! It does not dry out my skin like other soaps, or leave a film. It smells great and does not bother my allergies, or asthma at all. One of the only few soaps out there that does not cause me to have any form of allergic reaction. (Ivory and Dove are the other two). This soap is made by Burt Bee&#x27;s, which is owned by Clorox of all companies. Burt Bee&#x27;s is their natural product selection, and their stuff really is great. So if you have allergies, asthma, or are just looking for a good soap all around for your hypo allergenic needs, this is the stuff!</li>
            <li> This soap is terrible....not at all like it used to be not sure what Burts Bees has changed but for the price they are way of track.  This used to be such a nice soap now its a big goopy mess that smells yuck!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will never use Burts Bees soap again!!</li>
            <li> This soap has me sold- so much in fact that on my original order I ordered two packs of it.  If you have dry skin I would recommend that you try this product.</li>
            <li> This Honey and Shea soap is absolutely the best for cleansing and not drying out your skin while washing and/or shaving your legs.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it at Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great soap. Non-drying and did not irritate my skin. Leaves no residue on skin and has a clean scent. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> My hubs bought me this soap, and I love it! I use it for my face. What I didn&#x27;t expect was the fact that it would be better than ANY acne treatment I ever used. I rarely have breakouts and It&#x27;s also lighting up my post acne marks. I love their pomegranate soap too, but this soap works the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to run out to the store &amp; just pick up a pack of soap.  But if you have skin issues, you&#x27;re a little more selective (or you should be).  The bar is a nice size (the common ones in the store are downsizing) &amp; the scent is light &amp; mellow.  It prevents flare-ups of dermatitis &amp; aids in dry skin.  It works for us, as all Burt&#x27;s Bees products do.</li>
            <li> I cant get enough of this soap especially in the winter.Your skin is so smooth with no greasy residue and its no big deal if you skip your body lotion.Be careful it runs about $4.50 in the drugstore but I just use Amazon for the convenience I do not like to run out!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap. It is great in the summer for drier skin. I always take it with me on vacation to the sunny places, too. My fear is that they are not making it anymore, very hard to find in local stores. Thank you for the great service.</li>
            <li> This soap has a nice mild scent, rinses off easily and does not dry my skin or make me itch like Dial other similar soaps.  A bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t dry out with Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I love the fact that these products are not loaded with tons of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I loved this soap. I have bought bars that were this price for one bar and they left my skin dry.. NOT THIS ONE! I loved it!!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for those people looking for amazing feeling skin and looking. This soap is very reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey &amp; Shea Conditioning Body Bar is a lovely, honey-and-shea butter-filled natural bath soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey &amp; Shea Conditioning Body Bar lathers most luxuriously and cleanses well without stripping my skin of moisture or leaving behind an icky, soapy film. It also leaves behind a lovely honey smell close to your skin -- my partner noticed it. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar is big (5 oz) and doesn&#x27;t melt into oblivion when wet (let it dry between uses). I purchased it at Walgreens for $2.69 (on clearance). It usually costs usually $5 or so. I bought it on a whim but I like is so much I might try it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: sodium rapeseedate (saponified rapeseed oil), aqua (water), sodium cocoate (saponified coconut oil), glycerin, parfum (fragrance), shea butter (butyrospermum parkii), sunflower seed oil (helianthus annuus) , honey (mel), royal jelly extract, sodium citrate,iron oxides (CI 77492), titanium dioxide(CI 77891)</li>
            <li> This was about 15. for one bar of soap!  It goes for $5. in the store.  It said box open, so I thought it was a case of soap.</li>
            <li> For people, especially teenagers, who have acne and other skin problems, this soap is great.  My grandchildren all use it for their acne and it helps clean the skin, getting rid of the excess oils, with out the harshness of so many popular acne products on the market today.</li>
            <li> It decent soap.  Smell is a bit boring, not that it stated it would be anything but what it is.  I like it overall and if you like an unscented type of soap you should try this.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that my wife will use I and if it makes her happy then she leaves me alone and that makes me very happy!.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife she seems to like it personally I could care less soap is soap as long as i dont smell too bad im happy</li>
            <li> As long as you can stomach the price, you will likely be happy with every Burt&#x27;s Bees product you buy. The soap is cleansing, moisturizing and unoffensive in every way. The 3 pack seemed like a fair deal (or at least as fair as they get).</li>
            <li> All natural and a great balance between moisturizing and clean feel/no residue. I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for more than 2 years now. Burt&#x27;s Bees has got it going on...I just hope they don&#x27;t start changing their formulas after they get a little success in sales.</li>
            <li> it was recommended by a friend who noted my skin problems. I&#x27;ve switched to this product exclusively and my skin condition has im proved much.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products are wonderful. I love this bar soap. It lasts forever. It moisturizes, goes on smooth, and foams even in hard water. The only down side for me is that it is not fragrant. Safe for young kid&#x27;s skin as well.</li>
            <li> I use this in the bathroom as hand soap. it is less expensive than liquid soap and last much longer.  Leaves your hands conditioned and not dry at all.</li>
            <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve ever used!!  Doesn&#x27;t dry the skin at all and no smell so people like me that have allergies are o.k.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for shaving at the gym as well as showering.  It works very well for both and saves a lot of space. I have not found anything that works any better.</li>
