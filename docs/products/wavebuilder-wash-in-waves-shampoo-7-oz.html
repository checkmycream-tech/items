            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>great buy for those who are trying to keep there wave on.</li>
            <li>but its stronger than most things but the best thing about this is that it can be used as a standalone product !!!</li>
            <li>That wouldn&#x27;t be fair to you guys.</li>
            <li>and i did not think i would get good value out of this.</li>
            <li>Invest in a good overnight cap and you will see results within 1 week.</li>
            <li>Even smells good.</li>
            <li>It clean my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great for many reasons it smells nice but dont get it in you</li>
            <li>Purchased for husband, product was ok!</li>
            <li>At first you won&#x27;t see anything but keep at it and the waves will soon appear!!!!</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s excited to try it out!!</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great, has a good smell, really light, and is great for holding your wave pattern as you wash your hair, I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li>WIW is a good light shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, when you get out of the shower your scale feels so FRESH and your hair.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>i will buy more soon.</li>
            <li>What I like about it most</li>
            <li>but I do notice this product makes my hair very curly after use which is great for enhancing your wave thickness.</li>
            <li>Thanks fellaz for the great reviews</li>
            <li>When i first received my package I was not feeling to good about my purchase.</li>
            <li>and then I follow up with  Wave Builder Super Smooth &amp; Rich Pomade Cocoa &amp; Shea while my hair is still damp.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to apply a lot to get your hair clean.</li>
            <li>I use a sparing amount with each application, but it still finishes quickly.</li>
            <li>I guess the key thing to remember with all these products is that the more you brush the better they all work.</li>
            <li>I Strongly Recommend It To All Those Who Are Trying To Get Waves Or Those Who Wants To Enhance There Waves.</li>
            <li>once your hair dries your waves actually might look better than before!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes your hair soft and helps keep it from drying out too much so that you can get the most success in your pursuit of greatness.&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li>eyes or mouth cause its kind of acidic and it burns but which is expected</li>
            <li>better than just using standard soap or shampoo.</li>
            <li>Your waves look better instantly.</li>
            <li>i use this product and its nothing short of amazing instant waves.i would recommend anyone to use it  </li>
            <li>you can never brush too much</li>
            <li>This shampoo works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find that as normal or welcoming.</li>
            <li>use this and sum pink lotion, instead waves, make sure you brush daily.</li>
            <li>I need no gel or hair oil after using this- my hair just curls and waves naturally!</li>
            <li>This stuff will make your hair so wavy it could make a young boy</li>
            <li>Leaves hair slightly soft and managable for brushing.</li>
            <li>So after about 2 months, I can see more waves forming from prolonged use of this product so I do agree that it works in conjunction with frequent brush sessions and leave-in conditioners, but 6.9 ounces is way too small!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re 100% in full bloom in less than a week.</li>
            <li>It even washes out the murrys pomade easily &amp; if u know how thick murrys is then you know this shampoo gets major points for that.</li>
            <li>it does not dry my scalp or hair out.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was skeptical at first, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft so easier to lay down.</li>
            <li> Wave builder helps you keep in your waves even if you avoid a haircut for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> All you need to do is apply a moderate amount in your wet hair and rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Never really thought there was a big difference in what shampoo to use while having waves</li>
            <li> Afterwards, dry your hair and just brush in any direction.</li>
            <li> Not only that, if you have a new brush that needs to be broken in, use it in the shower with this Shampoo!</li>
            <li> I recommend using other products to help build waves.</li>
            <li> and I have a small amount left.</li>
            <li> and I mean that in both positive and negative ways.</li>
            <li> Also, when you are in the shower applying this product and some of it runs down your face it gives you that IcyHot menthol sensation on your skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now harder for me to lose my waves than for me to at least semi-keep them without even du ragging.</li>
            <li> Shampoos are to be used once in a while, but I use this product fatefully everyday- make that every time I shower, which may be twice a day!</li>
            <li> The bottle was rather small</li>
            <li> I was completely wrong</li>

            <li> This shampoo works great, has a good smell, really light, and is great for holding your wave pattern as you wash your hair, I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li> Well, wave builder&#x27;s products are for 360 waving.  WIW is a good light shampoo.</li>
            <li> use this and sum pink lotion, instead waves, make sure you brush daily. you can never brush too much</li>
            <li> It came on time. great product. It doesn&#x27;t wash out my wave. I love it It clean my hair perfectly. i will buy more soon. I will recommand this to anyone who has wave.</li>
            <li> Hell keep me from washing my waves out.</li>
            <li> i use this product and its nothing short of amazing instant waves.i would recommend anyone to use it  i didnt order it off amazon because sell it across the street</li>
            <li> Shampoos are to be used once in a while, but I use this product fatefully everyday- make that every time I shower, which may be twice a day! I need no gel or hair oil after using this- my hair just curls and waves naturally!</li>
            <li> Purchased for husband, product was ok!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Help build waves. Makes hair soft so easier to lay down. I recommend using other products to help build waves.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but it really does work. I like the way my hair feels afterward and then I follow up with  Wave Builder Super Smooth &amp; Rich Pomade Cocoa &amp; Shea while my hair is still damp. Throw a doo-rag on, leave on over night, then WA-LA! The Pacific Ocean doesn&#x27;t have anything on me! lol</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t agree with my skin and gave a burning sensation....  This is just from my personal experience though..  Overall score 3/10</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Wave builder shampoo! I use this to brush my waves in while I&#x27;m in the shower. Not only that, if you have a new brush that needs to be broken in, use it in the shower with this Shampoo!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to just buy this product and use it once or twice then make a review. That wouldn&#x27;t be fair to you guys. So after about 2 months, I can see more waves forming from prolonged use of this product so I do agree that it works in conjunction with frequent brush sessions and leave-in conditioners, but 6.9 ounces is way too small! I use a sparing amount with each application, but it still finishes quickly. This bottle can&#x27;t possibly even last 1 month if its your go-to shampoo, not even if you stretch it. Also, when you are in the shower applying this product and some of it runs down your face it gives you that IcyHot menthol sensation on your skin and I don&#x27;t find that as normal or welcoming. There&#x27;s nothing else like this shampoo and I mean that in both positive and negative ways. So ultimately...I recommend this product.... 4/5 stars.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for many reasons it smells nice but dont get it in you eyes or mouth cause its kind of acidic and it burns but which is expected but its stronger than most things but the best thing about this is that it can be used as a standalone product !!! if you have waves and you put this on in the shower i usually wet my hair apply it and then soak a soft brush in water from the shower and brush it out of my hair without letting the stream from the shower touch my head then i use a medium brush after i get out to help push the water out then slap on a durag and once your hair dries your waves actually might look better than before!</li>
            <li> This stuff will make your hair so wavy it could make a young boy seasick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes your hair soft and helps keep it from drying out too much so that you can get the most success in your pursuit of greatness.&lt;br /&gt;Way better than just using standard soap or shampoo. It&#x27;s now harder for me to lose my waves than for me to at least semi-keep them without even du ragging. And when I du-rag?&lt;br /&gt;BAM! They&#x27;re 100% in full bloom in less than a week.</li>
            <li> When i first received my package I was not feeling to good about my purchase. The bottle was rather small and i did not think i would get good value out of this. I was completely wrong and i have had this almost a year and I have a small amount left. you don&#x27;t have to apply a lot to get your hair clean.</li>
            <li> Wave builder helps you keep in your waves even if you avoid a haircut for a long period of time. All you need to do is apply a moderate amount in your wet hair and rinse it off.Afterwards, dry your hair and just brush in any direction.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, when you get out of the shower your scale feels so FRESH and your hair. Your waves look better instantly.</li>
            <li> great buy for those who are trying to keep there wave on.</li>
            <li> I guess the key thing to remember with all these products is that the more you brush the better they all work. Invest in a good overnight cap and you will see results within 1 week. Don&#x27;t give up! At first you won&#x27;t see anything but keep at it and the waves will soon appear!!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well. What I like about it most it does not dry my scalp or hair out. Good product.!!</li>
            <li> This Product Exceeded My Expectations. I Strongly Recommend It To All Those Who Are Trying To Get Waves Or Those Who Wants To Enhance There Waves.</li>
            <li> Never really thought there was a big difference in what shampoo to use while having waves but I do notice this product makes my hair very curly after use which is great for enhancing your wave thickness. It even washes out the murrys pomade easily &amp; if u know how thick murrys is then you know this shampoo gets major points for that. Ive been using it about 3months now and reccomend it for anyone with (coarse)blk hair and especially those trying to get waves.</li>
            <li> Cleans your hair without drying it out. Leaves hair slightly soft and managable for brushing. Even smells good. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got my husband the set received on time he&#x27;s excited to try it out!! Thanks fellaz for the great reviews</li>
