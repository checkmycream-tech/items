            <li>I like that it&#x27;s already diluted so you can safely put it on your skin without worrying about developing a sensitivity.</li>

            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>was cause me more</li>
            <li>Within minutes I am sound asleep!</li>
            <li>I hardly am able to smell it...</li>
            <li>So excited!</li>
            <li>A great stress free blend that smells very fruity</li>
            <li>though i don&#x27;t experience a very hugh difference in anxiety/stress, it is very soothing and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Very handy to carr around and in those cases where you need the extra boost in case of an anxiety attack this comes in handy</li>
            <li>Smells great, definitely helps me relax and sleep better.</li>
            <li>The product came very quickly.</li>
            <li>It smells strong,  </li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong but I like it.</li>
            <li>scent is strong, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very nice, not too overpowering, but did not last more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Above all and most importantly, it is very effective in calming my nerves and relieving symptoms of anxiety.</li>
            <li>first bought the rollerball and it was nice</li>
            <li>Got it for my pregnant granddaughter whose hormones are off the chart!</li>
            <li>Being able to quickly swipe on a pre-diluted roll on will be a huge time saver before school.</li>
            <li>but I actually enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>is absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Free:</li>
            <li>I used it for a couple more days and helped calm me still.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the scent too strong (and it&#x27;s not offensive to my pregnant nose).  </li>
            <li>Not in a holistic &amp;#34;has special Healy properties&amp;#34; way.</li>
            <li>I could tell right away because I could smell the oil through the amazon box!</li>
            <li>Initially, the product smell was very strong, but I think that was because I put it on too many places.</li>
            <li>True believer in this stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin is kind of sensitive, but I&#x27;ve never had anything quite like this happen.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just got one that was diluted too much, and would have better luck with the euro dropper.</li>
            <li>I have purchased two pre-diluted roller ball bottles as well as a full 10ml bottle of the undiluted formula.</li>
            <li>I love this company, and it came  super fast.</li>
            <li>so i decided to buy the bottle and make my own roller balls, easy enough to do if you buy the rollerballs off amazon and a carrier oil</li>
            <li>My blood pressure has dropped tremendously, from having to be on mild medication to nothing at all.</li>
            <li>or so if you&#x27;re super stressed.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really worked!!</li>
            <li>but when I put this on, it does seem to calm me.</li>
            <li>I feel a sense of calm when I take a sniff.</li>
            <li>I do feel this helps calm me</li>
            <li>Will not purchase again, but it was worth trying.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d find the scent of fresh baked cookies relaxing.......</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stress Free is a synergistic blend of essential oils that together, promote a relaxed state of mind, enabling you to cope better with lifeâ€™s</li>
            <li>This really helps to keep me calm!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to bother returning it because I bought it to help relax my daughter and want to begin using it right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about having a roll on for this particular oil as two of my kids are prone to anxiety with change.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps me to feel more calm and relaxed.</li>
            <li>The nice herbal smell is a good distraction from everything going wrong.</li>
            <li>I am a full time college student, and it has especially come in handy at school; I noticed a huge difference in my ability to focus and retain more details and information during class with a significant improvement in my test-taking (overall ability to stay focused and process exam content with little to no anxiety or susceptibility to distractions, as well as an improvement in test scores).</li>
            <li>I use this when I&#x27;m very stressed out, daily, from lifes every day surprises with 3 special needs children!!</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy really nailed it with this product!  </li>
            <li>Its perfect to use when you are feeling slightly uncomfortable or to put on kids before they go to school.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to help if nothing more than enticing you to take deep cleansing breaths.</li>
            <li>I love Plant Therapy Essential Oils and their website</li>
            <li>I love plant therapy essential oils!</li>
            <li>Thanks plant therapy!</li>
            <li>I have to say it really seems to help calm my son.</li>
            <li>Love cannot say enough about this blend.</li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>smells very minty fresh</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used the anti-anxiety.</li>
            <li>I could just open this and breathe in the aroma and achieve a more relaxed feeling; will buy again.</li>
            <li>i was a first timer and wanted some roll ons to test..</li>
            <li>Will NOT reduce real anxiety!</li>
            <li>I applied more but it just didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>So, I pried off the roll top and added a few drops of my own essential oils</li>
            <li>I have also found that rubbing it into the bottoms of my feet before bed helps me to relax enough to fall asleep easily - something that is a challenge for sufferers of PTSD and/or generalized anxiety disorder.</li>
            <li>I have anxiety and a very high stressed job</li>
            <li>It has a very soothing scent.</li>
            <li>Very pleasing and calming.</li>
            <li>Very calming.</li>
            <li>helps me relax much better,&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>It really does work to relax me.</li>
            <li>Also, I figured $9.99 wouldn&#x27;t be too much to lose if it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>This oil has been renamed to STRESS FREE, so if you are a regular of this oil, watch out for whenever they change the name on amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>as they say 2-3% dilution, I am providing a chart so you can see how much to dilute.</li>
            <li>, I really felt like it helped with my anxiety though.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not what I expected.</li>
            <li>With all the good reviews, I was expecting this roll-on oil to at least have a discernible scent.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the product is great, just missing about a quarter of the bottle.</li>
            <li>how much is it effective, hard to say</li>
            <li>But it definitely helps me stay calm.</li>
            <li>Very calming, works naturally.</li>
            <li>Our 14 year old has anxiety issues and this helps so much.</li>
            <li>If I use it at bedtime, I am relaxed enough to fall right asleep.</li>
            <li>I roll it on to the bottom of my feet, big toe, wrists &amp; right under my nose.</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy has a wide range of top quality essential oils that I would highly recommend...</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>their website&lt;br /&gt;Stress Free Synergy (previously known as Anti-Anxiety)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, but it doesn&#x27;t fade after a few minutes like some others do.  </li>
            <li>I dab it on my temples and it works well, but I have my wrist right there ready to blot to ensure I don&#x27;t have oil dripping down the sides of my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really calms me down - I have an extreme type A personality and do not suffer fools gladly.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter struggles with anxiety and this product has really helped her.</li>
            <li>I hAve gotten used to the smell and actually like it now, very soothing.  </li>
            <li>old son too, and he loves it.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased a few other oils from Plant Therapy as well and think all the products purchased are amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I instantly calmed down and was able to go back to sleep after about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>When you apply this, it comes out quick from the roller and it will run and drip if you&#x27;re not quick to rub it in.  </li>
            <li>At the first sign of anxiety starting or panic attacks I use the Anti Anxiety Synergy Pre-Diluted Essential Roll On, and within minutes I am back to my normal self.  </li>
            <li>and it helps calm me down.</li>
            <li>I needed something to calm me down as I prepared to visit Europe at 79.</li>
            <li>and it calms me right down.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I did not have any topical reaction to this product whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps me to calm down and breathe.</li>
            <li>I mean that I really enjoy the scent scent and find it relaxing in the same way</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen any relief in anxiety, general or specific</li>
            <li>I still use this on a day to day basis and it definitely helps with my minimal anxiety, when I feel the start of an attack I immediately roll on and slowly it gets better.  </li>
            <li>It really calms me down.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather stick to my single oil blends of Wild Orange or Lavender.</li>

            <li> Would love an oil with more vanilla, or citrus, based tones.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love Plant Therapy products.  </li>
            <li> This is ok...</li>

            <li> I got the tranquil and respir-aid  roll-ons, and love both of those.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> If you like the scent of Ylang Ylang, vanilla and lavender you will love this.</li>
            <li> I also use this in an inhaler, you can find those on amazon as well :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this synergy.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil combo...</li>
            <li> and I love the roll on bottle</li>
            <li> I love to rub this on my wrists and sniff it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> I would still recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> love it..</li>
            <li> was cause me more</li>
            <li> Within minutes I am sound asleep!</li>
            <li> I hardly am able to smell it...</li>
            <li> So excited!</li>
            <li> A great stress free blend that smells very fruity</li>
            <li> though i don&#x27;t experience a very hugh difference in anxiety/stress, it is very soothing and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Very handy to carr around and in those cases where you need the extra boost in case of an anxiety attack this comes in handy</li>
            <li> Smells great, definitely helps me relax and sleep better.</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly.</li>
            <li> It smells strong,  </li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong but I like it.</li>
            <li> scent is strong, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very nice, not too overpowering, but did not last more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Above all and most importantly, it is very effective in calming my nerves and relieving symptoms of anxiety.</li>
            <li> first bought the rollerball and it was nice</li>
            <li> Got it for my pregnant granddaughter whose hormones are off the chart!</li>
            <li> Being able to quickly swipe on a pre-diluted roll on will be a huge time saver before school.</li>
            <li> but I actually enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> is absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Free:</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple more days and helped calm me still.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the scent too strong (and it&#x27;s not offensive to my pregnant nose).  </li>
            <li> Not in a holistic &amp;#34;has special Healy properties&amp;#34; way.</li>
            <li> I could tell right away because I could smell the oil through the amazon box!</li>
            <li> Initially, the product smell was very strong, but I think that was because I put it on too many places.</li>
            <li> True believer in this stuff.</li>
            <li> My skin is kind of sensitive, but I&#x27;ve never had anything quite like this happen.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got one that was diluted too much, and would have better luck with the euro dropper.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two pre-diluted roller ball bottles as well as a full 10ml bottle of the undiluted formula.</li>
            <li> I love this company, and it came  super fast.</li>
            <li> so i decided to buy the bottle and make my own roller balls, easy enough to do if you buy the rollerballs off amazon and a carrier oil</li>
            <li> My blood pressure has dropped tremendously, from having to be on mild medication to nothing at all.</li>
            <li> or so if you&#x27;re super stressed.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really worked!!</li>
            <li> but when I put this on, it does seem to calm me.</li>
            <li> I feel a sense of calm when I take a sniff.</li>
            <li> I do feel this helps calm me</li>
            <li> Will not purchase again, but it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d find the scent of fresh baked cookies relaxing.......</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stress Free is a synergistic blend of essential oils that together, promote a relaxed state of mind, enabling you to cope better with lifeâ€™s</li>
            <li> This really helps to keep me calm!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to bother returning it because I bought it to help relax my daughter and want to begin using it right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about having a roll on for this particular oil as two of my kids are prone to anxiety with change.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps me to feel more calm and relaxed.</li>
            <li> The nice herbal smell is a good distraction from everything going wrong.</li>
            <li> I am a full time college student, and it has especially come in handy at school; I noticed a huge difference in my ability to focus and retain more details and information during class with a significant improvement in my test-taking (overall ability to stay focused and process exam content with little to no anxiety or susceptibility to distractions, as well as an improvement in test scores).</li>
            <li> I use this when I&#x27;m very stressed out, daily, from lifes every day surprises with 3 special needs children!!</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy really nailed it with this product!  </li>
            <li> Its perfect to use when you are feeling slightly uncomfortable or to put on kids before they go to school.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to help if nothing more than enticing you to take deep cleansing breaths.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy Essential Oils and their website</li>
            <li> I love plant therapy essential oils!</li>
            <li> Thanks plant therapy!</li>
            <li> I have to say it really seems to help calm my son.</li>
            <li> Love cannot say enough about this blend.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> smells very minty fresh</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used the anti-anxiety.</li>
            <li> I could just open this and breathe in the aroma and achieve a more relaxed feeling; will buy again.</li>
            <li> i was a first timer and wanted some roll ons to test..</li>
            <li> Will NOT reduce real anxiety!</li>
            <li> I applied more but it just didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> So, I pried off the roll top and added a few drops of my own essential oils</li>
            <li> I have also found that rubbing it into the bottoms of my feet before bed helps me to relax enough to fall asleep easily - something that is a challenge for sufferers of PTSD and/or generalized anxiety disorder.</li>
            <li> I have anxiety and a very high stressed job</li>
            <li> It has a very soothing scent.</li>
            <li> Very pleasing and calming.</li>
            <li> Very calming.</li>
            <li> helps me relax much better,&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> It really does work to relax me.</li>
            <li> Also, I figured $9.99 wouldn&#x27;t be too much to lose if it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This oil has been renamed to STRESS FREE, so if you are a regular of this oil, watch out for whenever they change the name on amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> as they say 2-3% dilution, I am providing a chart so you can see how much to dilute.</li>
            <li> , I really felt like it helped with my anxiety though.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> With all the good reviews, I was expecting this roll-on oil to at least have a discernible scent.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the product is great, just missing about a quarter of the bottle.</li>
            <li> how much is it effective, hard to say</li>
            <li> But it definitely helps me stay calm.</li>
            <li> Very calming, works naturally.</li>
            <li> Our 14 year old has anxiety issues and this helps so much.</li>
            <li> If I use it at bedtime, I am relaxed enough to fall right asleep.</li>
            <li> I roll it on to the bottom of my feet, big toe, wrists &amp; right under my nose.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy has a wide range of top quality essential oils that I would highly recommend...</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> their website&lt;br /&gt;Stress Free Synergy (previously known as Anti-Anxiety)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong, but it doesn&#x27;t fade after a few minutes like some others do.  </li>
            <li> I dab it on my temples and it works well, but I have my wrist right there ready to blot to ensure I don&#x27;t have oil dripping down the sides of my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really calms me down - I have an extreme type A personality and do not suffer fools gladly.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter struggles with anxiety and this product has really helped her.</li>
            <li> I hAve gotten used to the smell and actually like it now, very soothing.  </li>
            <li> old son too, and he loves it.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased a few other oils from Plant Therapy as well and think all the products purchased are amazing.  </li>
            <li> and I instantly calmed down and was able to go back to sleep after about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> When you apply this, it comes out quick from the roller and it will run and drip if you&#x27;re not quick to rub it in.  </li>
            <li> At the first sign of anxiety starting or panic attacks I use the Anti Anxiety Synergy Pre-Diluted Essential Roll On, and within minutes I am back to my normal self.  </li>
            <li> and it helps calm me down.</li>
            <li> I needed something to calm me down as I prepared to visit Europe at 79.</li>
            <li> and it calms me right down.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I did not have any topical reaction to this product whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps me to calm down and breathe.</li>
            <li> I mean that I really enjoy the scent scent and find it relaxing in the same way</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen any relief in anxiety, general or specific</li>
            <li> I still use this on a day to day basis and it definitely helps with my minimal anxiety, when I feel the start of an attack I immediately roll on and slowly it gets better.  </li>
            <li> It really calms me down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather stick to my single oil blends of Wild Orange or Lavender.</li>
            <li> The lavender is just a little &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34;, like that old patchouli oil.</li>
            <li> I used to drink tea a lot, but for some reason it hasn&#x27;t been sitting well lately, so I thought I&#x27;d try this stuff because I&#x27;ve been going through some really stressful situations.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a complete waste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and half</li>
            <li> I put a little on the inside of my wrists when I&#x27;m feeling extra stressed.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my 7 year old because he has ADHD and anxiety and was having a hard time in school.</li>
            <li> I was having panic attacks like crazy and as soon as I received this I applied it and almost instantly I was calm and relaxed.  </li>
            <li> My son has a few issues and diagnosis that all relate back to anxiety.</li>
            <li> I get very anxious and it&#x27;s hard for me to calm myself down.</li>
            <li> I have an anxiety disorder and due to pregnancy</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe PTSD and ADHD, and have found this blend to be extremely helpful in keeping me relaxed and focused.</li>
            <li> I tend to get overly anxious sometimes, and while this isn&#x27;t a permanent fix, it definitely calms me down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having massive issues with my anxiety lately</li>
            <li> but I swear it calms me down.</li>
            <li> I have always relied on reviews, and once again the reviews did not let me down.  </li>
            <li> Use a few drops in a diffuser or bath, or mix into a body oil, lotion or other body care product.</li>
            <li> It was calming, but about half an hour after applying it on my wrist</li>
            <li> The smell is less than desirable.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m thankful to God for having found these essential oil therapies.</li>
            <li> I am subject to panic attacks and I rub this oil on my wrist and give it a sniff</li>
            <li> When I start feeling a little &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; or overwhelmed, I pull this stuff out.  </li>
            <li> I also rub a little on the bottom of my feet at night.</li>
            <li> Although this is no xanax it does help a little.</li>
            <li> Using this everyday during the work week by dabbing just a bit under my nose while at work.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from anxiety or panic attacks.  </li>
            <li> This is useless, someone to be an essential oil for anxiety its so diluted that you might as well just rub a little bit of tap water on your temple and call it holy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it helps.</li>
            <li> The bottle leaks oil, which sucks if you&#x27;re trying to carry this in your bag.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> The scent was weak even before applying it and after 10-15 minutes, indiscernible on my forearm.</li>
            <li> The smell is not great</li>
            <li> I had been researching herbal remedies because I was tired of side effects from prescription medicine.</li>
            <li> put the product on the insides of my wrists and also behind my ears.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not, then it&#x27;s just too thin of a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li> I apply it behind my ears, on each side of my larynx, on my wrists, and along my sternum.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my feet and behind my ears every night before bed.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every night, as I suffer from very bad anxiety,  especially at night.  </li>
            <li> I have purchasee other roll on anxiety remedies on amazon that smelled horrible.</li>
            <li> My husband has a lot of anxiety and was very skeptical that this could help him.  </li>
            <li> After I opened it, however, the oil leaked out the cap badly</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed now because I&#x27;m stuck with a $10 bottle of oil that amazon won&#x27;t let me return because it&#x27;s considered &amp;</li>
            <li> and I hated the smell</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, I would not buy again.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The smell is not great but I swear it calms me down. I have anxiety and a very high stressed job but when I put this on, it does seem to calm me. It does not fully take my anxiety away but seems to help which is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product. Hasn&#x27;t helped with anxiety at all. Sure does smell good, though!</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm. Smells great too. Love the aroma.</li>
            <li> Keep this in my purse.  The roll on makes it very easy to use and I love the blend.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy really nailed it with this product!  We love it!!  Its perfect to use when you are feeling slightly uncomfortable or to put on kids before they go to school.  Love the roll on too!!</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter struggles with anxiety and this product has really helped her.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. The bottle leaks oil, which sucks if you&#x27;re trying to carry this in your bag. Will not purchase again, but it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is instantly relaxing. I put a little on the inside of my wrists when I&#x27;m feeling extra stressed. The nice herbal smell is a good distraction from everything going wrong. It has lasted me a while too.</li>
            <li> A great stress free blend that smells very fruity</li>
            <li> loved this product! The scent instantly relaxes me!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the roll-on. Essential oils are always great to use and this just makes them so wonderful to apply!&lt;br /&gt;Love plant therapy!</li>
            <li> This stuff really worked!!</li>
            <li> I like this roll-on for calming my nerves, but I do wish the lavendar was the more predominant scent.</li>
            <li> True believer in this stuff. I use this almost every night, as I suffer from very bad anxiety,  especially at night.  It really calms me down.  I feel much better relying on something like this rather than pills. It smells strong,  but I actually enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, I would not buy again. I can&#x27;t get over the smell to see if it helps with anxiety</li>
            <li> Trying to come off of anxiety medications and this is greatly helpful. I roll some on at night and occasionally throughout the day if needed. It is a miracle potion if used before exercising! I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and half though which is why I only gave four stars. The scent is a bit strong but I like it.</li>
            <li> I like this! It has a very soothing scent. I ordered more so I can put it in my diffuser as well. I will be ordering again and again.  I have purchasee other roll on anxiety remedies on amazon that smelled horrible. Save this one on your wish lists. This one is a keeper. Seller is also great.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works great.  I roll some on my jawline and collarbone and rub it in, and then just breathe...I have an anxiety disorder and due to pregnancy I can&#x27;t take medication for anxiety.  I used to drink tea a lot, but for some reason it hasn&#x27;t been sitting well lately, so I thought I&#x27;d try this stuff because I&#x27;ve been going through some really stressful situations.  I take it every where I go.  When I start feeling a little &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; or overwhelmed, I pull this stuff out.  I don&#x27;t find the scent too strong (and it&#x27;s not offensive to my pregnant nose).  Eventually I forget that I even put it on!  But it definitely helps me stay calm.</li>
            <li> Smells great, definitely helps me relax and sleep better. I like that it&#x27;s already diluted so you can safely put it on your skin without worrying about developing a sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I loved it! Got it for my pregnant granddaughter whose hormones are off the chart! She loved it! I am ordering some for me and my hyper yorkie too!</li>
            <li> This works for me. I love the smell. Very pleasing and calming.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overbearing and no one will know you are wearing it unless you told them. It does seem to help if nothing more than enticing you to take deep cleansing breaths. I also rub a little on the bottom of my feet at night. Seems to help turn the brain off.</li>
            <li> It smells good and I don&#x27;t regret purchasing it, but I haven&#x27;t seen any relief in anxiety, general or specific</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  It&#x27;s not too strong, but it doesn&#x27;t fade after a few minutes like some others do.  Very calming.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell great right out of the bottle, but on the skin it smelled okay and wasn&#x27;t too strong. It was calming, but about half an hour after applying it on my wrist I started getting itchy. Next thing I knew, my arm was red, burning, and was breaking out in bumps. My skin is kind of sensitive, but I&#x27;ve never had anything quite like this happen. I&#x27;m really disappointed now because I&#x27;m stuck with a $10 bottle of oil that amazon won&#x27;t let me return because it&#x27;s considered &amp;#34;hazardous material.&amp;#34; Oh well.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT WORKS AS DESCRIBED !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having massive issues with my anxiety lately and I was literally bathing in this oil!!!! Love it!!! Ladies, it&#x27;s great for cramps too!!! Just apply it over your uterus and the cramps are gone. I did this when I had cramps and I felt great the rest of the day. I would recommend it for muscle pain too :) it helped with mine :)</li>
            <li> Definitely helps me to feel more calm and relaxed. I suffer from panic attacks when I drive, and this has been a life saver for me.</li>
            <li> I have always relied on reviews, and once again the reviews did not let me down.  At the first sign of anxiety starting or panic attacks I use the Anti Anxiety Synergy Pre-Diluted Essential Roll On, and within minutes I am back to my normal self.  I love Plant Therapy Essential Oils and their website is absolutely fantastic.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from anxiety or panic attacks.  Plant Therapy has a wide range of top quality essential oils that I would highly recommend...Plant Therapy is the best.</li>
            <li> I love plant therapy essential oils! I&#x27;m so excited about having a roll on for this particular oil as two of my kids are prone to anxiety with change. Being able to quickly swipe on a pre-diluted roll on will be a huge time saver before school. So excited!</li>
            <li> Very calming, works naturally.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this product. The blend of oils is perfect to ease nerves and calm anxiety. The roll on is a dream as I carry it around with me at all times. I have purchased a few other oils from Plant Therapy as well and think all the products purchased are amazing.  Service is above par as well.  Thank you and I will be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> great product! Smells great and absorbs into skin nicely. I have sensitive skin, and I did not have any topical reaction to this product whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my 7 year old because he has ADHD and anxiety and was having a hard time in school. Since he has allergies and eczema I don&#x27;t actually use the product on his skin. I rub it on his shirt sleeves and collar. His teacher actually emailed me and said &amp;#34;whatever you are doing, keep doing it, it is working wonders&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I am using this in combination with Calming the Child Synergy Pre-Diluted Essential Oil Roll On &amp; another homeopathic tablet for children and nerves.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Calming.</li>
            <li> The smell is less than desirable.  I&#x27;d rather stick to my single oil blends of Wild Orange or Lavender.</li>
            <li> I tend to get overly anxious sometimes, and while this isn&#x27;t a permanent fix, it definitely calms me down! Thanks plant therapy!</li>
            <li> My son has a few issues and diagnosis that all relate back to anxiety. I have been recommended essetial oils for several years and decided to try it and found this product. It was the easiest solution, not wanted to buy any kits or have to mix things up myself. I have to say it really seems to help calm my son. I really is a great mix and I didn&#x27;t have to hassle with anything!</li>
            <li> i have severe anxiety,&lt;br /&gt;and i take medications ,&lt;br /&gt;but i use this for at night time to put on  my neck to smell  it,&lt;br /&gt;it helps me relax much better,&lt;br /&gt;i also  put some on my pillow case to,&lt;br /&gt;it comes n handy and a  purse  or pocket size to,&lt;br /&gt;all i can say, it helps me,&lt;br /&gt;i love lavender smell anyways,</li>
            <li> I just received my second order of this synergy. I LOVE it! This really helps to keep me calm!</li>
            <li> Love cannot say enough about this blend. Its wonderful.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. I will put this on my palms or wrists when I get overwhelmed or if I feel my heart rate rising and it helps calm me down. It might just be that the smell takes me to a happy place but I really love using this.</li>
            <li> The lavender is just a little &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34;, like that old patchouli oil. Using this everyday during the work week by dabbing just a bit under my nose while at work. It really calms me down - I have an extreme type A personality and do not suffer fools gladly. My blood pressure has dropped tremendously, from having to be on mild medication to nothing at all. Seriously, I&#x27;m thankful to God for having found these essential oil therapies. Would love an oil with more vanilla, or citrus, based tones.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Great product!</li>
            <li> smells very minty fresh</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this this stuff. It really does work to relax me. Not in a holistic &amp;#34;has special Healy properties&amp;#34; way. I mean that I really enjoy the scent scent and find it relaxing in the same way you&#x27;d find the scent of fresh baked cookies relaxing....... Not that it smells like cookies. Lol</li>
            <li> Great quality oil! I use this when I&#x27;m very stressed out, daily, from lifes every day surprises with 3 special needs children!! Definitely helps me to calm down and breathe. Won&#x27;t go without.</li>
            <li> Our 14 year old has anxiety issues and this helps so much. helps him focus at school and when we go out!! It smells so good!!</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly. I&#x27;ve been suffering from anxiety for quite a while. I had been researching herbal remedies because I was tired of side effects from prescription medicine. Also, I figured $9.99 wouldn&#x27;t be too much to lose if it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I put the product on the insides of my wrists and also behind my ears. Initially, the product smell was very strong, but I think that was because I put it on too many places. Now I just put on my wrist.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s all in my head but I do think this product does help. I feel a sense of calm when I take a sniff. I&#x27;d recommend it. Even if it&#x27;s just in my head, I get compliments on how great I smell :)</li>
            <li> Love Plant Therapy products.  This would five star if it was just a bit thicker.  I think the carrier oil used is diluted.  If it&#x27;s not, then it&#x27;s just too thin of a carrier oil.  When you apply this, it comes out quick from the roller and it will run and drip if you&#x27;re not quick to rub it in.  I dab it on my temples and it works well, but I have my wrist right there ready to blot to ensure I don&#x27;t have oil dripping down the sides of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is strong, but not overpowering.  It&#x27;s minty.  Everyone who smells it, loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might need to reapply every hour or so if you&#x27;re super stressed.  I&#x27;m usually good for two to four hours with one roll on each temple.</li>
            <li> This is ok...it I dont like the smell of it though. I&#x27;m not really sure if it helps.</li>
            <li> This stuff amazed me. I am subject to panic attacks and I rub this oil on my wrist and give it a sniff and it calms me right down. If I use it at bedtime, I am relaxed enough to fall right asleep. I don&#x27;t know how it works but it just does. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used the anti-anxiety. I love this company, and it came  super fast. The smell is very nice, not too overpowering, but did not last more than 30 minutes. I got the tranquil and respir-aid  roll-ons, and love both of those. Maybe I just got one that was diluted too much, and would have better luck with the euro dropper.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helps with my panic attacks. But it is calming.</li>
            <li> I get very anxious and it&#x27;s hard for me to calm myself down. When I put this on it&#x27;s almost like it helps me breathe for a minute. Although this is no xanax it does help a little.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I have panic attacks and anxiety and this oil is great. The scent is really nice, it&#x27;s a comforting scent. If you like the scent of Ylang Ylang, vanilla and lavender you will love this. This oil has been renamed to STRESS FREE, so if you are a regular of this oil, watch out for whenever they change the name on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first bought the rollerball and it was nice so i decided to buy the bottle and make my own roller balls, easy enough to do if you buy the rollerballs off amazon and a carrier oil you can make a rollerball, as they say 2-3% dilution, I am providing a chart so you can see how much to dilute. I also use this in an inhaler, you can find those on amazon as well :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From their website&lt;br /&gt;Stress Free Synergy (previously known as Anti-Anxiety)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Stress Free: Lavender, Marjoram, Ylang Ylang, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Roman Chamomile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stress Free is a synergistic blend of essential oils that together, promote a relaxed state of mind, enabling you to cope better with lifeâ€™s challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested use: Use a few drops in a diffuser or bath, or mix into a body oil, lotion or other body care product. For topical use, dilute to 3%.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this synergy. I have purchased two pre-diluted roller ball bottles as well as a full 10ml bottle of the undiluted formula. The scent is divine, and my boyfriend loves the smell, too. Above all and most importantly, it is very effective in calming my nerves and relieving symptoms of anxiety. I suffer from severe PTSD and ADHD, and have found this blend to be extremely helpful in keeping me relaxed and focused. I am a full time college student, and it has especially come in handy at school; I noticed a huge difference in my ability to focus and retain more details and information during class with a significant improvement in my test-taking (overall ability to stay focused and process exam content with little to no anxiety or susceptibility to distractions, as well as an improvement in test scores). I apply it behind my ears, on each side of my larynx, on my wrists, and along my sternum. I have also found that rubbing it into the bottoms of my feet before bed helps me to relax enough to fall asleep easily - something that is a challenge for sufferers of PTSD and/or generalized anxiety disorder.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells great and is relaxing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from plant therapy and I hated the smell, I really felt like it helped with my anxiety though.  I emailed the company and explained to them I didn&#x27;t like the smell at all and they fully refunded me.  I still use this on a day to day basis and it definitely helps with my minimal anxiety, when I feel the start of an attack I immediately roll on and slowly it gets better.  I hAve gotten used to the smell and actually like it now, very soothing.  Will definitely be purchasing again.  I roll it on to the bottom of my feet, big toe, wrists &amp; right under my nose.</li>
            <li> Love Plant Therapy oils!  A high quality product at a great price!  My husband has a lot of anxiety and was very skeptical that this could help him.  However, I&#x27;ve seen him rubbing it on his wrists several times so it must be helping!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. I could just open this and breathe in the aroma and achieve a more relaxed feeling; will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It smells wonderful and really leaves a soothing/calming feeling after inhaling.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil combo... how much is it effective, hard to say</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Very handy to carr around and in those cases where you need the extra boost in case of an anxiety attack this comes in handy .. Am happy and satisfied</li>
            <li> I have ordered the pre-diluted roll-on from this seller before and had no issues. This time the anti-anxiety one had leaked in the package. I could tell right away because I could smell the oil through the amazon box! Other than that, the product is great, just missing about a quarter of the bottle. I&#x27;m not going to bother returning it because I bought it to help relax my daughter and want to begin using it right away.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my expecting daughter and she loves it Anti Anxiety Synergy Pre-Diluted Essential Oil Roll-On 10 ml (1/3 fl oz). ...</li>
            <li> this smells great and is easily portable and cheap. highly recommend. though i don&#x27;t experience a very hugh difference in anxiety/stress, it is very soothing and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I do feel this helps calm me and I love the roll on bottle</li>
            <li> I love to rub this on my wrists and sniff it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Woke up in the middle of the night last night having a panic attack...after what seemed like hours of suffering, I remembered that I had this in my purse. I put some on my neck and I instantly calmed down and was able to go back to sleep after about 20 minutes. I will use this forever. So thankful I found it and gave it a try. I&#x27;ve used it before just to relax and it&#x27;s great for that too. Love, love, love. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is useless, someone to be an essential oil for anxiety its so diluted that you might as well just rub a little bit of tap water on your temple and call it holy.</li>
            <li> It got here before it was supposed to get here which was awesome. I was having panic attacks like crazy and as soon as I received this I applied it and almost instantly I was calm and relaxed.  I used it for a couple more days and helped calm me still. The only thing I can think of that bothered me was the smell. It made me nautious (sp?) so I had to quit using it. I wish I could have kept using it as it obviously does what it is ment to do. But I contacted seller and they refunded money without any hassle. I would still recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> love it.. i was a first timer and wanted some roll ons to test.. i now make my own but still with plant therapy&#x27;s oils!</li>
            <li> Seriously? Why did I think this would work? Will NOT reduce real anxiety! Will help you relax if you have a headache!</li>
            <li> With all the good reviews, I was expecting this roll-on oil to at least have a discernible scent.  When it arrived, it was packaged well and had plastic tape around the cap so it didn&#x27;t leak.  After I opened it, however, the oil leaked out the cap badly so it was not transportable in a purse or suitcase, if that is what you&#x27;d planned.  The scent was weak even before applying it and after 10-15 minutes, indiscernible on my forearm. I applied more but it just didn&#x27;t last.  So, I pried off the roll top and added a few drops of my own essential oils so it&#x27;s not a complete waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I have a $10, ten milliliter bottle of fractionated coconut oil.  All this purchase did was cause me more anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This handy blend was a life saver and still is for those times that I start losing it.  This was my first experience with essential oils.  I needed something to calm me down as I prepared to visit Europe at 79. I am very satisfied.  I bought one for my 45 yr. old son too, and he loves it.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> easy to use, effective.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my feet and behind my ears every night before bed. Within minutes I am sound asleep!</li>
            <li> I hardly am able to smell it...but then I have allergies, so maybe that is why.</li>
