            <li>This deliciously orange syrup is made of coriander, amber, oregano, bay leaf, myrtle, angelica root, sandalwood, patchouli, benzoin, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>It is when a perfume is produced in fact the boms perfumes are not produced arise from the creation of an artist, a perumista that in his gift of sensitivity and perception ofativa puts on her perfume his art his God-given gift to create something perfect These perfumes Serge Lutes are incredible, you realize sus aroma in herbs, the countryside, the climate environment through the aroma exhaled by esa creation.</li>
            <li>Wonderful exotic tones which can be used by both men and women.</li>
            <li>I LOVE you this scent!  </li>
            <li>and I just love it!</li>
            <li>The dry-down is amazing - reminds me of creme brulee.</li>
            <li>I received the EDP quickly, which was great, because I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>Unlike traditional amber fragrances, this is not powdery and light but rich and unctuous with great longevity and sillage all tempered by the masterful blending of ingredients.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Serge Lutens.</li>
            <li>The benzoin and resins are quit prominent like incense burning in a mosque, which adds to the mystery.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Buy from reputable shop</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comforting, yet sexy, and it lasts.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this perfume.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite and unique perfume since many years.....</li>
            <li>Love the rich amber resin like scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a sweet authentic amber smell (if you are into fragrances).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a HUGE fragrance.</li>
            <li>Does not smell like the real one!!!</li>
            <li>Sooo, it starts off kind of fresh swamp smelling and 1 spray is too much.  </li>
            <li>this is not the same perfume I purchased in Paris and loved.  </li>
            <li>I really think this is a wonderfully exotic perfume.</li>
            <li>They scents add to the mystic of an older wiser more worldly woman.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this fragrance if you are intrigued by exotic and faraway places.</li>
            <li>Still great, though, and half the p,rice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitey not for everyone, and given an opportunity, SAMPLE IT FIRST!</li>
            <li>Classy and sexy.</li>
            <li>Wear this magical potion to be transported to far away lands, and you just might hear someone whisper - As-salam alaykum.</li>
            <li>It is much lighter and lacks the underlying rich scent.</li>
            <li>I am pretty masculine, and feel wearing this adds a romantic/sexy softness that is a fitting and intriguing contrast.</li>
            <li>and it is offensive as this fragrance unfolds quickly and mysteriously like revealing the genie after rubbing a magic lamp.</li>
            <li>It is magical and mysterious and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not qualified to discuss the different notes, but I think many would say it&#x27;s a heavier scent for colder weather or nights.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong and starts off with heavy almost medicinal herbs, which give way to the glorious and rich amber tempered by sandalwood and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>Very close to the discontinued amber perfume by Tom Ford.</li>
            <li>needed it fast, too, which Lutens site doesn&#x27;t provide.</li>
            <li>Its packaging is a very catchy simplicity of modern elegance nothing garnish after the perfume is not Santa</li>
            <li>From the first spritz you are transported to far off lands.</li>
            <li>Serge Lutens and Christopher Seldrake (the \\&quot;nose\\&quot; behind this remarkable fragrance) are geniuses.</li>
            <li>my new signature fragrances announce my arrival.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for everyone, and I tend to run with a crowd older than I (early 30s), so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am next to positive</li>
            <li>Well, I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this scent.</li>
            <li>I find that less is more with this fragrance, which is a monster and will last all day.</li>
            <li>These are not perfumes for young ingenues, like nothing created by pop idols for mass marketing.  </li>
            <li>After my first spritz of this intoxicating perfume, I was immediately back in the middle east, browsing the bazaars and smelling the incense and hookah smoke.</li>
            <li>I normally wear amber perfumes (another is L&#x27;Occitane Ambre), but I&#x27;m leery about purchasing them online for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li>Any sort of heat REALLY releases this smell in the air, so be careful when wearing it in the summer</li>
            <li>This bottle may have sat around too long under suboptimal conditions, smells a bit harsher than what you get when you order from Lutens directly.</li>

            <li> Sooo, it starts off kind of fresh swamp smelling and 1 spray is too much.  Just a dab on the pulse points.  After about a half hour the swamp turns into an enchanted forest with a dark earthy Amber coming out play.  I LOVE you this scent!  It is magical and mysterious and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite and unique perfume since many years..... and I just love it!</li>
            <li> I received the EDP quickly, which was great, because I love this scent.  It&#x27;s a layered creation, and rewards one with each reveal, from the initial note to the lingering beauty of the sillage.  I cannot recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li> One of the all-time amber greats.  It&#x27;s mixed with spices, so if those notes are questionable for you, do sample before purchase.  It&#x27;s a HUGE fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am next to positive this is not the same perfume I purchased in Paris and loved.  It is much lighter and lacks the underlying rich scent.</li>
            <li> After my first spritz of this intoxicating perfume, I was immediately back in the middle east, browsing the bazaars and smelling the incense and hookah smoke. Each layer is unique and not for the faint of heart. I absolutely love Serge Lutens. Classy and sexy.</li>
            <li> AMBRE SULTAN is like Prince Husain&#x27;s journey in \\&quot;One Thousand and One Nights\\&quot;. This deliciously orange syrup is made of coriander, amber, oregano, bay leaf, myrtle, angelica root, sandalwood, patchouli, benzoin, and vanilla. From the first spritz you are transported to far off lands. The fragrance is strong and starts off with heavy almost medicinal herbs, which give way to the glorious and rich amber tempered by sandalwood and vanilla. The dry-down is amazing - reminds me of creme brulee. Unlike traditional amber fragrances, this is not powdery and light but rich and unctuous with great longevity and sillage all tempered by the masterful blending of ingredients. The benzoin and resins are quit prominent like incense burning in a mosque, which adds to the mystery. Serge Lutens and Christopher Seldrake (the \\&quot;nose\\&quot; behind this remarkable fragrance) are geniuses. I find that less is more with this fragrance, which is a monster and will last all day. Too much and it is offensive as this fragrance unfolds quickly and mysteriously like revealing the genie after rubbing a magic lamp. Highly recommend this fragrance if you are intrigued by exotic and faraway places. Wear this magical potion to be transported to far away lands, and you just might hear someone whisper - As-salam alaykum.</li>

            <li> Does not smell like the real one!!!</li>
            <li> As the title says, I am a male in my mid 20&#x27;s and wear this fragrance. I LOVE it. It&#x27;s not for everyone, and I tend to run with a crowd older than I (early 30s), so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a sweet authentic amber smell (if you are into fragrances). If you are not familiar with the terminology, it&#x27;s almost a damp vanilla incense smell (without any spicyness from the incense). I am pretty masculine, and feel wearing this adds a romantic/sexy softness that is a fitting and intriguing contrast. I keep this for relaxing nights out on the town (wouldnt wear to a club). Any sort of heat REALLY releases this smell in the air, so be careful when wearing it in the summer (another reason to not wear it in a club).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitey not for everyone, and given an opportunity, SAMPLE IT FIRST!</li>
            <li> This bottle may have sat around too long under suboptimal conditions, smells a bit harsher than what you get when you order from Lutens directly. Still great, though, and half the p,rice. needed it fast, too, which Lutens site doesn&#x27;t provide.</li>

It&#x27;s comforting, yet sexy, and it lasts. I&#x27;m not qualified to discuss the different notes, but I think many would say it&#x27;s a heavier scent for colder weather or nights. However, I&#x27;ve always bucked that trend, and I wear what I want, when I want. I LOVE this perfume.</li>
            <li> There is something momento mori about all of Lutens fragrances.  These are not perfumes for young ingenues, like nothing created by pop idols for mass marketing.  They scents add to the mystic of an older wiser more worldly woman.  I guess I feel that describes me.  When I wear this one to work and leave my coat in the closet, my fellow workers don&#x27;t even have to look to see if I am at my desk:  my new signature fragrances announce my arrival.  Just wish my menfolk gave me the same acknowledgements.</li>
            <li> It is when a perfume is produced in fact the boms perfumes are not produced arise from the creation of an artist, a perumista that in his gift of sensitivity and perception ofativa puts on her perfume his art his God-given gift to create something perfect These perfumes Serge Lutes are incredible, you realize sus aroma in herbs, the countryside, the climate environment through the aroma exhaled by esa creation. Its packaging is a very catchy simplicity of modern elegance nothing garnish after the perfume is not Santa</li>
            <li> I had another amber based cologne and the manufacture stopped producing it.  So I&#x27;m still trying to find a replacement.  Unfortunately, this is not it.  This seems to have some base to it that overwhelms the amber.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; scent.</li>
