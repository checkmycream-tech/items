            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>A reliable, great product..</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the razor I was using so decided to do a search for this one and found it on line.  </li>

            <li>I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It works excellent and i appreciate being able to obtain it.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor I have ever used, I had one for many years, but it got&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe the razors that comes with it, isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>Too many choices all we need is one good one; this  is it!</li>
            <li>My wife had been using one of these razors for years and had been looking for a replacement for quite sometime and was very happy with the fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I love it that I can still buy the blades for it anywhere!</li>
            <li>great product.. wish still available in the stores as well.</li>
            <li>I have really liked this razor.</li>
            <li>They are the absolute best razors ever made in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I own both, and have one in each of our two showers.</li>
            <li>very easy to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Yes, the handle is great but the razors, not so much.</li>
            <li>I love the contour and non-slip design.</li>
            <li>Make sure you store this with the body of the razor perpendicular to the ground, so the webbing drains.</li>
            <li>I wish that the cartridges that go with this razor had more rounded edges so that they don&#x27;t scratch or dig in when shaving.  </li>
            <li>Why do companies discontinue products that people love?</li>
            <li>Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I also love Shick Silk Effects.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This razor is just OK.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some reason most stores don&#x27;t carry them, which is why I came to Amazon and had to suck up the cost.  </li>
            <li>And although you can&#x27;t pick which color you get, the sender somehow knew that the teal was my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Sooooo glad I found it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but this is the most ergonomic razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Like this better, no cuts or pain</li>
            <li>Otherwise I&#x27;m very happy to have my favorite razor back.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i love the this razor and do not use any thing else for my body</li>
            <li>if not impossible!!!!  </li>
            <li>I used to use this razor all the time, and absolutely love the ergonomic design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we could still find this item so we could continue to use the blades.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I have looked in many stores trying to find this razor, can still find the refill cartridge</li>
            <li>I had not been able to find the razor in the store</li>
            <li>Then I bought 2 more.</li>
            <li>amazon is the most easy buying source i have ever used and their customer service is bar-none!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I rarely replace the body, so I suppose it&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li>I thought is wasn&#x27;t available any more because I can&#x27;t find it or the blades in the walk in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>I have arthritis in my hands and this razor is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The design of it is easy, not bulky.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased to have these, I have loved this razor for many years, they are easy to hold and don&#x27;t &amp;#34;nic&amp;#34; like other razors I have tried when I couldn&#x27;t find these.</li>
            <li>Hands down, this is the best razor I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I have the Venus now, and it is fine,</li>
            <li>Truly an awesome little razor that could.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy the men&#x27;s blades that fit this.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many razors currently being sold, and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I had blades and no base .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, including Venus, but none are as comfortable to hold as these.</li>
            <li>Had one  but finally gave out , so I was happy when I found it again.</li>
            <li>I am SO happy that someone was selling this holder so I could go back to the system I prefer.</li>
            <li>This razor is so comfortable to hold and to use.</li>
            <li>and it gives a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I mourned it when it was discontinued, and was excited to find some available, so I bought two, and tons of refills.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I was able to get a new Sensor Excel Razor.</li>
            <li>This razor head is a bit smaller than most and is excellent for the underarm and bikini areas where the larger razors (for legs) do not work so well.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to find it on line.  </li>
            <li>I would have loved to have a blue one as my original</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>just wish there was a rewards program or discounts for loyal customers that shop a ton on amazon</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find them that I bought 2 right away.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor and paid the high price because they do not seem to make them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For starters, it doesn&#x27;t have 4 blades + 3 huge moisturizing strips crammed onto one head, so it&#x27;s MUCH easier shaving between folds, etc.</li>
            <li>excellent and received the orange as opposed to the old green one.</li>
            <li>Something worth</li>
            <li>I extremely rarely get nicks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>also really liked the sky blue color I received.</li>
            <li>I had somewhat of a burial ceremony for the old one :)</li>
            <li>Have purchased all the other brands and styles and none of them work as smooth and effective as this style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost 2 handles already from travelling so much, but it is worth it!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just right for me.</li>
            <li>Razor came early and works fine.  </li>
            <li>Got lucky and got both a great new shaver and handle, plus the Orange color we wanted that was shown in the display but not able to specifically pick it.  </li>
            <li>thanks for keeping a supply on hand!  </li>
            <li>For some reason, the memory of this was better than how it actually works.  </li>
            <li>So glad that I finally found another one of these razors.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor, had one and left in a hotel 2 yrs ago</li>
            <li>I remember this being a better razor than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Razor was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It fits my old razors that I bought originally.</li>
            <li>Was a little pricer than I liked, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>All the new razors now slip out of my hand in the shower and never shave as close!!</li>
            <li>One tiny lotion strip at the top that doesn&#x27;t immediately fall apart, and a smooth shave every time, for a long time before the razor gives out.</li>
            <li>The flat handle area is easy for handling and use and is non-slip.  </li>
            <li>The blades are terrific and the shave is very close and smooth.</li>
            <li>This razor is so much easier to hold onto.</li>
            <li>I just wish these razors did not rust so fast.</li>
            <li>A real value item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;and does a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really hope this company will continue to offer the razor.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves this razor and was very upset when they went off the market.  </li>
            <li>If I had done this, I would probably still be using the original one I bought way back when.</li>
            <li>This razor is the only way to buy the original sensor excel which doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand.  </li>
            <li>The sensor excell has an easy grip handle when your hands are wet and soapy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to be vulgar, but this is the absolute best razor I have found for shaving the bikini area and uh... below.</li>
            <li>well we did, but it was an older one that was time to be replaced.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor ever, I&#x27;m mad Gillette no longer offers it.  </li>
            <li>really hope Gillette will bring it back since it is the only razor that seems to fit in my hand&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this to try and save some money since the refills are cheaper than the new razors.  </li>
            <li>I wish Gillette would develop a new razor with this handle design, but with 3-4 blades instead of 2, for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I came across this razor because they are almost impossible to find and they used to be a great product; they used to last years.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor and used it for years in the past.</li>
            <li>other thing that is really nice about this razor is the wide handle.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but fit my need.</li>
            <li>It looks so cheerful in my little shower.</li>
            <li>They stay firmly in your hand and are comfortable in your palm.</li>
            <li>Distributor took a long time to ship it, but overall it was worth it for the product itself.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this one will last me as long as my first one</li>
            <li>There is no other razor that works as well as this one.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find this razor now in stores - easy to find refills - estatic to get this holder - accidently left my old one in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>It has a nice wide handle so there is less slipping in your hand.</li>
            <li>have tried countless other razors and nothing gives me a better shave Down There than my senor excel!</li>
            <li>It still works fine for everyday use but for special occasions I will splurge on an expensive razor.</li>

            <li> I just wish these razors did not rust so fast.</li>
            <li> A real value item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;and does a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really hope this company will continue to offer the razor.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves this razor and was very upset when they went off the market.  </li>
            <li> If I had done this, I would probably still be using the original one I bought way back when.</li>
            <li> This razor is the only way to buy the original sensor excel which doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand.  </li>
            <li> The sensor excell has an easy grip handle when your hands are wet and soapy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be vulgar, but this is the absolute best razor I have found for shaving the bikini area and uh... below.</li>
            <li> well we did, but it was an older one that was time to be replaced.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor ever, I&#x27;m mad Gillette no longer offers it.  </li>
            <li> really hope Gillette will bring it back since it is the only razor that seems to fit in my hand&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and save some money since the refills are cheaper than the new razors.  </li>
            <li> I wish Gillette would develop a new razor with this handle design, but with 3-4 blades instead of 2, for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I came across this razor because they are almost impossible to find and they used to be a great product; they used to last years.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor and used it for years in the past.</li>
            <li> other thing that is really nice about this razor is the wide handle.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but fit my need.</li>
            <li> It looks so cheerful in my little shower.</li>
            <li> They stay firmly in your hand and are comfortable in your palm.</li>
            <li> Distributor took a long time to ship it, but overall it was worth it for the product itself.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this one will last me as long as my first one</li>
            <li> There is no other razor that works as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find this razor now in stores - easy to find refills - estatic to get this holder - accidently left my old one in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> It has a nice wide handle so there is less slipping in your hand.</li>
            <li> have tried countless other razors and nothing gives me a better shave Down There than my senor excel!</li>
            <li> It still works fine for everyday use but for special occasions I will splurge on an expensive razor.</li>
            <li> The Excel razor blades last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to maneuver in the shower while you&#x27;re trying to shave your legs at all sorts of tricky angles, and under the water stream of the shower they easily slip.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t have to find a replacement for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can get almost a month out of a single razor blade shaving every single day.</li>
            <li> I can see not one single advantage to the thin-handled razors.</li>
            <li> So, a little internet sleuthing later, and I have the holder in my hand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why all contemporary women&#x27;s razors have long thin handles, like men&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re now expected to use behemoths that cost close to $10 a pop, with blades that rust practically immediately in the shower, and with a shaving strip at the top of the razor that almost immediately loses chunks and becomes bumpy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The handle is wide, which means it doesn&#x27;t roll in your hand.</li>
            <li> I like the wide, rubber grip.  </li>
            <li> A big waste of money.</li>
            <li> This item was such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It feels sturdy and solid in my hands when they are wet and slick with soap.</li>
            <li> then it was due</li>
            <li> I have used the same razor for numerous years, so long that they had gone extinct in the store!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other razors but the are hard to hold onto, especially if your hands are soapy.</li>
            <li> They are super expensive!</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t know why this is so hard to find, been to several places to buy</li>
            <li> I love the razor, i HATE the blades.  </li>
            <li> I guess Gillette may still make the product down there.</li>
            <li> I wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive, but these are the only razor handles I can use due to a medical condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little bit shorter than other razors, which can make some of that tricky maneuvering a teensy bit less</li>
            <li> While giving an average shave on the legs, admittedly...it does do an admirable job on other, um, lady parts, that newer razors just can&#x27;t handle because of all the massive extra surface area from the weird oval shape and moisturizing strips and multiple blades and other crap that just can&#x27;t maneuver into the nooks and crannies for a decent tailored trim.  </li>
            <li> These new razors like the Venus and Intuition are increadibly uncomfortable for me.</li>
            <li> They were ALL green.  </li>
            <li> I have probably a dozen blades left for this razor and now the handle part is broken.  </li>
            <li> just wanted to use up my (ridiculously expensive) old blades.  </li>
            <li> The thin ones ALWAYS rotate in my soapy hand, and I inevitably cut myself.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> This style of razor was used as the base for the original movie prop.</li>
            <li> They are all truly terrible, and I feel like I&#x27;m causing scars on my legs by cutting myself more frequently.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this razor</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find item.</li>
            <li> But since the replacement blades are so blasted expensive now, I really use this razor for just the lady parts, and I keep a Venus razor for legs and armpits.</li>
            <li> i thought it was very expensive for something i bought just a year ago at wal-mart i only had to get another one becasue</li>
            <li> I was very sad, especially since I still had blades for it.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for a plastic razor</li>
            <li> (Not a good place to nick the skin.)</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m so addicted</li>
            <li> Even though outdated, this is what was needed.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as described and pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> sad it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> , I can no longer use a thin handle razer!  </li>
            <li> All those disposable razors for women are very difficult for someone with tremors to use.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to find in stores......</li>
            <li> :(.  </li>
            <li> However, I am extremely disappointed; the handle no longer holds a blade after one (1) month of use and there was no misuse of the product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the razor, i HATE the blades.  I&#x27;m going to buy the men&#x27;s blades that fit this.  Ordering a pack of Gillette Sensor3 Disposable Cartridge, 8 Count now.  It&#x27;s a 3blade, I&#x27;ll let you know how it goes.</li>
            <li> They were ALL green.  That&#x27;s okay since I can&#x27;t find them anymore.  I should be set now</li>
            <li> Have tried many razors currently being sold, and this is by far the best.  Got one for my daughter and neice as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be vulgar, but this is the absolute best razor I have found for shaving the bikini area and uh... below. For starters, it doesn&#x27;t have 4 blades + 3 huge moisturizing strips crammed onto one head, so it&#x27;s MUCH easier shaving between folds, etc. The handle is wide, which means it doesn&#x27;t roll in your hand. (Not a good place to nick the skin.) It&#x27;s also a little bit shorter than other razors, which can make some of that tricky maneuvering a teensy bit less tricky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried countless other razors and nothing gives me a better shave Down There than my senor excel! But since the replacement blades are so blasted expensive now, I really use this razor for just the lady parts, and I keep a Venus razor for legs and armpits.</li>
            <li> I had blades and no base . A little pricey, but fit my need.</li>
            <li> This is the best Razor! Can not buy in any store anymore. Have purchased all the other brands and styles and none of them work as smooth and effective as this style.</li>
            <li> Had the same make &amp; model for years....thanks for keeping a supply on hand!  Too many choices all we need is one good one; this  is it!</li>
            <li> This razor head is a bit smaller than most and is excellent for the underarm and bikini areas where the larger razors (for legs) do not work so well.  The flat handle area is easy for handling and use and is non-slip.  I have really liked this razor.</li>
            <li> All those disposable razors for women are very difficult for someone with tremors to use.  This razor is so much easier to hold onto.</li>
            <li> I wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive, but these are the only razor handles I can use due to a medical condition. I&#x27;ve used them since the sensors came out. They are the absolute best razors ever made in my opinion. I&#x27;ve tried others, including Venus, but none are as comfortable to hold as these. The Excel razor blades last a long time as well. I can get almost a month out of a single razor blade shaving every single day.</li>
            <li> Even though outdated, this is what was needed.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as described and pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Have extra blades,&lt;br /&gt;Great to find here..</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use this for my legs, but to convert into a Star Wars episode 1 Jedi communicator. This style of razor was used as the base for the original movie prop. Could be cheaper, but they&#x27;re out of production so I understand.</li>
            <li> It works great and I wish they still sold them on the market. It fits my old razors that I bought originally. I just wish these razors did not rust so fast.</li>
            <li> I remember using this razor when I was in HS and college.  Then they discontinued it and I started using the Venus razors. For some reason, the memory of this was better than how it actually works.  Yes, the handle is great but the razors, not so much. I never get cuts and nicks and did with this.  Maybe the razors that comes with it, isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> This totally ticks me off.  I have probably a dozen blades left for this razor and now the handle part is broken.  Something worth $5-6 bucks is now $25+.  Gold diggers.  It is a great razor with a close shave.  I have the Venus now, and it is fine, just wanted to use up my (ridiculously expensive) old blades.  Grrrrrr!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great razor!  I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these in the states for years, and finally just gave in to purchase it overseas.  Distributor took a long time to ship it, but overall it was worth it for the product itself.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this razor now in stores - easy to find refills - estatic to get this holder - accidently left my old one in Hawaii. Will hold on to this one forever! I love the contour and non-slip design.</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best razor I have ever used! I used a lot of different options before and finally bought this version 11 or so years ago. I juuuuussst had to replace the body last January because it had mildew in the web. Make sure you store this with the body of the razor perpendicular to the ground, so the webbing drains. If I had done this, I would probably still be using the original one I bought way back when.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I was able to get a new Sensor Excel Razor. I&#x27;ve tried other razors but the are hard to hold onto, especially if your hands are soapy. I wish that the cartridges that go with this razor had more rounded edges so that they don&#x27;t scratch or dig in when shaving.  But the razor itself is awesome. Why do companies discontinue products that people love?</li>
            <li> My wife had been using one of these razors for years and had been looking for a replacement for quite sometime and was very happy with the fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why all contemporary women&#x27;s razors have long thin handles, like men&#x27;s razors. They are difficult to maneuver in the shower while you&#x27;re trying to shave your legs at all sorts of tricky angles, and under the water stream of the shower they easily slip. Please bring back razors like this one. I love this razor and used it for years in the past. I also love Shick Silk Effects. I own both, and have one in each of our two showers. They stay firmly in your hand and are comfortable in your palm. They do not slip. The blades are terrific and the shave is very close and smooth. I can see not one single advantage to the thin-handled razors.</li>
            <li> This razor is the only way to buy the original sensor excel which doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this razor and I&#x27;m so happy that I did, happy, happy... A reliable, great product..</li>
            <li> This razor is just OK. Nothing special.</li>
            <li> i thought it was very expensive for something i bought just a year ago at wal-mart i only had to get another one becasue i left mine on a cruise i was on. If it gets lost againg im not buying another one. sad it was so expensive. i paid only 3.80 for the one i bought at wal-mart.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these 15 years ago and threw it away when I moved.  :(.  There is no other razor that works as well as this one.  I can use the same blade for months.  Problem is that it is no longer sold in stores.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with the razor I was using so decided to do a search for this one and found it on line.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that is really nice about this razor is the wide handle.  I have arthritis in my hands and this razor is so easy to use.  I never get nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> Now I know why I only buy these once every 10 years... They are super expensive! But I&#x27;m so addicted, I can no longer use a thin handle razer!  The thin ones ALWAYS rotate in my soapy hand, and I inevitably cut myself.  These are perfect!  For some reason most stores don&#x27;t carry them, which is why I came to Amazon and had to suck up the cost.  But I rarely replace the body, so I suppose it&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li> because its what I was looking for. Had one  but finally gave out , so I was happy when I found it again.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find this razor in stores!  While giving an average shave on the legs, admittedly...it does do an admirable job on other, um, lady parts, that newer razors just can&#x27;t handle because of all the massive extra surface area from the weird oval shape and moisturizing strips and multiple blades and other crap that just can&#x27;t maneuver into the nooks and crannies for a decent tailored trim.  Just sayin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Got lucky and got both a great new shaver and handle, plus the Orange color we wanted that was shown in the display but not able to specifically pick it.  Go Giants!! Would have given 5 stars if could have specifically picked the color I wanted.</li>
            <li> The state of women&#x27;s razors has deteriorated drastically in the last several years. We&#x27;re now expected to use behemoths that cost close to $10 a pop, with blades that rust practically immediately in the shower, and with a shaving strip at the top of the razor that almost immediately loses chunks and becomes bumpy and uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve tried regular razors. I&#x27;ve tried disposables. They are all truly terrible, and I feel like I&#x27;m causing scars on my legs by cutting myself more frequently. I kept seeing the cartridges for this product all over town, but not the holder. You can&#x27;t use the razor without the holder! So, a little internet sleuthing later, and I have the holder in my hand. The best women&#x27;s razor system ever made. One tiny lotion strip at the top that doesn&#x27;t immediately fall apart, and a smooth shave every time, for a long time before the razor gives out. Yes, it only has two blades. But this has never been a problem. I get a closer shave from this product than I ever did from any of those 5-blade Venus nightmares. I am SO happy that someone was selling this holder so I could go back to the system I prefer. And although you can&#x27;t pick which color you get, the sender somehow knew that the teal was my favorite. It looks so cheerful in my little shower. Thank you! And Gillette... you need to wake up and send this back to the stores! Truly an awesome little razor that could.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for years and it finally broke. Imagine my surprise that you can&#x27;t buy them at a store anymore. You can buy the blades for them, but not the razor. Why&#x27;s that? This is the best razor! It&#x27;s not a disposable so it doesn&#x27;t fill up the landfill. It has a nice wide handle so there is less slipping in your hand. I don&#x27;t know why they quit making them. Hopefully this one will last me as long as my first one and I won&#x27;t have to find a replacement for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  I thought is wasn&#x27;t available any more because I can&#x27;t find it or the blades in the walk in stores anymore.  Sooooo glad I found it here on Amazon.  I like the wide, rubber grip.  It feels sturdy and solid in my hands when they are wet and slick with soap.</li>
            <li> I have looked and looked for this razor.  Knew I would find it on Amazon!  Was a little pricer than I liked, but well worth it.  I have tried every razor out there, but keep coming back to this razor.  The design of it is easy, not bulky.  No frills, and just a great razor for my legs.  I love it that I can still buy the blades for it anywhere!</li>
            <li> I was excited when I came across this razor because they are almost impossible to find and they used to be a great product; they used to last years.  However, I am extremely disappointed; the handle no longer holds a blade after one (1) month of use and there was no misuse of the product.  A big waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find item. It works excellent and i appreciate being able to obtain it. A real value item.</li>
            <li> excellent and received the orange as opposed to the old green one. great product.. wish still available in the stores as well.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for a plastic razor but this is the most ergonomic razor I have ever used. I extremely rarely get nicks.&lt;br /&gt;I also really liked the sky blue color I received.</li>
            <li> Like this better, no cuts or pain</li>
            <li> Razor came early and works fine.  I would have loved to have a blue one as my original but I&#x27;ll get over the orange color eventually. Otherwise I&#x27;m very happy to have my favorite razor back.</li>
            <li> amazon is the most easy buying source i have ever used and their customer service is bar-none!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish there was a rewards program or discounts for loyal customers that shop a ton on amazon</li>
            <li> So glad that I finally found another one of these razors.  I had looked in all of my local stores and found none.</li>
            <li> been using one of these for years and when it broke I was very sad, especially since I still had blades for it. very easy to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, had one and left in a hotel 2 yrs ago and the venus I bought to replace it with doesn&#x27;t even compare to the sensor razor excel, don&#x27;t know why this is so hard to find, been to several places to buy but you can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used the same razor for numerous years, so long that they had gone extinct in the store!  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  I had somewhat of a burial ceremony for the old one :)</li>
            <li> I rated this product with four stars because I never used it. I got it for a friend, but she loves it!</li>
            <li> I remember this being a better razor than it actually is.  I bought this to try and save some money since the refills are cheaper than the new razors.  It does an the job, but it is not as comfy as the newer razors.  It still works fine for everyday use but for special occasions I will splurge on an expensive razor.</li>
            <li> I have one but I had that one since they came out. Love it. The handle it&#x27;s just right for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever used, I had one for many years, but it got&lt;br /&gt;accidentally thrown out so I HAD to replace it!!!</li>
            <li> i love the this razor and do not use any thing else for my body and i got it ealier then it was due</li>
            <li> This is the only razor that I use and have used it for years.  Very difficult to find in stores......if not impossible!!!!  It is the easiest razor to use!!!</li>
            <li> I used to use this razor all the time, and absolutely love the ergonomic design. I mourned it when it was discontinued, and was excited to find some available, so I bought two, and tons of refills. But then when I started using it again, I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting as close a shave as I had become accustomed to with the Schick Quattro. Now I truly regret the purchase. I wish Gillette would develop a new razor with this handle design, but with 3-4 blades instead of 2, for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> we had the blades for this but not the razor ... well we did, but it was an older one that was time to be replaced. I&#x27;m glad we could still find this item so we could continue to use the blades. thanks!</li>
            <li> The best razor ever!  I&#x27;ve lost 2 handles already from travelling so much, but it is worth it!  All the new razors now slip out of my hand in the shower and never shave as close!!</li>
            <li> Please gillette please bring back this razor. This razor is so comfortable to hold and to use. It doesn&#x27;t pull hair and I never get ingrowns with this razor. These new razors like the Venus and Intuition are increadibly uncomfortable for me. They always give me ingrowns and irrratition and never give me a close shave. The sensor excell has an easy grip handle when your hands are wet and soapy and it gives a close and comfortable shave. Love love love.</li>
            <li> I have looked in many stores trying to find this razor, can still find the refill cartridge but that&#x27;s it.  I am very pleased to have these, I have loved this razor for many years, they are easy to hold and don&#x27;t &amp;#34;nic&amp;#34; like other razors I have tried when I couldn&#x27;t find these.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor ever, I&#x27;m mad Gillette no longer offers it.  Nothing on the market compares and I don&#x27;t like their replacement...The Venus.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and paid the high price because they do not seem to make them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I really hope Gillette will bring it back since it is the only razor that seems to fit in my hand&lt;br /&gt;and does a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this company will continue to offer the razor.  I did note that it was imported from&lt;br /&gt;Brazil. I guess Gillette may still make the product down there.</li>
            <li> I had not been able to find the razor in the store so I was excited to find it on line.  Razor was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This item was such a waste of money. The blades do not shave as close as others such as the Venus. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this razor and was very upset when they went off the market.  I was so excited to find them that I bought 2 right away.  Then I bought 2 more.</li>
