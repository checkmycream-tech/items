            <li>Have  always loved these products.  </li>
            <li>I have loved every John Frieda product I have tried.</li>
            <li>My husband did mention that my hair is shinier and looks good in that regard, but agreed that it seemed like it was bleaching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>think this product would make anyone&#x27;s hair look good regardless of color tones.</li>
            <li>Also good for hair</li>
            <li>A splendid shampoo, which smells great and washes cleanly out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Much better than any Joico brand!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what they did to this formula, but I love it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pull this from shelves again--I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>On the whole I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>It adds a nice shine as well.  </li>
            <li>and she also liked the scent of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Also liked the look and style of bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will disclose that I opted to use my own conditioner instead of the companion product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>I liked the way it made my hair feel more conditioned after shampooing, even without using a separate conditioner.</li>
            <li>However I will still continue to use this because I love the smell</li>
            <li>Glad I can get them from prime now.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to prolong the coloring sessions by about three weeks and the hair looks shinier to boot.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was ok.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a while now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>of the things that I most like about John Frieda products is that unlike most shampoos, they are not tested on animals and they do not use animal products in their manufacture.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I have found for those that color their hair red.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it would be interesting to see what happened.</li>
            <li>Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate are found in most shampoos, but you don&#x27;t want them in a color-protecting shampoo because they strip the dye.  </li>
            <li>Then wash out and repeat for better results.</li>
            <li>But I needed more, so about a year ago, I decided to give this shampoo system one more try.</li>
            <li>AND I would love to see more from this line like color brightening sprays and even hair masks.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo-</li>
            <li>My stylist is always impressed that my hair is still red after 12 weeks.</li>
            <li>This has the ingredients to help color treated hair appear healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair an auburn shade for the better part of 20 years.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve always had dark-blonde hair, it turns lighter in the summer (I&#x27;m outdoors a lot) and more reddish in the winter months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost better than a</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for 20+ years and if the shampoo says it helps retain your color, it not being truthful.</li>
            <li>This is the best color enhancing shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve pretty much tried them all.)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the price is great too.</li>
            <li>This was pretty good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more smooth than most shampoos.</li>
            <li>I find it to be gentle, with good cleaning, and to lengthen the time the coloring stays in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love John Frieda products, so was excited to find this product and the conditioner to go with it.</li>
            <li>it is a joy to be able to give a shampoo a five on both aesthetic and moral grounds.</li>
            <li>In the very initial days after redying my hair, however, this did a really great job of keeping the color from stripping out more.</li>
            <li>Also made hair soft, worked surprisingly well as a shampoo, more like a shampoo meets a conditioner.</li>
            <li>i color my own hair and it either washes out too quickly or grows in too quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;The instructions say to follow this shampoo with their conditioning product, but I find it works fine by itself.</li>
            <li>This has long been one of my favorite brands of shampoo, and the conditioner is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it worked fine, but I also went and bought the Brunette conditioner from this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shampoo works fine.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>Yes, my hair is still red, so I&#x27;m still a happy camper.</li>
            <li>, my hair is still red, so I&#x27;m still a happy camper.</li>
            <li>My color looked fabulous two weeks after going to the salon.</li>
            <li>What I did notice regarding the coolor was that it was much more golden this time around.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much I have ordered more *</li>
            <li>The product smells great, and it works well with my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much so that my husband and eight year old son comment on how great my hair smells.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The day after, hair is still pleasantly clean</li>
            <li>It made my hair clean.</li>
            <li>I do not remember my hair fading to a strawberry blonde that was so silky and bright.  </li>
            <li>I have bright red hair and have been using this product for years.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers very well, smells OK and does seem to protect and enhance color.  </li>
            <li>Looking brilliant,and full of brightness.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the only products that i don&#x27;t have to use conditioner with because it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>So to me, it being color protecting but having sulfates doesn&#x27;t sound quite right to me.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a mild, sweet scent and cleans well without leaving hair feeling stripped.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, great scent and lathers up enough so that I can get all of my hair clean (not just the crown).</li>
            <li>I bought this because I dyed my hair red, which is very healthy (my hair).  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, lathered a lot the first time, so go sparingly until you figure out the right amount for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that most cosmetic corporations test on animals because they think it is a good idea</li>
            <li>I feel it really does help my dye jobs last longer, and it&#x27;s also a pleasant shampoo to use --</li>
            <li>Great job at brightening up my dulling hair, but a little drying.</li>
            <li>shampoo will not add red clumps of color in your hair, so if you are just looking to refreshing highlights or lowlights, this is a fine product to use.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper to buy it from Amazon and like getting it delivered to my house and free shipping.</li>
            <li>I would say my hair looks more natural, not as dull/flat in color that it can appear after 4 weeks</li>
            <li>or if it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>It works well and keep the color fresh.  </li>
            <li>but I also got great looking white hair with better control than I&#x27;ve had with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: A good hair product to keep the red vibrant.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner really make the color of my hair look more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Its probably as good as any other shampoo that has color protection.</li>
            <li>It adds a pick-me-up to the red color, which is great because red color fades quickly.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works well for keeping the color from fading as quickly, though it certainly still fades some.</li>
            <li>Followed by a conditioner, my hair was soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply, lathered well and rinsed off completely.</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner combo really keeps my color from fading, and makes it super shiny to boot.</li>
            <li>As well as very manageable!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no stripping and my color seems just as pretty three weeks after coloring as it did three days after coloring.  </li>
            <li>John Frieda Radiant Red Colour Protecting shampoo did a wonderful job of moisturizing her massive red tresses and the color brightened with each shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is more auburn with red highlights.</li>
            <li>This shampoo did bring out some of my red highlights and also boosted some reddish lowlights I had done at the salon many months ago.</li>
            <li>If you understand that it may not produce those results and are still interested,  then give it a try and see how it works with your tone.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The sulfates in this shampoo will more likely strip the color you have paid to add into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, gives a brilliant shine, and enhances color with little mess or inconvenience.</li>
            <li>That being said, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in actual shine of my hair and it does make my hair more oily, but it certainly protects the color.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t usually notice much difference in shampoos, but this one is better than most.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does seem to add a lot of shine and also makes the red more intense.</li>
            <li>As far as keeping my hair red, the best solution I&#x27;ve found is to mix a little bit of temporary hair dye, I use Alfaparf &amp;#34;Chili Red&amp;#34;, with my conditioner</li>
            <li>Worked great to bring out the red in my naturally auburn-streaked hair, and after I dyed my hair red</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it hurt my hair, but it certainly didn&#x27;t prolong the red or make more vibrant for mine.</li>
            <li>Made her hair feel fresh and new</li>
            <li>It always ends up running clear again quickly, then showing up on the towel when I get out.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner with it, but certainly will after seeing how well the shampoo works.  </li>
            <li>I do not wash my hair daily, which has left me wondering if the result would have been any different if it was used daily as stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for bottle red heads if you want great smelling silky hair that fades to a nice golden color.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d say it would work for anyone and works fine as a basic shampoo even.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing, but it actually helps brighten my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Really like this shampoo cause it is gentle to my hair and for those who color their hair, does not strip the color out.</li>
            <li>It does not really have a jelly substance as many in these types of tubes do.</li>
            <li>and* ordered the conditioner (which also works really well).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Smooth face and red curls everywhere</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>really like this shampoo a lot.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really all I was hoping for...</li>
            <li>The fragrance is yummy..fast shipping , reasonable price</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need much to lather up your hair</li>
            <li>I tried another brand, and was dissapointed in how fast my hair faded.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had darker red hair my entire life, kind of on the auburn side.</li>
            <li>I have colored hair, and it made my hair look more natural, not as flat in color.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really keeps the red in your hair, leaves it feeling clean and gives it a shine as well.</li>
            <li>I have other products that do a better job that I use instead.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my red any darker, but perks it up a bit  leaving it clean &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t colored red, but I like the way that it helps to nudge the red highlights to show a little more nicely.</li>
            <li>It is shampoo that gets the job done as far as cleaning the hair, but I honestly don&#x27;t think it makes much of a difference in keeping the red from fading - the water temperature you use in the shower is a bigger factor than anything -</li>
            <li>My wife has kinky red hair and is always ready to try something new because of her unique hair style.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair (I&#x27;m Puerto Rican) and it leaves my curls super soft and curly.</li>
            <li>The good thing about my hair is in general it holds color really well, but there is always a difference between freshly dyed hair a few weeks later hair.</li>
            <li>I did not find that it extended the true red tone</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and manageable, I liked that I can go longer without dyeing my hair to maintain my shade of red that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is good for softness and just adds a little bit of extra color each time.</li>
            <li>My hair now looks more like strawberry blonde than red.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and not too much was needed for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Most of my natural auburn is a distant memory</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only a couple bucks more than basic shampoos out there</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Initially, I thought this was only for people who have dyed their hair red, but it does a good job of balancing my natural color.</li>
            <li>Red hair fades very quickly and this product made color last much longer.</li>
            <li>Also, the product smells reminiscent of the actual hair dye itself and can be a bit overwhelming if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells or have a headache.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hue, as opposed to a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>The shampoo goes on well, and rinses out easily here in the local water (which is about middle of the road for hardness).</li>
            <li>so this month I will begin to use both products again though my hair is two different shades of brown right now (ombre).</li>
            <li>This is going to be my new go-to shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo originally to help keep by red hair red.</li>
            <li>Shampoos that help preserve red tones are important, as any natural or &#x27;bottle&#x27; red will attest to.</li>
            <li>First of all, the shampoo comes out as a red gel liquid.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s been my exact experience with John Frieda Radiant Red Colour</li>
            <li>Noticed hair a bit shinier, more luster than usual.</li>
            <li>Even after the first couple of uses I could see a big difference in my hair, it looked like I had just done the color as the shampoo brightened and refreshed my color.</li>
            <li>I tend to mix a little bit of this shampoo with color protector from Fantastic Sams.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more moisturizing, especially because it&#x27;s meant for color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love it if it was color depositing, but that&#x27;s a product that seems to be really hard to find.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo since I got old and my red hair started to need a little help.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would be great to use everyday because the buildup could eventually effect your scalp in a negative way.</li>
            <li>(Natural Instincts carribean mahogany)</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this three times (three strikes, you&#x27;re out), meaning after having my hair professionally colored on three separate occasions, using solely this product.</li>
            <li>It really helps my hair stay red.</li>
            <li>What it does very well is increase shine, which emphasizes red tones of color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a light shampoo that doesnt make my hair feel heavy after use.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead and the shampoo states that it is for all redheads</li>
            <li>I do a color-balancing wash at my salon to preserve my natural color and help brighten the brassier highlights.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the shampoo is the color of red medicine and has a very pleasing scent.  </li>
            <li>I felt that my hair was fading at the same rate but felt very silky.  </li>
            <li>I was quite surprised by the outcome of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It adds reddish highlights to even natural hair (</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on my hair, in that I don&#x27;t have a mass of dry tangles that need a ton of conditioner after I&#x27;ve shampooed my hair.  </li>
            <li>The length this happened was shortened with this shampoo, and the vibrancy of the freshly done color lasted about a few washes longer than normal.</li>
            <li>I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for three weeks now and my recently dyed medium auburn hair is still fading at the normal rate.  </li>
            <li>After one use it DID leave the color looking very bright but caused a TON of breakage and dried my hair out, which is nearly impossible beings I have naturally very oily hair.</li>
            <li>I generally go with salon brand shampoos that protect color</li>
            <li>BUT the Natural Instincts actually stood in my hair for a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural strawberry blonde...</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo and was surprised by several observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Keeps my color treated hair healthy and prevents the fading that typically happens within a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Even compared to other higher end brands, such as Joyco, I would recommend the John Frieda brands.</li>
            <li>A little of this product goes a long way as it lathers up way better than I expected!</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive or dry hair you may not want to use this product or you may want to mix it like I have too.</li>
            <li>The price could be a bit lower for my taste, but after using this product I am pretty reluctant to save a few bucks on something else.</li>
            <li>so I have some blonde in my hair along with mostly  light, red &amp; even a little dark red.</li>
            <li>This product says it \\&quot;Transforms red strands into vivid red color\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;There was no real transformation.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Have  always loved these products.  </li>
            <li> I have loved every John Frieda product I have tried.</li>
            <li> My husband did mention that my hair is shinier and looks good in that regard, but agreed that it seemed like it was bleaching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> think this product would make anyone&#x27;s hair look good regardless of color tones.</li>
            <li> Also good for hair</li>
            <li> A splendid shampoo, which smells great and washes cleanly out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Much better than any Joico brand!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they did to this formula, but I love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pull this from shelves again--I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> On the whole I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> It adds a nice shine as well.  </li>
            <li> and she also liked the scent of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Also liked the look and style of bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will disclose that I opted to use my own conditioner instead of the companion product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells nice.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this stuff!!  </li>
            <li> I liked the way it made my hair feel more conditioned after shampooing, even without using a separate conditioner.</li>
            <li> However I will still continue to use this because I love the smell</li>
            <li> Glad I can get them from prime now.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to prolong the coloring sessions by about three weeks and the hair looks shinier to boot.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was ok.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> of the things that I most like about John Frieda products is that unlike most shampoos, they are not tested on animals and they do not use animal products in their manufacture.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have found for those that color their hair red.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it would be interesting to see what happened.</li>
            <li> Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate are found in most shampoos, but you don&#x27;t want them in a color-protecting shampoo because they strip the dye.  </li>
            <li> Then wash out and repeat for better results.</li>
            <li> But I needed more, so about a year ago, I decided to give this shampoo system one more try.</li>
            <li> AND I would love to see more from this line like color brightening sprays and even hair masks.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo-</li>
            <li> My stylist is always impressed that my hair is still red after 12 weeks.</li>
            <li> This has the ingredients to help color treated hair appear healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair an auburn shade for the better part of 20 years.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve always had dark-blonde hair, it turns lighter in the summer (I&#x27;m outdoors a lot) and more reddish in the winter months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost better than a</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for 20+ years and if the shampoo says it helps retain your color, it not being truthful.</li>
            <li> This is the best color enhancing shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve pretty much tried them all.)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and the price is great too.</li>
            <li> This was pretty good shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more smooth than most shampoos.</li>
            <li> I find it to be gentle, with good cleaning, and to lengthen the time the coloring stays in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love John Frieda products, so was excited to find this product and the conditioner to go with it.</li>
            <li> it is a joy to be able to give a shampoo a five on both aesthetic and moral grounds.</li>
            <li> In the very initial days after redying my hair, however, this did a really great job of keeping the color from stripping out more.</li>
            <li> Also made hair soft, worked surprisingly well as a shampoo, more like a shampoo meets a conditioner.</li>
            <li> i color my own hair and it either washes out too quickly or grows in too quickly</li>
            <li> /&gt;The instructions say to follow this shampoo with their conditioning product, but I find it works fine by itself.</li>
            <li> This has long been one of my favorite brands of shampoo, and the conditioner is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it worked fine, but I also went and bought the Brunette conditioner from this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shampoo works fine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> Yes, my hair is still red, so I&#x27;m still a happy camper.</li>
            <li> , my hair is still red, so I&#x27;m still a happy camper.</li>
            <li> My color looked fabulous two weeks after going to the salon.</li>
            <li> What I did notice regarding the coolor was that it was much more golden this time around.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much I have ordered more *</li>
            <li> The product smells great, and it works well with my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much so that my husband and eight year old son comment on how great my hair smells.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The day after, hair is still pleasantly clean</li>
            <li> It made my hair clean.</li>
            <li> I do not remember my hair fading to a strawberry blonde that was so silky and bright.  </li>
            <li> I have bright red hair and have been using this product for years.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers very well, smells OK and does seem to protect and enhance color.  </li>
            <li> Looking brilliant,and full of brightness.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the only products that i don&#x27;t have to use conditioner with because it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> So to me, it being color protecting but having sulfates doesn&#x27;t sound quite right to me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a mild, sweet scent and cleans well without leaving hair feeling stripped.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, great scent and lathers up enough so that I can get all of my hair clean (not just the crown).</li>
            <li> I bought this because I dyed my hair red, which is very healthy (my hair).  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, lathered a lot the first time, so go sparingly until you figure out the right amount for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that most cosmetic corporations test on animals because they think it is a good idea</li>
            <li> I feel it really does help my dye jobs last longer, and it&#x27;s also a pleasant shampoo to use --</li>
            <li> Great job at brightening up my dulling hair, but a little drying.</li>
            <li> shampoo will not add red clumps of color in your hair, so if you are just looking to refreshing highlights or lowlights, this is a fine product to use.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper to buy it from Amazon and like getting it delivered to my house and free shipping.</li>
            <li> I would say my hair looks more natural, not as dull/flat in color that it can appear after 4 weeks</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> It works well and keep the color fresh.  </li>
            <li> but I also got great looking white hair with better control than I&#x27;ve had with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: A good hair product to keep the red vibrant.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner really make the color of my hair look more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Its probably as good as any other shampoo that has color protection.</li>
            <li> It adds a pick-me-up to the red color, which is great because red color fades quickly.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well for keeping the color from fading as quickly, though it certainly still fades some.</li>
            <li> Followed by a conditioner, my hair was soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply, lathered well and rinsed off completely.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner combo really keeps my color from fading, and makes it super shiny to boot.</li>
            <li> As well as very manageable!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no stripping and my color seems just as pretty three weeks after coloring as it did three days after coloring.  </li>
            <li> John Frieda Radiant Red Colour Protecting shampoo did a wonderful job of moisturizing her massive red tresses and the color brightened with each shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is more auburn with red highlights.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did bring out some of my red highlights and also boosted some reddish lowlights I had done at the salon many months ago.</li>
            <li> If you understand that it may not produce those results and are still interested,  then give it a try and see how it works with your tone.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The sulfates in this shampoo will more likely strip the color you have paid to add into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, gives a brilliant shine, and enhances color with little mess or inconvenience.</li>
            <li> That being said, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in actual shine of my hair and it does make my hair more oily, but it certainly protects the color.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually notice much difference in shampoos, but this one is better than most.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does seem to add a lot of shine and also makes the red more intense.</li>
            <li> As far as keeping my hair red, the best solution I&#x27;ve found is to mix a little bit of temporary hair dye, I use Alfaparf &amp;#34;Chili Red&amp;#34;, with my conditioner</li>
            <li> Worked great to bring out the red in my naturally auburn-streaked hair, and after I dyed my hair red</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it hurt my hair, but it certainly didn&#x27;t prolong the red or make more vibrant for mine.</li>
            <li> Made her hair feel fresh and new</li>
            <li> It always ends up running clear again quickly, then showing up on the towel when I get out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner with it, but certainly will after seeing how well the shampoo works.  </li>
            <li> I do not wash my hair daily, which has left me wondering if the result would have been any different if it was used daily as stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for bottle red heads if you want great smelling silky hair that fades to a nice golden color.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d say it would work for anyone and works fine as a basic shampoo even.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing, but it actually helps brighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo cause it is gentle to my hair and for those who color their hair, does not strip the color out.</li>
            <li> It does not really have a jelly substance as many in these types of tubes do.</li>
            <li> and* ordered the conditioner (which also works really well).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Smooth face and red curls everywhere</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> really like this shampoo a lot.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really all I was hoping for...</li>
            <li> The fragrance is yummy..fast shipping , reasonable price</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need much to lather up your hair</li>
            <li> I tried another brand, and was dissapointed in how fast my hair faded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had darker red hair my entire life, kind of on the auburn side.</li>
            <li> I have colored hair, and it made my hair look more natural, not as flat in color.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really keeps the red in your hair, leaves it feeling clean and gives it a shine as well.</li>
            <li> I have other products that do a better job that I use instead.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my red any darker, but perks it up a bit  leaving it clean &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t colored red, but I like the way that it helps to nudge the red highlights to show a little more nicely.</li>
            <li> It is shampoo that gets the job done as far as cleaning the hair, but I honestly don&#x27;t think it makes much of a difference in keeping the red from fading - the water temperature you use in the shower is a bigger factor than anything -</li>
            <li> My wife has kinky red hair and is always ready to try something new because of her unique hair style.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair (I&#x27;m Puerto Rican) and it leaves my curls super soft and curly.</li>
            <li> The good thing about my hair is in general it holds color really well, but there is always a difference between freshly dyed hair a few weeks later hair.</li>
            <li> I did not find that it extended the true red tone</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and manageable, I liked that I can go longer without dyeing my hair to maintain my shade of red that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is good for softness and just adds a little bit of extra color each time.</li>
            <li> My hair now looks more like strawberry blonde than red.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and not too much was needed for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Most of my natural auburn is a distant memory</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a couple bucks more than basic shampoos out there</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Initially, I thought this was only for people who have dyed their hair red, but it does a good job of balancing my natural color.</li>
            <li> Red hair fades very quickly and this product made color last much longer.</li>
            <li> Also, the product smells reminiscent of the actual hair dye itself and can be a bit overwhelming if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells or have a headache.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hue, as opposed to a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> The shampoo goes on well, and rinses out easily here in the local water (which is about middle of the road for hardness).</li>
            <li> so this month I will begin to use both products again though my hair is two different shades of brown right now (ombre).</li>
            <li> This is going to be my new go-to shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo originally to help keep by red hair red.</li>
            <li> Shampoos that help preserve red tones are important, as any natural or &#x27;bottle&#x27; red will attest to.</li>
            <li> First of all, the shampoo comes out as a red gel liquid.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s been my exact experience with John Frieda Radiant Red Colour</li>
            <li> Noticed hair a bit shinier, more luster than usual.</li>
            <li> Even after the first couple of uses I could see a big difference in my hair, it looked like I had just done the color as the shampoo brightened and refreshed my color.</li>
            <li> I tend to mix a little bit of this shampoo with color protector from Fantastic Sams.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little more moisturizing, especially because it&#x27;s meant for color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love it if it was color depositing, but that&#x27;s a product that seems to be really hard to find.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo since I got old and my red hair started to need a little help.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would be great to use everyday because the buildup could eventually effect your scalp in a negative way.</li>
            <li> (Natural Instincts carribean mahogany)</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this three times (three strikes, you&#x27;re out), meaning after having my hair professionally colored on three separate occasions, using solely this product.</li>
            <li> It really helps my hair stay red.</li>
            <li> What it does very well is increase shine, which emphasizes red tones of color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a light shampoo that doesnt make my hair feel heavy after use.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead and the shampoo states that it is for all redheads</li>
            <li> I do a color-balancing wash at my salon to preserve my natural color and help brighten the brassier highlights.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the shampoo is the color of red medicine and has a very pleasing scent.  </li>
            <li> I felt that my hair was fading at the same rate but felt very silky.  </li>
            <li> I was quite surprised by the outcome of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It adds reddish highlights to even natural hair (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on my hair, in that I don&#x27;t have a mass of dry tangles that need a ton of conditioner after I&#x27;ve shampooed my hair.  </li>
            <li> The length this happened was shortened with this shampoo, and the vibrancy of the freshly done color lasted about a few washes longer than normal.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for three weeks now and my recently dyed medium auburn hair is still fading at the normal rate.  </li>
            <li> After one use it DID leave the color looking very bright but caused a TON of breakage and dried my hair out, which is nearly impossible beings I have naturally very oily hair.</li>
            <li> I generally go with salon brand shampoos that protect color</li>
            <li> BUT the Natural Instincts actually stood in my hair for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural strawberry blonde...</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo and was surprised by several observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Keeps my color treated hair healthy and prevents the fading that typically happens within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Even compared to other higher end brands, such as Joyco, I would recommend the John Frieda brands.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way as it lathers up way better than I expected!</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive or dry hair you may not want to use this product or you may want to mix it like I have too.</li>
            <li> The price could be a bit lower for my taste, but after using this product I am pretty reluctant to save a few bucks on something else.</li>
            <li> so I have some blonde in my hair along with mostly  light, red &amp; even a little dark red.</li>
            <li> This product says it \\&quot;Transforms red strands into vivid red color\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;There was no real transformation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is gentle on my 50 year old, color treated, dry, thick, curly, neck length, Irish hair.</li>
            <li> Red is always hard to maintain and to keep the color in, but my hair tends to take it pretty well.  </li>
            <li> def helps brighten my red highlights (i am not a natural redhead).  </li>
            <li> My hair does appear to be less dull and my hair feels very clean and not weighed down after conditioning.</li>
            <li> None of the times did this do anything differently than any other regular sulfate-free product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to come on here and write that this product kept my red color treated hair vivid and brighter for longer, but unfortunately,  I can not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair continuously red and a lot less of a hassle that way because this brand of temporary dye is similar to a conditioner texture as it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a redhead for 20 years now and other than a color-depositing shampoo/conditioner, I&#x27;ve yet to find a product that actually works.</li>
            <li> DOG, on the other hand...&lt;br /&gt;One of my pups is an American Water Spaniel.</li>
            <li> I personally use it every other day.</li>
            <li> My hair began to feel dry upon using it</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Hair coloring is expensive (if done professionally), so I ordered this to see if it really helps keep that color between sessions.</li>
            <li> The only down bringer for me is this product makes my head itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> The frizz and smell are just not worth it to me, especially since my color is fading anyway.</li>
            <li> My hair is brunette, but I add dark red highlights to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried color enhancing shampoos before, and either they are hard to use (i.e., they don&#x27;t foam up and actually clean your hair), or they are hard to use (leave on your hair half an hour??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead, but my hair can look dull sometimes.  </li>
            <li> My hair is waist length, undyed and unprocessed.</li>

            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is medium red, extremely thick and rather coarse..</li>
            <li> For my part I try very hard not to buy any cosmetics that have animal products (usually included in the form of protein) as ingredients or that have been tested on animals, and I very much appreciate quality options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love John Frieda products, so was excited to find this product and the conditioner to go with it. I have other products that do a better job that I use instead.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal. The only down bringer for me is this product makes my head itchy and dry. I tend to mix a little bit of this shampoo with color protector from Fantastic Sams. Otherwise it keeps my hair fading rapidly. If you have very sensitive or dry hair you may not want to use this product or you may want to mix it like I have too. As for delivery it was on time and packaging was very simple.</li>
            <li> I LOVEEEEE this product ! I have naturally curly hair (I&#x27;m Puerto Rican) and it leaves my curls super soft and curly. As well as very manageable! I use both the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. I used this product while I had a sort of auburn color in my hair (Natural Instincts carribean mahogany) I thought it would continue to deposit color into my hair it didn&#x27;t BUT the Natural Instincts actually stood in my hair for a while. I was using this product along with taking biotin vitamins my hair was beginning to feel fuller I don&#x27;t know if it was because of the biotin or the combination of both so this month I will begin to use both products again though my hair is two different shades of brown right now (ombre). So now I&#x27;m thankful it doesn&#x27;t deposit red into my hair lol. ALSO, the product smells REALLY good ! I tried the John Freida &amp;#34;brilliant brunette&amp;#34; &amp; I HATED it .. My hair began to feel dry upon using it I couldn&#x27;t figure out why then I remembered I changed up shampoos&amp; conditioners. That was a total disappointment ! I would totally recommend this to anyone !</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for three weeks now and my recently dyed medium auburn hair is still fading at the normal rate.  My hair does appear to be less dull and my hair feels very clean and not weighed down after conditioning. However, my hair terribly frizzy!!  Also, the product smells reminiscent of the actual hair dye itself and can be a bit overwhelming if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells or have a headache. I will continue to use it, at least until it&#x27;s gone but I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase it. The frizz and smell are just not worth it to me, especially since my color is fading anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo originally to help keep by red hair red. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t really do anything for color protection. However I will still continue to use this because I love the smell and it makes my hair really soft. As far as keeping my hair red, the best solution I&#x27;ve found is to mix a little bit of temporary hair dye, I use Alfaparf &amp;#34;Chili Red&amp;#34;, with my conditioner and it keeps my hair continuously red and a lot less of a hassle that way because this brand of temporary dye is similar to a conditioner texture as it is.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stop my hair from fading</li>
            <li> Have  always loved these products.  Glad I can get them from prime now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a redhead for 20 years now and other than a color-depositing shampoo/conditioner, I&#x27;ve yet to find a product that actually works. I&#x27;ve tried this three times (three strikes, you&#x27;re out), meaning after having my hair professionally colored on three separate occasions, using solely this product. None of the times did this do anything differently than any other regular sulfate-free product.</li>
            <li> My husband is nicknamed “Red” for the obvious reason, and this keeps his color visible as he hair tuns white-blonde over the years. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers very well, smells OK and does seem to protect and enhance color.  I&#x27;d love it if it was color depositing, but that&#x27;s a product that seems to be really hard to find.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really keeps the red in your hair, leaves it feeling clean and gives it a shine as well. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Yes, my hair is still red, so I&#x27;m still a happy camper. The shampoo does the trick but if you&#x27;re in the mood for a little conditioning that doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo cause it is gentle to my hair and for those who color their hair, does not strip the color out. So much cheaper to buy it from Amazon and like getting it delivered to my house and free shipping.</li>
            <li> Great job at brightening up my dulling hair, but a little drying. Need to use a leave in conditioner, too.</li>
            <li> Check out my review on the conditioner by the same manufacturer.  Love love LOVE this stuff!!  I will buy this again and again!</li>
            <li> Love this.  It really helps my hair stay red.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I dyed my hair red, which is very healthy (my hair).  After one use it DID leave the color looking very bright but caused a TON of breakage and dried my hair out, which is nearly impossible beings I have naturally very oily hair.</li>
            <li> Some shampoos just don&#x27;t lather up enough or luxuriously enough, but this one does!  The price could be a bit lower for my taste, but after using this product I am pretty reluctant to save a few bucks on something else.</li>
            <li> Keeps my color treated hair healthy and prevents the fading that typically happens within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Size Name: Shampoo, Pack of 2 Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my hair is still red, so I&#x27;m still a happy camper. The shampoo does the trick but if you&#x27;re in the mood for a little conditioning that doesn&#x27;t hurt either</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t let the shampoo&#x27;s shiny red color freak you out.  Easy to apply, lathered a lot the first time, so go sparingly until you figure out the right amount for you. My color looked fabulous two weeks after going to the salon. After using this shampoo weekly for a month I can see that it added shine and amped up the intensity of the color, it boosted highlights &amp; amplified the lowlights from the toner my stylist applies. I would say my hair looks more natural, not as dull/flat in color that it can appear after 4 weeks (I have mine treated every 6 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle on my 50 year old, color treated, dry, thick, curly, neck length, Irish hair. Followed by a conditioner, my hair was soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural strawberry blonde...so I have some blonde in my hair along with mostly  light, red &amp; even a little dark red. This John Frieda Radiant Red Shampoo seems to add the  slightest hint of red to the blonde. It doesn&#x27;t make my red any darker, but perks it up a bit  leaving it clean &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a mild, sweet scent and cleans well without leaving hair feeling stripped. What it does very well is increase shine, which emphasizes red tones of color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have always had red highlights in my hair. This product says it \\&quot;Transforms red strands into vivid red color\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;There was no real transformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no real significant fragrance either. The shampoo itself is slightly thicker than a shampoo that has a heavy creamy texture. It does not really have a jelly substance as many in these types of tubes do. It was easy to apply, lathered well and rinsed off completely.</li>
            <li> I love this.  It&#x27;s very gentle on my hair, in that I don&#x27;t have a mass of dry tangles that need a ton of conditioner after I&#x27;ve shampooed my hair.  There&#x27;s no stripping and my color seems just as pretty three weeks after coloring as it did three days after coloring.  I love this product so much I have ordered more *and* ordered the conditioner (which also works really well).</li>
            <li> This shampoo will save you money. It maintains the depth and intensity of your color in between the colorings. i color my own hair and it either washes out too quickly or grows in too quickly or I accidentally leave spots in some places. Instead of recoloring and having to mix the coloring again, not to mention the time required to color the hair and wait for it to sit, I use this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been able to prolong the coloring sessions by about three weeks and the hair looks shinier to boot.</li>
            <li> This was pretty good shampoo.  It comes out of the tube a translucent red color but lathers up white.  It creates a LOT of lather!  It does not add red color to your hair.  The fragrance was ok.  I wish it was a little more moisturizing, especially because it&#x27;s meant for color-treated hair.  Overall, I feel like it might be a little gimmicky and I&#x27;d probably recommend looking for an all-purpose moisturizing color-protecting shampoo.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> i have nothing bad to say. it&#x27;s a light shampoo that doesnt make my hair feel heavy after use.  it def helps brighten my red highlights (i am not a natural redhead).  i use it everytime i wash my hair, every couple of days.  defintely use it with conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now and absolutely love it. Red hair fades very quickly and this product made color last much longer. It also hydrates both the hair and scalp. Some shampoos and conditioners irritate my scalp after using it for some time and this product does not do that. Even compared to other higher end brands, such as Joyco, I would recommend the John Frieda brands.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo since I got old and my red hair started to need a little help. I feel it really does help my dye jobs last longer, and it&#x27;s also a pleasant shampoo to use -- so I subscribe to it.</li>
            <li> Worked great to bring out the red in my naturally auburn-streaked hair, and after I dyed my hair red it helped keep the color bright! I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Much better than any Joico brand!  Doesn&#x27;t leave a film and doesn&#x27;t smell like plastic!</li>
            <li> Hair coloring is expensive (if done professionally), so I ordered this to see if it really helps keep that color between sessions. I find it to be gentle, with good cleaning, and to lengthen the time the coloring stays in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to follow this shampoo with their conditioning product, but I find it works fine by itself. The shampoo goes on well, and rinses out easily here in the local water (which is about middle of the road for hardness). It appears to provide about a 20% boost in the length of time that the red color will hold it&#x27;s hue, as opposed to a normal shampoo. So it seems to work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: A good hair product to keep the red vibrant. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have loved every John Frieda product I have tried. This one is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need very little product to get a ton of shampoo. The product smells great, and it works well with my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually notice much difference in shampoos, but this one is better than most.</li>
            <li> A splendid shampoo, which smells great and washes cleanly out of my hair. This has long been one of my favorite brands of shampoo, and the conditioner is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that I most like about John Frieda products is that unlike most shampoos, they are not tested on animals and they do not use animal products in their manufacture. I&#x27;m not sure that most cosmetic corporations test on animals because they think it is a good idea - I suspect it isn&#x27;t the case at all. I suspect these are decisions generated by corporate legal departments, fearful of liability. For my part I try very hard not to buy any cosmetics that have animal products (usually included in the form of protein) as ingredients or that have been tested on animals, and I very much appreciate quality options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is a joy to be able to give a shampoo a five on both aesthetic and moral grounds.</li>
            <li> Shampoos that help preserve red tones are important, as any natural or &#x27;bottle&#x27; red will attest to. It is the most difficult color to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on myself, but I only have streaks of red.&lt;br /&gt;My DOG, on the other hand...&lt;br /&gt;One of my pups is an American Water Spaniel. Smooth face and red curls everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;She got into a bit of mess, I grabbed this and sudsed her body (not her face) up.&lt;br /&gt;Her coat looks as red as when she was a pup!</li>
            <li> This shampoo does seem to add a lot of shine and also makes the red more intense. It does not change the highlights and lowlights. I have colored hair, and it made my hair look more natural, not as flat in color. I liked the way it made my hair feel more conditioned after shampooing, even without using a separate conditioner. I think this is great if you&#x27;re a proud red-head like me!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is medium red, extremely thick and rather coarse.. John Frieda Radiant Red Colour Protecting shampoo did a wonderful job of moisturizing her massive red tresses and the color brightened with each shampoo. We will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> I dis like it. looking not good. prduct has leakage, insufficient packing. feeling down. i hope after have improve. thanks.</li>
            <li> This is good for softness and just adds a little bit of extra color each time. My hair isn&#x27;t colored red, but I like the way that it helps to nudge the red highlights to show a little more nicely. On the whole I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> This is going to be my new go-to shampoo.  I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner with it, but certainly will after seeing how well the shampoo works.  This is the best shampoo I have found for those that color their hair red.  It adds a pick-me-up to the red color, which is great because red color fades quickly. It adds a nice shine as well.  A little of this product goes a long way as it lathers up way better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I am a red head and I love this shampoo!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife has kinky red hair and is always ready to try something new because of her unique hair style. She said it worked well with her hair. Made her hair feel fresh and new and she also liked the scent of the shampoo. Also liked the look and style of bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would use again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner combo really keeps my color from fading, and makes it super shiny to boot. The only thing keeping it from a 5-star rating is the fact that neither is color depositing. I was hoping for a little color to help camouflage emerging \\&quot;roots\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead and the shampoo states that it is for all redheads so I thought it would be interesting to see what happened. First of all, the shampoo comes out as a red gel liquid. After using it for about a week, my hair has been dryer (even with moisturizing conditioner) and also my hair is a little bleached. My hair now looks more like strawberry blonde than red. My husband did mention that my hair is shinier and looks good in that regard, but agreed that it seemed like it was bleaching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall it dries out my hair and has bleached it. I will not be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> The problems with this shampoo start with the ingredient list.  Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate are found in most shampoos, but you don&#x27;t want them in a color-protecting shampoo because they strip the dye.  That&#x27;s been my exact experience with John Frieda Radiant Red Colour Protecting Shampoo: dull color, not a preserved red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does well enough at cleaning my hair, but it is terrible for the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a non-color depositing but color-protecting shampoo, I much prefer TIGI Bed Head Dumb Blonde.</li>
            <li> This shampoo ,with its simple scent. Will help you keep your red hair color . Looking brilliant,and full of brightness. I use about a quarter size in my hand. I let  the shampoo sit in while rubbing it.  Then wash out and repeat for better results. Smells good. N or overpowering with fragrance. Very great for color. Brings out the best.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price. Don&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but it seems to do the job. Smells awesome, though!</li>
            <li> I am not a fiery red head. My hair is more auburn with red highlights. This shampoo did bring out some of my red highlights and also boosted some reddish lowlights I had done at the salon many months ago. It smells nice, and not too much was needed for my thick hair. I used Carol&#x27;s Daughter conditioner with this and it worked fine, but I also went and bought the Brunette conditioner from this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo will not add red clumps of color in your hair, so if you are just looking to refreshing highlights or lowlights, this is a fine product to use. Because it doesn&#x27;t actually leave any color behind, it will not cover gray hairs. I took one star off, because my hair is a bit frizzy after using it. I usually wear my hair up anyway, so I am not too upset about this, but if you have curly hair (I have wimpy spirals), you may want to use a curl based conditioner or other moisturizing product with it.</li>
            <li> Most of my natural auburn is a distant memory but I still have about 25% of it, the rest white. My hair is waist length, undyed and unprocessed. I was hoping this shampoo would help just a bit making my still-has-some-color hair shine a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this shampoo a lot. It cleans very well, great scent and lathers up enough so that I can get all of my hair clean (not just the crown). I know this shampoo imparts no color but I do see increased shine in my dark reddish parts with ongoing use. That&#x27;s really all I was hoping for... but I also got great looking white hair with better control than I&#x27;ve had with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product would make anyone&#x27;s hair look good regardless of color tones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had darker red hair my entire life, kind of on the auburn side. It tends to change color depending on the season, so about twice a year I do a color-balancing wash at my salon to preserve my natural color and help brighten the brassier highlights. But I needed more, so about a year ago, I decided to give this shampoo system one more try. I don&#x27;t know what they did to this formula, but I love it! Not only does it smell amazing, but it actually helps brighten my hair. Initially, I thought this was only for people who have dyed their hair red, but it does a good job of balancing my natural color. I haven&#x27;t even had the need to try a cranberry rinse to balance it, because this does the trick! It also make styling my hair easier because there is less frizz when I use it. Don&#x27;t pull this from shelves again--I love it! AND I would love to see more from this line like color brightening sprays and even hair masks.</li>
            <li> John Frieda products are truly the best. I love this shampoo-i have auburn hair and it keeps my color and my hair is &amp;#34;SUPER SHINEY&amp;#34;. This is probably one of the only products that i don&#x27;t have to use conditioner with because it&#x27;s that good. I highly recommend this product and the price is great too.</li>
            <li> So part of this is my fault for not doing enough research. But after I had bought it, I found a list of ingredients this shampoo has and it has a bunch of sulfates in it (which strips hair color out). So to me, it being color protecting but having sulfates doesn&#x27;t sound quite right to me. Not wanting to risk it, I shipped these back and went on a hunt for a sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is great shampoo the bottle those bends and it hard to get shampoo out to use it without feel as if you are wasting it</li>
            <li> I really wanted to come on here and write that this product kept my red color treated hair vivid and brighter for longer, but unfortunately,  I can not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the shampoo is the color of red medicine and has a very pleasing scent.  So much so that my husband and eight year old son comment on how great my hair smells.  I felt that my hair was fading at the same rate but felt very silky.  What I did notice regarding the coolor was that it was much more golden this time around.  I do not remember my hair fading to a strawberry blonde that was so silky and bright.  I will disclose that I opted to use my own conditioner instead of the companion product.  On the labeling it does say to use &#x27;daily&#x27;... I do not wash my hair daily, which has left me wondering if the result would have been any different if it was used daily as stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for bottle red heads if you want great smelling silky hair that fades to a nice golden color.  This is what happened to my hair; your mileage may vary.  I did not find that it extended the true red tone but it also didnt fade and feel like straw.  If you understand that it may not produce those results and are still interested,  then give it a try and see how it works with your tone.</li>
            <li> The good thing about my hair is in general it holds color really well, but there is always a difference between freshly dyed hair a few weeks later hair. This shampoo works well for keeping the color from fading as quickly, though it certainly still fades some. In the very initial days after redying my hair, however, this did a really great job of keeping the color from stripping out more. For whatever reason, for several washes after the initial dye job, my hair will bleed out, both in the shower and on the towel afterwards. It always ends up running clear again quickly, then showing up on the towel when I get out. The length this happened was shortened with this shampoo, and the vibrancy of the freshly done color lasted about a few washes longer than normal. That being said, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in actual shine of my hair and it does make my hair more oily, but it certainly protects the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead, but my hair can look dull sometimes.  This shampoo and conditioner really make the color of my hair look more vibrant.  My hair feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair red and this seems to be the only shampoo that helps to brighten the color, but also helps balance my scalp. I have oily hair and dry scalp. This is the only shampoo that seems to help with that probably. I have been using this shampoo for about 8 months and will never go to another shampoo again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! The fragrance is yummy..fast shipping , reasonable price</li>
            <li> I color my hair and this makes a big difference. My stylist is always impressed that my hair is still red after 12 weeks. I really only need my roots done anymore, because the color holds well with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Noticed hair a bit shinier, more luster than usual. Also made hair soft, worked surprisingly well as a shampoo, more like a shampoo meets a conditioner. It&#x27;s more smooth than most shampoos. Also good for hair that&#x27;s red or hair with red undertones but I&#x27;d say it would work for anyone and works fine as a basic shampoo even. This has the ingredients to help color treated hair appear healthy and shiny. For the price and the name it&#x27;s on par or a steal for the results you&#x27;re getting. It&#x27;s only a couple bucks more than basic shampoos out there so if you have red hair I&#x27;d definitely give it a shot and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair an auburn shade for the better part of 20 years. Red is always hard to maintain and to keep the color in, but my hair tends to take it pretty well.  I generally go with salon brand shampoos that protect color but I tried this specifically since it was for red hair. It is shampoo that gets the job done as far as cleaning the hair, but I honestly don&#x27;t think it makes much of a difference in keeping the red from fading - the water temperature you use in the shower is a bigger factor than anything - but since this makes the claim that it helps protect the red, I&#x27;d have to call B.S. on this one. I don&#x27;t think it hurt my hair, but it certainly didn&#x27;t prolong the red or make more vibrant for mine. Its probably as good as any other shampoo that has color protection.</li>
            <li> For the price this product works great. It doesn&#x27;t add any color to your hair, but I believe it coats it to prevent fading (similar to Pantene) and has no stripping agents in it. I don&#x27;t think it would be great to use everyday because the buildup could eventually effect your scalp in a negative way. It has a fruity smell and does leave your hair feeling softer. I personally use it every other day. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo to add a bit of color protection to my read shoulder-length curly hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helps keep his red hair as red as he thinks it does or if it&#x27;s worth the price but he likes it so I get it for him.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised by the outcome of this shampoo.  While I&#x27;ve always had dark-blonde hair, it turns lighter in the summer (I&#x27;m outdoors a lot) and more reddish in the winter months. I tried this shampoo and was surprised by several observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much to lather up your hair&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant aroma&lt;br /&gt;It adds reddish highlights to even natural hair (uncolored)&lt;br /&gt;It works deeply into the folicles&lt;br /&gt;The day after, hair is still pleasantly clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something I&#x27;m taking on my next road trip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried color enhancing shampoos before, and either they are hard to use (i.e., they don&#x27;t foam up and actually clean your hair), or they are hard to use (leave on your hair half an hour?? Nothing like having a rapidly cooling mop of wet hair on your head!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Frieda&#x27;s Radiant Red is definitely different. Easy to use, gives a brilliant shine, and enhances color with little mess or inconvenience. My hair is brunette, but I add dark red highlights to it. This shampoo makes my hair shine like glass and the red highlights just gleam. It&#x27;s almost better than a retouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend. This is the best color enhancing shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve pretty much tried them all.)</li>
            <li> Even after the first couple of uses I could see a big difference in my hair, it looked like I had just done the color as the shampoo brightened and refreshed my color. It left my hair soft and manageable, I liked that I can go longer without dyeing my hair to maintain my shade of red that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Not impressed. If you would like to keep your colored red hair, don&#x27;t wash it as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo works fine. It cleans your hair. It will not deposit color or keep your hair red. The sulfates in this shampoo will more likely strip the color you have paid to add into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice. It made my hair clean. But it also removed quite a bit of my red each time I washed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for 20+ years and if the shampoo says it helps retain your color, it not being truthful.</li>
            <li> I have bright red hair and have been using this product for years.  It works well and keep the color fresh.  This 2-pack is cheaper than my local grocery.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo and contitioner I will use on my color treated hair.  I tried another brand, and was dissapointed in how fast my hair faded.</li>
