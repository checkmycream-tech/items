            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>(more potent ?)</li>
            <li>Do I need the Vit C serum so that it will absorb better or another</li>
            <li>This works, I&#x27;ll buy more</li>
            <li>Used mostly as a moisturizer, hyaluronic acid can hold up to 3,000 times its weight in water.</li>
            <li>This one seem to be one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>lid crack and part of this precious liquid inside the bubble rap...</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m waiting one more week for this bottle..</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I have used it many times since I received it.</li>
            <li>It felt so lovely when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>but I am well pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am sure it&#x27;s a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what my face looks like after using it for a month or two!</li>
            <li>I believe reviews should be honest regardless of whether an item was received free, at a discount, or purchased at full price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hyaluronic acid is safe for even the most sensitive of skin types, making it a popular ingredient for many skin care</li>
            <li>/&gt;this arrived very quickly, was sealed well and was not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>good clean fast product</li>
            <li>i ordered this product to help with all the fine lines around the eyes and they have not disappeared but they are not as visible as before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instantly plump fine lines while reducing the appearance of wrinkles gradually&lt;br /&gt;Add</li>
            <li>so far so good with helping my fine lines</li>
            <li>have used this for about a week but noticed  a huge difference  </li>
            <li>For now, I like the consistency of the product, it is easier to apply and it feels smooth and light.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good...</li>
            <li>I was at first reluctant about trying it out again, and am glad I got this</li>
            <li>and I am willing to give it time and maybe one more purchase before I comment on the product results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Applying Hyaluronic acid has become part of my daily routine; I do not think I&#x27;m going to be able to stop using it now that I experienced reasonable and measurable results.</li>
            <li>I try to apply it right after washing my face or fresh from the shower when my skin is still damp and has more moisture on it.</li>
            <li>It is very important that it has No Fragrance &amp; Parabens because our skin is very sensible.</li>
            <li>I love that this serum is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>the smell is not bad either.</li>
            <li>i also use it at nigjt without worrying it will stain my pillows since its absorb really quickly.</li>
            <li>skin feels plumper and more hydrated which is always a plus since I live in the desert.</li>
            <li>Love the new skin texture</li>
            <li>This comes in a good size pretty blue bottle.</li>
            <li>I have been using serums for years, but this is my favorite thus far.  </li>
            <li>As a result, hyaluronic acid serums help deliver powerful hydration to the skin in one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not affiliated in any way with any company or product for which I leave a review, nor am I compensated in any way for leaving a product review, and a positive review is never guaranteed, only an honest one.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it, Hyaluronic Acid is the single most important thing you can put on your face to hold in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I have naturally blemished skin and fine lines around my eyes and the creases of my mouth.</li>
            <li>This stuff REALLY works!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>We will absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li>I am in my late 40&#x27;s and going through a huge mid life crisis, so when i am offered a skin care product like this BIG - 2 oz Hyaluronic Acid during a promotion in exchange for my honest review I was pretty happy to try it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t tried it yet you really should!</li>
            <li>Just in case you wondered ;)</li>
            <li>Love this product , saw results the next day .</li>
            <li>My other tools include vitamin C serum, regular facials, a good dermatologist, zinc sunscreen, hats, scarves, sleeves &amp; sunglasses, oral collagen &amp; keratin supplement plus good multi, whole foods plant based diet, daily meditation, tons of hot yoga &amp; getting allergy tested.</li>
            <li>I have some smile lines and wrinkles by my eyes normally</li>
            <li>It does make your face feel very protected from the elements and it leaves your skin feeling super soft!</li>
            <li>I really wanted this stuff to help with the dark bags under my eyes in the mornings and this worked amazing for that.</li>
            <li>It really helps keep everything together.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;Sonja</li>
            <li>I really like how it feels on my skin and</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it as much as I do-</li>
            <li>Also the fine lines I have been dealing with since I&#x27;ve started getting older aren&#x27;t quite so deep.</li>
            <li>My complexion has cleared up noticeably , and while my blackheads persist, they are significantly reduced, especially in problem areas like my nose .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Hyaluronic Acid in the past and love it!  </li>
            <li>The dark circles and puffiness around my eyes are not so prominent anymore.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>he uses it twice daily and has seen amazing improvement to his dark undereye circles.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it, as it is with most skin care products, nor does my skin look gross while I am wearing it, but the opposite, it appears to be hydrating.</li>
            <li>After she used it I can already see the difference and an improvement on her fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness under her eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the suggestions in the email I received said to use on a damp or wet face and possibly mix it with a face makeup.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a big and consistent problem with blackheads on my nose since puberty, and have tried virtually everything</li>
            <li>Glides on skin smoothly and gets rid of those pesky dark circles around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty big bottle comes with 2 ounces!</li>
            <li>It is way too soon to say, it has given me a young appearance, I look younger than my natural age anyway, but I do feel it has helped, because my diet isn&#x27;t very healthy these days, and the food I eat reduces hydration and makes my skin look more sagging, but since I have been using the HA, it isn&#x27;t as bad as it is normally.</li>
            <li>This is a very thick face balm that absorbs nicely.  </li>
            <li>It has caused my sensitive skin no adverse effects.</li>
            <li>Growing old is a reality</li>
            <li>and I had none so far.  </li>
            <li>sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Used 1/2 bottle so far, I like the way it feels.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised.</li>
            <li>Out loud because I was so surprised after applying it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you have similar issues.</li>
            <li>intense moisture to dry skin</li>
            <li>I am a 70 year old male...</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and the lines above my lip line have faded.  </li>
            <li>Well I have been hearing a lot about Hyaluronic acid lately and how good it is for your skin lately.</li>
            <li>The ingredients really help to awaken your skin, it helps reduce you dark cirlcles, and prolong againg.</li>
            <li>Certainly, I am using less liquid foundation and concealer than a</li>
            <li>I have thin skin around my eyes which means that I am prone to fine lines &amp; circles.</li>

            <li> Well I have been hearing a lot about Hyaluronic acid lately and how good it is for your skin lately.</li>
            <li> The ingredients really help to awaken your skin, it helps reduce you dark cirlcles, and prolong againg.</li>
            <li> Certainly, I am using less liquid foundation and concealer than a</li>
            <li> I have thin skin around my eyes which means that I am prone to fine lines &amp; circles.</li>
            <li> The only other thing I can compare it to is recently I got a hydrogen facial with collagen &amp; it did a similar thing.</li>
            <li> so I expected this one to be the same.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m almost 70, not many products works on old geezers like me👍</li>

            <li> Not only does it go on smoothly a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a softer complexion and the deep creases aren&#x27;t as noticeable as the finer lines even less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there was an expiration date on it, nevertheless, I&#x27;m confident that it was bad.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the HA for almost 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say how well it does work , but I can say, so far there is nothing negative</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it!  I plan to purchase another bottle...&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with my moisturizer and I love the feel of it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels plumper and more hydrated which is always a plus since I live in the desert.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and I believe it is helping. I try to apply it right after washing my face or fresh from the shower when my skin is still damp and has more moisture on it. I like that this has a money back guarantee. Any company that stands behind their product that way gives me hope that it will actually do what they claim it does. This comes in a good size pretty blue bottle. It has no noticeable odor to it. It goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and feels good on the skin. It has caused my sensitive skin no adverse effects. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.  I try very hard to write reviews that contain information that I would want to know when considering purchasing a product and that I would find helpful in making a purchasing decision. I believe reviews should be honest regardless of whether an item was received free, at a discount, or purchased at full price. I am not affiliated in any way with any company or product for which I leave a review, nor am I compensated in any way for leaving a product review, and a positive review is never guaranteed, only an honest one.</li>
            <li> Well I have been hearing a lot about Hyaluronic acid lately and how good it is for your skin lately. I remember in anatomy class learning about this stuff. Its in your joints and in your skin. It really helps keep everything together. I really wanted this stuff to help with the dark bags under my eyes in the mornings and this worked amazing for that. I was not expecting everything else this did for my skin. I have some smile lines and wrinkles by my eyes normally and I notice a difference in those too. It leaves a &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look to your face that I love.</li>
            <li> Good Product. It’s not miracle but feels nice after application. Would buy again and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love this hydrating serum! This serum has the best feel on your face. It is a very light product and does not leave your face feeling all greasy and oily. It does make your face feel very protected from the elements and it leaves your skin feeling super soft! I love it.</li>
            <li> I started using this serum after reading that hyaluronic acid was good for getting rid of blackheads. I&#x27;ve had a big and consistent problem with blackheads on my nose since puberty, and have tried virtually everything so I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot. I purchased a different brand before getting this one as a gift from my sister, and for whatever reason it didn&#x27;t work. I was at first reluctant about trying it out again, and am glad I got this (more potent ?) brand of hyaluronic acid because it has been working marvels on my skin. My complexion has cleared up noticeably , and while my blackheads persist, they are significantly reduced, especially in problem areas like my nose .  I highly recommend this product if you have similar issues.</li>
            <li> I love this beauty product! I have naturally blemished skin and fine lines around my eyes and the creases of my mouth. I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks and have already noticed a difference! The dark circles and puffiness around my eyes are not so prominent anymore. Also the fine lines I have been dealing with since I&#x27;ve started getting older aren&#x27;t quite so deep. I&#x27;m excited to see what my face looks like after using it for a month or two!</li>
            <li> so far so good with helping my fine lines</li>
            <li> So far, so good...this is a product that takes a bit of time to work so you will just have to wait for an &amp;#34;empty bottle&amp;#34; update.  But for now, I&#x27;ve used it for about half a week and I like it.  It is to be used morning and night.  The formula is quite thick...gel consistency and so it is a wee bit difficult to get out of the dropper,but with a full bottle it&#x27;s not been a problem.  It&#x27;s when I get to the end that I&#x27;m thinking this may be difficult to get out of the bottom.  I received this as a discount to review it and I&#x27;ll update everyone at the end of the tunnel.</li>
            <li> I am a 70 year old male... i ordered this product to help with all the fine lines around the eyes and they have not disappeared but they are not as visible as before. Growing old is a reality but nothing says u have to look an ancient artifact either, I like this and will reorder again</li>
            <li> I have been using hyaluronic acid products for some time now with great results so I expected this one to be the same.  My skin is so soft and the lines above my lip line have faded.  My pores are much smaller and my skin just looks brighter.  My skin is prone to breakouts and I had none so far.  I definitely recommend this product!  I received a discount for reviewing this product.</li>
            <li> After two weeks cannot see change. Do I need the Vit C serum so that it will absorb better or another product.i do like the way the serum feels on my face</li>
            <li> Very lightweight moisturizer, perfect for my oily, breakout prone skin. It actually cleared a breakout on my chest that I could not get under control with other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using serums for years, but this is my favorite thus far.  Glides on skin smoothly and gets rid of those pesky dark circles around the eyes.  This formula penetrates deeper to heal and beautify skin with ingredients the skin loves.  Transforms your skin from drab to fab in a matter of days.  Excellent product that garners excellent results!</li>
            <li> good clean fast product</li>
            <li> This works, I&#x27;ll buy more</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a common ingredient found in skin care products. Used mostly as a moisturizer, hyaluronic acid can hold up to 3,000 times its weight in water. As a result, hyaluronic acid serums help deliver powerful hydration to the skin in one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid serums keep the skin soft, supple, firm, and moisturized, which help prevent breakouts and signs of aging on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is safe for even the most sensitive of skin types, making it a popular ingredient for many skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instantly plump fine lines while reducing the appearance of wrinkles gradually&lt;br /&gt;Add intense moisture to dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Instant glowing complexion&lt;br /&gt;Improve appearance of dark under eye circles&lt;br /&gt;Safe for all skin types including sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of different hyaluronic acid serums. This one seem to be one of the better ones. In just a few days I noticed a difference in how my face looked and felt. My face had a glow and my dark circles wasn&#x27;t as noticeable. I have very sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t bother me at all. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and plumps up my face!</li>
            <li> Works well as to tightening the skin. I&#x27;m almost 70, not many products works on old geezers like me👍</li>
            <li> I bought this and excited to use it but a got disappointed when arrived at home I had to returned it because the seal was broken, lid crack and part of this precious liquid inside the bubble rap...😞..now I&#x27;m waiting one more week for this bottle..</li>
            <li> Just two words can describe this product....TOTALLY AMAZING.  Love it....Will definitely buy again.  My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the shipping speed and I am sure it&#x27;s a pretty good product.  Unfortunately, I am as of yet not seeing any &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34;.  but just want to let you know all was well with the shipping and I am willing to give it time and maybe one more purchase before I comment on the product results.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;Sonja</li>
            <li> Used 1/2 bottle so far, I like the way it feels. I use quite a few products but I believe this product works. I love the suggestions in the email I received said to use on a damp or wet face and possibly mix it with a face makeup. I have noticed a softer complexion and the deep creases aren&#x27;t as noticeable as the finer lines even less noticeable. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my grandma because she is always talking about how Hyaluronic Acid is amazing so I got this for her so she can try it on and check for herself how it works. After she used it I can already see the difference and an improvement on her fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness under her eyes. I am really surprised. It is very important that it has No Fragrance &amp; Parabens because our skin is very sensible. I am happy with the combination of the ingredients in this product. This hydrating facial serum has botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Organic Aloe and antioxidants such as Green Tea, Vitamin C &amp; E. I will be buying this again! !  I received this for a discounted price for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works!</li>
            <li> I received this on a review. I really like how it feels on my skin and the smell is not bad either. I have used it many times since I received it. I recommend the seller and the product.</li>
            <li> What a nice product! I&#x27;ve only used it 3 days &amp; I can see &amp; feel a difference!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty big bottle comes with 2 ounces! I cant rave enough about using hyaluronic acid, ot does wonders to the skin.. The ingredients really help to awaken your skin, it helps reduce you dark cirlcles, and prolong againg. I love that this serum is very lightweight. So i can use it under my makeup so my foundation doesnt cling on to my dry patches i also use it at nigjt without worrying it will stain my pillows since its absorb really quickly. These are my honest opinions in trying this product.</li>
            <li> received this about one week ago and I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully.  I think this is miracle stuff.  I am definitely keeping this in my anti-aging arsenal.</li>
            <li> I received 2 bottles of this serum in agreement to write a review.  I have some of the serum on my neck at this time.  It felt so lovely when I put it on.  It is a good consistency.  I have not used this type of product before but I am well pleased.  I plan to use it until the last drop is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Polly</li>
            <li> Great product! I currently use it as step 3 in my am/pm beauty routine. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few types of serums and Bleu Beaute definitely works!  Not only does it go on smoothly a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for a couple of weeks.  This is a very thick face balm that absorbs nicely.  I mix a drop sometimes two with a drop of argan oil and am very pleased with how hydrated my face has been.  I really like this product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using the HA for almost 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say how well it does work , but I can say, so far there is nothing negative what so ever. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it, as it is with most skin care products, nor does my skin look gross while I am wearing it, but the opposite, it appears to be hydrating. I have used a lot of expensive skin care, and I can definitely say, this is worth every cent I paid for it. It is way too soon to say, it has given me a young appearance, I look younger than my natural age anyway, but I do feel it has helped, because my diet isn&#x27;t very healthy these days, and the food I eat reduces hydration and makes my skin look more sagging, but since I have been using the HA, it isn&#x27;t as bad as it is normally.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so hydrating and has become a staple in my nightly skincare routine. My husband loves it as much as I do- he uses it twice daily and has seen amazing improvement to his dark undereye circles. We will absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and going through a huge mid life crisis, so when i am offered a skin care product like this BIG - 2 oz Hyaluronic Acid during a promotion in exchange for my honest review I was pretty happy to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;this arrived very quickly, was sealed well and was not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for about a week but noticed  a huge difference  the first time I used it, Hyaluronic Acid is the single most important thing you can put on your face to hold in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet you really should!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot.  I want to try a new product now, but this one was very good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Hyaluronic Acid in the past and love it!  Unfortunately this had the smell of a product that has gone bad.  I don&#x27;t know if there was an expiration date on it, nevertheless, I&#x27;m confident that it was bad.  Not something I would want to put on my face.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for approximately 25 plus days. I have notice that my pores seemed a bit smaller and my skin tighter. In addition, I believe my dark spots have lighten up a little, nothing too dramatic . Certainly, I am using less liquid foundation and concealer than a I did a month ago. Applying Hyaluronic acid has become part of my daily routine; I do not think I&#x27;m going to be able to stop using it now that I experienced reasonable and measurable results.</li>
            <li> When I put this around my eyes it took about 30 seconds for the blueness to reduce. I have thin skin around my eyes which means that I am prone to fine lines &amp; circles. A genetic curse I suppose. This helps plump up my skin immediately. I was starting to feel down about looking tired. I actually said &amp;#34;holy ----!&amp;#34; Out loud because I was so surprised after applying it. The only other thing I can compare it to is recently I got a hydrogen facial with collagen &amp; it did a similar thing. I found a secret weapon!!!! I&#x27;m 37 &amp; my skin returned to what it looked like 3 years ago. My other tools include vitamin C serum, regular facials, a good dermatologist, zinc sunscreen, hats, scarves, sleeves &amp; sunglasses, oral collagen &amp; keratin supplement plus good multi, whole foods plant based diet, daily meditation, tons of hot yoga &amp; getting allergy tested. Just in case you wondered ;)</li>
            <li> Love the new skin texture</li>
            <li> Love this product , saw results the next day .</li>
            <li> I just started using this brand so I don&#x27;t have the long term review yet.  For now, I like the consistency of the product, it is easier to apply and it feels smooth and light.  I have been using it both in the am and pm before applying moisturizer  I am hoping to see results!</li>
