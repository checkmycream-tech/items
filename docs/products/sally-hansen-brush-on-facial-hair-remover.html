    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>But for body hair, great product!</li>
            <li>but I think it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This product works great!  </li>
            <li>Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li>I was and am very pleased!</li>
            <li>So if the hair comes off around 6 minutes, please happily do so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome face :-)</li>
            <li>I tried bleaching which was moderately successful.</li>
            <li>Be sure to test it on your arm before to see how your skin will react!</li>
            <li>i was worried that it wouldnt work because of these reviews, but i took a chance, and im glad i did!</li>
            <li>Try Parissa - that stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen doesn&#x27;t know how to make effective hair removal products.  </li>
            <li>Good for fine hair, you know the kind that you don&#x27;t care about. . .</li>
            <li>This is good stuff but the scent is really a strong perfume smell and it aggravates my skin and leaves a rash and scab.</li>
            <li>(again, just a matter of what kind of skin you have :) )</li>
            <li>: BE SURE TO USE WARM MOIST PAPER TOWEL.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I would have been better off saving my money and shaving.</li>
            <li>made my skin smooth, burned for a good hour but was fine after!</li>
            <li>:) Love it.</li>
            <li>Remember that this is just ME and MY skin :).</li>
            <li>Then I waited for 3 more mins.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll help with removing the hair. :)</li>
            <li>I love how this leaves my face smooth and my make up goes on smooth too</li>
            <li>(And yes, I know, sometimes someone can be fine on their arm, and then break out once it touches their face.)</li>
            <li>works fine.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at a CVS and have been using it for a little over 2 months and it is great!</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s an excellent product, and has saved me from having black facial hair on important dates (like wedding photos!!!)</li>
            <li>I had to smooth it out with my fingers.</li>
            <li>I bought this product today after work excited to use it as soon as I got home.</li>
            <li>I have tried SEVERAL hair removal products, as well as gone to the salon to have hair removed, and also Laser hair removal (even though it&#x27;s costly, it is by FAR the best solution to unwanted/bothersome hair).</li>
            <li>sure that, like any chemical product, there could be some irritation for certain types of skin, but not for me.  </li>
            <li>Then it started to burn and turn bright red.</li>
            <li>After the full eight minutes, I wiped off the product as instructed.</li>
            <li>See, it only removes the hair to the very top layer of skin</li>
            <li>I also rinse my entire face with warm water then cool water after I am done.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have tried many hair removal products like nair, depil silk and surgi.</li>
            <li>My sister is more sensitive to it as well.</li>
            <li>More sensitive skin tends to disagree with this hair remover.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>It was the same price, and since the packaging described the product as moisturizing and effective, I would give it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and soft and, amazingly, clean.</li>
            <li>Because they&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li>my skin is a light caramel complexion and i usually dont get redness or irritation but this made my skin bright red.i</li>
            <li>I tried bleaching first, but that seemed to burn</li>
            <li>It worked well and consistently for me.  </li>
            <li>none of it moved, so there was nothing to &amp;#34;shake&amp;#34; I put some water in it to shake it up since water is the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>Bleach would never get it all on the first try, and if it did, as soon as I stepped into the sun,</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 3 years now, and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li>I use it only once a week and leave it on for 7-8 minutes to make sure it works.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>I tried many brands and only got some hairs bleached.</li>
            <li>first bc</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sally Hansen!</li>
            <li>So, of course, I had a bright red, raw mustache for a couple of days :) haha not too funny at the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this product at least 5 times, and each time I am more and more dissatisfied with it.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it is not expensive, good job!</li>
            <li>The ONLY good thing that I can say about this product is that it does not burn like many other facial hair removers.</li>
            <li>Maybe you have to have a certain hair type for this to work?  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t come off easily and what it does remove comes back as fast as it would had</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t lose a single hair, but did get irritated skin (not bad, luckily).  </li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>Once you get it on, it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>(within the same week) more grows back and it is more coarse.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I think it works very well.  </li>
            <li>After that I was in so much pain.</li>
            <li>So I tried this hair remover and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is much better to have a layer of natural hair (mine was blonde) on your face than remove it and get stubble!</li>
            <li>On the instructions, it does advise that you do a spot test on your arm first to see if you&#x27;re sensitive to the product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels dry and is lightly burning.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the skin on the upper lip is much more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>A lot of people, I discovered, ARE very sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>(nothing happened), then try five minutes (okay...), but no more than eight (guess I have to take it off now).</li>
            <li>I do this at most once a week usually</li>
            <li>First and foremost you have to have not washed, moisturized or anything to your face in the last two hours.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn like the bleach, it takes like 3 minutes and it works so completely!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions the first time I tried this on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>Furst step I brush, more like pat, the product above my lip and down the sides of my lips, all over my jawline, under my chin, I look like Santa Claus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this twice now and both times I left it on for the maximum amount of time (8 minutes) and it did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the tube.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it claims to have a soft brush,</li>
            <li>Yes, but I could see it growing back only two days later, and I don&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s worth it because instead of having hair, I now have very irritated skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I do not recommend using this.</li>
            <li>False advirtising, it caused my whole upper lip to burn and be bright red, didn&#x27;t remove all my hairs and cost $8!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised this product has so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li>I first opened the bottle and the paste was dry...</li>
            <li>I do NOT recommend this particular brush-on product because it does not remove all of the hair for one, and two when the hair grows back</li>
            <li>It blistered, burned like hell and caused major acne breakout.</li>
            <li>In less than 10 minutes, the cream did its job and the hair came right off</li>
            <li>and it barely removed anything all it did</li>
            <li>This is NOT pain-free as the box says, and definitely NOT for sensitive</li>
            <li>but I tried this product twice, thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough the first time, and it has done the same both times.</li>
            <li>Area was red for nearly a day.</li>
            <li>I am going to have to do some hunting to find the brand that actually works so until then I am stuck using this stuff nearly twice a week just to keep from looking like a dude.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend for other areas really.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect but it helps me take off most of the hair on my upper lip and the soft hair on my chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only good things I can say is that it did not irritate my skin and does not smell too bad.</li>

            <li> The only good things I can say is that it did not irritate my skin and does not smell too bad.</li>
            <li> Worst method of hair removal and product I have ever used in my life (and I&#x27;ve used sooooo many!!!).</li>
            <li> It also removes the 5&#x27;oclock shadow that many other products would leave behind, and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Previously, I spend years and $ on having my upper lip and chin professionally waxed.  </li>
            <li> Then tried the same size area on my chin and it burned the mess out of my face (had to use a cold compress to get the burning to stop), didn&#x27;t have enough time to leave it on for it to do any good other than smell like burning hair.</li>
            <li> I even broke out a little which never happens because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Upon closer examination it left the skin on parts of my upper lip raw, and I only left it on for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product on my face, as some of those with negative comments did, and for me, it worked VERY well.  </li>
            <li> That is how much this stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t cost me much, since it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Plus, the brush is not soft.</li>
            <li> (long shot, I know)</li>
            <li> When the hair grows back, it&#x27;s not very noticable</li>
            <li> They do make other products specifically for facial hair, so if you&#x27;re considering using it for that purpose, maybe you should think twice.</li>
            <li> only bad thing about that is, if you leave the cream on for more than 8 minutes, it tends to sting for an hour or two after wiping off the cream.</li>
            <li> this was such a WASTE of money i left it on for 8 min</li>
            <li> However, the product slightly softens the hairs just enough so that they do not pull out at the root, but instead break off.</li>
            <li> I later remove the product with wet rung out paper towels by wiping the product in the direction of the hair (down).</li>
            <li> This will easily win an award for worst hair removal product in history.</li>
            <li> I also do the center of my two eyebrows and on occassion my forehead.</li>
            <li> This is obviously not a good product for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> i buy a hair/skin/beauty product i usually always look up reviews prior to buying however this time</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles were bent outward, making it difficult to apply exactly where I wanted it.</li>
            <li> However, a lot of other people, like me, are not.</li>
            <li> I bought this product instead of my usual facial waxing strips from another brand.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed bc other hair removal creams don&#x27;t work on other areas of my body like my legs at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to recommend this product to everyone, when I know that it only works for some.</li>
            <li> i left this on for 10 minutes , got a towel and scrubbed it really hard</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any negative reaction on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> A lot of people are stating that it burnt them and caused them to pretty much hate the product: completely understandable.</li>
            <li> Basically from under my eye area down.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation as I did the allergy test as recommended, but other than that it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth it!</li>
            <li> The brush did not look soft (the bristles were bent all weird), nut I needed to get rid of the hair</li>
            <li> brush is just a bunch of harsh bristles that do not apply the product evenly.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I have a dark complexion, and I have always had THICK dark hair in unwanted areas (including, yes... my &#x27;mustache&#x27;).</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even get the peach fuzz on my chin, much less the coarser hairs that I usually pluck.  </li>
            <li> It can leave irritation if you scratch the area you used the product on and the brush IS stiff, but it makes up for these two cons in the end.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this has happened to others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry that not everyone had the same reaction</li>
            <li> My skin lets me do a lot of crap to it, and doesn&#x27;t usually complain haha</li>
            <li> sorry that&#x27;s not true, the brush is stiff and hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I still had all my hair there, no irritation for me at least... not buying this ever again.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> i had thin darker hair on my upper lip, i have no idea how it got there, because it wasnt there a few months ago :(</li>
            <li> No hair was ever removed, but there was a pretty nasty burning on my lip area for hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this out of desperation because I was unable to find my usual brand in the store.</li>
            <li> I applied a cold compress as directed on the instructions and am hoping I don&#x27;t have to walk around for a few days with this redness.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy.</li>
            <li> ABsolutely the worst experience EVER.</li>
            <li> However, it is ineffective, has a thin consistency and requires rubbing to get the hair to come off at all .</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive to just buy and not have it work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer the blonde fuzzy hair to the burned painful, ugly skin I ended up with!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a matter of how terrible the product itself is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inconvenient and costly.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the bad comments deter you from this hair remover</li>
            <li> It reminded me of the latrine at girl scout camp, it was that bad.</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> I have to use it once a week which isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad reactions to cream tempers before.</li>
            <li> I had to go on medication after using this, my skin was destroyed and I suffered bad chemical burns!</li>
            <li> Very bad product...does not even deserve one star.</li>
            <li> Very Very painful.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair remover I&#x27;ve ever got, it hasn&#x27;t removed any singel hair from my face , the worst part is my face get burned, got horrible redness on my face!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this twice now and both times I left it on for the maximum amount of time (8 minutes) and it did absolutely nothing for me.  Such a disappointment.  It was a complete waste of money, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair remover I&#x27;ve ever got, it hasn&#x27;t removed any singel hair from my face , the worst part is my face get burned, got horrible redness on my face! Please don&#x27;t buy it, you will defenetly reget</li>
            <li> Well, I have finally hit that age where I noticed a shadow above my upper lip appearing...(where IS that graceful aging??)...I tried plucking a few hairs, but that didn&#x27;t seem feasible on my whole upper lip..so I went ahead and bought this product.  I tried bleaching first, but that seemed to burn and I had to wipe it off before it actually lightened the hairs.  Waited a month and tried this...only left it on for the 3 minutes and it didn&#x27;t seem to remove all the hairs, especially the coarser ones.  At that point, my skin was already starting to burn and become red.  I applied a cold compress as directed on the instructions and am hoping I don&#x27;t have to walk around for a few days with this redness.  I too did the patch test.  Apparently the skin on the upper lip is much more sensitive.  Wondering what else I can use now.  Guess I might have to try a wax product.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> By the way my husband is Daniel, I am a female that tried this and it was awful!!!!! It did not remove any hair and left my skin red, burned and irritated!!!!!!! worst product ever.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DO NOT GET THIS!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;before i buy a hair/skin/beauty product i usually always look up reviews prior to buying however this time i didnt. this was such a WASTE of money i left it on for 8 min and it barely removed anything all it did was make my skin burn. my skin is a light caramel complexion and i usually dont get redness or irritation but this made my skin bright red.i had to put honey on my face to soothe it thank god nothing to drastic happened. please avoid this product at all costs</li>
            <li> I had been using the cream that came in a tube. (made by the same company) It worked well and consistently for me.  I purchased this brush on one because I assumed it was the same product just with a different applicator.  It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the tube.  I&#x27;m going back to the tube version but I&#x27;m worried that this is an overall formula change for the company, in which case, neither will work.</li>
            <li> As Kim said, it leaves ALOT of redness and burning!!! Upon closer examination it left the skin on parts of my upper lip raw, and I only left it on for 3 minutes. Now I have to walk around with a rash on my face for the next couple of days. Plus, the brush is not soft. Some of the bristles were bent outward, making it difficult to apply exactly where I wanted it. This is NOT pain-free as the box says, and definitely NOT for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. all this was after I did the skin patch test on my arm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product at least 5 times, and each time I am more and more dissatisfied with it. After using this product on my upper lip for the longest recommended time, I end up having to tweeze because it doesn&#x27;t remove any coarse hairs. However, the product slightly softens the hairs just enough so that they do not pull out at the root, but instead break off. This leaves you with noticeable stubble.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product on my face, as some of those with negative comments did, and for me, it worked VERY well.  I&#x27;d tried hair removal products years ago and saw this on sale in the local CVS.  In less than 10 minutes, the cream did its job and the hair came right off (note: I did use a washcloth).  The scent was decent/not chemically and my skin was not at all irritated. They do make other products specifically for facial hair, so if you&#x27;re considering using it for that purpose, maybe you should think twice. But for body hair, great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product today after work excited to use it as soon as I got home. I first opened the bottle and the paste was dry... none of it moved, so there was nothing to &amp;#34;shake&amp;#34; I put some water in it to shake it up since water is the first ingredient. I put it on my upper lip and chin, waited 6 minutes and checked to see if any hair would be removed, still there. I waited over 15 minutes with it on my face and scrubbed it off. I still had all my hair there, no irritation for me at least... not buying this ever again.</li>
            <li> Good for fine hair, you know the kind that you don&#x27;t care about. . . As for the corse hair above your lip or anywhere else is says it is save to use, just do not bother with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation as I did the allergy test as recommended, but other than that it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised this product has so many negative reviews.I have extremely sensitive skin and have tried many hair removal products like nair, depil silk and surgi. This is the only product that didn&#x27;t burn my skin. It also removes the 5&#x27;oclock shadow that many other products would leave behind, and lasts long. This will be the only product I use from now on.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it claims to have a soft brush, sorry that&#x27;s not true, the brush is stiff and hard to use.  Once you get it on, it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I have tried SEVERAL hair removal products, as well as gone to the salon to have hair removed, and also Laser hair removal (even though it&#x27;s costly, it is by FAR the best solution to unwanted/bothersome hair). I do NOT recommend this particular brush-on product because it does not remove all of the hair for one, and two when the hair grows back (within the same week) more grows back and it is more coarse. I&#x27;m not sure if this has happened to others but I tried this product twice, thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough the first time, and it has done the same both times. The ONLY good thing that I can say about this product is that it does not burn like many other facial hair removers. THAT&#x27;S IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions, left it on for 5 minutes. The hair wiped away, but then I noticed a lot of redness start to appear. The area is now really red and burning! This is obviously not a good product for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff but the scent is really a strong perfume smell and it aggravates my skin and leaves a rash and scab.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 4 minutes, then I tried 6 minutes, and finally I tried 8 minutes (the longest time recommended).  Didn&#x27;t lose a single hair, but did get irritated skin (not bad, luckily).  Maybe you have to have a certain hair type for this to work?  It didn&#x27;t even get the peach fuzz on my chin, much less the coarser hairs that I usually pluck.  At least it didn&#x27;t cost me much, since it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have a dark complexion, and I have always had THICK dark hair in unwanted areas (including, yes... my &#x27;mustache&#x27;). Bleach would never get it all on the first try, and if it did, as soon as I stepped into the sun, *BAM!* there was my glistening blond-ish mustache in all its glory. Finally, my mom bought this for me to see how it would work. And It. Was. A. Miracle. I have been using this product for about 3 years now, and it has never failed me. A lot of people are stating that it burnt them and caused them to pretty much hate the product: completely understandable. I&#x27;m not arguing with them! Because they&#x27;re right. My sister is more sensitive to it as well. On the instructions, it does advise that you do a spot test on your arm first to see if you&#x27;re sensitive to the product. (And yes, I know, sometimes someone can be fine on their arm, and then break out once it touches their face.) A lot of people, I discovered, ARE very sensitive to it. (For example, I let my roommate use it and her upper lip was burnt and red for 3 days!!! I felt awful). However, a lot of other people, like me, are not. It&#x27;s not really a matter of how terrible the product itself is. Everyone has a different type of skin, and different skin history. You just have to find out if works for you or not. More sensitive skin tends to disagree with this hair remover. My skin lets me do a lot of crap to it, and doesn&#x27;t usually complain haha (again, just a matter of what kind of skin you have :) ) Don&#x27;t let the bad comments deter you from this hair remover: it works for some. The only time I have EVER had a problem with it was when I forgot to set my alarm (whoops), and left it on for 2 minutes longer than the longest advised time. So, of course, I had a bright red, raw mustache for a couple of days :) haha not too funny at the time. Anyway!!! It&#x27;s hard to recommend this product to everyone, when I know that it only works for some. I know it&#x27;s expensive to just buy and not have it work for you. So, if you have a friend who just happens to have it! (long shot, I know) Ask if you can try the patch test on your arm. Then you could go from there. All in all, it&#x27;s an excellent product, and has saved me from having black facial hair on important dates (like wedding photos!!!) :) Love it. Remember that this is just ME and MY skin :). The day they stop selling this is the day I will be convinced the apocalypse is among us.</li>
            <li> This product is joke. Not atall working for me. I kept for 5 mins on skin then checked. NOOOO.. it did not work. Then I waited for 3 more mins. again checked noo.. did not work atall. very annoying!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a CVS and have been using it for a little over 2 months and it is great! I figured it was worth a try. What would I lose? Six dollars? I was and am very pleased! When the hair grows back, it&#x27;s not very noticable but I recommend you use it weekly to keep it that way. I use it only once a week and leave it on for 7-8 minutes to make sure it works. It leaves my skin smooth and soft and, amazingly, clean. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the chemicals but it actually removes dirt along with the hair.     Be sure to test it on your arm before to see how your skin will react! It can leave irritation if you scratch the area you used the product on and the brush IS stiff, but it makes up for these two cons in the end.    Great product for a great price! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It does not remove upper lip hair even after 7 minutes (The maximum time allowed is 8min) Very bad product...does not even deserve one star.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m going against the crowd and have to say I like this product quite a bit. It&#x27;s not perfect but it helps me take off most of the hair on my upper lip and the soft hair on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about that is, if you leave the cream on for more than 8 minutes, it tends to sting for an hour or two after wiping off the cream. So if the hair comes off around 6 minutes, please happily do so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: BE SURE TO USE WARM MOIST PAPER TOWEL. It&#x27;ll help with removing the hair. :)</li>
            <li> Did not like this product! I got the jar out, red the directions, opened up the bottle, and about died from the odor. It reminded me of the latrine at girl scout camp, it was that bad. The brush did not look soft (the bristles were bent all weird), nut I needed to get rid of the hair so I put it on anyway. Bad idea. I had to sit with the awful smell under my nose for three minutes. I finally got to wipe it off and the hair was gone, so I figured that was that. Then it started to burn and turn bright red. I am not happy. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I think it works very well.  Left it on for about 5 minutes and all the hair came off.  I didn&#x27;t have any negative reaction on my upper lip.  I&#x27;m sorry that not everyone had the same reaction but I think it is wonderful.  A little goes a long way and it is not expensive, good job!</li>
            <li> I use this for my sideburns. works fine. Don&#x27;t have any problem with burning or redness afterwards. Would not recommend for other areas really. Try Parissa - that stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Worst method of hair removal and product I have ever used in my life (and I&#x27;ve used sooooo many!!!). This will easily win an award for worst hair removal product in history. It doesn&#x27;t remove any hair at all and simply destroys your skin. I had to go on medication after using this, my skin was destroyed and I suffered bad chemical burns! It blistered, burned like hell and caused major acne breakout. ABsolutely the worst experience EVER. Run for the hills. This product should be discontinued!!!I will never buy anything from Sally Hanson again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product instead of my usual facial waxing strips from another brand.  It was the same price, and since the packaging described the product as moisturizing and effective, I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is just a bunch of harsh bristles that do not apply the product evenly.  I had to smooth it out with my fingers. The package says try three minutes (nothing happened), then try five minutes (okay...), but no more than eight (guess I have to take it off now). After the full eight minutes, I wiped off the product as instructed. It appears to have dissolved SOME of the hair but not all and it created STUBBLE (packaging says this will NOT happen)?!  The hair on my upper lip is darker but not coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point blank:  I still have hair remaining, including stubble, even after the leaving it on for max time.  My skin feels dry and is lightly burning.  It seems as though the hair will be back tomorrow.  I&#x27;m returning to waxing.  I can deal with 30 seconds of pain to remove ALL of the hair for three weeks.</li>
            <li> I tried bleaching....didn&#x27;t like it because the hair will still be there but blond and still noticeable.  I tried waxing at the salon....left my lip irratated and red.  Then I saw this and tried it and this is my fave!  I leave on the cream for 8 min and tada!  No  hair and my skin is not irritated.  I have to use it once a week which isn&#x27;t too bad.  This works for me.</li>
            <li> I have a scab from where this burned me. I followed the directions.. Now-- i cannot open my mouth without the scab cracking and bleeding. HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I tried this twice, and got the same results both times. I followed the instructions exactly. No hair was ever removed, but there was a pretty nasty burning on my lip area for hours. Will never buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I have been since my sister introduced me to this since 2004 however that was without the brush. I started using this brush type over a year ago. I am African American/Native American with a caramel complexion. At my age the hair on my face even the teeny tiny blonde hairs are a bother. I love how this leaves my face smooth and my make up goes on smooth too (when I wear foundation). I do this at most once a week usually once every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it in two steps. First and foremost you have to have not washed, moisturized or anything to your face in the last two hours. Furst step I brush, more like pat, the product above my lip and down the sides of my lips, all over my jawline, under my chin, I look like Santa Claus. Basically from under my eye area down. I set the timer on my phone for 3 mins. I later remove the product with wet rung out paper towels by wiping the product in the direction of the hair (down). I fold the towel after I use each part. You can rub a section if you feel it did not pull the hair off, which I usually only have to do above my lip and under my eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to the second part which is where I put the product under my eyebrows and above my eyebrows. I also do the center of my two eyebrows and on occassion my forehead. I set my timer again for three minutes. Repeat the removal steps. I also rinse my entire face with warm water then cool water after I am done. You can not use any cleansers or moisturizers for 2 hours after. That is it. Awesome face :-)</li>
            <li> Did the test spot on my arm as instructed, didn&#x27;t take the hair off but it didn&#x27;t leave any irritation after a minute left on and a 24 hour wait. Then tried the same size area on my chin and it burned the mess out of my face (had to use a cold compress to get the burning to stop), didn&#x27;t have enough time to leave it on for it to do any good other than smell like burning hair. Area was red for nearly a day. Will not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and left it on for the recommended 2 minutes. It felt like it was burning, but I figured that was just because it was working. Well, I removed it, noticed some hair still there, so as the package said I could put it on those areas again for another 2 minutes. After that I was in so much pain. It removed the hair but gave me 2nd degree burns on my face! Very Very painful. My skin oozed for a coupole of days and then scabbed over. It looked horrible! Please give me my hair back. I&#x27;d prefer the blonde fuzzy hair to the burned painful, ugly skin I ended up with! Wish I could give it 0 stars!</li>
            <li> I have tried waxing at the salon. That ripped skin off once and it needed to be redone the next week. Plus you have to let it grow in. I tried bleaching which was moderately successful. I tried many brands and only got some hairs bleached. I also had to trim and pluck! Nothing was satisfactory. This product is a godsend for those who it works for. It is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t burn like the bleach, it takes like 3 minutes and it works so completely! I was amazed bc other hair removal creams don&#x27;t work on other areas of my body like my legs at all. I would like to buy stock in this company. Oh and I did the skin test first bc I&#x27;ve had bad reactions to cream tempers before. I advise everyone to do the same before use!</li>
            <li> This product works great!  Previously, I spend years and $ on having my upper lip and chin professionally waxed.  It&#x27;s inconvenient and costly.  So I tried this hair remover and it works very well.  I use it every two weeks and it definitely removes the hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that, like any chemical product, there could be some irritation for certain types of skin, but not for me.  I have an olive undertone to my skin.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Removed the hair, but burned my face even tho I followed the instructions exactly. It&#x27;s been a week and I still have spots, and I could feel stubble the third day after I used it! I&#x27;ll use the rest for my legs, but will never buy again!</li>
            <li> This product does not work.  I followed the directions the first time I tried this on my upper lip.  It didn&#x27;t work.  The next time I left it on for 25 minutes and still nothing happened.  Worst \\&quot;hair remover\\&quot; ever.  Sally Hansen doesn&#x27;t know how to make effective hair removal products.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used this to remove the hair on my upper lip but it left me red and my lip felt like it was burning for two days. I even broke out a little which never happens because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. Does this remove hair? Yes, but I could see it growing back only two days later, and I don&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s worth it because instead of having hair, I now have very irritated skin. Thanks Sally Hansen!</li>
            <li> I did not buy it from amazon. I bought it from publix. i was worried that it wouldnt work because of these reviews, but i took a chance, and im glad i did! i had thin darker hair on my upper lip, i have no idea how it got there, because it wasnt there a few months ago :( i left this on for 10 minutes , got a towel and scrubbed it really hard and all the hair came off! made my skin smooth, burned for a good hour but was fine after!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I do not recommend using this. Left me with red, inflamed and irritated skin for days.</li>
            <li> I bought this out of desperation because I was unable to find my usual brand in the store. Wowie was that a mistake. I can honestly say that I would have been better off saving my money and shaving. I am a girl, btw. Yep. That is how much this stuff sucks. The only good things I can say is that it did not irritate my skin and does not smell too bad. However, it is ineffective, has a thin consistency and requires rubbing to get the hair to come off at all . See, it only removes the hair to the very top layer of skin so it doesn&#x27;t come off easily and what it does remove comes back as fast as it would had I used a razor. I am going to have to do some hunting to find the brand that actually works so until then I am stuck using this stuff nearly twice a week just to keep from looking like a dude. Ridiculous. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> This is just a waste of time and money. After using the product I practically felt/feel like a man because of all the stubble that comes back! It is much better to have a layer of natural hair (mine was blonde) on your face than remove it and get stubble! It&#x27;s just terrible.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever! False advirtising, it caused my whole upper lip to burn and be bright red, didn&#x27;t remove all my hairs and cost $8! Totally not worth it!</li>
