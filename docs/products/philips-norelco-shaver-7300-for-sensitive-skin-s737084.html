    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I notice that it works best on hair that is thicker &amp; bristle-like (stubs) rather than finer hair areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He was impressed with the ease in which this thing can e cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Find a Norelco that has a perfectly flush head, like this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Well the Philips Norelco Series 7000 Shaver 7300 is the perfect answer!</li>
            <li>The best electric razor my husband has ever had.</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s the best electric shaver he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li>The battery life is very good.</li>
            <li>The flex heads work to yield an incredibly close shave for an electric model.  </li>
            <li>Not even close to ideal for trimming or infrequent shaving.</li>
            <li>A good product!</li>
            <li>Not as good as a shave with a razor, but the best electric shaver we have used.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver.</li>
            <li>That being said, I haven&#x27;t experienced any razor burn, chafing, or undue dryness from use...</li>
            <li>I am using this razor as the replacement for my Philips Norelco Snso-Touch which is quite honestly the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>The carrying case is great for travel.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, He has been delighted with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>This one does a good job of getting close without nicking or razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Both methods provide a good charge.</li>
            <li>Once charging the shaver, it’s good for about an hour.  </li>
            <li>Charger stand allows for a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, all in all I’d say this is a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>That is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very pleased to report that he loved everything about this shaver.  </li>
            <li>This Norelco Shaver 7300 is a welcome change and has seemed to do a better job of trimming those hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There weren&#x27;t any clamshell packaging, so that was nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that the heads can be washed to get the hairs out/quick cleaning.  </li>
            <li>the directions state that the razor is good for 3 days growth without trimming, two days is probably a better estimate.</li>
            <li>system is pricey,  but the quality seems to be good as with most Norelco products.</li>
            <li>This particular shaving configuration was best for close shaves upon testing the unit.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent, high quality razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although he may be easy to please, he told me that since he knew the price going in, he was expecting superior performance</li>
            <li>Luckily I have a Wahl beard trimmer that works great</li>
            <li>Cleaning the heads is very easy</li>
            <li>This makes this product that much more effective because it has been written with the upmost customer service in mind.  </li>
            <li>This makes this product that much more effective because it has been written with the upmost customer service in mind.  </li>
            <li>He was also very impressed with the battery life which has been far greater than any model he has ever owned or used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the circular design doesn&#x27;t lend itself to very accurate trimming.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall his is quite happy with this shaver and since he is not a shy person as to voicing complaints I am content that he is pleased with this shaver which , in turn, pleases me and pleases my sister.</li>
            <li>The cleaner is effective, but it&#x27;s easy to spill when changing.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the best electric razor we&#x27;ve used; would recommend.</li>
            <li>If you shave every day or two, you&#x27;ll be able to use this and never worry about shaving cream or blades again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, this Norelco electric razor is generally better in both categories of pull and irritation.</li>
            <li>Do you need an incredibly close, complete shave in your life fellas?</li>
            <li>couple more weeks&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Philips Norelco shaver looks cooler than most shavers on the market.  </li>
            <li>One plus for this one over the Arcitec is that the trimmer is a separate attachment which works much better.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn’t quite sure what that was.  </li>
            <li>Travel case is very nice, I will certainly be using it for all my Norelco shavers when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent razor for those looking for a clean and relatively frequent shave.  </li>
            <li>Granted, they aren&#x27;t always perfect, but they&#x27;re usually quite good.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is great, although it requires the shaver head to be pulled off and the trimmer popped on, unlike my older Norelco</li>
            <li>Norelco makes great shavers, so I guess I&#x27;m going to just appreciate that my ancient one is still working better for me than this new</li>
            <li>tried out the beard trimmer and it works fine; but I have to admit I like the models better where the trimmer is attached and doesn’t need to be installed by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>7300 is a great razor for those with sensitive skin like me.  </li>
            <li>Being able to easily clean the razor in the shower by popping the head off and/or putting it in the cleaning station.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like mine just says to clean it after it has been used for so many seconds.</li>
            <li>Easy as 1-2-3.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;With the shaving experience being easy, What about the cleanup and repackaging experience?</li>
            <li>/&gt;With the shaving experience being easy, What about the cleanup and repackaging experience?</li>
            <li>and it is easily irritated.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and recommend using Lectric Shave to help prep the beard too.</li>
            <li>on the whole, this was nice but not as good as just using a straight razor and takes up a bit of space.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll try and respond promptly.by popping off the head, however, it feels like cheap plastic, and it seems like it&#x27;d be easy to snap a piece of plastic in doing that, which would ruin the head-unit.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s easy to clean the razor in the shower with just water by popping off the head, however, it feels like cheap plastic, and it seems like it&#x27;d be easy to snap a piece of plastic in doing that, which would ruin the head-unit.</li>
            <li>The razor, like all Norelco&#x27;s, cuts fine and can give you a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>This thing is huge.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re fortunate to have the space for the unit.</li>
            <li>razor is sturdy, well-made, and comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic because it means you can travel with the razor without having to take the charging stand and just a cord.  </li>
            <li>Detailed enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is sound through and through.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is sound through and through.  </li>
            <li>shaver provides a close, comfortable shave with no irritation and all the convenience that an electric is known for.  </li>
            <li>The frustration free packaging lives up to its name.  </li>
            <li>The rotary blades do move smoothly over the skin.</li>
            <li>It was frustration free packaging</li>
            <li>I say he did not whine, but I have to tell you that he did mumble something about the replacement heads costing more than several of his beloved birddogs.  </li>
            <li>That was surprising to me because it is made for sensitive skin, so you would think that would be counter productive.  </li>
            <li>- the whole top pops off and can be rinsed easily.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t get as clean a shave as I&#x27;d like, either.</li>
            <li>Razor tells you when to clean it.  </li>
            <li>I clean it every time it needs a charge (about 30-50 uses, I think).  </li>
            <li>Utilizing the included SmartClean cartridge, it&#x27;ll clean the hair out from the head, preventing it from clogging.  </li>
            <li>Can also be cleaned manually with water, though they advertise that the SmartClean system will clean it better.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>So for the lifetime of this shaver, he&#x27;ll no longer need to clean the heads under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My overall assessment is that this is a comfortable shaver that does a really good job for me.</li>
            <li>He even received special dispensation to use one in the army in the 1950&#x27;s, when they were against regulation.  </li>
            <li>It can handle a good number of shaves on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses (for me, at least):&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s slim and easy to hold and maneuver with its flexible head.</li>
            <li>I have owned A LOT of Norelco razors over the last 20 years, and have been mostly delighted with their products.  </li>
            <li>you may only get one good shave out of it before needing to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require hot water, shaving cream and a towel, and I can be done with it very quickly and neatly.</li>
            <li>The recharge was quick and, unlike many of the cheapo models he&#x27;s lately been using, it was attractive sitting in its stand on the vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Smart Clean System is a unique feature to keep the blades clean.  </li>
            <li>/cleaning stand&lt;br /&gt;Firm, soft-shell travel pouch (it&#x27;s very nice and fits all my other Norelco&#x27;s)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that this particular model can also be used in the shower also and comes with a large stand that contains a cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>I got a pretty smooth shave, without pulling or skin irritation.</li>
            <li>battery provides a good long life to this unit.</li>
            <li>have been enjoying shaving with the new shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The most helpful part of the Norelco experience is the manual, which covers pretty much every scenario you can think of.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The most helpful part of the Norelco experience is the manual, which covers pretty much every scenario you can think of.  </li>
            <li>still prefer a blade to an electric but for fast and easy this is worth a try</li>
            <li>This Norelco Shaver is a nice little unit that offers a good shave.</li>
            <li>I thought this was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes with a sturdy travel case, and honestly, if you&#x27;re only going to be gone a week or so, you could probably travel without the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>Though it’s a pricey, the investment for this wireless rechargeable shaver is well worth</li>
            <li>Calling it “the second coming” of shaving might be a bit much, but personally, it’s the best shaver I’ve had in my possession.  </li>
            <li>Calling it “the second coming” of shaving might be a bit much, but personally, it’s the best shaver I’ve had in my possession.  </li>
            <li>And like most rechargeables the shaver will not work while plugged in, either on the stand or directly with the charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor fits nicely in the hand, is quiet, and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>The openings in the head are pretty large in comparison to what I&#x27;m used to, making it easy to catch folds or wrinkles in the skin, although the lower rpm prevents it from causing damage.</li>
            <li>The smart clean system was also a bonus, as was the not to pricey replacement cartridge.  </li>
            <li>Well, there’s the Smart clean system, which serves as both the charging unit and also a means of cleaning – though not disinfecting – the wireless shaver.  </li>
            <li>Besides the cleaning system itself, a cleaning cartridge is provided, which is inserted in the bottom of the smart clean system.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!the intensity of the shave you may only get one good shave out of it before needing to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be fair, he used the blade about 3 weeks before returning to his normal method of shaving using a 4 or 5 blade standard razor.  </li>
            <li>It takes up room on your sink area, and I&#x27;m not sure that the cleaning system really does any better job than just a good rinse with hot water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first, he was reluctant to utilize the head cleaner, insisting that he normally cleaned his razors in the sink which worked just fine, but I urged him to try it once</li>
            <li>According to him, via a face to face report, the shaver gives him a fast, comfortable and very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Overall that&#x27;s a big win for me.</li>
            <li>The set-up for this razor is easy plus it has clear directions.</li>
            <li>He was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use and</li>
            <li>He said prior electrics didn’t work well for him, but this one being top of the line was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It provides a smooth shave without irritation which says a lot when you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(A small &amp;#34;travel/storage case&amp;#34; also comes with it, which is very nice.)  </li>
            <li>hey, he married my closest sister.  </li>
            <li>a higher rated Norelco razor ?</li>
            <li>After charging the shaver up, I began by first using the trimmer (requires removing the shaver head, and putting on the trimmer attachment) to whack through the growth -- the trimmer seemed to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>You know, where you need to operate on a baby seal in an emergency and you want to antiseptically prep the area of the incision by removing the hair first.  </li>
            <li>You know, where you need to operate on a baby seal in an emergency and you want to antiseptically prep the area of the incision by removing the hair first.  </li>
            <li>It does an okay job of shaving if you have a lot of time and don&#x27;t mind going over the same areas a lot.  </li>
            <li>I know beards are kind of fashionable nowadays, but I&#x27;ve never been able to go more than a day or two without shaving before it starts to drive me crazy.  </li>
            <li>If your counter space in the bathroom is as precious as ours, this is too big.  </li>
            <li>Still, razors can get pretty gross over time if not cleaned, so it&#x27;s not bad that you can clean it this way, but it&#x27;s like havinga monthly subscription for your razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say that you should read all these reviews and decide whether this is the right model for your particular needs.</li>
            <li>I subtract a whole &#x27;nother star because I didn&#x27;t care for the uncloseness of the shave and the unexpectedly large number of times I had to go over certain areas compared to my standard shaver, which made those areas more irritable and redder and</li>
            <li>Most recently I&#x27;ve been wearing a full beard, so am only shaving my lower neck.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself features numerous indicators, notably the battery display (full and low).  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is a separate attachment--pretty easy to swap out, but still a nuisance--and not nearly as convenient or as useful as most other trimmers.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco Shaver 7300 is truly gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>While this was supposedly frustration free packaging, there were still 5 boxes and lots of packaging yo open and recycle.  </li>
            <li>The razor can be used in the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t glide over the skin very well unless you use shaving gel/cream.</li>
            <li>It really is quite imposing sitting on the countertop.  </li>
            <li>If you were shaving fast, it seems like it could cut the inside of your lip.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>MUCH easier.</li>
            <li>On the system, there is a lit up display featuring indicators for power, cleaning, cleaning cartridge replacement, ready, and charging.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>whole is three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>whole is three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He did not feel this was a reasonable substitute in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Pick any other Norelco razor made in the last 30 years and you will see that the top of the razor is perfectly smooth, no gaping holes at all, and the razor heads all sit flush to the head-unit.  </li>
            <li>(Actually, I&#x27;ve gone a whole week while backpacking, but I&#x27;m sure you can guess what the first order of business was when I got out of the back country.)  </li>
            <li>There was some minor skin irritation on the first shave, but it did deliver a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>It takes up more counter space and is taller than the other shaver.  </li>
            <li>If you look at my issues below, just apply those to other Norelco razors and you should be able to find an acceptable one.  </li>
            <li>And when you’re naturally hair as I tend to be but don’t prefer lots of facial hair, well, you need one awesome shaver (wet or dry like this one) that can get the job done.</li>
            <li>And when you’re naturally hair as I tend to be but don’t prefer lots of facial hair, well, you need one awesome shaver (wet or dry like this one) that can get the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 100% sure now that the Philips people did not very much intend to design this product, the Philips Norelco Shaver 7300 for Sensitive Skin, S7370/87,</li>
            <li>Either way, it works great, especially on my neck where the hair is hard to trim.</li>
            <li>If one wishes to repack the product in the box, it’s easy to do IF you are careful to watch how you unpacked it.  </li>
            <li>If one wishes to repack the product in the box, it’s easy to do IF you are careful to watch how you unpacked it.  </li>
            <li>but then I also felt the sting of the older razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moving on then comes the shaver, the main attraction.  </li>
            <li>The liquid soap that is included also didn&#x27;t appeal to him and reminded him of an older man then what he likes as a 30-something guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He told me that without having to push down too hard he was able to get a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>The top can even be disassembled for better cleaning - another plus over the Arcitec, where I was constantly getting tiny bits of fuzz from the towel clogging up the little rotary blades.  </li>
            <li>When you read about the extra features and cool things that is says that it can do, you might be convinced that this shaver is worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, he&#x27;s tried every brand from high end Remingtons and Norelcos, to no name brands found for under $30 in mail order catalogues - so he had a lot to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, a quality product that comes highly recommended by my Dad.</li>
            <li>The obvious problem on a vessel with no gravity is that that extra part is perfectly happy to wander off the table and roam about the whole vehicle, which we always don&#x27;t want because such loose objects floating around unincarcerated is that we bump into them or they bump into us, which we always dislike.  </li>
            <li>No matter what the new technology, electric razors always pull on my particular type of beard growth.</li>
            <li>Philips gets that right, as personally the SmartClick Trimmer was used to “shape” and “groom” hair, which the comfort rings,</li>
            <li>(It states that you need to clean after every shave, but the razor will last a few days before the light comes on.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Razor feels cheap, not like other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned in the past&lt;br</li>
            <li>one.an this new one.</li>
            <li>Whether a more traditional wet shave with a razor or a shave with an electric razor, iti s a matter of preference.</li>
            <li>The 2nd and 3rd shaves seemed to deliver similarly good results with less skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He highly recommends this shaver to everyone, with or without sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The shaver &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; a bit more, making it more uncomfortable to use, though it is not enough to make him want to stop using it.  </li>
            <li>I’m sure you can plug it in elsewhere or only occasionally as I don’t think daily (or maybe even weekly)</li>
            <li>Despite the minor drawbacks, he likes it well enough that this has become his preferred shaver, even though his old one still works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaver under review is perfectly suited to being a leg leveler if you&#x27;ve got a leg that exactly 2.3 inches short, which is extremely unlikely and which also equals just a skosh less than two and nineteen sixty-fourths.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d make a recommendation for a better Norelco model, but they change and become discontinued so frequently that it seems pointless.  </li>
            <li>When you are shaving under the nose, the two top heads get pushed down, but the bottom head stays popped up, which means the edge of that head goes inside your mouth, and runs along the inside of your upper lip, which is just distguisting.  </li>
            <li>He also liked the fact that it worked equally well as both a wet and dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s not able to use a razor any longer due to skin sensitivities, so he&#x27;s been looking around for a good shaver.</li>

            <li>We have had old Norelco shavers that have snagged and pulled hairs.  </li>

            <li>He does miss the attachment that his old shaver had that allowed him to shave his neck as well.  </li>
            <li>The ability to plug the razor directly into the power cord and not having to charge it through the charging/cleaning stand.  </li>
            <li>My first shave was about that long</li>
            <li>As far as cleaning the shaver, the comfort rings/hair chamber is detachable and washable which is a pro.&lt;br</li>

            <li>After a few passes, my mini-beard/mustache was gone, and my skin was smooth again.  </li>
            <li>On my old shaver, I&#x27;ve encountered times where my shaver would turn on while in luggage.  </li>
            <li>At the time of this review, the replaceable shaver head costs nearly $50 (to be replaced about once a year).  </li>
            <li>I have particularly sensitive skin, with rosacea</li>
            <li>Whether it was an old &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; 3 head Norelco, a Remington Microscreen, or a Braun.  </li>
            <li>working perfectly so far.</li>
            <li>I don’t notice such things, or not as much, with a non-rotary electric shaver, or indeed with a non-electric hand razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, that all changed when he got his hands on this Philips Norelco Shaver 7300 for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely quiet, and it gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all I was surprised when this razor came.  </li>
            <li>Nice feature, even if it is unnecessary for me, since I rise it after every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then again, with a product as fancy and expensive as this shaver, it should have a good manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then again, with a product as fancy and expensive as this shaver, it should have a good manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Charges full in less than an hour</li>
            <li>Frustration Free Packaging, for use on the ISS at all, which is why I subtract only half a star from five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleaning/charger base is a nice addition so don&#x27;t have to worry how I&#x27;m going to clean it for the next morning and always ready and charged.</li>
            <li>Instead, I remove the head of the shaver, and rinse out the hair under the faucet, then put it back together in the charging/cleaning stand.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the stand, it is rather large, since it contains the cleaning cartridge (I included a picture next to deodorant for size comparison).  </li>
            <li>The distance between the outside edge of the cutters and the outside edge of the head unit is quite large, even if it is curved.  </li>
            <li>The distance between the outside edge of the cutters and the outside edge of the head unit is quite large, even if it is curved.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, clean, and provides the closest shave I have ever had from an electric razor (to include multiple Brauns, Remingtons and other Norelcos).  </li>
            <li>It is, however, close enough for a very serviceable shave, and the fact it takes mere seconds means I shave more frequently.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more than a few millimeters, and it means the blades need to be sharp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The parts do fit into a hard case, and the product does qualify for Prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this point, I am going to simply dump it and use my old shaver until I find a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Like many products that have a lot of extra features it fails to master the main purpose.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been disappointed more often than not by the different shavers available out there.</li>
            <li>The power button is in plain sight as it should be, right beneath the shaver’s model name.  </li>
            <li>You can plug the charger directly into the bottom of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still getting used to using an electric, and it really does take a few weeks to switch over.</li>
            <li>This is fortunate because the base is huge, and even my 13 year old daughter didn&#x27;t like seeing it on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>If you shoot it with a .22 short round from ten paces it won&#x27;t work exactly right.  </li>
            <li>If you shoot it with a .22 short round from ten paces it won&#x27;t work exactly right.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it feels large and the heads are spaced out a bit further than on some other models, which means you need to shave with a slightly larger circular</li>
            <li>Overall, it feels large and the heads are spaced out a bit further than on some other models, which means you need to shave with a slightly larger circular motion.  </li>
            <li>This comes with a solution to put in, but I found just rinsing it keeps it clean enough for the most part, and using the base is something that doesn&#x27;t need to be done as often.  </li>
            <li>I really wish they would cut down on the amount of double boxing done.</li>
            <li>I do subtract another half a star for how big the whole apparatus is even on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you are shaving, the heads get pushed down and then pop back up when there&#x27;s no pressure on them, so they&#x27;re constantly moving back and forth during the whole shave.  </li>
            <li>Razor feels cheap, not like other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned in the past 6.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m not sure if the one I got was defective or not, but it had a much lower rpm than my lower-wattage Norelco, which strangely made it less powerful and also easier to catch.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to read the whole review, just find a Norelco that doesn&#x27;t leave that huge gaping hole in the middle of the razor when the cutting heads are at rest.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I notice that it works best on hair that is thicker &amp; bristle-like (stubs) rather than finer hair areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He was impressed with the ease in which this thing can e cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Find a Norelco that has a perfectly flush head, like this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Well the Philips Norelco Series 7000 Shaver 7300 is the perfect answer!</li>
            <li> The best electric razor my husband has ever had.</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s the best electric shaver he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> The battery life is very good.</li>
            <li> The flex heads work to yield an incredibly close shave for an electric model.  </li>
            <li> Not even close to ideal for trimming or infrequent shaving.</li>
            <li> A good product!</li>
            <li> Not as good as a shave with a razor, but the best electric shaver we have used.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver.</li>
            <li> That being said, I haven&#x27;t experienced any razor burn, chafing, or undue dryness from use...</li>
            <li> I am using this razor as the replacement for my Philips Norelco Snso-Touch which is quite honestly the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> The carrying case is great for travel.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, He has been delighted with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> This one does a good job of getting close without nicking or razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Both methods provide a good charge.</li>
            <li> Once charging the shaver, it’s good for about an hour.  </li>
            <li> Charger stand allows for a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, all in all I’d say this is a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> That is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very pleased to report that he loved everything about this shaver.  </li>
            <li> This Norelco Shaver 7300 is a welcome change and has seemed to do a better job of trimming those hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There weren&#x27;t any clamshell packaging, so that was nice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that the heads can be washed to get the hairs out/quick cleaning.  </li>
            <li> the directions state that the razor is good for 3 days growth without trimming, two days is probably a better estimate.</li>
            <li> system is pricey,  but the quality seems to be good as with most Norelco products.</li>
            <li> This particular shaving configuration was best for close shaves upon testing the unit.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent, high quality razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although he may be easy to please, he told me that since he knew the price going in, he was expecting superior performance</li>
            <li> Luckily I have a Wahl beard trimmer that works great</li>
            <li> Cleaning the heads is very easy</li>
            <li> This makes this product that much more effective because it has been written with the upmost customer service in mind.  </li>
            <li> This makes this product that much more effective because it has been written with the upmost customer service in mind.  </li>
            <li> He was also very impressed with the battery life which has been far greater than any model he has ever owned or used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the circular design doesn&#x27;t lend itself to very accurate trimming.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall his is quite happy with this shaver and since he is not a shy person as to voicing complaints I am content that he is pleased with this shaver which , in turn, pleases me and pleases my sister.</li>
            <li> The cleaner is effective, but it&#x27;s easy to spill when changing.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the best electric razor we&#x27;ve used; would recommend.</li>
            <li> If you shave every day or two, you&#x27;ll be able to use this and never worry about shaving cream or blades again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, this Norelco electric razor is generally better in both categories of pull and irritation.</li>
            <li> Do you need an incredibly close, complete shave in your life fellas?</li>
            <li> couple more weeks&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco shaver looks cooler than most shavers on the market.  </li>
            <li> One plus for this one over the Arcitec is that the trimmer is a separate attachment which works much better.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn’t quite sure what that was.  </li>
            <li> Travel case is very nice, I will certainly be using it for all my Norelco shavers when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor for those looking for a clean and relatively frequent shave.  </li>
            <li> Granted, they aren&#x27;t always perfect, but they&#x27;re usually quite good.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is great, although it requires the shaver head to be pulled off and the trimmer popped on, unlike my older Norelco</li>
            <li> Norelco makes great shavers, so I guess I&#x27;m going to just appreciate that my ancient one is still working better for me than this new</li>
            <li> tried out the beard trimmer and it works fine; but I have to admit I like the models better where the trimmer is attached and doesn’t need to be installed by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 7300 is a great razor for those with sensitive skin like me.  </li>
            <li> Being able to easily clean the razor in the shower by popping the head off and/or putting it in the cleaning station.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems like mine just says to clean it after it has been used for so many seconds.</li>
            <li> Easy as 1-2-3.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;With the shaving experience being easy, What about the cleanup and repackaging experience?</li>
            <li> /&gt;With the shaving experience being easy, What about the cleanup and repackaging experience?</li>
            <li> and it is easily irritated.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and recommend using Lectric Shave to help prep the beard too.</li>
            <li> on the whole, this was nice but not as good as just using a straight razor and takes up a bit of space.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll try and respond promptly.by popping off the head, however, it feels like cheap plastic, and it seems like it&#x27;d be easy to snap a piece of plastic in doing that, which would ruin the head-unit.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s easy to clean the razor in the shower with just water by popping off the head, however, it feels like cheap plastic, and it seems like it&#x27;d be easy to snap a piece of plastic in doing that, which would ruin the head-unit.</li>
            <li> The razor, like all Norelco&#x27;s, cuts fine and can give you a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> This thing is huge.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re fortunate to have the space for the unit.</li>
            <li> razor is sturdy, well-made, and comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic because it means you can travel with the razor without having to take the charging stand and just a cord.  </li>
            <li> Detailed enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product is sound through and through.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product is sound through and through.  </li>
            <li> shaver provides a close, comfortable shave with no irritation and all the convenience that an electric is known for.  </li>
            <li> The frustration free packaging lives up to its name.  </li>
            <li> The rotary blades do move smoothly over the skin.</li>
            <li> It was frustration free packaging</li>
            <li> I say he did not whine, but I have to tell you that he did mumble something about the replacement heads costing more than several of his beloved birddogs.  </li>
            <li> That was surprising to me because it is made for sensitive skin, so you would think that would be counter productive.  </li>
            <li> - the whole top pops off and can be rinsed easily.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t get as clean a shave as I&#x27;d like, either.</li>
            <li> Razor tells you when to clean it.  </li>
            <li> I clean it every time it needs a charge (about 30-50 uses, I think).  </li>
            <li> Utilizing the included SmartClean cartridge, it&#x27;ll clean the hair out from the head, preventing it from clogging.  </li>
            <li> Can also be cleaned manually with water, though they advertise that the SmartClean system will clean it better.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> So for the lifetime of this shaver, he&#x27;ll no longer need to clean the heads under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My overall assessment is that this is a comfortable shaver that does a really good job for me.</li>
            <li> He even received special dispensation to use one in the army in the 1950&#x27;s, when they were against regulation.  </li>
            <li> It can handle a good number of shaves on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses (for me, at least):&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s slim and easy to hold and maneuver with its flexible head.</li>
            <li> I have owned A LOT of Norelco razors over the last 20 years, and have been mostly delighted with their products.  </li>
            <li> you may only get one good shave out of it before needing to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require hot water, shaving cream and a towel, and I can be done with it very quickly and neatly.</li>
            <li> The recharge was quick and, unlike many of the cheapo models he&#x27;s lately been using, it was attractive sitting in its stand on the vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Smart Clean System is a unique feature to keep the blades clean.  </li>
            <li> /cleaning stand&lt;br /&gt;Firm, soft-shell travel pouch (it&#x27;s very nice and fits all my other Norelco&#x27;s)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that this particular model can also be used in the shower also and comes with a large stand that contains a cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty smooth shave, without pulling or skin irritation.</li>
            <li> battery provides a good long life to this unit.</li>
            <li> have been enjoying shaving with the new shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The most helpful part of the Norelco experience is the manual, which covers pretty much every scenario you can think of.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The most helpful part of the Norelco experience is the manual, which covers pretty much every scenario you can think of.  </li>
            <li> still prefer a blade to an electric but for fast and easy this is worth a try</li>
            <li> This Norelco Shaver is a nice little unit that offers a good shave.</li>
            <li> I thought this was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with a sturdy travel case, and honestly, if you&#x27;re only going to be gone a week or so, you could probably travel without the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> Though it’s a pricey, the investment for this wireless rechargeable shaver is well worth</li>
            <li> Calling it “the second coming” of shaving might be a bit much, but personally, it’s the best shaver I’ve had in my possession.  </li>
            <li> Calling it “the second coming” of shaving might be a bit much, but personally, it’s the best shaver I’ve had in my possession.  </li>
            <li> And like most rechargeables the shaver will not work while plugged in, either on the stand or directly with the charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor fits nicely in the hand, is quiet, and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> The openings in the head are pretty large in comparison to what I&#x27;m used to, making it easy to catch folds or wrinkles in the skin, although the lower rpm prevents it from causing damage.</li>
            <li> The smart clean system was also a bonus, as was the not to pricey replacement cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Well, there’s the Smart clean system, which serves as both the charging unit and also a means of cleaning – though not disinfecting – the wireless shaver.  </li>
            <li> Besides the cleaning system itself, a cleaning cartridge is provided, which is inserted in the bottom of the smart clean system.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!the intensity of the shave you may only get one good shave out of it before needing to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be fair, he used the blade about 3 weeks before returning to his normal method of shaving using a 4 or 5 blade standard razor.  </li>
            <li> It takes up room on your sink area, and I&#x27;m not sure that the cleaning system really does any better job than just a good rinse with hot water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first, he was reluctant to utilize the head cleaner, insisting that he normally cleaned his razors in the sink which worked just fine, but I urged him to try it once</li>
            <li> According to him, via a face to face report, the shaver gives him a fast, comfortable and very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Overall that&#x27;s a big win for me.</li>
            <li> The set-up for this razor is easy plus it has clear directions.</li>
            <li> He was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use and</li>
            <li> He said prior electrics didn’t work well for him, but this one being top of the line was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth shave without irritation which says a lot when you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (A small &amp;#34;travel/storage case&amp;#34; also comes with it, which is very nice.)  </li>
            <li> hey, he married my closest sister.  </li>
            <li> a higher rated Norelco razor ?</li>
            <li> After charging the shaver up, I began by first using the trimmer (requires removing the shaver head, and putting on the trimmer attachment) to whack through the growth -- the trimmer seemed to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> You know, where you need to operate on a baby seal in an emergency and you want to antiseptically prep the area of the incision by removing the hair first.  </li>
            <li> You know, where you need to operate on a baby seal in an emergency and you want to antiseptically prep the area of the incision by removing the hair first.  </li>
            <li> It does an okay job of shaving if you have a lot of time and don&#x27;t mind going over the same areas a lot.  </li>
            <li> I know beards are kind of fashionable nowadays, but I&#x27;ve never been able to go more than a day or two without shaving before it starts to drive me crazy.  </li>
            <li> If your counter space in the bathroom is as precious as ours, this is too big.  </li>
            <li> Still, razors can get pretty gross over time if not cleaned, so it&#x27;s not bad that you can clean it this way, but it&#x27;s like havinga monthly subscription for your razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say that you should read all these reviews and decide whether this is the right model for your particular needs.</li>
            <li> I subtract a whole &#x27;nother star because I didn&#x27;t care for the uncloseness of the shave and the unexpectedly large number of times I had to go over certain areas compared to my standard shaver, which made those areas more irritable and redder and</li>
            <li> Most recently I&#x27;ve been wearing a full beard, so am only shaving my lower neck.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself features numerous indicators, notably the battery display (full and low).  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is a separate attachment--pretty easy to swap out, but still a nuisance--and not nearly as convenient or as useful as most other trimmers.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Shaver 7300 is truly gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> While this was supposedly frustration free packaging, there were still 5 boxes and lots of packaging yo open and recycle.  </li>
            <li> The razor can be used in the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t glide over the skin very well unless you use shaving gel/cream.</li>
            <li> It really is quite imposing sitting on the countertop.  </li>
            <li> If you were shaving fast, it seems like it could cut the inside of your lip.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> MUCH easier.</li>
            <li> On the system, there is a lit up display featuring indicators for power, cleaning, cleaning cartridge replacement, ready, and charging.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>

            <li> He did not feel this was a reasonable substitute in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Pick any other Norelco razor made in the last 30 years and you will see that the top of the razor is perfectly smooth, no gaping holes at all, and the razor heads all sit flush to the head-unit.  </li>
            <li> (Actually, I&#x27;ve gone a whole week while backpacking, but I&#x27;m sure you can guess what the first order of business was when I got out of the back country.)  </li>
            <li> There was some minor skin irritation on the first shave, but it did deliver a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> It takes up more counter space and is taller than the other shaver.  </li>
            <li> If you look at my issues below, just apply those to other Norelco razors and you should be able to find an acceptable one.  </li>
            <li> And when you’re naturally hair as I tend to be but don’t prefer lots of facial hair, well, you need one awesome shaver (wet or dry like this one) that can get the job done.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m almost 100% sure now that the Philips people did not very much intend to design this product, the Philips Norelco Shaver 7300 for Sensitive Skin, S7370/87,</li>
            <li> Either way, it works great, especially on my neck where the hair is hard to trim.</li>
            <li> If one wishes to repack the product in the box, it’s easy to do IF you are careful to watch how you unpacked it.  </li>

            <li> but then I also felt the sting of the older razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moving on then comes the shaver, the main attraction.  </li>
            <li> The liquid soap that is included also didn&#x27;t appeal to him and reminded him of an older man then what he likes as a 30-something guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He told me that without having to push down too hard he was able to get a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> The top can even be disassembled for better cleaning - another plus over the Arcitec, where I was constantly getting tiny bits of fuzz from the towel clogging up the little rotary blades.  </li>
            <li> When you read about the extra features and cool things that is says that it can do, you might be convinced that this shaver is worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li> Over the years, he&#x27;s tried every brand from high end Remingtons and Norelcos, to no name brands found for under $30 in mail order catalogues - so he had a lot to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, a quality product that comes highly recommended by my Dad.</li>
            <li> The obvious problem on a vessel with no gravity is that that extra part is perfectly happy to wander off the table and roam about the whole vehicle, which we always don&#x27;t want because such loose objects floating around unincarcerated is that we bump into them or they bump into us, which we always dislike.  </li>
            <li> No matter what the new technology, electric razors always pull on my particular type of beard growth.</li>
            <li> Philips gets that right, as personally the SmartClick Trimmer was used to “shape” and “groom” hair, which the comfort rings,</li>
            <li> (It states that you need to clean after every shave, but the razor will last a few days before the light comes on.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Razor feels cheap, not like other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned in the past&lt;br</li>
            <li> one.an this new one.</li>
            <li> Whether a more traditional wet shave with a razor or a shave with an electric razor, iti s a matter of preference.</li>
            <li> The 2nd and 3rd shaves seemed to deliver similarly good results with less skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He highly recommends this shaver to everyone, with or without sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The shaver &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; a bit more, making it more uncomfortable to use, though it is not enough to make him want to stop using it.  </li>
            <li> I’m sure you can plug it in elsewhere or only occasionally as I don’t think daily (or maybe even weekly)</li>
            <li> Despite the minor drawbacks, he likes it well enough that this has become his preferred shaver, even though his old one still works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver under review is perfectly suited to being a leg leveler if you&#x27;ve got a leg that exactly 2.3 inches short, which is extremely unlikely and which also equals just a skosh less than two and nineteen sixty-fourths.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d make a recommendation for a better Norelco model, but they change and become discontinued so frequently that it seems pointless.  </li>
            <li> When you are shaving under the nose, the two top heads get pushed down, but the bottom head stays popped up, which means the edge of that head goes inside your mouth, and runs along the inside of your upper lip, which is just distguisting.  </li>
            <li> He also liked the fact that it worked equally well as both a wet and dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s not able to use a razor any longer due to skin sensitivities, so he&#x27;s been looking around for a good shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a natural shaving oil will help keep the razor less gunky and easier to clean, while avoiding shaving creams loaded with chemicals.)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>

            <li> He does miss the attachment that his old shaver had that allowed him to shave his neck as well.  </li>
            <li> The ability to plug the razor directly into the power cord and not having to charge it through the charging/cleaning stand.  </li>
            <li> My first shave was about that long</li>

            <li> After a few passes, my mini-beard/mustache was gone, and my skin was smooth again.  </li>
            <li> On my old shaver, I&#x27;ve encountered times where my shaver would turn on while in luggage.  </li>
            <li> At the time of this review, the replaceable shaver head costs nearly $50 (to be replaced about once a year).  </li>
            <li> I have particularly sensitive skin, with rosacea</li>
            <li> Whether it was an old &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; 3 head Norelco, a Remington Microscreen, or a Braun.  </li>
            <li> working perfectly so far.</li>
            <li> I don’t notice such things, or not as much, with a non-rotary electric shaver, or indeed with a non-electric hand razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, that all changed when he got his hands on this Philips Norelco Shaver 7300 for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely quiet, and it gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all I was surprised when this razor came.  </li>
            <li> Nice feature, even if it is unnecessary for me, since I rise it after every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then again, with a product as fancy and expensive as this shaver, it should have a good manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then again, with a product as fancy and expensive as this shaver, it should have a good manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Charges full in less than an hour</li>
            <li> Frustration Free Packaging, for use on the ISS at all, which is why I subtract only half a star from five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning/charger base is a nice addition so don&#x27;t have to worry how I&#x27;m going to clean it for the next morning and always ready and charged.</li>
            <li> Instead, I remove the head of the shaver, and rinse out the hair under the faucet, then put it back together in the charging/cleaning stand.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the stand, it is rather large, since it contains the cleaning cartridge (I included a picture next to deodorant for size comparison).  </li>
            <li> The distance between the outside edge of the cutters and the outside edge of the head unit is quite large, even if it is curved.  </li>
            <li> The distance between the outside edge of the cutters and the outside edge of the head unit is quite large, even if it is curved.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, clean, and provides the closest shave I have ever had from an electric razor (to include multiple Brauns, Remingtons and other Norelcos).  </li>
            <li> It is, however, close enough for a very serviceable shave, and the fact it takes mere seconds means I shave more frequently.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more than a few millimeters, and it means the blades need to be sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The parts do fit into a hard case, and the product does qualify for Prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this point, I am going to simply dump it and use my old shaver until I find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Like many products that have a lot of extra features it fails to master the main purpose.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been disappointed more often than not by the different shavers available out there.</li>
            <li> The power button is in plain sight as it should be, right beneath the shaver’s model name.  </li>
            <li> You can plug the charger directly into the bottom of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still getting used to using an electric, and it really does take a few weeks to switch over.</li>
            <li> This is fortunate because the base is huge, and even my 13 year old daughter didn&#x27;t like seeing it on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> If you shoot it with a .22 short round from ten paces it won&#x27;t work exactly right.  </li>

            <li> Overall, it feels large and the heads are spaced out a bit further than on some other models, which means you need to shave with a slightly larger circular motion.  </li>
            <li> This comes with a solution to put in, but I found just rinsing it keeps it clean enough for the most part, and using the base is something that doesn&#x27;t need to be done as often.  </li>
            <li> I really wish they would cut down on the amount of double boxing done.</li>
            <li> I do subtract another half a star for how big the whole apparatus is even on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you are shaving, the heads get pushed down and then pop back up when there&#x27;s no pressure on them, so they&#x27;re constantly moving back and forth during the whole shave.  </li>
            <li> Razor feels cheap, not like other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned in the past 6.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure if the one I got was defective or not, but it had a much lower rpm than my lower-wattage Norelco, which strangely made it less powerful and also easier to catch.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to read the whole review, just find a Norelco that doesn&#x27;t leave that huge gaping hole in the middle of the razor when the cutting heads are at rest.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco Shaver 7300 for Sensitive skin did an above average job on my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I also like the angle of the heads on the Arcitec over this one - slightly cup shaped instead of bulged outward from the center, but both flex and once my face got used to it, it wasn&#x27;t really an issue anymore.  </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco Shaver 7300 for Sensitive Skin&lt;br /&gt;+Above average shave for an electric&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> As Norelco says in the manual, it takes a little while for your face to adjust to a new shaver, and it took me about a week before this one stopped feeling like it was pulling at the hairs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was frustrated by the lack of precision in maintaining my beard line, and the fact that without sufficient stubble, I kept missing patches that no matter how many times I went over the spot, I couldn&#x27;t seem to catch the grains the right way.  </li>
            <li> It probably would have been much cheaper and a better value without the base extras.  </li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t have young, tight skin (which I don&#x27;t), keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> When you go around places like your chin, it&#x27;s EASY for the razor heads to get caught up on the hard angles of your face, and so you have to go back a little and change the angle of the motion to get the head to get pushed down.  </li>
            <li> Also, the regular blades are extremely sharp and prone to pulling on longer facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I get hardly any razor burn and yet the shave is very</li>
            <li> He was looking for a closeness of shave, if not as close as a blade, at least a reasonable substitute.  </li>
            <li> If i&#x27;m going to wet shave,I&#x27;ll use a regular razor.</li>
            <li> And the base that functions as a cleaner is more trouble than its worth when you can just wash in the sink.</li>
            <li> The recharging/cleaning base will be a good feature to some, a pain for others.</li>
            <li> The apparent impact of the microbead coating did result in a slightly smoother passage over the skin.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you are interesting in trimming or shaving less frequently, this razor will be a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> For my usage, it only appears to need charging about once a week, which compares well with other electric shavers I’ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it dry, but also tried it with shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> I do my electric shaving dry and this razor appears to get all the places it should.</li>
            <li> He tried it dry and with electric shave lotion.  </li>
            <li> With limited bathroom counter space, this is proving a bit problematic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stand is a bit bulky if counter space is also limited.  </li>
            <li> This one can be used wet or dry, but I preferred using it dry as I was accustomed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very quiet shaver and very sharp.  </li>
            <li> The biggest plus for this reviewer was the ability to use the shaver wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> The ABSOLUTE WORST thing about this razor is the HUGE empty space that is created in the middle of the heads by the spring-loaded heads popping back up!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Norelco shavers, having previously used the Arcitec.  </li>
            <li> If cost is an issue, understand the probable need to buy new heads each year (and cleaning solution every few months) depending on how heavy your beard is.  </li>
            <li> For even better but less frequent cleaning there is the base.  </li>
            <li> husband thought it shaved a little nicer then a disposable razor but not nearly as nice as his preferred straight razor way.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t broken out, and I am getting reasonably close shaves.</li>
            <li> I prefer a wet shave,  as electric razors tend to irritate my face.</li>
            <li> As it is a cordless shaver, this can be used for wet shaving also, but I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s a wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s a wet shaver.  </li>

            <li> minus two halves minus 1</li>
            <li> A few times, I think it went through a cleaning cycle in the middle of the night which was a bit weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still he felt there was too much drag on his face.  </li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive skin, thick curly hair, and who is prone to both razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> But if you didn’t, it may take a few tries to get the parts back in correctly.  </li>
            <li> But if you didn’t, it may take a few tries to get the parts back in correctly.  </li>
            <li> The base unit that charges and cleans the shaver has almost as big a footprint as your garden-variety hydropentameter air tester, which is more than you might have</li>
            <li> that exactly 2.3 inches short, which is extremely unlikely and which also equals just a skosh less than two and nineteen sixty-fourths.  </li>
            <li> and you will see that that same distance on this razor is very small, which makes getting those hairs in hard to reach spots MUCH</li>
            <li> I usually use dry but will occasionally use in the shower with water.</li>
            <li> This makes it difficult to get those hairs that are right up under the nose.  </li>
            <li> This makes it difficult to get those hairs that are right up under the nose.  </li>
            <li> The other configuration is with the SmartClick Trimmer, which the manual prescribes for grooming sideburns and mustache.  </li>
            <li> does this compare to other electrics</li>
            <li> I have had several Norelco shavers and this one is clearly an indication that their designs are headed in the wrong direction.  </li>
            <li> Power cord fits other Norelco products, like the Bodygroom 7100, so you can have less cords in your bathroom if plugs are limited.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco  Series 7000 shaver is somewhat typical of other battery powered shavers.</li>
            <li> I think that you could probably find a recipe online for refilling the cleaning solution if you look hard enough.  </li>
            <li> This razor gives him a closer shave and in less time.  </li>
            <li> My Dad was the test subject for this shaver, since he&#x27;s always been an electric razor user.  </li>
            <li> A bit awkward at first, takes some getting used to&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite all of the extras, the shaving performance was not good enough for me to recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Razor pinches and does not clean the neck thoroughly&lt;</li>
            <li> Less waste.  </li>
            <li> Just a little inconvenience.</li>
            <li> The go-to shaver for everyday close shaves.  </li>
            <li> , I had a few issues with this model.  </li>

            <li> However, there are some parts of my face and neck that need going over a few times to get everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you will see that that same distance on this razor is very small, which makes getting those hairs in hard to reach spots</li>

            <li> I have used multiple electric razors in the past with poor results.  </li>

            <li> Though the base seems to work well in my limited use, it is large.  </li>
            <li> However, there are some spots that would require at least 5-10 passes to track down some elusive hair that somehow seem to dodge blades -- and in the process causes some skin irritation.  </li>

            <li> Lately, all their razors have required a charging stand, so this is a welcomed and needed change.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Also note that the base is not required for charging - the cord can be plugged straight into the shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the razor was a fairly common size, it was housed in a base that takes up considerable counter space about 5 x 5 inches and about 10 inches tall.</li>

            <li> Great shaver. Gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> Cleaning too complicated; didn&#x27;t even try after reading manual</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Shaver 7300 is truly gentle on my skin. I am using it to shave unwanted hair everywhere. I notice that it works best on hair that is thicker &amp; bristle-like (stubs) rather than finer hair areas. I compared it to my old triple head electric razor and it did not do the job as well but then I also felt the sting of the older razor. The instructions advise that the shave will become closer after one&#x27;s body acclimates during a training period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor for people with sensitive skin or those who need to shave over areas where nicks may occur using a manual bladed razor.</li>
            <li> Since I do not wear a beard nor do I have to shave my face (thank goodness)...yet, I passed this one along to a brother-in-law whom I am rather fond of...hey, he married my closest sister.  Anyway, He has been delighted with this shaver.  According to him, via a face to face report, the shaver gives him a fast, comfortable and very close shave.  He does have extremely sensitive skin and I did not hear one word of whining pass his lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was impressed with the ease in which this thing can e cleaned.  He also liked the fact that it worked equally well as both a wet and dry shaver.  He was also very impressed with the battery life which has been far greater than any model he has ever owned or used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I say he did not whine, but I have to tell you that he did mumble something about the replacement heads costing more than several of his beloved birddogs.  I assured him that when the time came that I would take out a loan and cover the cost for him.  That sort of shamed him and I heard no more complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall his is quite happy with this shaver and since he is not a shy person as to voicing complaints I am content that he is pleased with this shaver which , in turn, pleases me and pleases my sister.</li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive skin, thick curly hair, and who is prone to both razor burn and ingrown hairs. I thought this was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was frustrated by the lack of precision in maintaining my beard line, and the fact that without sufficient stubble, I kept missing patches that no matter how many times I went over the spot, I couldn&#x27;t seem to catch the grains the right way.  That being said, I haven&#x27;t experienced any razor burn, chafing, or undue dryness from use...I just don&#x27;t get as clean a shave as I&#x27;d like, either.</li>
            <li> While this was supposedly frustration free packaging, there were still 5 boxes and lots of packaging yo open and recycle.  There weren&#x27;t any clamshell packaging, so that was nice.  I really wish they would cut down on the amount of double boxing done. Now on to the razor review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a couple different electric razors over the years, and gone back and forth from blade to shaver. Most recently I&#x27;ve been wearing a full beard, so am only shaving my lower neck. I was using a 3 blade razor before the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;I have been enjoying shaving with the new shaver.  I&#x27;ve been using it dry, but also tried it with shaving gel.  Both work equally well.  I don&#x27;t using the cleaning solution each time I shave, in order to have it last longer. Instead, I remove the head of the shaver, and rinse out the hair under the faucet, then put it back together in the charging/cleaning stand.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the stand, it is rather large, since it contains the cleaning cartridge (I included a picture next to deodorant for size comparison).  You don&#x27;t have to use the stand though, if counter space is an issue.  You can plug the charger directly into the bottom of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still getting used to using an electric, and it really does take a few weeks to switch over. My skin hasn&#x27;t broken out, and I am getting reasonably close shaves. No, it isn&#x27;t as close as a blade, but I&#x27;m not expecting it to be.  It is, however, close enough for a very serviceable shave, and the fact it takes mere seconds means I shave more frequently.  It doesn&#x27;t require hot water, shaving cream and a towel, and I can be done with it very quickly and neatly. Overall that&#x27;s a big win for me.</li>
            <li> Not as good as a shave with a razor, but the best electric shaver we have used.  We have had old Norelco shavers that have snagged and pulled hairs.  This one does a good job of getting close without nicking or razor burn.  Unfortunately, the clipper requires an attachment, so a razor is still used for sideburns.  It&#x27;s nice that the heads can be washed to get the hairs out/quick cleaning.  The stand was way too big to keep on the counter so it was put away.  Overall, the best electric razor we&#x27;ve used; would recommend.</li>
            <li> This shaver was marketed for sensitive skin.  The apparent impact of the microbead coating did result in a slightly smoother passage over the skin. The flex heads work to yield an incredibly close shave for an electric model.  The biggest plus for this reviewer was the ability to use the shaver wet or dry.  The smart clean system was also a bonus, as was the not to pricey replacement cartridge.  Recommended for those with sensitive skin but wanting a close shave from an electric model.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor for those looking for a clean and relatively frequent shave.  It&#x27;s quiet, clean, and provides the closest shave I have ever had from an electric razor (to include multiple Brauns, Remingtons and other Norelcos).  If you shave every day or two, you&#x27;ll be able to use this and never worry about shaving cream or blades again.  On the other hand, if you are interesting in trimming or shaving less frequently, this razor will be a disappointment.  The trimmer is a separate attachment--pretty easy to swap out, but still a nuisance--and not nearly as convenient or as useful as most other trimmers.  Also, the regular blades are extremely sharp and prone to pulling on longer facial hair.  Also, the circular design doesn&#x27;t lend itself to very accurate trimming.  It&#x27;s a very quiet shaver and very sharp.  The cleaner is effective, but it&#x27;s easy to spill when changing.  Replacement cleaning cartridges run in the $10-15 range.  Bottom Line--The go-to shaver for everyday close shaves.  Not even close to ideal for trimming or infrequent shaving.</li>
            <li> The set-up for this razor is easy plus it has clear directions. The self-cleaning base is quite large which is something to keep in mind if you have limited counter space. We&#x27;re fortunate to have the space for the unit. You just pop the cleaning solution in the base, and it has lights to let you know when the razor needs cleaning. (It states that you need to clean after every shave, but the razor will last a few days before the light comes on.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have two options for charging. You can plug the charger directly into the razor or you can plug the charger into the cleaning base. Both methods provide a good charge. The battery life is very good. It comes with a sturdy travel case, and honestly, if you&#x27;re only going to be gone a week or so, you could probably travel without the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the directions state that the razor is good for 3 days growth without trimming, two days is probably a better estimate. If you do need to trim prior to shaving, you can attach the included trimmer on the razor. The razor can be used in the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t glide over the skin very well unless you use shaving gel/cream. While the heads do move independently, they will sometimes catch as you move from and around the chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is sturdy, well-made, and comfortable to hold and use. It provides a smooth shave without irritation which says a lot when you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Whether a more traditional wet shave with a razor or a shave with an electric razor, iti s a matter of preference. I prefer a wet shave,  as electric razors tend to irritate my face. No matter what the new technology, electric razors always pull on my particular type of beard growth. And the necessity of making continued passes over the same area tend to irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this Norelco electric razor is generally better in both categories of pull and irritation. As it is a cordless shaver, this can be used for wet shaving also, but I haven&#x27;t tried it. If i&#x27;m going to wet shave,I&#x27;ll use a regular razor. The recharging/cleaning base will be a good feature to some, a pain for others. It takes up room on your sink area, and I&#x27;m not sure that the cleaning system really does any better job than just a good rinse with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system is pricey,  but the quality seems to be good as with most Norelco products. So this product could be a five star one for some. For me, it rates 4 stars, not too bad considering I&#x27;m not a fan of electric razors.</li>
            <li> What a piece of garbage.  If I wasn&#x27;t recovering from surgery over the past week, I&#x27;d return this shaver.  At this point, I am going to simply dump it and use my old shaver until I find a replacement.  I have had several Norelco shavers and this one is clearly an indication that their designs are headed in the wrong direction.  I wish a choice was no stars</li>
            <li> My husband got this to replace a Braun electric self-cleaning shaver he has had for almost 10 years.  Pluses:  This razor gives him a closer shave and in less time.  It holds a charge well, allowing him to take it (without the base) with him when he travels.  Minuses:  It takes up more counter space and is taller than the other shaver.  It really is quite imposing sitting on the countertop.  I accidentally bumped the base when straightening up and it went into a cleaning cycle even though the shaver wasn&#x27;t even in it.  The shaver &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; a bit more, making it more uncomfortable to use, though it is not enough to make him want to stop using it.  He does miss the attachment that his old shaver had that allowed him to shave his neck as well.  Despite the minor drawbacks, he likes it well enough that this has become his preferred shaver, even though his old one still works fine.</li>
            <li> I have owned A LOT of Norelco razors over the last 20 years, and have been mostly delighted with their products.  Granted, they aren&#x27;t always perfect, but they&#x27;re usually quite good.  However, this razor leaves me bewildered, because I did not think Norelco could ever release a razor this bad.  It is, BY FAR, the worst Norelco I&#x27;ve used in over 20 years.  I&#x27;d make a recommendation for a better Norelco model, but they change and become discontinued so frequently that it seems pointless.  If you look at my issues below, just apply those to other Norelco razors and you should be able to find an acceptable one.  If you don&#x27;t want to read the whole review, just find a Norelco that doesn&#x27;t leave that huge gaping hole in the middle of the razor when the cutting heads are at rest.  Find a Norelco that has a perfectly flush head, like this [[ASIN:B003V32UDI Philips Norelco Shaver 8800 (Model  1290X/46 )]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included:&lt;br /&gt;Charging/cleaning stand&lt;br /&gt;Firm, soft-shell travel pouch (it&#x27;s very nice and fits all my other Norelco&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;Power cord&lt;br /&gt;Container of cleaning fluid&lt;br /&gt;Side burn attachment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;1. The razor, like all Norelco&#x27;s, cuts fine and can give you a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;2. Travel case is very nice, I will certainly be using it for all my Norelco shavers when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;3. The ability to plug the razor directly into the power cord and not having to charge it through the charging/cleaning stand.  This is fantastic because it means you can travel with the razor without having to take the charging stand and just a cord.  Lately, all their razors have required a charging stand, so this is a welcomed and needed change.&lt;br /&gt;4. Being able to easily clean the razor in the shower by popping the head off and/or putting it in the cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;5. Shaver is dual-voltage 110/220&lt;br /&gt;6. Power cord fits other Norelco products, like the Bodygroom 7100, so you can have less cords in your bathroom if plugs are limited.&lt;br /&gt;7. Razor tells you when to clean it.  It seems like mine just says to clean it after it has been used for so many seconds. Nice feature, even if it is unnecessary for me, since I rise it after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;1. The ABSOLUTE WORST thing about this razor is the HUGE empty space that is created in the middle of the heads by the spring-loaded heads popping back up!  Pick any other Norelco razor made in the last 30 years and you will see that the top of the razor is perfectly smooth, no gaping holes at all, and the razor heads all sit flush to the head-unit.  Here&#x27;s why this is a problem.  When you are shaving, the heads get pushed down and then pop back up when there&#x27;s no pressure on them, so they&#x27;re constantly moving back and forth during the whole shave.  When you go around places like your chin, it&#x27;s EASY for the razor heads to get caught up on the hard angles of your face, and so you have to go back a little and change the angle of the motion to get the head to get pushed down.  Where this is absolutely infuriating is when you are shaving just under your nose.  When you are shaving under the nose, the two top heads get pushed down, but the bottom head stays popped up, which means the edge of that head goes inside your mouth, and runs along the inside of your upper lip, which is just distguisting.  That edge is actually quite sharp and it&#x27;s a VERY uncomfortable feeling.  If you were shaving fast, it seems like it could cut the inside of your lip.&lt;br /&gt;2. The charging/cleaning stand is not just big, it&#x27;s enormous.  Hopefully you have room on your counter for it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Refill cartridges are expensive.  I think that you could probably find a recipe online for refilling the cleaning solution if you look hard enough.  Perhaps even get some of that blue liquid from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply that barbers soak thier combs in and such.  Still, razors can get pretty gross over time if not cleaned, so it&#x27;s not bad that you can clean it this way, but it&#x27;s like havinga monthly subscription for your razor.  Also, it&#x27;s easy to clean the razor in the shower with just water by popping off the head, however, it feels like cheap plastic, and it seems like it&#x27;d be easy to snap a piece of plastic in doing that, which would ruin the head-unit. (Tip: Shaving with a natural shaving oil will help keep the razor less gunky and easier to clean, while avoiding shaving creams loaded with chemicals.)&lt;br /&gt;4. No removable lanyard to hang the razor in the shower (this used to be a standard thing)&lt;br /&gt;5. Razor feels cheap, not like other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned in the past&lt;br /&gt;6. Razor will not work while plugged in, you must disconnect the cord for it to run.  This might be a safety issue since it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; razor, so maybe it&#x27;s not a good or bad thing, it just is. Never-the-less, if you&#x27;re in a hurry, this could be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;7. The distance between the outside edge of the cutters and the outside edge of the head unit is quite large, even if it is curved.  This makes it difficult to get those hairs that are right up under the nose.  Look at a razor like this [[ASIN:B000UK163K Philips Norelco 8020X]] and you will see that that same distance on this razor is very small, which makes getting those hairs in hard to reach spots MUCH easier.&lt;br /&gt;8. Not enough rubber on it for my liking being that it&#x27;s a wet shaver.  Overall, it feels large and the heads are spaced out a bit further than on some other models, which means you need to shave with a slightly larger circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, just ask in the comments and I&#x27;ll try and respond promptly.by popping off the head, however, it feels like cheap plastic, and it seems like it&#x27;d be easy to snap a piece of plastic in doing that, which would ruin the head-unit.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a month and have never had a closer shave. I usually use dry but will occasionally use in the shower with water. Either way, it works great, especially on my neck where the hair is hard to trim. However, the beard trimmer is a separate attachment which is a hassle. And the base that functions as a cleaner is more trouble than its worth when you can just wash in the sink.</li>
            <li> Do you need an incredibly close, complete shave in your life fellas? Well the Philips Norelco Series 7000 Shaver 7300 is the perfect answer! Though it’s a pricey, the investment for this wireless rechargeable shaver is well worth it all said and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting with the packaging, what comes with this shaver? Well, there’s the Smart clean system, which serves as both the charging unit and also a means of cleaning – though not disinfecting – the wireless shaver.  On the system, there is a lit up display featuring indicators for power, cleaning, cleaning cartridge replacement, ready, and charging.  A cap locks in the Norelco shaver when cleaning or charging. Besides the cleaning system itself, a cleaning cartridge is provided, which is inserted in the bottom of the smart clean system. Detailed enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on then comes the shaver, the main attraction.  The shaver itself features numerous indicators, notably the battery display (full and low).  The power button is in plain sight as it should be, right beneath the shaver’s model name.  The Norelco 7300 comes with a shaving unit featuring a “hair chamber’ which captures the hair and three comfort rings.  This particular shaving configuration was best for close shaves upon testing the unit.  The other configuration is with the SmartClick Trimmer, which the manual prescribes for grooming sideburns and mustache.  Philips gets that right, as personally the SmartClick Trimmer was used to “shape” and “groom” hair, which the comfort rings, could never hope to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how was the shaving experience beyond the aforementioned? – Easy as 1-2-3.  The hairier you are, the longer it takes to get the desired effects, but both the advertised shaving configuration and the trimmer accomplish the tasks without a hitch.  Once charging the shaver, it’s good for about an hour.  My first shave was about that long (let’s say the facial hair was saved up), so it’s possible depending on the intensity of the shave you may only get one good shave out of it before needing to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the shaving experience being easy, What about the cleanup and repackaging experience? The usual bummer of cleaning up a mess is involved, even with this product.  That’s not a rub though – it just goes with the shaving experience.  If one wishes to repack the product in the box, it’s easy to do IF you are careful to watch how you unpacked it.  But if you didn’t, it may take a few tries to get the parts back in correctly.  As far as cleaning the shaver, the comfort rings/hair chamber is detachable and washable which is a pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most helpful part of the Norelco experience is the manual, which covers pretty much every scenario you can think of.  This makes this product that much more effective because it has been written with the upmost customer service in mind.  But then again, with a product as fancy and expensive as this shaver, it should have a good manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is sound through and through.  Calling it “the second coming” of shaving might be a bit much, but personally, it’s the best shaver I’ve had in my possession.  And when you’re naturally hair as I tend to be but don’t prefer lots of facial hair, well, you need one awesome shaver (wet or dry like this one) that can get the job done. Highly recommended!the intensity of the shave you may only get one good shave out of it before needing to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the shaving experience being easy, What about the cleanup and repackaging experience?

Calling it “the second coming” of shaving might be a bit much, but personally, it’s the best shaver I’ve had in my possession.  And when you’re naturally hair as I tend to be but don’t prefer lots of facial hair, well, you need one awesome shaver (wet or dry like this one) that can get the job done. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> have only used 3 times</li>
            <li> Works well.  No adjustment for depth (that I have found).  You do have to pull off the triple blade and put on the trimmer (I use mine for my neck/sideburns, but I guess it works for beards too).  Charger stand allows for a good cleaning.  I clean it every time it needs a charge (about 30-50 uses, I think).  I don&#x27;t take the stand when traveling, but I do take the charger and plug in to the razor directly.</li>
            <li> Not happy so far&lt;br /&gt;Will continue for couple more weeks&lt;br /&gt;Razor pinches and does not clean the neck thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;No indicator for battery charge&lt;br /&gt;Thinking of return to my old Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Is there a higher rated Norelco razor ?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver for years and shave once every 2-3 days.  My current shaver has served me well (or so I thought), over the years.  However, there are some spots that would require at least 5-10 passes to track down some elusive hair that somehow seem to dodge blades -- and in the process causes some skin irritation.  This Norelco Shaver 7300 is a welcome change and has seemed to do a better job of trimming those hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the purpose of this review, I put off shaving for about two weeks.  After charging the shaver up, I began by first using the trimmer (requires removing the shaver head, and putting on the trimmer attachment) to whack through the growth -- the trimmer seemed to work pretty well.  After the hairs were of shorter length, I went through with the shaver.  After a few passes, my mini-beard/mustache was gone, and my skin was smooth again.  There was some minor skin irritation on the first shave, but it did deliver a clean shave.  The 2nd and 3rd shaves seemed to deliver similarly good results with less skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;### PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively close shave.  Minimal skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;- Quiet&lt;br /&gt;- SmartClean base system charges and cleans the shaver.  Utilizing the included SmartClean cartridge, it&#x27;ll clean the hair out from the head, preventing it from clogging.  It also keeps the head lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;- Can also be cleaned manually with water, though they advertise that the SmartClean system will clean it better.&lt;br /&gt;- Travel Lock -- On my old shaver, I&#x27;ve encountered times where my shaver would turn on while in luggage.  This shaver has a lock that prevents it from inadvertently turning on.&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; and Battery indicator&lt;br /&gt;- Charges full in less than an hour&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer works well&lt;br /&gt;- Includes travel carrying pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;### CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive consumables cost.  At the time of this review, the replaceable shaver head costs nearly $50 (to be replaced about once a year).  The SmartClean cartridge should cost about $12/each.&lt;br /&gt;- LARGE charging base.  Though the base seems to work well in my limited use, it is large.  With limited bathroom counter space, this is proving a bit problematic.&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer is a separate attachment.&lt;br /&gt;- Battery indicator only shows that its low.  No percentage indicator.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco Shaver 7300 for Sensitive Skin&lt;br /&gt;+Above average shave for an electric&lt;br /&gt;+ no irritation&lt;br /&gt;+ came with carry case for razor&lt;br /&gt;- A bit awkward at first, takes some getting used to&lt;br /&gt;- Charging stand very big - takes a lot of counter space&lt;br /&gt;- the pivot point from handles to blades could be a weak point ( no issues 1st month)&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer a blade to an electric but for fast and easy this is worth a try</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco  Series 7000 shaver is somewhat typical of other battery powered shavers. It can handle a good number of shaves on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses (for me, at least):&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s slim and easy to hold and maneuver with its flexible head. It&#x27;s nice that this particular model can also be used in the shower also and comes with a large stand that contains a cleaning solution. The shaver can be place in the stand to recharge, and the heads are washed with the solution while in the stand, which is convenient (albeit possibly unnecessary). The trimmer is great, although it requires the shaver head to be pulled off and the trimmer popped on, unlike my older Norelco I was hoping this would replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Although it seems this wasn&#x27;t a problem for others, for me, I had a few issues with this model.  The openings in the head are pretty large in comparison to what I&#x27;m used to, making it easy to catch folds or wrinkles in the skin, although the lower rpm prevents it from causing damage. So if you don&#x27;t have young, tight skin (which I don&#x27;t), keep that in mind. Also, I&#x27;m not sure if the one I got was defective or not, but it had a much lower rpm than my lower-wattage Norelco, which strangely made it less powerful and also easier to catch. This also means it&#x27;s rather ineffective on a beard that&#x27;s more than a few millimeters, and it means the blades need to be sharp. If cost is an issue, understand the probable need to buy new heads each year (and cleaning solution every few months) depending on how heavy your beard is.  The stand is a bit bulky if counter space is also limited.  And like most rechargeables the shaver will not work while plugged in, either on the stand or directly with the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say that you should read all these reviews and decide whether this is the right model for your particular needs. Norelco makes great shavers, so I guess I&#x27;m going to just appreciate that my ancient one is still working better for me than this new one.an this new one.</li>
            <li> My Dad was the test subject for this shaver, since he&#x27;s always been an electric razor user.  He even received special dispensation to use one in the army in the 1950&#x27;s, when they were against regulation.  Over the years, he&#x27;s tried every brand from high end Remingtons and Norelcos, to no name brands found for under $30 in mail order catalogues - so he had a lot to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although he may be easy to please, he told me that since he knew the price going in, he was expecting superior performance so I&#x27;m very pleased to report that he loved everything about this shaver.  He told me that without having to push down too hard he was able to get a nice close shave.  The heads followed the contours of his face well and did not pinch his skin.  The recharge was quick and, unlike many of the cheapo models he&#x27;s lately been using, it was attractive sitting in its stand on the vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, he was reluctant to utilize the head cleaner, insisting that he normally cleaned his razors in the sink which worked just fine, but I urged him to try it once so I could get his reaction and, after that, he was sold.  He was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use and especially like the automatic timer feature so he knew when it was finished.  So for the lifetime of this shaver, he&#x27;ll no longer need to clean the heads under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a quality product that comes highly recommended by my Dad.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, high quality razor.  I have particularly sensitive skin, with rosacea and it is easily irritated. I have used multiple electric razors in the past with poor results.  Whether it was an old &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; 3 head Norelco, a Remington Microscreen, or a Braun.  All offer convenience and quality - but they also all tended to irritate the skin and not shave as close as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver provides a close, comfortable shave with no irritation and all the convenience that an electric is known for.  A good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a blade-man, but since using this shaver, haven&#x27;t even thought about going back to the blade. So easy to use and recommend using Lectric Shave to help prep the beard too. No nicks, no cuts. The cleaning/charger base is a nice addition so don&#x27;t have to worry how I&#x27;m going to clean it for the next morning and always ready and charged.</li>
            <li> July 11, 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this shaver both with and without a soap or gel or cream on my face, both in and out of the shower, and both on Earth and on the International Space Station, I have reached several conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, travelling with this product and all its parts is a pain.  There are several parts and altogether they take up a lot of volume, not to mention mass, which makes a difference on the ISS.  The base unit that charges and cleans the shaver has almost as big a footprint as your garden-variety hydropentameter air tester, which is more than you might have expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parts do fit into a hard case, and the product does qualify for Prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the trimmer that you use for straightening and shortening and parallelifying your various sideburns is a separate part.  You must remove the shaving head and replace it with the trimmer head.  The obvious problem on a vessel with no gravity is that that extra part is perfectly happy to wander off the table and roam about the whole vehicle, which we always don&#x27;t want because such loose objects floating around unincarcerated is that we bump into them or they bump into us, which we always dislike.  I&#x27;m almost 100% sure now that the Philips people did not very much intend to design this product, the Philips Norelco Shaver 7300 for Sensitive Skin, S7370/87, Frustration Free Packaging, for use on the ISS at all, which is why I subtract only half a star from five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I do subtract another half a star for how big the whole apparatus is even on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I subtract a whole &#x27;nother star because I didn&#x27;t care for the uncloseness of the shave and the unexpectedly large number of times I had to go over certain areas compared to my standard shaver, which made those areas more irritable and redder and rasher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver under review is perfectly suited to being a leg leveler if you&#x27;ve got a leg that exactly 2.3 inches short, which is extremely unlikely and which also equals just a skosh less than two and nineteen sixty-fourths.  If you shoot it with a .22 short round from ten paces it won&#x27;t work exactly right.  If you shoot it with a .50 caliber Barrett rifle from that same distance, it will basically disappear.  It is just simply awful at shaving seals for surgery.  You know, where you need to operate on a baby seal in an emergency and you want to antiseptically prep the area of the incision by removing the hair first.  I don&#x27;t subtract any stars for these deficiencies, I just thot you&#x27;d want to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five minus two halves minus 1 whole is three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***leg that exactly 2.3 inches short, which is extremely unlikely and which also equals just a skosh less than two and nineteen sixty-fourths.

            <li> I am using this razor as the replacement for my Philips Norelco Snso-Touch which is quite honestly the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  After a few years it dulled a bit and needed to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7300 is a great razor for those with sensitive skin like me.  I get hardly any razor burn and yet the shave is very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I resisted giving it 5 stars for one reason - the beard/mustache trimmer attachment seems to take forever to work over patches of hair.  Luckily I have a Wahl beard trimmer that works great so I just use that instead.</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco shaver looks cooler than most shavers on the market.  When you read about the extra features and cool things that is says that it can do, you might be convinced that this shaver is worth the extra cost.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  Like many products that have a lot of extra features it fails to master the main purpose.  It does an okay job of shaving if you have a lot of time and don&#x27;t mind going over the same areas a lot.  That was surprising to me because it is made for sensitive skin, so you would think that would be counter productive.  I&#x27;m not even going to get into the size and awkwardness, just be forewarned that you must have a lot of counter space or don&#x27;t even consider this shaver.  It probably would have been much cheaper and a better value without the base extras.  The replacement blades are quite expensive, but hopefully the price will drop on those.  This probably will not be a cost that a lot of people will factor in, but it should be considered before purchasing any product that requires them.  The frustration free packaging lives up to its name.  I get sick of using a knife to open everything that I buy.  Also the box is recyclable cardboard.  Despite all of the extras, the shaving performance was not good enough for me to recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The best electric razor my husband has ever had.</li>
            <li> The Norelco Shaver 7300 for Sensitive skin did an above average job on my facial hair.  I got a pretty smooth shave, without pulling or skin irritation. I used my razor with shaving cream, which is optional.  The razor fits nicely in the hand, is quiet, and lightweight.  The carrying case is great for travel.  The only downside is the trimming attachment being a separate component and not actually attached to the razor.  Just a little inconvenience. The Smart Clean System is a unique feature to keep the blades clean.  Overall a quality razor that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This thing is huge. It takes up about five of square inches of counter space and because of the liquid in the base, you can&#x27;t just throw it in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband thought it shaved a little nicer then a disposable razor but not nearly as nice as his preferred straight razor way. The liquid soap that is included also didn&#x27;t appeal to him and reminded him of an older man then what he likes as a 30-something guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on the whole, this was nice but not as good as just using a straight razor and takes up a bit of space.</li>
            <li> I know beards are kind of fashionable nowadays, but I&#x27;ve never been able to go more than a day or two without shaving before it starts to drive me crazy.  (Actually, I&#x27;ve gone a whole week while backpacking, but I&#x27;m sure you can guess what the first order of business was when I got out of the back country.)  I&#x27;m a big fan of Norelco shavers, having previously used the Arcitec.  As Norelco says in the manual, it takes a little while for your face to adjust to a new shaver, and it took me about a week before this one stopped feeling like it was pulling at the hairs.  This one can be used wet or dry, but I preferred using it dry as I was accustomed.  One plus for this one over the Arcitec is that the trimmer is a separate attachment which works much better.  The downside of it being separate, of course, is the fear that I&#x27;ll lose it in the drawer.  I also like the angle of the heads on the Arcitec over this one - slightly cup shaped instead of bulged outward from the center, but both flex and once my face got used to it, it wasn&#x27;t really an issue anymore.  Cleaning the heads is very easy - the whole top pops off and can be rinsed easily.  The top can even be disassembled for better cleaning - another plus over the Arcitec, where I was constantly getting tiny bits of fuzz from the towel clogging up the little rotary blades.  For even better but less frequent cleaning there is the base.  This comes with a solution to put in, but I found just rinsing it keeps it clean enough for the most part, and using the base is something that doesn&#x27;t need to be done as often.  This is fortunate because the base is huge, and even my 13 year old daughter didn&#x27;t like seeing it on the bathroom counter.  Also note that the base is not required for charging - the cord can be plugged straight into the shaver.  (A small &amp;#34;travel/storage case&amp;#34; also comes with it, which is very nice.)  My overall assessment is that this is a comfortable shaver that does a really good job for me.</li>
            <li> working perfectly so far.</li>
            <li> This Norelco Shaver is a nice little unit that offers a good shave. The rotary blades do move smoothly over the skin. I do my electric shaving dry and this razor appears to get all the places it should. However, there are some parts of my face and neck that need going over a few times to get everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed with this rotary shaver. At the end of the day, after using it, I move my hand over areas of my face I’d shaved in the morning and I feel gristle there. I don’t notice such things, or not as much, with a non-rotary electric shaver, or indeed with a non-electric hand razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery provides a good long life to this unit. For my usage, it only appears to need charging about once a week, which compares well with other electric shavers I’ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried out the beard trimmer and it works fine; but I have to admit I like the models better where the trimmer is attached and doesn’t need to be installed by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, all in all I’d say this is a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s not able to use a razor any longer due to skin sensitivities, so he&#x27;s been looking around for a good shaver. He&#x27;s been disappointed more often than not by the different shavers available out there. However, that all changed when he got his hands on this Philips Norelco Shaver 7300 for Sensitive Skin. He just loves it! He says it&#x27;s the best electric shaver he&#x27;s ever used. It&#x27;s extremely quiet, and it gives a very close shave. Not as close as a razor blade, but close enough. He highly recommends this shaver to everyone, with or without sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I opted to get this razor for my boyfriend who uses a 4-5 blade standard razor every AM.  He said prior electrics didn’t work well for him, but this one being top of the line was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING:&lt;br /&gt;First of all I was surprised when this razor came.  It was frustration free packaging and I wasn’t quite sure what that was.  It meant there was no extra retail box inside the packing one.  Less waste.  That is a good thing.  There is a base, the razor and the triple head as well as a separate head for trims and a carry case for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE:&lt;br /&gt;While the razor was a fairly common size, it was housed in a base that takes up considerable counter space about 5 x 5 inches and about 10 inches tall. If your counter space in the bathroom is as precious as ours, this is too big.  I’m sure you can plug it in elsewhere or only occasionally as I don’t think daily (or maybe even weekly) charging is necessary, but that’s a lot of bother. This base provides charging and cleaning.  A few times, I think it went through a cleaning cycle in the middle of the night which was a bit weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY OF SHAVE:&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is what it’s all about isn’t it?  It did not meet my boyfriend’s expectations. He was hoping for an ease of shave, which he did not find.  He tried it dry and with electric shave lotion.  Still he felt there was too much drag on his face.  He was looking for a closeness of shave, if not as close as a blade, at least a reasonable substitute.  However he remained disappointed.  To be fair, he used the blade about 3 weeks before returning to his normal method of shaving using a 4 or 5 blade standard razor.  He did not feel this was a reasonable substitute in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;How does this compare to other electrics, we can&#x27;t answer, so please take that in account.  That&#x27;s why we gave it a 3 and not a 2.</li>
