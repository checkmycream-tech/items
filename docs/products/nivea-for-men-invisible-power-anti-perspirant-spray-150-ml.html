            <li>Very impressed.</li>
            <li>everything perfect</li>
            <li>A very good and efficient product.</li>
            <li>Very Good.</li>
            <li>Smells really good and it lasts too!</li>
            <li>Good, I think Nivea is the best brand.</li>
            <li>, I gotta say it doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue wich is great</li>
            <li>Always a great product.</li>
            <li>I am so happy now using this.</li>
            <li>bummed because it seems good for your clothing and body.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Wish we had this kind of products available in the US !!</li>
            <li>I was really liked this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>but the fragance is just not my favorite</li>
            <li>We both love it</li>
            <li>i also love the smell and makes me want to hug him and smell it all the time.</li>
            <li>and I feel confident all day.</li>
            <li>Otherwise.. I love it and keeps my clothes clean!</li>
            <li>Spray on a lot and let dry without a shirt, or wear a sleeveless for 15 min for best results.</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure there are better options out there.</li>
            <li>and it works pretty fine</li>
            <li>It keeps it dry for the whole day, plus it smells good that I feel confident around others.</li>
            <li>Smells good and the cans last for a good month and half plus.</li>
            <li>Just like what I experienced before that with my old deodorant, the armpit part turns yellow as time goes by even after washing my shirts.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh scent</li>
            <li>but it has ruined many of my favorites t shirts with yellow stains</li>
            <li>I guess this deodorant isn&#x27;t aimed for people who sweat a lot nor people living in hot places</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d definitely not recommend it for there are better options out there.</li>
            <li>Definitely keeps clothes stain free, and protects adequately.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t protect anywhere near the &amp;#34;48 hours&amp;#34; it says it does, in fact it doesn&#x27;t even protect full 24 hours.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really dissapointed, as I said before it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave stains on clothes</li>
            <li>It really is invisible.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t say it last 48 hours, if you&#x27;re a very sweaty guy like I am then you might want to try something else.</li>
            <li>Works very well and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Last but not least it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave residues that could stain my clothes like degree</li>

            <li> I wish it really lasted 48 hours, but I workout everyday and stay outside for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t leave any white stain on my colored shirts as other brands do especially when you wear shirts that it leaves those lines at the sides.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been using it for that long</li>
            <li> In the other hand it kinda last around a day</li>
            <li> It is invisible , but doesn&#x27;t keep me dry as they said</li>
            <li> Not like with the other brand</li>
            <li> I put on after shower and can then put on a black shirt and nothing transfers onto the black shirt.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a spray deodorant that doesnt leave a white residue.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll update this review in a few days</li>
            <li> like I do (I live in a place with a temp around 85 - 95 degrees farenheit) and if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough the fragance is just not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this one sucks</li>
            <li> You feel wet and smells bad.</li>
            <li> this stuff was not effective on me :(</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> i tried this stuff to save my shirts. im not a big sweater, but like any human, need antiperspirant. this stuff was not effective on me :( bummed because it seems good for your clothing and body.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I didn&#x27;t find it in my country.  A very good and efficient product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna start saying that I&#x27;ve been a fan of nivea products since always; I&#x27;ve been using degree stick deodorant and it works pretty fine but it has ruined many of my favorites t shirts with yellow stains so I was looking for a &amp;#34;stain free&amp;#34; deodorant and then I found this one, I gotta say it doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue wich is great but the fragance is just not my favorite, i don&#x27;t like it a bit. In the other hand it kinda last around a day but I wouldn&#x27;t say it last 48 hours, if you&#x27;re a very sweaty guy like I am then you might want to try something else. I&#x27;m not saying this one sucks but I&#x27;m pretty sure there are better options out there. Last but not least it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave residues that could stain my clothes like degree did but I haven&#x27;t been using it for that long so I&#x27;ll update this review in a few days and I&#x27;ll let you know if this actually stains clothes or not.  UPDATE:  So it&#x27;s been around a week since I&#x27;ve been using it and I&#x27;m really dissapointed, as I said before it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave stains on clothes but it doesn&#x27;t protect anywhere near the &amp;#34;48 hours&amp;#34; it says it does, in fact it doesn&#x27;t even protect full 24 hours. I guess this deodorant isn&#x27;t aimed for people who sweat a lot nor people living in hot places like I do (I live in a place with a temp around 85 - 95 degrees farenheit) and if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough the fragance is just not good. So I&#x27;d definitely not recommend it for there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> Always a great product.</li>
            <li> I was really liked this product. It&#x27;s for men and it smells just perfect! I wish it really lasted 48 hours, but I workout everyday and stay outside for long periods of time. Otherwise.. I love it and keeps my clothes clean! Wish we had this kind of products available in the US !!</li>
            <li> My hubby found it in Mexico while on a job assignment and could not find it home (in Canada. ) Neither could I in the States, but I found it on Amazon.  We both love it (I use it too!)</li>
            <li> While I have been using it, I feel the dryness in my underarms. It keeps it dry for the whole day, plus it smells good that I feel confident around others. Not like with the other brand I used that it won&#x27;t last in the afternoon. You feel wet and smells bad. It won&#x27;t leave any white stain on my colored shirts as other brands do especially when you wear shirts that it leaves those lines at the sides. I don&#x27;t see anymore yellow stains on my white shirts. Just like what I experienced before that with my old deodorant, the armpit part turns yellow as time goes by even after washing my shirts. I am so happy now using this.I would highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Very Good. European quality!</li>
            <li> Good, I think Nivea is the best brand.</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT! I Recommend it to all :D</li>
            <li> The best deodorant I have ever used. It is very hard to find a spray deodorant that doesnt leave a white residue. It really is invisible. I put on after shower and can then put on a black shirt and nothing transfers onto the black shirt.</li>
            <li> I got it for my boyfriend and he loves it! i also love the smell and makes me want to hug him and smell it all the time. Smells really good and it lasts too!</li>
            <li> I like the fresh scent and it last all day. Good product.</li>
            <li> My husband lives these for travel.</li>
            <li> Clean and refreshing fragrance. Definitely keeps clothes stain free, and protects adequately. I&#x27;d spray it and wait for a minute or so for it to settle. You will notice powder coating which provides antiperspirant protection.</li>
            <li> Works very well and lasts for a long time. Smells good and the cans last for a good month and half plus.</li>
            <li> I sweat all the time, no matter what temp, season, I could be in Antarctica and pit through a shirt. I was about to resort to a sweat gland reduction procedure called Miradry until I found this deodorant in Germany. It has literally changed my life. I don&#x27;t ruin shirts anymore and I feel confident all day. Spray on a lot and let dry without a shirt, or wear a sleeveless for 15 min for best results. If they discontinue this deodorant I will cry. Not even prescription deodorants worked for me.</li>
            <li> Used degree before this . This works well. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> everything perfect I stay well, recommended seller 100%</li>
            <li> It is invisible , but doesn&#x27;t keep me dry as they said</li>
