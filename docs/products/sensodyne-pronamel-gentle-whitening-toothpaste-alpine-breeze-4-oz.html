            <li>great product - good price</li>
            <li>I love Sensodyne Pronamel, this is the best product</li>
            <li>Has helped my sensitivity and has a pleasant flavor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not something that you gag from, but it&#x27;s also not something that I would consider pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It does what it is supposed to do, and has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>All flavors of Sensodyne Pronamel are pleasant tasting.  </li>
            <li>Good flavor.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my teeth and gums, and I also use it on my tongue.</li>
            <li>I did not look closely to see that it comes in three good flavors and not just that goop flavor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I think this may be the best toothpaste available.</li>
            <li>so the price is good.</li>
            <li>This product works just as well as any Sensodyne toothpaste, which is to say it does a good job of reducing sensitivity.    </li>
            <li>The flavor is fairly neutral.</li>
            <li>, good deal in 3-pack.</li>
            <li>The taste is good and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>It also does a good job of maintaining whiteness.  </li>
            <li>Good for my teeth.</li>
            <li>It has a nice taste and keeps my dentist happy,</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good product</li>
            <li>good stuff, sensitivity to heat</li>
            <li>this toothpaste is really good.</li>
            <li>not so good as it was described!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think its a good deal to buy 3 at a time.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Good flavor, seems to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>Good breath?</li>
            <li>That my dentist recommends it, without having samples and a sales rep touting how good it is?</li>
            <li>It helps with sensitivity and tastes good.</li>
            <li>Loved it and met all my expectations</li>
            <li>Good for brushing before you go to bed.</li>
            <li>Good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but this was a good deal on three.</li>
            <li>though that a mainstream product would be this good?</li>
            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>This is good toothpaste and no sodium laural sulfate in it.  </li>
            <li>it is a good product.</li>
            <li>But feels good because of the taste.</li>
            <li>tates good, hope it works</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good deal from Amazon though.</li>
            <li>This is also a good tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and I got it for a good price.</li>
            <li>I have been using for 3+ years and my teeth never looked or felt so good.</li>
            <li>the price was good.  </li>
            <li>Good paste though would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>tooth paste is good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>I find it cleans well and tastes quite good.</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>Also, it is an awesome thing to be able to purchase it on a subscription so that I get it in advance of when I need it and never have to worry about forgetting it when I go to the store :)</li>
            <li>Tastes good, does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate, and protects teeth &#x3D; winning combination!</li>
            <li>im more of a colgate guy but the sensodyne has great mouth feel</li>
            <li>Shopping is very enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Great product, that&#x27;s why I have it on subscribe &amp; save :)</li>
            <li>but all in all very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and I will continue using this brand which, in my opinion, is head and shoulders over the others.</li>
            <li>Great ebayer:-)</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>very pleased</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to put more on my toothbrush than the crest we used to use, but regardless, I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste have used for years, now on auto delivery, love it.</li>
            <li>Good taste and effective leaning.  </li>
            <li>Works great for sensitivity and tastes pretty good!</li>
            <li>This paste is just as effective, tastes great and leaves me confident with its results.</li>
            <li>Love this brand!</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Love  this product!</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant and i like the stand up top.  </li>
            <li>It tastes great, it helps with my sensitivity and it also whitens (fairly quickly, at that!).</li>
            <li>Tastes fine, works great and my teeth are not aching.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>Nice toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it on Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li>I used to use Sensodyne and find this equally effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pricing with Subscribe and Save savings is a nice added bonus.</li>
            <li>Honestly don&#x27;t see or feel and difference.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it works</li>
            <li>Really handy if you have a receding gum line.</li>
            <li>and I really researched toothpaste, trying to find the best product to reduce teeth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not altogether thrilled about it&#x27;s whitening ability.</li>
            <li>Kind of a hassle.</li>
            <li>Was recommended to me by my hygienist, and it honestly does as it promises.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it rinses easily, so it is easy to keep an electric tooth brush clean.  </li>
            <li>My front teeth used to be kind of brittle (and I grind my teeth in my sleep sometimes), but I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and haven&#x27;t had any chips.</li>
            <li>Of course, I am not a scientist - just reporting on my own results.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; to it when you use it&lt;</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled about the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was a kind of toothpaste from my country that helped me a lot, but Sensodyne isn&#x27;t even close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased another kind of Sensodyne toothpaste after I&#x27;ve used up what I bought this time, and hopefully it will work well.</li>
            <li>This is a gentler, but still effective way to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>SO she gave me this and honestly</li>
            <li>This never irritates my teeth, and does a great job keeping them feeling clean throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste is pleasantly minty without being too strong.</li>
            <li>If you do not want a strong mint toothpaste, this is a good option.</li>
            <li>Tastes good keeps the teeth safe, and whiteness is better.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for my sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>For years I was making my own tooth powder, because I found most toothpastes made the inside of my mouth peel</li>
            <li>Sensodyne is the best sensitive tooth paste i have tried and i have tried a bunch.</li>
            <li>Mine were in good shape no damage, but its a cheap way of sending it.</li>
            <li>Best for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Its really a good price with free shipping using Prime.</li>
            <li>Best sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, this is the best.</li>
            <li>No scrubbies in it, very smooth texture.</li>
            <li>, my teeth don&#x27;t get sensitive at all , amazing!!</li>
            <li>Very good for cleaning sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll eventually get use to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M GETTING SO MANY COMPLIMENTS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to many toothpastes.</li>
            <li>My dentist back home is impressed with my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is our go-to toothpaste -- good for sensitive teeth, good for enamel etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 6+ months, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see myself using this for more than the 3-pack</li>
            <li>I used so many brands of toothpaste to help me with the sensivety of my teeth, nothing work.</li>
            <li>&quot; is the latest in dentifrice marketing.  </li>
            <li>Save yourself some money and get the regular Sensodyne toothpaste - it works great!</li>
            <li>What more could we ask for?</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be enjoying ice cream once more. :)</li>
            <li>I regret that I now have 3 more tubes of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit more costly</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Glad I listened to the recommendations of my dentist</li>
            <li>It really works great</li>
            <li>Love sensodyne pronamel.</li>
            <li>As always with Amazon. :)</li>
            <li>My wife love&#x27;s this product and the price for buying in bulk</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been enjoying this latest iteration of Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li>I have used many brands and types.</li>
            <li>I love it as well.</li>
            <li>I totally love it.</li>
            <li>Im glad to come home and use the pronamel.</li>
            <li>I began having nerve pain most of the time just with the two teeth then a customer that is a dentist suggested I try Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>All of us are getting better checkups.</li>
            <li>or if we are developing better habits.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I love Sensodyne</li>
            <li>Love the bulk pricing.</li>
            <li>i love brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste, but wish there was a tad more whitening in it.</li>
            <li>/cold much better after using this product.</li>
            <li>I still could not eat many acidic foods while using this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started eating whole milk products, cheeses, eggs, and nuts more liberally and greatly reduced my sugar intake.  </li>
            <li>If it strengthens my enamel, even better, as I&#x27;m a grinder.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I love to eat acidic foods which soften the enamel.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this brand, and I love how cost efficient it is to get these on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love buying this product in bulk from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Ok, no sensitivity problems, but...  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My husband is allergic to sodium lauryl sulfate which is in most toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Love this product will purchase again.</li>
            <li>My family all love it as well.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size I purchased and thought I was getting more ounces for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>love to bulk order this</li>
            <li>but so is more toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Who needs a mouth-searingly refreshing blast of peppermint at night before bed.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>AND my teeth are healthier. :-)</li>
            <li>For some reason I love chewing on ice cubes and my teeth would sometimes hurt when doing that,</li>
            <li>How do I get more?</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste...</li>
            <li>Was told by dentist to use this to make feel better.</li>
            <li>Most of the Sensodynes seem to help with my teeth sensitivity</li>
            <li>This toothpaste glides on smoothly to my toothbrush and foams up nicely (I HAAAATE when my toothpaste does not &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; up...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better value to buy online than in the store.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>After many many many years of dental work</li>
            <li>Excellent, simple as that.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>I love pronamel- used for years.  </li>
            <li>I tried several and this was the best of all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You should try it :)</li>
            <li>Love the flavor of the Alpine Breeze.  </li>
            <li>and I worried that I would get more cavities.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>It gave me the results I was looking for; whiter teeth and healthy gums.</li>
            <li>Give it a try you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>Many toothpaste that i use will have always hurt teeth</li>
            <li>I love this tooth paste with no dye.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t use Crest any more.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love it for the product, not the price.  </li>
            <li>but you&#x27;re getting more cleaning power form my experience.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t refreshing</li>
            <li>and I love how it removed sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I like it the most of the Sensodyne toothpastes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It has a great taste and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice clean feeling without a lot of foam.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about these toothpastes is the top, it&#x27;s really easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean since started using pronamel.  </li>
            <li>Good product and does exactly what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li>This is very mild and not that refreshing.</li>
            <li>The Alpine Breeze flavor is nice and mild.</li>
            <li>The price is great and the toothpaste is slowly becoming my favorite, in my old age.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste for those of us who are sensitive!</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>In addition, the tube stores vertical leaving room for more important clutter.</li>
            <li>As I said, I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I&#x27;ve gotten more used to the taste, but it&#x27;s not one I particularly enjoy.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely great for not bothering sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it has helped my tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste works great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Sensodyne is a great product if you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works great for my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;this toothpaste is great for sensitive teeth, and it shows up at my door automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and have found that using Sensodyne brand paste seems to keep my teeth happy.  </li>
            <li>This works great on my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>great for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>great for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It tastes great and helps with toughen up our sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on your teeth, so if sensitivity is a problem, it&#x27;s a good choice.  </li>
            <li>ENOUGH HOW SUPER GREAT THIS WORKS!!  </li>
            <li>Very effective for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpast and purchasing it online is worth it with the price!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that has sensitive teeth, receding gums, or basically anyone that always wants to have the best teeth!</li>
            <li>Gentle is kind of what most of us want from Sensodyne, I imagine.</li>
            <li>I have Invisalign and go through toothpaste very quickly brushing 3-5 times a day after any food.  </li>
            <li>Easy stand up tube.</li>
            <li>and my teeth are clean of course :-)</li>
            <li>However, I cannot be more happy that I chose to spend that extra couple of dollars.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I tried this Alpine Breeze and it has a very mild</li>
            <li>Whitening strips are way too strong for me, too.</li>
            <li>Fairly strong flavor that I had to get used to...</li>
            <li>It is good quality and a decent price...</li>
            <li>strongly recommend non SLS toothpaste to anyone that gets cancer sores.</li>
            <li>Most toothpaste has too strong of mint flavor for my taste, I tried the Sensodyne Fresh Breath and it was better but still too strong.</li>
            <li>I really find it very useful and good.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice fresh breath and teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>thats when we found Sensodyne which he seems to tolerate fine and in addition has floride.</li>
            <li>A fine combination.  </li>
            <li>Started using the Sensodyne, and within a week, I had less sensitivity in my teeth, which was great!!!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is fine.</li>
            <li>It has mild whitening which is a plus!</li>
            <li>This one has a mild refreshing taste.</li>
            <li>challenge anyone with sensitivity to try dietary changes first before putting carcinogens into their mouth (which I never found to be very effective anyway, and they certainly did nothing to address the root cause of the problem).</li>
            <li>Great tasting, it is easy to get out of tube with no rolled up left over.</li>
            <li>We have noticed a huge difference since switching to this product.</li>
            <li>And, while this might seem like a huge problem, keep in mind that I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars despite the taste.  </li>
            <li>Each time I am given a goody package including a free sample of Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>Yes, I sound like an ad writer -</li>
            <li>This is a product I can genuinely recommend.</li>
            <li>Even my husband who thinks everything is a marketing gimmick started using this toothpaste because his cheap stuff ran out.  </li>
            <li>It was suggested to try Sensodyne as it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I received this product well packaged and in a fantastic time frame.  </li>
            <li>If your mouth gums, or tounge get irritated, or sores pop up it may be time to switch to an SLS free toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is sulfate free, which I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does this sound contradictory to you?</li>
            <li>Does this sound contradictory to you?</li>
            <li>Smooth teeth, comfortable mouth.  </li>
            <li>I have had a great deal of dental work in the last couple years: implants and caps, zoom whitening, and bone grafts.  </li>
            <li>light mint flavor.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li>I think the flavor is a bit strong and burny, but it keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>and though I&#x27;m sure it cleans my teeth, it doesn&#x27;t leave me with that &#x27;fresh mouth&#x27; feeling.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Good toothpaste for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Overall, we think it&#x27;s a nice tasting, effective product.</li>
            <li>While there have been many years in which I&#x27;ve had no cavities, my dental hygienist has mentioned in a real change for the better in regard to plaque.</li>
            <li>This is good toothpaste for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Very economical to purchase the 3-pack as a subscription (every 3 months or so) from Amazon if you need this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed anything major difference with the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as cheap as the original stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome and I highly recommend it for anyone with similar sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Any toothpaste with Fluoride is really all you need for good cavity protection so as long as the toothpaste has Fluoride, I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li>but I am pain free right now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it will be your favorite toothpaste in the entire world, but if you&#x27;re on the hunt for the best toothpaste in the entire world you owe it to yourself to try this one.</li>
            <li>Well with the unique Sensodyne tube, we no longer have squeeze wars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young(ish) but don&#x27;t have great genes when it comes to teeth, and had suffered off and on from tooth sensitivity as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my standard toothpaste, great to get multiple tube at this good price.</li>
            <li>Helps significantly reduce sensitivity.</li>
            <li>And, my teeth feel clean and appear whiter.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to clean my teeth just as well.</li>
            <li>But when I finished to tube, I decided to go back to my old toothpase, and guess what, within two days my pain and sensitivity was greatly reduced!</li>
            <li>Clean feeling?</li>
            <li>This toothpaste seems to whiten my teeth with repeated continuous use and it makes my mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>I like this toothpaste, gives me that clean feeling I want without an overpowering flavor.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t believe how much more comfortable my teeth feel since I started using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>the taste is not overpowering and my teeth feel clean after use.</li>
            <li>Feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant taste and texture and I haven&#x27;t needed to re-whiten my teeth since using it regularly- about 3 years.</li>
            <li>Well, to my pleasant surprise, Sensodyne definitely works.</li>
            <li>fast delivery  &amp; good Deal, Thanks</li>
            <li>After getting so many cavities filled (7 in one visit, 8 in another), my teeth were becoming extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>My first try of this toothpaste , it is good you can feel it ,if you are looking for new toothpaste try it</li>
            <li>works as advertised and tastes great, priced right and was give to me at my last dentist visit as a sample</li>
            <li>Therefore, I was reluctant to buy the real thing (I do not want to be that healthy).  </li>
            <li>Really like it &amp; will buy more.</li>
            <li>Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li>Sweet and 2.</li>
            <li>Always feel super clean after every use.</li>
            <li>kind she bought was even for &#x27;sensitive teeth&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK toothpaste, but it foams way too much and makes me gag every time.</li>
            <li>perhaps something sweet.  </li>
            <li>The Pronamel helps, and it tastes good enough.</li>
            <li>The taste is not bad.  </li>
            <li>No bad taste.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, but some may not like the taste.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price.</li>
            <li>Great product, just not the right flavor as I like a little bit more of a minty blast in the mornings.</li>
            <li>Mild flavor, kind to my sensitive teeth and no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>This may seem pricey, but your pain goes away and your teeth feel clean and fresh for 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>This product protects your teeth from acid erosion, tooth decay and makes your mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can have it delivered to Jordan for a better price than I would pay locally.</li>
            <li>This product is everything I need in a toothpaste:  Whitening, gentle, and good for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste has tremendously helped with the sensitivity of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I also make sure to get enough vitamins D, A, and K, and my teeth have never been in better shape.  </li>
            <li>Wish it did more whitening, but my sensitive teeth are pain free.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt super clean and my breath was fresh for hours.</li>
            <li>only reason I docked it one star is because this toothpaste really doesn&#x27;t taste great.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best by far for my sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>I am a 20 year old and I was not blessed with great teeth, I really have to work hard to keep them clean and feeling great.</li>
            <li>We have used Pronamel for several years now and very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised to realize that a product could actually be as good as a commercial claims, better even in this case.</li>
            <li>I love it because I feel it is not hard on teeth.</li>
            <li>Nice flavor, leaves mouth feeling clean, not gritty.</li>
            <li>better than any other tooth paste out there great for people with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Sensodyne has been my tooth paste for many years and this new product is recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I have recently experienced for myself the role of diet -- particularly the consumption of whole milk products -- in remineralizing porous, sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>The taste is pretty good, and it definitely helps with the sensitivity.</li>
            <li>i love limes and orange juice food that is pretty much acidic</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the taste but is easy on the gums</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes good and makes my mouth feel clean without feeling sandblasted as the other stuff did.</li>
            <li>This tastes more mild than the normal sensodyne and is more gentle on the mouth, stops the sensitivity and really helps my tender teeth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as bad as the older, non-Pronamel Sensodyne, so if you&#x27;ve only tried that, you may be pleasantly suprised, but if you&#x27;re used to \\&quot;normal\\&quot; (Crest, Colgate, even Tom&#x27;s) toothpaste, don&#x27;t expect to switch to Pronamel and not notice a difference.      </li>
            <li>ANd the container is pretty good for getting most of it out of the tube instead of having to leave a bunch inside and waste it</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>/&gt;no more sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>Let me first say that this product works!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to my crest toothpaste and live happily ever after.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Foams less than most name-brand tooth pastes, but still froths more than enough for comfortable and effective brushing</li>
            <li>As pleasant tasting and texture as any other product.</li>
            <li>For years I bought only Arm &amp; Hammer Peroxicare, since I liked its effectiveness and flavor and it caused no reaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happy with how this cleans, how it tastes (husband commented on fresh taste also), the way it freshens breath, and no sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smile.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Would recommend purchasing this product as it is well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with how the Pronamel is working and while my teeth don&#x27;t seem to be as white as it used to be when I was using Optic White, I believe it&#x27;s absolutely a fair trade off for not gagging every time I</li>
            <li>that it makes it wholly worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I prefer Glister Products ([[ASIN:B0017KHCB2 Glister Advanced Toothbrush]]) toothpaste &amp; brush for regular use and maintaining healthy teeth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li>It is a powerful irritant, and is a mouth culprit for pain, redness, and ulcers.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>as good as expected.</li>
            <li>Older Sensodyne varieties did not rinse so easily.  </li>
            <li>Safe for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>But with Subscribe &amp; Save, it&#x27;s definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is any better toothpaste if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Stuck with Colgate Sensitive which I find better for me.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my teeth would be more sensitive but all that went away over time.</li>
            <li>Of course, the medical issues were considerably more important than the cosmetic elements.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive teeth, I firmly believe that this is the best toothpaste for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take about 2 weeks or so to see and FEEL results, but it is so worth</li>
            <li>It also has a nice minty flavor which I prefer to the regular Synsodyne flavor.</li>
            <li>I like Colgate sensitive better.</li>
            <li>I think this works well, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the flavor.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any ways in which it seems to be more effective than any other Sensodyne toothpaste, in spite of obviously trying to appear more fancy.  </li>
            <li>So far very excited.</li>
            <li>package (i.e. the tube) is better than other tubes as it seems you can get most of the product out.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean very well and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and minty.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really notice a difference between this and the original Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li>Not just to brush but to apply some on my tooth right after brushing in night.</li>
            <li>And the price was right.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>if that is the right word for it).</li>
            <li>Sensodyne Pro does the job right.</li>
            <li>or I notice a particular sensitivity, but this tooth paste makes a HUGE difference in my life.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for at least 15 years and it resolved all sensitivity I once experienced, and if it&#x27;s true, the anti-acidity protection may be beneficial.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need as much as it recommends but my mouth doesn&#x27;t always feel as clean as when I use Crest for some reason.</li>
            <li>and she recommended moving away from Sensodyne because it&#x27;s too much of a creamy paste and doesn&#x27;t have a grit to aid in cleaning your teeth as many of the normal toothpastes have.</li>
            <li>I want no other :)  </li>
            <li>It helps to strengthen your teeth, and this new version even adds a gentle whitening agent to make your teeth look even better.</li>
            <li>And over time we have noticed our teeth have become whiter without becoming sensitive.</li>
            <li>Update, Jan 2015:  They got rid of the goofy top, and are back to a sensible old design.  </li>
            <li>have mentioned the strange taste, and I honestly have no problem with the taste whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve noticed any great whitening or enamel effects over the toothpastes I&#x27;ve used previously, but my teeth certainly don&#x27;t bother me as much from brushing!</li>
            <li>Actually, Aquafresh Extreme Clean is very good, does not irritate the inside of the mouth, very gentle, and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>For some reason when my husband uses my toothpaste, he suddenly remembers to put the cap back on, lol...</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth gently and effectively, and I&#x27;m definitely starting to see some whitening effects.</li>
            <li>If they fixed that it would be an easy 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>Slight whitening effect - good for maintenance.</li>
            <li>Good product but just slightly overpriced.</li>
            <li>The material inside is more gooey than other Sysodyne products that I&#x27;ve used, but it tastes and cleans fine.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my teeth and my gums.  </li>
            <li>It also is very gentle.  </li>
            <li>Almost forgot to mention that this toothpaste is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t give me that burning sensation on my tongue or gums like colgate and crest does.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>very gentle on gums</li>
            <li>Everything is good - the smell, the taste, it fixes sensitivity, but again, does not clean.</li>
            <li>After years of chewing on ice, which makes hairline cracks in your teeth, being pregnant 4 times and vomiting throughout each pregnancy, I have super sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to clean very well, maybe because of the gentle whitening part.</li>
            <li>The price is a little steep, but it&#x27;s some pretty good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t identified your favorite toothpaste in the entire world, then you should try this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I work in Afghanistan and am able to see a dentist occasionally.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth that have been a primary aesthetic asset for 55 years.  </li>
            <li>In fact, since I&#x27;ve been using it (almost done with first tube)</li>
            <li>no one wants to be bothered!  </li>
            <li>I used this toothpaste for about a month first and it helped a lot with the sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>Even after you put the top back on, toothpaste continues to seep out of the nozzle and accumulate on the inside of the cap.  </li>
            <li>I first used this while traveling.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>The next time will buy more.</li>
            <li>I used this consistently for about a month and my sensitivity virtually went away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different types of toothpaste over the years, but the one to consistently keep my teeth shining the brightest was always Pronamel.</li>
            <li>Compared to Sam&#x27;s club the price is higher.</li>
            <li>I also tried to reduce processed foods in general and replace them with more nutritious whole</li>
            <li>Please be aware before you purchase this item.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste works exactly as described and has reduced my sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I would try it in the store first and see if you like it.</li>
            <li>OK, the information on the box of this toothpaste states that it &amp;#34;strengthens and re-hardens enamel to help protect against the effects of acid erosion&amp;#34; from liquids such as soda and wine, and acidic foods like tomatoes.</li>
            <li>However, you most likely aren&#x27;t buying this product for this feature.</li>
            <li>and it works just as well as the first</li>
            <li>THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM SENSODYNE, BUT IT IS CHEAPER HERE THAN THE STORES,</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This product really was recommended by my dentist!  </li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>That said, I was a bit surprised at how smooth this paste feels.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied, but am just used to the grittier stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first discovered this from a dentist&#x27;s sample.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>No complaints ; )</li>
            <li>been ordering via amazon for yrs, one of my favorite toothpaste, the moment i get off sensodyne, my sensitivities will come back, that&#x27;s why this is on s&amp;s now!</li>
            <li>No weird taste or aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>About a year ago I became interested in whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li>So keep your teeth white and that enamel healthy with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I drink a lot of hot coffee and tea.  </li>
            <li>Sensodyne Pronamel, however, is the first I&#x27;ve found that did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that got me to this outcome.  </li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this toothpaste has a MUCH better flavor than the regular Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>But get much more quantity from Sam&#x27;s Club with same price</li>
            <li>That was my biggest gripe with the original, the flavor left my mouth lacking that clean feeling and taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had extremely sensitive teeth for many years now due to nighttime grinding, and I&#x27;ve tried many different toothpastes for reducing sensitivity including most of Sensodyne&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t to strong which is my opinion kind of sucks</li>
            <li>My teeth are now so sensitive I cant even drink tap water even with a straw without it hurting!!!!</li>
            <li>I like that the top of the cap is flat</li>
            <li>Ever since my dentist recommended this product, I never switched to any other kind.  </li>
            <li>No harsh flavors and keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>A tube (around 4-5 bucks at your local Target) can last me for a good two months.</li>
            <li>A tube (around 4-5 bucks at your local Target) can last me for a good two months.</li>
            <li>A GOOD TOOTH PASTE, EQUAL TO BOTH CREST AND COLGATE TOTAL</li>
            <li>+2 &#x3D; no clean and fresh feeling after brushing with this toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;Although this product might be good in dealing with sensitive teeth, I still would not recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in local drugstores, so I&#x27;m glad that Amazon will send it to my door at a good price.</li>
            <li>my enamel was pretty much gone so if you need help protecting your enamel get this paste</li>
            <li>This is the one toothpaste I can use long term which gives me the most resistance to sensitivity.</li>
            <li>It has been my favorite for a long time.</li>
            <li>It appears to keep my teeth clean and white, and leaves my mouth feeling fresh after a cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It is enough that this is very effective in diminishing the sensitivity I have, which of course is due to the acid erosion over the years.</li>
            <li>It is enough that this is very effective in diminishing the sensitivity I have, which of course is due to the acid erosion over the years.</li>
            <li>The extra 1.50 or so is worth every penny and is a must have winner and a keeper!as much as it recommends but my mouth doesn&#x27;t always feel as clean as when I use Crest for some reason.</li>
            <li>They became super sensitive again</li>
            <li>I think it is really good to try to keep the enamel on your teeth as long as possible</li>
            <li>In addition it bears mentioning that as it turns out the price is far higher than this product is worth..</li>
            <li>This certainly didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t verify the benefits of the box of it strengthening my enamel and preventing acid erosion, I certainly feel my mouth is healthier when using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay, but It runs very soon, i use one tube within three weeks, really very fast compared to other toothpastes</li>
            <li>I used to have super sensitive teeth, but after using this product I rarely have sensitive teeth anymore.  </li>
            <li>I get at most 2-3 a year now (mostly at times when I&#x27;m stressed), when typically I would get 2-3 a month, each time lasting a week or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is a very high chance it will be squashed when delivered since it is not packaged in a box.</li>
            <li>In fact, you know how people joke that you never see little kids or \\&quot;invincible in their own minds\\&quot; teens complaining about sore backs or wincing at an ice cream cone?  </li>
            <li>are pretty white and clean</li>
            <li>Noticed my front teeth had become stained and more rough and porous.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I&#x27;d received a sample of this toothpaste at my last dentist appointment.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks I am really noticing the difference.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really been watching for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the teeth.</li>
            <li>The travel size is very convenient when need for a trip.</li>
            <li>when I drink cold water my teeth don&#x27;t hurt anymore which is great!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much toothpaste I got.  </li>
            <li>so sometimes it is a pain making sure it is closed -</li>
            <li>This toothpaste really helped me.  </li>
            <li>This one does the job &amp; yet is gentle too.</li>
            <li>so it shoots out, and I always end up with too much.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste works very well.  </li>
            <li>It has worked very well.</li>
            <li>After going through almost the whole tube of Pronamel Gentle Whitening, I&#x27;d say it works as well as any of them, improving my sensitivity substantially but not eliminating it altogether.  </li>
            <li>After switching to Sensodyne&#x27;s Pronamel, I don&#x27;t have that problem as much as I used to.</li>
            <li>taste of this toothpaste is a light minty taste, definitely not overpowering by any means (just the way I like my toothpaste).</li>
            <li>I really like it, I will buy.</li>
            <li>and I really prefer this toothpaste and will recommend it to my patients.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is about as reasonable a cost as I have seen and like the convenience of if being sent to my door.</li>
            <li>tube is a real pain to deal with as well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t as much.</li>
            <li>Near the end I couldn&#x27;t even eat grapes, orange juice, fresh pineapple, coffee, or even salsa without inducing sensitivity.)  </li>
            <li>Dentist recommended and we really like it.</li>
            <li>that is what I been looking for thanks</li>
            <li>This product has really saved the enamel on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The pronamel really does harden the surface of the tooth.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I dislike about getting it on amazon is that they mail it in a cheap see through bag in a manila envelope.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are much happier now, I can turn my electric toothbrush up to the highest setting with no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a retired chemist with too much time on my hands, and I just had to know the answer to this question.</li>
            <li>I tried it and immediately noticed how much cleaner my mouth felt after brushing.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak for the whitening aspect but that is because I didn&#x27;t really buy it for that purpose.</li>
            <li>flavor, very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MUCH CHEAPER</li>
            <li>This toothpaste was recommended by my dentist for thin enamel and it&#x27;s been really great.</li>
            <li>so the whitening hasn&#x27;t really done anything for me.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture and taste of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>subscribe and save really spoils me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured, there can&#x27;t be that much of a difference</li>
            <li>I like that my teeth feel stronger and the gentle whitening is a plus that I&#x27;ve noticed as well.  </li>
            <li>Then the Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste came out and this is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have found this toothpaste very helpful to reduce the sensitivity in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>and this helps him so much.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think the whitening is really doing anything.</li>
            <li>Great fast delivery, have been using this for the last few years</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended sensodyne so got the gentle whitening one.</li>
            <li>The whole family is using this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have very sensible teeth.</li>
            <li>The ability to purchase at a discount thru Amazon and have it sent regularly is very convenient.</li>
            <li>and I think it really, really works.</li>
            <li>I would like to write an engaging review of toothpaste, but the prose is simply not in me.  </li>
            <li>and this product really helps out with that.</li>
            <li>My dentist, a close friend, recommended this paste  as it is gentle on tooth enamel.  </li>
            <li>I firmly recommend this toothpaste, and I will never use another kind, ever again.</li>
            <li>the other toothpaste did to my teeth, but now my teeth are back to feeling good again, and I cannot believe</li>
            <li>It does clean teeth well, and so far does seem far gentler than the abrasive toothpaste I had been using.  </li>
            <li>for my older teeth this toothpaste is worth every penny helps me out for sensitive teeth and hopefully helps me keep my teeth.</li>
            <li>Now Im back to normal and my teeth are still nice and white.  </li>
            <li>It does taste better to me than some other sensitivity-reducing toothpastes.    </li>
            <li>The Alpine Breeze flavor is okay, not stellar</li>
            <li>The Alpine Breeze flavor is okay, not stellar</li>
            <li>The extra 1.50 or so is worth every penny and is a must have winner and a keeper!</li>
            <li>I also love the taste and do not use any other tooth paste.</li>
            <li>Feel better than other toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to switch back to the original since it is cheaper by volume.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist also observed a significant decrease in tartar as well in my last visit.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see why I have to use this particular one but</li>
            <li>The only criticism I have about this product is that the tubes (even when full) are very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I was pretty much ordered by my dentist to use it because I have extremely sensitive teeth (can&#x27;t even eat ice cream without it hurting).  </li>
            <li>Hey, that&#x27;s a nice little factoid!</li>
            <li>Works very well, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but unlike that, it&#x27;s also a toothpaste meant to clean your teeth so it foams up a little more, just like regular toothpaste but not as much.</li>
            <li>This will go a long way towards your goal of a pain free mouth. </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure regarding how cost effective it is to buy online vs store.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, but I purchased this toothpaste because I started wearing Invisalign and, as a result, began brushing my teeth far more often than I used to.</li>
            <li>It has a nice minty taste, though not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The first container got completely blocked up that it no longer would dispense</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t much like the fancy new tops.  </li>
            <li>It is more expensive than others but does seem better.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive then most.</li>
            <li>particular product has two main ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Fluoride&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though its more expensive than Crest, I get more than what I pay for.</li>
            <li>is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that</li>
            <li>This particular product also addresses the enamel erosion.</li>
            <li>I was gonna have it set with Amazon pantry and sent to me regularly, but the cost just adds up too quickly for me.</li>
            <li>I had trouble using the extra-whitening but this stuff is safe to use and cleans very well, too.</li>
            <li>Guess what, this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t include that particular ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I have two teeth that are very sensitive and this toothpaste really helps.</li>
            <li>My teeth are sensitive and after using this I very rarely feel the same</li>
            <li>So, when one of my teeth started being very sensitive I was looking for help!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too much more in cost, nor less in size than normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It was highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>twice a day, which also has high fluoride concentration to help harden the existing enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>also recently purchased the company that makes Biotene toothpaste, and then Glaxo completely changed the Biotene enzyme system formula into generic ingredients containing simple detergents, and continue to market Biotene riding on the good reputation it used to have as an enzyme based system.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other sensitive toothpaste I have ever tried</li>
            <li>I find Sensodyne to be better than the other toothpastes for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>much better than some of the other sensitive toothpastes on the market.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricier than others, but I feel it works so much better</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is a little more liquidy, which I prefer to the thicker paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Teeth feel better every day I use it and a little whiter, too.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean with a lot less pain.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really confirm how the whitening part works as I don&#x27;t really pay attention to that, especially considering how much soda I drink.</li>
            <li>Plus it is Sensodyne, made for sensitive teeth, and has a gentle whitening additive.  </li>
            <li>For anyone with sensitive teeth would recommend the use of sensodyne pronamel gentle whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this in real life....and yes indeed, it;s all I use as far as toothepaste</li>
            <li>It works really well for my sensitive teeth, and I also noticed whiter teeth with use.</li>
            <li>BF is really picky about toothpaste as far as taste and texture, but he likes this one.</li>
            <li>I had sensitive teeth before I used this toothpaste, it really helped a lot</li>
            <li>I have to brush my teeth frequently - and - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s hype or real -</li>
            <li>great toothpaste but a bit expensive for the amt.  </li>
            <li>It really does help sensitive teeth a lot.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have become sensitive over the years, and this toothpaste really helps with that.  </li>
            <li>So far I am really liking this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Really does help with my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Really helped my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>after a few weeks of use my teeth feel stronger and more impervious to damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the taste, but that&#x27;s the same way I feel about all toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I normally buy this at the grocery or drug store but just added it to my subscribe and save list.</li>
            <li>There is nothing on the market hat compares to this, it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;</li>
            <li>After a few days of use I do feel that the sensitivity got better</li>
            <li>They allow toothpaste to get between the top and tube, and get goopy and messy.  </li>
            <li>Recently, my wife accidentally purchased a different kind of toothpaste, and so I decided to use that up before switching back to Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, not sure if I will continue to purchase this item since it is more expensive than regular toothpaste for nominal (at best) results.</li>
            <li>B001MS73GS ACT Total Care Rinse, Fresh Mint, 33.8-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one just isn&#x27;t worth extra money.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Sesodyne if your teeth is very sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li>Typically, whiteners make the teeth even more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wary of most toothpastes and mouthwash products, because my teeth are easily irritated.</li>
            <li>I went right back on Sensodyne and problem resolved!</li>
            <li>this stuff take my teeth from yellow  to white  and stronger this tooth past is awsome  great deal for the price</li>
            <li>and I figured I&#x27;d just learn to live with it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>My teeth always get sensitive in the winter time and I am forced to brush with warm water.</li>
            <li>Sensodyne is not as harsh as many other toothpastes and the taste is not bad in my opinion👍</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I really highly recommend this product for people with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I try to whiten my teeth every 6 months, but my teeth are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it because my teeth were very sensitive after bleaching.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and using this makes the sensitivity</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anybody else with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have an issue where one tooth is very sensitive if I drink any beverage with sugar using this toothpaste</li>
            <li>My teeth are always very sensitive, so my dentist recommended Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>my hubby has very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I had a root scaling done by my periodontist,and my teeth became very sensitive to hot/cold.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>and my tongue is still very sensitive to food.  </li>
            <li>a little sharp taste otherwise good</li>
            <li>I was using Crest whitening toothpaste for 3 months and made my teeth sensitive to hot/cold and hurt!</li>
            <li>At this point, I use it a couple of times a week only, and switch around with a couple of other brands whose flavors I like better.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive teeth, except for when I do whitening treatments.</li>
            <li>Just remember to use a soft bristled toothbrush!</li>
            <li>This is a more expensive toothpaste, but it is so worth the money!</li>
            <li>For the first time in ten years I can eat lemons, vinegar, Granny Smith apples...</li>
            <li>I recommend it for people who have sensitive teeth like me!  </li>
            <li>It does take a couple of weeks to truly kick it but consistent use will definitely take away some sensitivity.</li>
            <li>all of my front teeth have become EXTREMELY sensitive!</li>
            <li>Also as an added benefit it helps with sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>After about 2 days, I don&#x27;t think I was sensitive too anything at all!</li>
            <li>We can actually tell the difference when we use a different toothpaste out teeth just do not feel as clean</li>
            <li>I developed sensitive teeth as I have gotten older (boo hiss)  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste, no more sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to vigorously hold the top down for several seconds before anything comes out.  </li>
            <li>I have been more sensitive since using this paste, it makes your breath worse, and it makes funny noises when brushing.</li>
            <li>This is better tasting, smoother, and you need to use much less so it actually saves money.</li>
            <li>I left it in the sink overnight and had a big pile of artistic looking toothpaste in my sink in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical that a flouride toothpaste alone would work after all these years of using popular brands proclaiming their effectiveness (which did not help alleviate the increasing pain I experienced when drinking hot or cold liquids).  </li>
            <li>The taste is not very minty but is pleasant enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other toothpastes for sensitivities but Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste is the only one that&#x27;s been true to its word.  </li>
            <li>The cap is also large enough that I can not manipulate it with one hand (I can normally open other screw on caps easily since the cap fits in between my fingers.)</li>
            <li>I like this toothpaste, probably a little more than the standard version of Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure exactly at what point the pain completely subsided, but it&#x27;s certainly 100% thanks to Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can stand it vertically, allowing the toothpaste to stay near the opening (don&#x27;t have to work hard to get most of it out).</li>
            <li>without it, I cant drink cold drinks without a straw, because the pain on my front teeth is too great.</li>
            <li>is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;</li>
            <li>I must say I do like the Senodyne; it&#x27;s the only toothpaste I use because it really helps the sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use whitening formulas before because my teeth are so sensitive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The old timey tube designs force us to squeeze the paste out.</li>
            <li>a nonsmoker, so sensitive teeth have always been an issue for me.</li>
            <li>The moment I switch to a toothpaste that&#x27;s not for sensitive teeth, I&#x27;m immediately remorseful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My grandaughter has sensitive teeth, so the dentist recommended she use Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>Anytime I stop using this toothpaste for a prolonged period of time my teeth get really sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, I&#x27;d recommend buying Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>Helps with my sensitive teeth while helping to rebuild the enamel.</li>
            <li>My wife wanted a sensitive toothpaste, we tried this and it worked well.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.  </li>
            <li>I would indeed order from this seller again and was pleasantly surprised that it arrived ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li>Gentle whitening, no sensitivity issues which we have found some toothpastes can actually cause.  </li>
            <li>This seems to do what it intends, though it doesn&#x27;t foam much, like a regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in all non natural or non sensitive  toothpastes.</li>
            <li>as help my sensitive teeth alot</li>
            <li>Used to use Crest till I got old....</li>
            <li>For sensitive teethe, for whitening and enamel.</li>
            <li>If you need whitening and you have sensitive teeth do NOT hesitate to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and a tube of these remedies the issue immediately.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sensodyne, for sensitive tooth.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and have used some version of Sensodyne for years.</li>
            <li>FOR USE: The suggested method of use is equally  strange, although perhaps logical.</li>
            <li>We are told to wait at least an hour, or better yet, brush BEFORE meals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>FOR USE: The suggested method of use is equally  strange, although perhaps logical.</li>
            <li>We are told to wait at least an hour, or better yet, brush BEFORE meals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I still did guess that the toothpaste was actually the cause of the whole problem.  </li>
            <li>This is the toothpaste my dentist recommends for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Sensitive teeth and issues with gumlines.</li>
            <li>I have had extremely sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>What I am trying to say is that my teeth are extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>I really felt like I deep cleaned my mouth.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I like the fact that it is not too minty, and the packing is very convenient, especially as you get to the end of the tube.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the old formula that caused taste changes.</li>
            <li>Does the job on all sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive teeth/gums.  </li>
            <li>I started using it, too, and it has completely cleared up my tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>Still, it works very well, so I&#x27;ll be sticking to Pronamel for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, and drink a lot soda.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend this is you have sensitive teeth and want to protect the enamel on your teeth (also it does whiten some after a while).</li>
            <li>It also helps to some degree with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with sensitive teeth in my life.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t even had a cavity since I was a kid (almost 33 years old).</li>

            <li>I began using this toothpaste after I felt like the Colgate Sensitive was doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, give this brand a try.</li>
            <li>I use an Oral B electronic brush with sensitive head and this toothpaste.</li>

            <li>Both of my daughters have sensitive teeth because of their braces.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it really helps whiten your teeth--certainly not like Crest White Strips or anything.</li>

            <li>My teeth have become sensitive from all the dental work.  </li>
            <li>My dentist gave me a prescription crest sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>As far as whitening ...</li>
            <li>I do  have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I suggest this toothpaste for everyone, not just if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got sensitive teeth and my dentist recommended I use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am no longer sensitive to ultrasonic cleaning at the dental office</li>

            <li>Switching to Crest&#x27;s 3d sensitive fixed my problems and I haven&#x27;t felt any sensitivity changes.</li>
            <li>What I found out was that this could be caused by a frequent ingredient in toothpaste called sodium lauryl sulfate.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely get if you have cancre sores and sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>i have sensitive teeth and my docter recommended me this.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to want to spend the extra few dollars to get the Pronamel version, but I&#x27;m really glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, according to our users, this toothpaste does not taste good and they miss their Rembrandt.</li>
            <li>My concern was that brushing my teeth 4-5 times a day (any time I ate or drank something other than water) would cause enamel erosion, so I wanted to use something a little more gentle than my old standby (</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t POP with a mess around the opening to clean or squirting stuff in your eyes, nor does it require screwing.</li>
            <li>Just go back to the plain tube top.</li>
            <li>Other whitening toothpastes &amp; many regular ones actually burn the inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li>I want to be able to use other toothpastes but this is the only brand that actually helps our teeth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>right dentist I upsell for a living, no thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; or \\&quot;minty\\&quot; as your typical tube of Colgate and Crest, but it&#x27;s certainly not a bad taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>toothpaste doesn&#x27;t make my mouth feel quite as minty fresh as some other kinds I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The Pronamel claims to stop acid erosion of your teeth when in reality the ingredients are exactly the same as the regular version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a good toothpaste but its a little disappointing that the tubes weren&#x27;t bigger (didn&#x27;t contain more toothpaste basically).</li>
            <li>The cool mint &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; in the mouth a little bit</li>
            <li>After a year of using a stiff toothbrush, my gums are no slightly over exposed and super sensitive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this product does mention \\&quot;gentle whitening\\&quot;, my teeth are no different as far as a brighter shade of white.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was expected</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little to gentle to do much in the whitening arena.</li>
            <li>Gentle whitening was a little to gentle for me.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say if does a good or bad job at protecting/restoring enamel.</li>
            <li>well worth the slight cost in tease.</li>
            <li>I scoured the internet for solutions, and found out that &amp;#34;sodium lauryl sulfate&amp;#34; is a chemical in many common toothpastes (like crest of colgate, etc) is a potential cause of canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>tried using a different, more common toothpaste like Colgate</li>
            <li>Last time I was there, while a teacher was checking what the student was do with my teeth, I asked the teacher (a professional dentist, and not 90 years old and out of date) about acid erosion.</li>
            <li>My mom-in-law has very sensitive gums and teeth, and this is the only brand of toothpaste that she can use without any discomfort.</li>
            <li>Yes, it helps sensitivity, but it just seems weak when it comes to really feeling like you have a clean mouth.</li>
            <li>I can barely drink water with ice in it and have never been able to truly enjoy eating ice cream because it hurts so bad.</li>
            <li>I finally found a toothpaste that not only helps with general sensitivity but also has gentle whitening.  </li>
            <li>The major source in nature is bat guano found in caves.</li>
            <li>I was using some whitening strips and my teeth started to become more sensitive to hot and cold, this toothpaste reversed that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT, there is one major downside.  </li>
            <li>No other product (wash or toothpaste) has done that for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are labeling this one as a special acid fighter simply because it contains fluoride, the same ingredient that every other toothpaste contains.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li>sensodyne is the one that cosistently works the best for me no more cold and heat sensativity and no chalky taste</li>
            <li>All at the same time, It seems like an oxymoron to me, teeth whitening  and sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>But recently they changed the formula, and now I&#x27;m allergic to my old fave.</li>
            <li>so well I can rant about its taste and still give it a 5 Star Review; if you&#x27;re looking for a sensitive toothpaste, look no further.</li>
            <li>Regularly, my teeth are not all that sensitive, but I do eat a lot of acidy food and drink acidy drinks.</li>
            <li>My teeth are fairly white, so I can&#x27;t say it has made my teeth any whiter, but I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth haven&#x27;t developed that yellowish tint since using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive teeth and will only use this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;d taken personal and professional dental steps to reduce the habits that erode enamel and causes sensitivity, I still had intermittent sensitivity.</li>
            <li>You are likely buying it because you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;About 3 months later, all the problems were gone and I got an unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li>Now about 6 or so months later i do not have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suffer from overly sensitive teeth or necessarily want a whitening product.  </li>
            <li>And, though your mileage may vary, I haven&#x27;t found any of the Pronamel flavors to be significantly better or worse than the others.    </li>
            <li>Makes my teeth less sensitive and really does whiten them, although, that takes some time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s certainly not as pleasant as your standard toothpaste (Crest, Colgate, Aquafresh, etc.).</li>
            <li>Usually toothpastes without SLA don&#x27;t foam as well, but this brand foams better than other brands that don not have SLA.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, try this one and you will not go back to the regular brand.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of brands for sensitive teeth, including a different version of Sensodyne and wasn&#x27;t all that impressed--until now and this specific product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three months</li>
            <li>The only thing is it is kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>Because of that, I developed a pretty high sensitivity to crunchy things, cold things, and hot things.</li>
            <li>First tube opened seemed a little on the watery side</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it really helps with my sensitive teeth as I don&#x27;t see a major difference.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that the taste is medicinal or pretty bad, however, the results are truly worth</li>
            <li>The product is more expensive than regular toothpaste but ever since i started using it, my teeth have not been sensitive.</li>
            <li>Minty fresh, although not overwhelmingly so&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>If you put a dab on an especially sensitive spot, after brushing, and leave it there, just on the tender spot, it calms it down in a day or two.</li>
            <li>I find I have to use a full brush-length of paste to brush all my teeth, whereas with other pastes I can use less.  </li>
            <li>but I actually slowed down eating as much acidic food as I used too</li>
            <li>sooooo... had my teeth filled and they hurt super bad.</li>
            <li>Was using it for 6-7 month straight, but noticed that it does not clean the teeth well.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have SLS that causes ulcers, and has fluoride to prevent cavities (which is good), but the taste is really bad.</li>
            <li>It feels clean and not super heavy.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> great product - good price</li>
            <li> I love Sensodyne Pronamel, this is the best product</li>
            <li> Has helped my sensitivity and has a pleasant flavor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something that you gag from, but it&#x27;s also not something that I would consider pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do, and has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> All flavors of Sensodyne Pronamel are pleasant tasting.  </li>
            <li> Good flavor.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my teeth and gums, and I also use it on my tongue.</li>
            <li> I did not look closely to see that it comes in three good flavors and not just that goop flavor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I think this may be the best toothpaste available.</li>
            <li> so the price is good.</li>
            <li> This product works just as well as any Sensodyne toothpaste, which is to say it does a good job of reducing sensitivity.    </li>
            <li> The flavor is fairly neutral.</li>
            <li> , good deal in 3-pack.</li>
            <li> The taste is good and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> It also does a good job of maintaining whiteness.  </li>
            <li> Good for my teeth.</li>
            <li> It has a nice taste and keeps my dentist happy,</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good product</li>
            <li> good stuff, sensitivity to heat</li>
            <li> this toothpaste is really good.</li>
            <li> not so good as it was described!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think its a good deal to buy 3 at a time.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> Good flavor, seems to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> Good breath?</li>
            <li> That my dentist recommends it, without having samples and a sales rep touting how good it is?</li>
            <li> It helps with sensitivity and tastes good.</li>
            <li> Loved it and met all my expectations</li>
            <li> Good for brushing before you go to bed.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but this was a good deal on three.</li>
            <li> though that a mainstream product would be this good?</li>
            <li> good price.</li>
            <li> This is good toothpaste and no sodium laural sulfate in it.  </li>
            <li> it is a good product.</li>
            <li> But feels good because of the taste.</li>
            <li> tates good, hope it works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal from Amazon though.</li>
            <li> This is also a good tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and I got it for a good price.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 3+ years and my teeth never looked or felt so good.</li>
            <li> the price was good.  </li>
            <li> Good paste though would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> tooth paste is good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> I find it cleans well and tastes quite good.</li>
            <li> Good deal.</li>
            <li> Also, it is an awesome thing to be able to purchase it on a subscription so that I get it in advance of when I need it and never have to worry about forgetting it when I go to the store :)</li>
            <li> Tastes good, does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate, and protects teeth &#x3D; winning combination!</li>
            <li> im more of a colgate guy but the sensodyne has great mouth feel</li>
            <li> Shopping is very enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Great product, that&#x27;s why I have it on subscribe &amp; save :)</li>
            <li> but all in all very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and I will continue using this brand which, in my opinion, is head and shoulders over the others.</li>
            <li> Great ebayer:-)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> very pleased</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to put more on my toothbrush than the crest we used to use, but regardless, I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste have used for years, now on auto delivery, love it.</li>
            <li> Good taste and effective leaning.  </li>
            <li> Works great for sensitivity and tastes pretty good!</li>
            <li> This paste is just as effective, tastes great and leaves me confident with its results.</li>
            <li> Love this brand!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Love  this product!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> The taste is pleasant and i like the stand up top.  </li>
            <li> It tastes great, it helps with my sensitivity and it also whitens (fairly quickly, at that!).</li>
            <li> Tastes fine, works great and my teeth are not aching.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li> Nice toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Glad to find it on Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li> I used to use Sensodyne and find this equally effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pricing with Subscribe and Save savings is a nice added bonus.</li>
            <li> Honestly don&#x27;t see or feel and difference.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it works</li>
            <li> Really handy if you have a receding gum line.</li>
            <li> and I really researched toothpaste, trying to find the best product to reduce teeth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not altogether thrilled about it&#x27;s whitening ability.</li>
            <li> Kind of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by my hygienist, and it honestly does as it promises.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it rinses easily, so it is easy to keep an electric tooth brush clean.  </li>
            <li> My front teeth used to be kind of brittle (and I grind my teeth in my sleep sometimes), but I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and haven&#x27;t had any chips.</li>
            <li> Of course, I am not a scientist - just reporting on my own results.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; to it when you use it&lt;</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled about the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a kind of toothpaste from my country that helped me a lot, but Sensodyne isn&#x27;t even close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased another kind of Sensodyne toothpaste after I&#x27;ve used up what I bought this time, and hopefully it will work well.</li>
            <li> This is a gentler, but still effective way to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> SO she gave me this and honestly</li>
            <li> This never irritates my teeth, and does a great job keeping them feeling clean throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The taste is pleasantly minty without being too strong.</li>
            <li> If you do not want a strong mint toothpaste, this is a good option.</li>
            <li> Tastes good keeps the teeth safe, and whiteness is better.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> For years I was making my own tooth powder, because I found most toothpastes made the inside of my mouth peel</li>
            <li> Sensodyne is the best sensitive tooth paste i have tried and i have tried a bunch.</li>
            <li> Mine were in good shape no damage, but its a cheap way of sending it.</li>
            <li> Best for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Its really a good price with free shipping using Prime.</li>
            <li> Best sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, this is the best.</li>
            <li> No scrubbies in it, very smooth texture.</li>
            <li> , my teeth don&#x27;t get sensitive at all , amazing!!</li>
            <li> Very good for cleaning sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll eventually get use to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M GETTING SO MANY COMPLIMENTS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to many toothpastes.</li>
            <li> My dentist back home is impressed with my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is our go-to toothpaste -- good for sensitive teeth, good for enamel etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 6+ months, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself using this for more than the 3-pack</li>
            <li> I used so many brands of toothpaste to help me with the sensivety of my teeth, nothing work.</li>
            <li> &quot; is the latest in dentifrice marketing.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself some money and get the regular Sensodyne toothpaste - it works great!</li>
            <li> What more could we ask for?</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be enjoying ice cream once more. :)</li>
            <li> I regret that I now have 3 more tubes of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit more costly</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Glad I listened to the recommendations of my dentist</li>
            <li> It really works great</li>
            <li> Love sensodyne pronamel.</li>
            <li> As always with Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> My wife love&#x27;s this product and the price for buying in bulk</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying this latest iteration of Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li> I have used many brands and types.</li>
            <li> I love it as well.</li>
            <li> I totally love it.</li>
            <li> Im glad to come home and use the pronamel.</li>
            <li> I began having nerve pain most of the time just with the two teeth then a customer that is a dentist suggested I try Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> All of us are getting better checkups.</li>
            <li> or if we are developing better habits.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I love Sensodyne</li>
            <li> Love the bulk pricing.</li>
            <li> i love brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste, but wish there was a tad more whitening in it.</li>
            <li> /cold much better after using this product.</li>
            <li> I still could not eat many acidic foods while using this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started eating whole milk products, cheeses, eggs, and nuts more liberally and greatly reduced my sugar intake.  </li>
            <li> If it strengthens my enamel, even better, as I&#x27;m a grinder.  </li>
            <li> and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I love to eat acidic foods which soften the enamel.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this brand, and I love how cost efficient it is to get these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love buying this product in bulk from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Ok, no sensitivity problems, but...  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My husband is allergic to sodium lauryl sulfate which is in most toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Love this product will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My family all love it as well.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size I purchased and thought I was getting more ounces for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> love to bulk order this</li>
            <li> but so is more toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Who needs a mouth-searingly refreshing blast of peppermint at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> AND my teeth are healthier. :-)</li>
            <li> For some reason I love chewing on ice cubes and my teeth would sometimes hurt when doing that,</li>
            <li> How do I get more?</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste...</li>
            <li> Was told by dentist to use this to make feel better.</li>
            <li> Most of the Sensodynes seem to help with my teeth sensitivity</li>
            <li> This toothpaste glides on smoothly to my toothbrush and foams up nicely (I HAAAATE when my toothpaste does not &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; up...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better value to buy online than in the store.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> After many many many years of dental work</li>
            <li> Excellent, simple as that.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> I love pronamel- used for years.  </li>
            <li> I tried several and this was the best of all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should try it :)</li>
            <li> Love the flavor of the Alpine Breeze.  </li>
            <li> and I worried that I would get more cavities.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> It gave me the results I was looking for; whiter teeth and healthy gums.</li>
            <li> Give it a try you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> Many toothpaste that i use will have always hurt teeth</li>
            <li> I love this tooth paste with no dye.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t use Crest any more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love it for the product, not the price.  </li>
            <li> but you&#x27;re getting more cleaning power form my experience.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t refreshing</li>
            <li> and I love how it removed sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I like it the most of the Sensodyne toothpastes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It has a great taste and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice clean feeling without a lot of foam.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about these toothpastes is the top, it&#x27;s really easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean since started using pronamel.  </li>
            <li> Good product and does exactly what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> This is very mild and not that refreshing.</li>
            <li> The Alpine Breeze flavor is nice and mild.</li>
            <li> The price is great and the toothpaste is slowly becoming my favorite, in my old age.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for those of us who are sensitive!</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> In addition, the tube stores vertical leaving room for more important clutter.</li>
            <li> As I said, I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I&#x27;ve gotten more used to the taste, but it&#x27;s not one I particularly enjoy.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely great for not bothering sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Most importantly it has helped my tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste works great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne is a great product if you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works great for my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;this toothpaste is great for sensitive teeth, and it shows up at my door automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and have found that using Sensodyne brand paste seems to keep my teeth happy.  </li>
            <li> This works great on my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> great for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> great for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It tastes great and helps with toughen up our sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on your teeth, so if sensitivity is a problem, it&#x27;s a good choice.  </li>
            <li> ENOUGH HOW SUPER GREAT THIS WORKS!!  </li>
            <li> Very effective for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpast and purchasing it online is worth it with the price!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that has sensitive teeth, receding gums, or basically anyone that always wants to have the best teeth!</li>
            <li> Gentle is kind of what most of us want from Sensodyne, I imagine.</li>
            <li> I have Invisalign and go through toothpaste very quickly brushing 3-5 times a day after any food.  </li>
            <li> Easy stand up tube.</li>
            <li> and my teeth are clean of course :-)</li>
            <li> However, I cannot be more happy that I chose to spend that extra couple of dollars.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I tried this Alpine Breeze and it has a very mild</li>
            <li> Whitening strips are way too strong for me, too.</li>
            <li> Fairly strong flavor that I had to get used to...</li>
            <li> It is good quality and a decent price...</li>
            <li> strongly recommend non SLS toothpaste to anyone that gets cancer sores.</li>
            <li> Most toothpaste has too strong of mint flavor for my taste, I tried the Sensodyne Fresh Breath and it was better but still too strong.</li>
            <li> I really find it very useful and good.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice fresh breath and teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> thats when we found Sensodyne which he seems to tolerate fine and in addition has floride.</li>
            <li> A fine combination.  </li>
            <li> Started using the Sensodyne, and within a week, I had less sensitivity in my teeth, which was great!!!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is fine.</li>
            <li> It has mild whitening which is a plus!</li>
            <li> This one has a mild refreshing taste.</li>
            <li> challenge anyone with sensitivity to try dietary changes first before putting carcinogens into their mouth (which I never found to be very effective anyway, and they certainly did nothing to address the root cause of the problem).</li>
            <li> Great tasting, it is easy to get out of tube with no rolled up left over.</li>
            <li> We have noticed a huge difference since switching to this product.</li>
            <li> And, while this might seem like a huge problem, keep in mind that I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars despite the taste.  </li>
            <li> Each time I am given a goody package including a free sample of Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> Yes, I sound like an ad writer -</li>
            <li> This is a product I can genuinely recommend.</li>
            <li> Even my husband who thinks everything is a marketing gimmick started using this toothpaste because his cheap stuff ran out.  </li>
            <li> It was suggested to try Sensodyne as it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I received this product well packaged and in a fantastic time frame.  </li>
            <li> If your mouth gums, or tounge get irritated, or sores pop up it may be time to switch to an SLS free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is sulfate free, which I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does this sound contradictory to you?</li>
            <li> Does this sound contradictory to you?</li>
            <li> Smooth teeth, comfortable mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have had a great deal of dental work in the last couple years: implants and caps, zoom whitening, and bone grafts.  </li>
            <li> light mint flavor.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> I think the flavor is a bit strong and burny, but it keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> and though I&#x27;m sure it cleans my teeth, it doesn&#x27;t leave me with that &#x27;fresh mouth&#x27; feeling.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Good toothpaste for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Overall, we think it&#x27;s a nice tasting, effective product.</li>
            <li> While there have been many years in which I&#x27;ve had no cavities, my dental hygienist has mentioned in a real change for the better in regard to plaque.</li>
            <li> This is good toothpaste for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Very economical to purchase the 3-pack as a subscription (every 3 months or so) from Amazon if you need this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed anything major difference with the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as cheap as the original stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and I highly recommend it for anyone with similar sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Any toothpaste with Fluoride is really all you need for good cavity protection so as long as the toothpaste has Fluoride, I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li> but I am pain free right now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it will be your favorite toothpaste in the entire world, but if you&#x27;re on the hunt for the best toothpaste in the entire world you owe it to yourself to try this one.</li>
            <li> Well with the unique Sensodyne tube, we no longer have squeeze wars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young(ish) but don&#x27;t have great genes when it comes to teeth, and had suffered off and on from tooth sensitivity as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my standard toothpaste, great to get multiple tube at this good price.</li>
            <li> Helps significantly reduce sensitivity.</li>
            <li> And, my teeth feel clean and appear whiter.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to clean my teeth just as well.</li>
            <li> But when I finished to tube, I decided to go back to my old toothpase, and guess what, within two days my pain and sensitivity was greatly reduced!</li>
            <li> Clean feeling?</li>
            <li> This toothpaste seems to whiten my teeth with repeated continuous use and it makes my mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste, gives me that clean feeling I want without an overpowering flavor.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe how much more comfortable my teeth feel since I started using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> the taste is not overpowering and my teeth feel clean after use.</li>
            <li> Feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant taste and texture and I haven&#x27;t needed to re-whiten my teeth since using it regularly- about 3 years.</li>
            <li> Well, to my pleasant surprise, Sensodyne definitely works.</li>
            <li> fast delivery  &amp; good Deal, Thanks</li>
            <li> After getting so many cavities filled (7 in one visit, 8 in another), my teeth were becoming extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> My first try of this toothpaste , it is good you can feel it ,if you are looking for new toothpaste try it</li>
            <li> works as advertised and tastes great, priced right and was give to me at my last dentist visit as a sample</li>
            <li> Therefore, I was reluctant to buy the real thing (I do not want to be that healthy).  </li>
            <li> Really like it &amp; will buy more.</li>
            <li> Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> Sweet and 2.</li>
            <li> Always feel super clean after every use.</li>
            <li> kind she bought was even for &#x27;sensitive teeth&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK toothpaste, but it foams way too much and makes me gag every time.</li>
            <li> perhaps something sweet.  </li>
            <li> The Pronamel helps, and it tastes good enough.</li>
            <li> The taste is not bad.  </li>
            <li> No bad taste.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, but some may not like the taste.</li>
            <li> Not a bad price.</li>
            <li> Great product, just not the right flavor as I like a little bit more of a minty blast in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Mild flavor, kind to my sensitive teeth and no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This may seem pricey, but your pain goes away and your teeth feel clean and fresh for 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> This product protects your teeth from acid erosion, tooth decay and makes your mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can have it delivered to Jordan for a better price than I would pay locally.</li>
            <li> This product is everything I need in a toothpaste:  Whitening, gentle, and good for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste has tremendously helped with the sensitivity of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I also make sure to get enough vitamins D, A, and K, and my teeth have never been in better shape.  </li>
            <li> Wish it did more whitening, but my sensitive teeth are pain free.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt super clean and my breath was fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> only reason I docked it one star is because this toothpaste really doesn&#x27;t taste great.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best by far for my sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old and I was not blessed with great teeth, I really have to work hard to keep them clean and feeling great.</li>
            <li> We have used Pronamel for several years now and very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised to realize that a product could actually be as good as a commercial claims, better even in this case.</li>
            <li> I love it because I feel it is not hard on teeth.</li>
            <li> Nice flavor, leaves mouth feeling clean, not gritty.</li>
            <li> better than any other tooth paste out there great for people with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Sensodyne has been my tooth paste for many years and this new product is recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have recently experienced for myself the role of diet -- particularly the consumption of whole milk products -- in remineralizing porous, sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> The taste is pretty good, and it definitely helps with the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> i love limes and orange juice food that is pretty much acidic</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the taste but is easy on the gums</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes good and makes my mouth feel clean without feeling sandblasted as the other stuff did.</li>
            <li> This tastes more mild than the normal sensodyne and is more gentle on the mouth, stops the sensitivity and really helps my tender teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as bad as the older, non-Pronamel Sensodyne, so if you&#x27;ve only tried that, you may be pleasantly suprised, but if you&#x27;re used to \\&quot;normal\\&quot; (Crest, Colgate, even Tom&#x27;s) toothpaste, don&#x27;t expect to switch to Pronamel and not notice a difference.      </li>
            <li> ANd the container is pretty good for getting most of it out of the tube instead of having to leave a bunch inside and waste it</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> /&gt;no more sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> Let me first say that this product works!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to my crest toothpaste and live happily ever after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Foams less than most name-brand tooth pastes, but still froths more than enough for comfortable and effective brushing</li>
            <li> As pleasant tasting and texture as any other product.</li>
            <li> For years I bought only Arm &amp; Hammer Peroxicare, since I liked its effectiveness and flavor and it caused no reaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Happy with how this cleans, how it tastes (husband commented on fresh taste also), the way it freshens breath, and no sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smile.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Would recommend purchasing this product as it is well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with how the Pronamel is working and while my teeth don&#x27;t seem to be as white as it used to be when I was using Optic White, I believe it&#x27;s absolutely a fair trade off for not gagging every time I</li>
            <li> that it makes it wholly worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I prefer Glister Products ([[ASIN:B0017KHCB2 Glister Advanced Toothbrush]]) toothpaste &amp; brush for regular use and maintaining healthy teeth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li> It is a powerful irritant, and is a mouth culprit for pain, redness, and ulcers.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> as good as expected.</li>
            <li> Older Sensodyne varieties did not rinse so easily.  </li>
            <li> Safe for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> But with Subscribe &amp; Save, it&#x27;s definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is any better toothpaste if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Stuck with Colgate Sensitive which I find better for me.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my teeth would be more sensitive but all that went away over time.</li>
            <li> Of course, the medical issues were considerably more important than the cosmetic elements.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive teeth, I firmly believe that this is the best toothpaste for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take about 2 weeks or so to see and FEEL results, but it is so worth</li>
            <li> It also has a nice minty flavor which I prefer to the regular Synsodyne flavor.</li>
            <li> I like Colgate sensitive better.</li>
            <li> I think this works well, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the flavor.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any ways in which it seems to be more effective than any other Sensodyne toothpaste, in spite of obviously trying to appear more fancy.  </li>
            <li> So far very excited.</li>
            <li> package (i.e. the tube) is better than other tubes as it seems you can get most of the product out.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean very well and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and minty.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really notice a difference between this and the original Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li> Not just to brush but to apply some on my tooth right after brushing in night.</li>
            <li> And the price was right.  </li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> if that is the right word for it).</li>
            <li> Sensodyne Pro does the job right.</li>
            <li> or I notice a particular sensitivity, but this tooth paste makes a HUGE difference in my life.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for at least 15 years and it resolved all sensitivity I once experienced, and if it&#x27;s true, the anti-acidity protection may be beneficial.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need as much as it recommends but my mouth doesn&#x27;t always feel as clean as when I use Crest for some reason.</li>
            <li> and she recommended moving away from Sensodyne because it&#x27;s too much of a creamy paste and doesn&#x27;t have a grit to aid in cleaning your teeth as many of the normal toothpastes have.</li>
            <li> I want no other :)  </li>
            <li> It helps to strengthen your teeth, and this new version even adds a gentle whitening agent to make your teeth look even better.</li>
            <li> And over time we have noticed our teeth have become whiter without becoming sensitive.</li>
            <li> Update, Jan 2015:  They got rid of the goofy top, and are back to a sensible old design.  </li>
            <li> have mentioned the strange taste, and I honestly have no problem with the taste whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve noticed any great whitening or enamel effects over the toothpastes I&#x27;ve used previously, but my teeth certainly don&#x27;t bother me as much from brushing!</li>
            <li> Actually, Aquafresh Extreme Clean is very good, does not irritate the inside of the mouth, very gentle, and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> For some reason when my husband uses my toothpaste, he suddenly remembers to put the cap back on, lol...</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth gently and effectively, and I&#x27;m definitely starting to see some whitening effects.</li>
            <li> If they fixed that it would be an easy 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Slight whitening effect - good for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Good product but just slightly overpriced.</li>
            <li> The material inside is more gooey than other Sysodyne products that I&#x27;ve used, but it tastes and cleans fine.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on my teeth and my gums.  </li>
            <li> It also is very gentle.  </li>
            <li> Almost forgot to mention that this toothpaste is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t give me that burning sensation on my tongue or gums like colgate and crest does.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> very gentle on gums</li>
            <li> Everything is good - the smell, the taste, it fixes sensitivity, but again, does not clean.</li>
            <li> After years of chewing on ice, which makes hairline cracks in your teeth, being pregnant 4 times and vomiting throughout each pregnancy, I have super sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to clean very well, maybe because of the gentle whitening part.</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep, but it&#x27;s some pretty good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t identified your favorite toothpaste in the entire world, then you should try this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I work in Afghanistan and am able to see a dentist occasionally.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth that have been a primary aesthetic asset for 55 years.  </li>
            <li> In fact, since I&#x27;ve been using it (almost done with first tube)</li>
            <li> no one wants to be bothered!  </li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste for about a month first and it helped a lot with the sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> Even after you put the top back on, toothpaste continues to seep out of the nozzle and accumulate on the inside of the cap.  </li>
            <li> I first used this while traveling.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> The next time will buy more.</li>
            <li> I used this consistently for about a month and my sensitivity virtually went away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different types of toothpaste over the years, but the one to consistently keep my teeth shining the brightest was always Pronamel.</li>
            <li> Compared to Sam&#x27;s club the price is higher.</li>
            <li> I also tried to reduce processed foods in general and replace them with more nutritious whole</li>
            <li> Please be aware before you purchase this item.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works exactly as described and has reduced my sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I would try it in the store first and see if you like it.</li>
            <li> OK, the information on the box of this toothpaste states that it &amp;#34;strengthens and re-hardens enamel to help protect against the effects of acid erosion&amp;#34; from liquids such as soda and wine, and acidic foods like tomatoes.</li>
            <li> However, you most likely aren&#x27;t buying this product for this feature.</li>
            <li> and it works just as well as the first</li>
            <li> THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM SENSODYNE, BUT IT IS CHEAPER HERE THAN THE STORES,</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This product really was recommended by my dentist!  </li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> That said, I was a bit surprised at how smooth this paste feels.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied, but am just used to the grittier stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first discovered this from a dentist&#x27;s sample.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> No complaints ; )</li>
            <li> been ordering via amazon for yrs, one of my favorite toothpaste, the moment i get off sensodyne, my sensitivities will come back, that&#x27;s why this is on s&amp;s now!</li>
            <li> No weird taste or aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> About a year ago I became interested in whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li> So keep your teeth white and that enamel healthy with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of hot coffee and tea.  </li>
            <li> Sensodyne Pronamel, however, is the first I&#x27;ve found that did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that got me to this outcome.  </li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this toothpaste has a MUCH better flavor than the regular Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> But get much more quantity from Sam&#x27;s Club with same price</li>
            <li> That was my biggest gripe with the original, the flavor left my mouth lacking that clean feeling and taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had extremely sensitive teeth for many years now due to nighttime grinding, and I&#x27;ve tried many different toothpastes for reducing sensitivity including most of Sensodyne&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t to strong which is my opinion kind of sucks</li>
            <li> My teeth are now so sensitive I cant even drink tap water even with a straw without it hurting!!!!</li>
            <li> I like that the top of the cap is flat</li>
            <li> Ever since my dentist recommended this product, I never switched to any other kind.  </li>
            <li> No harsh flavors and keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> A tube (around 4-5 bucks at your local Target) can last me for a good two months.</li>
            <li> A tube (around 4-5 bucks at your local Target) can last me for a good two months.</li>
            <li> A GOOD TOOTH PASTE, EQUAL TO BOTH CREST AND COLGATE TOTAL</li>
            <li> +2 &#x3D; no clean and fresh feeling after brushing with this toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;Although this product might be good in dealing with sensitive teeth, I still would not recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in local drugstores, so I&#x27;m glad that Amazon will send it to my door at a good price.</li>
            <li> my enamel was pretty much gone so if you need help protecting your enamel get this paste</li>
            <li> This is the one toothpaste I can use long term which gives me the most resistance to sensitivity.</li>
            <li> It has been my favorite for a long time.</li>
            <li> It appears to keep my teeth clean and white, and leaves my mouth feeling fresh after a cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It is enough that this is very effective in diminishing the sensitivity I have, which of course is due to the acid erosion over the years.</li>
            <li> It is enough that this is very effective in diminishing the sensitivity I have, which of course is due to the acid erosion over the years.</li>
            <li> The extra 1.50 or so is worth every penny and is a must have winner and a keeper!as much as it recommends but my mouth doesn&#x27;t always feel as clean as when I use Crest for some reason.</li>
            <li> They became super sensitive again</li>
            <li> I think it is really good to try to keep the enamel on your teeth as long as possible</li>
            <li> In addition it bears mentioning that as it turns out the price is far higher than this product is worth..</li>
            <li> This certainly didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t verify the benefits of the box of it strengthening my enamel and preventing acid erosion, I certainly feel my mouth is healthier when using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, but It runs very soon, i use one tube within three weeks, really very fast compared to other toothpastes</li>
            <li> I used to have super sensitive teeth, but after using this product I rarely have sensitive teeth anymore.  </li>
            <li> I get at most 2-3 a year now (mostly at times when I&#x27;m stressed), when typically I would get 2-3 a month, each time lasting a week or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is a very high chance it will be squashed when delivered since it is not packaged in a box.</li>
            <li> In fact, you know how people joke that you never see little kids or \\&quot;invincible in their own minds\\&quot; teens complaining about sore backs or wincing at an ice cream cone?  </li>
            <li> are pretty white and clean</li>
            <li> Noticed my front teeth had become stained and more rough and porous.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I&#x27;d received a sample of this toothpaste at my last dentist appointment.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks I am really noticing the difference.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really been watching for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the teeth.</li>
            <li> The travel size is very convenient when need for a trip.</li>
            <li> when I drink cold water my teeth don&#x27;t hurt anymore which is great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much toothpaste I got.  </li>
            <li> so sometimes it is a pain making sure it is closed -</li>
            <li> This toothpaste really helped me.  </li>
            <li> This one does the job &amp; yet is gentle too.</li>
            <li> so it shoots out, and I always end up with too much.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste works very well.  </li>
            <li> It has worked very well.</li>
            <li> After going through almost the whole tube of Pronamel Gentle Whitening, I&#x27;d say it works as well as any of them, improving my sensitivity substantially but not eliminating it altogether.  </li>
            <li> After switching to Sensodyne&#x27;s Pronamel, I don&#x27;t have that problem as much as I used to.</li>
            <li> taste of this toothpaste is a light minty taste, definitely not overpowering by any means (just the way I like my toothpaste).</li>
            <li> I really like it, I will buy.</li>
            <li> and I really prefer this toothpaste and will recommend it to my patients.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is about as reasonable a cost as I have seen and like the convenience of if being sent to my door.</li>
            <li> tube is a real pain to deal with as well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t as much.</li>
            <li> Near the end I couldn&#x27;t even eat grapes, orange juice, fresh pineapple, coffee, or even salsa without inducing sensitivity.)  </li>
            <li> Dentist recommended and we really like it.</li>
            <li> that is what I been looking for thanks</li>
            <li> This product has really saved the enamel on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The pronamel really does harden the surface of the tooth.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike about getting it on amazon is that they mail it in a cheap see through bag in a manila envelope.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are much happier now, I can turn my electric toothbrush up to the highest setting with no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a retired chemist with too much time on my hands, and I just had to know the answer to this question.</li>
            <li> I tried it and immediately noticed how much cleaner my mouth felt after brushing.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak for the whitening aspect but that is because I didn&#x27;t really buy it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> flavor, very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MUCH CHEAPER</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended by my dentist for thin enamel and it&#x27;s been really great.</li>
            <li> so the whitening hasn&#x27;t really done anything for me.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and taste of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> subscribe and save really spoils me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured, there can&#x27;t be that much of a difference</li>
            <li> I like that my teeth feel stronger and the gentle whitening is a plus that I&#x27;ve noticed as well.  </li>
            <li> Then the Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste came out and this is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have found this toothpaste very helpful to reduce the sensitivity in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and this helps him so much.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think the whitening is really doing anything.</li>
            <li> Great fast delivery, have been using this for the last few years</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended sensodyne so got the gentle whitening one.</li>
            <li> The whole family is using this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have very sensible teeth.</li>
            <li> The ability to purchase at a discount thru Amazon and have it sent regularly is very convenient.</li>
            <li> and I think it really, really works.</li>
            <li> I would like to write an engaging review of toothpaste, but the prose is simply not in me.  </li>
            <li> and this product really helps out with that.</li>
            <li> My dentist, a close friend, recommended this paste  as it is gentle on tooth enamel.  </li>
            <li> I firmly recommend this toothpaste, and I will never use another kind, ever again.</li>
            <li> the other toothpaste did to my teeth, but now my teeth are back to feeling good again, and I cannot believe</li>
            <li> It does clean teeth well, and so far does seem far gentler than the abrasive toothpaste I had been using.  </li>
            <li> for my older teeth this toothpaste is worth every penny helps me out for sensitive teeth and hopefully helps me keep my teeth.</li>
            <li> Now Im back to normal and my teeth are still nice and white.  </li>
            <li> It does taste better to me than some other sensitivity-reducing toothpastes.    </li>
            <li> The Alpine Breeze flavor is okay, not stellar</li>
            <li> The Alpine Breeze flavor is okay, not stellar</li>
            <li> The extra 1.50 or so is worth every penny and is a must have winner and a keeper!</li>
            <li> I also love the taste and do not use any other tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Feel better than other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to switch back to the original since it is cheaper by volume.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist also observed a significant decrease in tartar as well in my last visit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see why I have to use this particular one but</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have about this product is that the tubes (even when full) are very flimsy.</li>
            <li> I was pretty much ordered by my dentist to use it because I have extremely sensitive teeth (can&#x27;t even eat ice cream without it hurting).  </li>
            <li> Hey, that&#x27;s a nice little factoid!</li>
            <li> Works very well, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but unlike that, it&#x27;s also a toothpaste meant to clean your teeth so it foams up a little more, just like regular toothpaste but not as much.</li>
            <li> This will go a long way towards your goal of a pain free mouth. </li>
            <li> This is my first time using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure regarding how cost effective it is to buy online vs store.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, but I purchased this toothpaste because I started wearing Invisalign and, as a result, began brushing my teeth far more often than I used to.</li>
            <li> It has a nice minty taste, though not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The first container got completely blocked up that it no longer would dispense</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much like the fancy new tops.  </li>
            <li> It is more expensive than others but does seem better.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive then most.</li>
            <li> particular product has two main ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Fluoride&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though its more expensive than Crest, I get more than what I pay for.</li>
            <li> is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that</li>
            <li> This particular product also addresses the enamel erosion.</li>
            <li> I was gonna have it set with Amazon pantry and sent to me regularly, but the cost just adds up too quickly for me.</li>
            <li> I had trouble using the extra-whitening but this stuff is safe to use and cleans very well, too.</li>
            <li> Guess what, this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t include that particular ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I have two teeth that are very sensitive and this toothpaste really helps.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive and after using this I very rarely feel the same</li>
            <li> So, when one of my teeth started being very sensitive I was looking for help!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too much more in cost, nor less in size than normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It was highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> twice a day, which also has high fluoride concentration to help harden the existing enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> also recently purchased the company that makes Biotene toothpaste, and then Glaxo completely changed the Biotene enzyme system formula into generic ingredients containing simple detergents, and continue to market Biotene riding on the good reputation it used to have as an enzyme based system.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other sensitive toothpaste I have ever tried</li>
            <li> I find Sensodyne to be better than the other toothpastes for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> much better than some of the other sensitive toothpastes on the market.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricier than others, but I feel it works so much better</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is a little more liquidy, which I prefer to the thicker paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Teeth feel better every day I use it and a little whiter, too.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean with a lot less pain.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really confirm how the whitening part works as I don&#x27;t really pay attention to that, especially considering how much soda I drink.</li>
            <li> Plus it is Sensodyne, made for sensitive teeth, and has a gentle whitening additive.  </li>
            <li> For anyone with sensitive teeth would recommend the use of sensodyne pronamel gentle whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this in real life....and yes indeed, it;s all I use as far as toothepaste</li>
            <li> It works really well for my sensitive teeth, and I also noticed whiter teeth with use.</li>
            <li> BF is really picky about toothpaste as far as taste and texture, but he likes this one.</li>
            <li> I had sensitive teeth before I used this toothpaste, it really helped a lot</li>
            <li> I have to brush my teeth frequently - and - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s hype or real -</li>
            <li> great toothpaste but a bit expensive for the amt.  </li>
            <li> It really does help sensitive teeth a lot.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have become sensitive over the years, and this toothpaste really helps with that.  </li>
            <li> So far I am really liking this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Really does help with my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Really helped my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> after a few weeks of use my teeth feel stronger and more impervious to damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the taste, but that&#x27;s the same way I feel about all toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I normally buy this at the grocery or drug store but just added it to my subscribe and save list.</li>
            <li> There is nothing on the market hat compares to this, it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;</li>
            <li> After a few days of use I do feel that the sensitivity got better</li>
            <li> They allow toothpaste to get between the top and tube, and get goopy and messy.  </li>
            <li> Recently, my wife accidentally purchased a different kind of toothpaste, and so I decided to use that up before switching back to Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, not sure if I will continue to purchase this item since it is more expensive than regular toothpaste for nominal (at best) results.</li>
            <li> B001MS73GS ACT Total Care Rinse, Fresh Mint, 33.8-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one just isn&#x27;t worth extra money.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Sesodyne if your teeth is very sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li> Typically, whiteners make the teeth even more sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wary of most toothpastes and mouthwash products, because my teeth are easily irritated.</li>
            <li> I went right back on Sensodyne and problem resolved!</li>
            <li> this stuff take my teeth from yellow  to white  and stronger this tooth past is awsome  great deal for the price</li>
            <li> and I figured I&#x27;d just learn to live with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> My teeth always get sensitive in the winter time and I am forced to brush with warm water.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne is not as harsh as many other toothpastes and the taste is not bad in my opinion👍</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I really highly recommend this product for people with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I try to whiten my teeth every 6 months, but my teeth are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it because my teeth were very sensitive after bleaching.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and using this makes the sensitivity</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anybody else with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have an issue where one tooth is very sensitive if I drink any beverage with sugar using this toothpaste</li>
            <li> My teeth are always very sensitive, so my dentist recommended Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> my hubby has very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I had a root scaling done by my periodontist,and my teeth became very sensitive to hot/cold.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> and my tongue is still very sensitive to food.  </li>
            <li> a little sharp taste otherwise good</li>
            <li> I was using Crest whitening toothpaste for 3 months and made my teeth sensitive to hot/cold and hurt!</li>
            <li> At this point, I use it a couple of times a week only, and switch around with a couple of other brands whose flavors I like better.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive teeth, except for when I do whitening treatments.</li>
            <li> Just remember to use a soft bristled toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is a more expensive toothpaste, but it is so worth the money!</li>
            <li> For the first time in ten years I can eat lemons, vinegar, Granny Smith apples...</li>
            <li> I recommend it for people who have sensitive teeth like me!  </li>
            <li> It does take a couple of weeks to truly kick it but consistent use will definitely take away some sensitivity.</li>
            <li> all of my front teeth have become EXTREMELY sensitive!</li>
            <li> Also as an added benefit it helps with sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> After about 2 days, I don&#x27;t think I was sensitive too anything at all!</li>
            <li> We can actually tell the difference when we use a different toothpaste out teeth just do not feel as clean</li>
            <li> I developed sensitive teeth as I have gotten older (boo hiss)  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste, no more sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to vigorously hold the top down for several seconds before anything comes out.  </li>
            <li> I have been more sensitive since using this paste, it makes your breath worse, and it makes funny noises when brushing.</li>
            <li> This is better tasting, smoother, and you need to use much less so it actually saves money.</li>
            <li> I left it in the sink overnight and had a big pile of artistic looking toothpaste in my sink in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a flouride toothpaste alone would work after all these years of using popular brands proclaiming their effectiveness (which did not help alleviate the increasing pain I experienced when drinking hot or cold liquids).  </li>
            <li> The taste is not very minty but is pleasant enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other toothpastes for sensitivities but Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste is the only one that&#x27;s been true to its word.  </li>
            <li> The cap is also large enough that I can not manipulate it with one hand (I can normally open other screw on caps easily since the cap fits in between my fingers.)</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste, probably a little more than the standard version of Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly at what point the pain completely subsided, but it&#x27;s certainly 100% thanks to Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can stand it vertically, allowing the toothpaste to stay near the opening (don&#x27;t have to work hard to get most of it out).</li>
            <li> without it, I cant drink cold drinks without a straw, because the pain on my front teeth is too great.</li>
            <li> is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;</li>
            <li> I must say I do like the Senodyne; it&#x27;s the only toothpaste I use because it really helps the sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use whitening formulas before because my teeth are so sensitive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The old timey tube designs force us to squeeze the paste out.</li>
            <li> a nonsmoker, so sensitive teeth have always been an issue for me.</li>
            <li> The moment I switch to a toothpaste that&#x27;s not for sensitive teeth, I&#x27;m immediately remorseful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My grandaughter has sensitive teeth, so the dentist recommended she use Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> Anytime I stop using this toothpaste for a prolonged period of time my teeth get really sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, I&#x27;d recommend buying Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> Helps with my sensitive teeth while helping to rebuild the enamel.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a sensitive toothpaste, we tried this and it worked well.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.  </li>
            <li> I would indeed order from this seller again and was pleasantly surprised that it arrived ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li> Gentle whitening, no sensitivity issues which we have found some toothpastes can actually cause.  </li>
            <li> This seems to do what it intends, though it doesn&#x27;t foam much, like a regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in all non natural or non sensitive  toothpastes.</li>
            <li> as help my sensitive teeth alot</li>
            <li> Used to use Crest till I got old....</li>
            <li> For sensitive teethe, for whitening and enamel.</li>
            <li> If you need whitening and you have sensitive teeth do NOT hesitate to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and a tube of these remedies the issue immediately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sensodyne, for sensitive tooth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and have used some version of Sensodyne for years.</li>
            <li> FOR USE: The suggested method of use is equally  strange, although perhaps logical.</li>
            <li> We are told to wait at least an hour, or better yet, brush BEFORE meals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> FOR USE: The suggested method of use is equally  strange, although perhaps logical.</li>
            <li> We are told to wait at least an hour, or better yet, brush BEFORE meals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I still did guess that the toothpaste was actually the cause of the whole problem.  </li>
            <li> This is the toothpaste my dentist recommends for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Sensitive teeth and issues with gumlines.</li>
            <li> I have had extremely sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> What I am trying to say is that my teeth are extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> I really felt like I deep cleaned my mouth.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I like the fact that it is not too minty, and the packing is very convenient, especially as you get to the end of the tube.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the old formula that caused taste changes.</li>
            <li> Does the job on all sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth/gums.  </li>
            <li> I started using it, too, and it has completely cleared up my tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> Still, it works very well, so I&#x27;ll be sticking to Pronamel for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, and drink a lot soda.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend this is you have sensitive teeth and want to protect the enamel on your teeth (also it does whiten some after a while).</li>
            <li> It also helps to some degree with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with sensitive teeth in my life.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t even had a cavity since I was a kid (almost 33 years old).</li>
            <li> Purchased on dentist recommendation after my husbands root canal and discovery of sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I began using this toothpaste after I felt like the Colgate Sensitive was doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, give this brand a try.</li>
            <li> I use an Oral B electronic brush with sensitive head and this toothpaste.</li>

            <li> Both of my daughters have sensitive teeth because of their braces.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it really helps whiten your teeth--certainly not like Crest White Strips or anything.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, my dentist recommended this toothpaste, and I have been using it ever since..</li>

            <li> My teeth have become sensitive from all the dental work.  </li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a prescription crest sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> As far as whitening ...</li>
            <li> I do  have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I suggest this toothpaste for everyone, not just if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got sensitive teeth and my dentist recommended I use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am no longer sensitive to ultrasonic cleaning at the dental office</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive teeth.</li>

            <li> Started using it when i got sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Switching to Crest&#x27;s 3d sensitive fixed my problems and I haven&#x27;t felt any sensitivity changes.</li>
            <li> What I found out was that this could be caused by a frequent ingredient in toothpaste called sodium lauryl sulfate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely get if you have cancre sores and sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> i have sensitive teeth and my docter recommended me this.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to want to spend the extra few dollars to get the Pronamel version, but I&#x27;m really glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, according to our users, this toothpaste does not taste good and they miss their Rembrandt.</li>
            <li> My concern was that brushing my teeth 4-5 times a day (any time I ate or drank something other than water) would cause enamel erosion, so I wanted to use something a little more gentle than my old standby (</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t POP with a mess around the opening to clean or squirting stuff in your eyes, nor does it require screwing.</li>
            <li> Just go back to the plain tube top.</li>
            <li> Other whitening toothpastes &amp; many regular ones actually burn the inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I want to be able to use other toothpastes but this is the only brand that actually helps our teeth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> right dentist I upsell for a living, no thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; or \\&quot;minty\\&quot; as your typical tube of Colgate and Crest, but it&#x27;s certainly not a bad taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> toothpaste doesn&#x27;t make my mouth feel quite as minty fresh as some other kinds I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The Pronamel claims to stop acid erosion of your teeth when in reality the ingredients are exactly the same as the regular version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a good toothpaste but its a little disappointing that the tubes weren&#x27;t bigger (didn&#x27;t contain more toothpaste basically).</li>
            <li> The cool mint &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; in the mouth a little bit</li>
            <li> After a year of using a stiff toothbrush, my gums are no slightly over exposed and super sensitive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this product does mention \\&quot;gentle whitening\\&quot;, my teeth are no different as far as a brighter shade of white.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little to gentle to do much in the whitening arena.</li>
            <li> Gentle whitening was a little to gentle for me.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say if does a good or bad job at protecting/restoring enamel.</li>
            <li> well worth the slight cost in tease.</li>
            <li> I scoured the internet for solutions, and found out that &amp;#34;sodium lauryl sulfate&amp;#34; is a chemical in many common toothpastes (like crest of colgate, etc) is a potential cause of canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> tried using a different, more common toothpaste like Colgate</li>
            <li> Last time I was there, while a teacher was checking what the student was do with my teeth, I asked the teacher (a professional dentist, and not 90 years old and out of date) about acid erosion.</li>
            <li> My mom-in-law has very sensitive gums and teeth, and this is the only brand of toothpaste that she can use without any discomfort.</li>
            <li> Yes, it helps sensitivity, but it just seems weak when it comes to really feeling like you have a clean mouth.</li>
            <li> I can barely drink water with ice in it and have never been able to truly enjoy eating ice cream because it hurts so bad.</li>
            <li> I finally found a toothpaste that not only helps with general sensitivity but also has gentle whitening.  </li>
            <li> The major source in nature is bat guano found in caves.</li>
            <li> I was using some whitening strips and my teeth started to become more sensitive to hot and cold, this toothpaste reversed that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT, there is one major downside.  </li>
            <li> No other product (wash or toothpaste) has done that for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are labeling this one as a special acid fighter simply because it contains fluoride, the same ingredient that every other toothpaste contains.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li> sensodyne is the one that cosistently works the best for me no more cold and heat sensativity and no chalky taste</li>
            <li> All at the same time, It seems like an oxymoron to me, teeth whitening  and sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> But recently they changed the formula, and now I&#x27;m allergic to my old fave.</li>
            <li> so well I can rant about its taste and still give it a 5 Star Review; if you&#x27;re looking for a sensitive toothpaste, look no further.</li>
            <li> Regularly, my teeth are not all that sensitive, but I do eat a lot of acidy food and drink acidy drinks.</li>
            <li> My teeth are fairly white, so I can&#x27;t say it has made my teeth any whiter, but I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth haven&#x27;t developed that yellowish tint since using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive teeth and will only use this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;d taken personal and professional dental steps to reduce the habits that erode enamel and causes sensitivity, I still had intermittent sensitivity.</li>
            <li> You are likely buying it because you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;About 3 months later, all the problems were gone and I got an unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li> Now about 6 or so months later i do not have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from overly sensitive teeth or necessarily want a whitening product.  </li>
            <li> And, though your mileage may vary, I haven&#x27;t found any of the Pronamel flavors to be significantly better or worse than the others.    </li>
            <li> Makes my teeth less sensitive and really does whiten them, although, that takes some time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s certainly not as pleasant as your standard toothpaste (Crest, Colgate, Aquafresh, etc.).</li>
            <li> Usually toothpastes without SLA don&#x27;t foam as well, but this brand foams better than other brands that don not have SLA.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, try this one and you will not go back to the regular brand.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of brands for sensitive teeth, including a different version of Sensodyne and wasn&#x27;t all that impressed--until now and this specific product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three months</li>
            <li> The only thing is it is kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> Because of that, I developed a pretty high sensitivity to crunchy things, cold things, and hot things.</li>
            <li> First tube opened seemed a little on the watery side</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really helps with my sensitive teeth as I don&#x27;t see a major difference.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that the taste is medicinal or pretty bad, however, the results are truly worth</li>
            <li> The product is more expensive than regular toothpaste but ever since i started using it, my teeth have not been sensitive.</li>
            <li> Minty fresh, although not overwhelmingly so&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> If you put a dab on an especially sensitive spot, after brushing, and leave it there, just on the tender spot, it calms it down in a day or two.</li>
            <li> I find I have to use a full brush-length of paste to brush all my teeth, whereas with other pastes I can use less.  </li>
            <li> but I actually slowed down eating as much acidic food as I used too</li>
            <li> sooooo... had my teeth filled and they hurt super bad.</li>
            <li> Was using it for 6-7 month straight, but noticed that it does not clean the teeth well.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have SLS that causes ulcers, and has fluoride to prevent cavities (which is good), but the taste is really bad.</li>
            <li> It feels clean and not super heavy.  </li>
            <li> This is about the same price as any other toothpaste, so I suggest if you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> The packaging and the tube are a significant design improvement other other toothpastes I have previously used.</li>
            <li> i have been using it so far instead of other brands.</li>
            <li> I had one cavity for year year in absence.</li>
            <li> When there is less paste in the tube, when you try to squeeze out the paste a big glob of paste flies out, usually not onto the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to try this toothpaste, simply because it was more expensive than the Colgate Sensitive and am I on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> This has been fun (for me at least), and I will continue to use Sensodyne brand toothpaste, even knowing that it contains no special, secret ingredient that will magically restore my enamel to the condition it was in my youth.</li>
            <li> This has been fun (for me at least), and I will continue to use Sensodyne brand toothpaste, even knowing that it contains no special, secret ingredient that will magically restore my enamel to the condition it was in my youth.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne has always made this bearable regardless of brand or type.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve also had frequent mouth sores that have really rough pain for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my old toothpaste thinking that the pain level should go down with the antibiotics...</li>
            <li> Went to my dentist, thought I had a loose filling or a cavity because one of my teeth had been getting progressively more sensitive to cold.  </li>
            <li> I have decent teeth that I take care of pretty well but from time to time they get sensitive to something too cold or</li>
            <li> My teeth actually are less sensitive.</li>
            <li> So I began using the original Sesodyne toothpaste and found the taste pretty bad, but stayed with it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the enamel stuff really does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> As a consistent user of this toothpaste for several years, Sensodyne Pronamel has made it bearable for me to eat/drink hot &amp; cold without nerve pain.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it whitens teeth, but it is gentle</li>
            <li> Every time I touched that tooth directly with the toothpaste, I felt immediate, extreme, excruciating pain!  </li>
            <li> For me, I have always had very sensitive teeth to hot and cold and just fussy and sensitive teeth altogether.</li>
            <li> (If you&#x27;re ever on Jeopardy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that leaves us with the only other  ingredient: FLOURIDE, the same fluoride that is found in almost every toothpaste and in just about the same amount.</li>
            <li> My sensitive gums have been less tender too.</li>
            <li> and my teeth are definitely less sensitive.</li>
            <li> Helps to make sensitive teeth less so.</li>
            <li> I dont have any cavities and it seems to do the trick in keeping my teeth less sensitive.</li>
            <li> Was great at helping my sensitive teeth, but terrible at cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> It literally only took a few uses for it to completely eliminate the sensitivity that I was having.  </li>
            <li> Screwing the cap back on takes a little finesse to not have the toothpaste squirt out or to not drop the tube completely, as the tube itself is very thin plastic that wiggles and twists easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible maybe it&#x27;s because all other toothpastes do the same amount of whitening and I&#x27;m at a plateau point for whitening.</li>
            <li> and* noting the Sensodyne Pronamel is significantly more expensive than their regular line, I decided to do a little internet research.    </li>
            <li> When I first started out with Pronamel, I&#x27;d combine it with my regular toothpaste to cut down on the bitterness, which is what I&#x27;d suggest you try if you&#x27;re having a hard time with the flavor.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really drink anything cold or hot without my teeth feeling sore</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m able to eat and drink cold things without the pain I used to get.</li>
            <li> Found no difference from other other, non sensitive, toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and I would prefer a cap that snaps open and closed rather than a screw off cap.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not sensitive using this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sensitive teeth for a few years now</li>
            <li> But my tongue does feel/taste a bit strange for a minute or two after.</li>
            <li> After what was probably a few weeks I noticed that my tooth sensitivity had completely gone.  </li>
            <li> With this toothpaste, my teeth are never sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, as long as they don&#x27;t use toothpaste with SLS, they don&#x27;t get the sores, but the minute they do, they&#x27;re going to be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this toothpaste as long as it keeps working for me and helps keep my sensitivity down!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Use this everyday for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pronamel for a long time, and Sensodyne for an even longer time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works better than less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I am going back to regular sensodyne with less foam.</li>
            <li> The main reason I got it is because my fiance is always saying her teeth hurt when she drinks something really hot or really cold, so it has actually helped me mentally a lot because now I don&#x27;t have to hear her complain anymore which is a plus</li>
            <li> As I found out doing some searching, this was due to the sulfates present in the toothpaste which act as foaming agents.</li>
            <li> And it definitely does not get as foamy as other toothpaste, but that&#x27;s not the end of the world.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to get too technical but just compare the ingredients to other products on the market...</li>
            <li> All of the other sensitive-tooth toothpastes work too, they all contain the same stuff -- strontium chloride.</li>
            <li> Only comes in a 4oz tube, versus the 6oz tubes other toothpaste&#x27;s come it</li>
            <li> In addition, like other users I have had issues with the product continuing to ooze out after putting the cap back on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive by volume</li>
            <li> Actually noticing a whitening with due diligence.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell the difference when I use other brands.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I use it for my sensitive teeth, especially with my gums receding a bit from brushing too hard, as well as when I whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li> For those of you who&#x27;ve gotten the high concentrated fluoride paste through your dentist, it&#x27;s a thick paste that you coat your teeth with and let it sit there for a few minutes before rinsing it out, then you have to actually brush your teeth with regular toothpaste for the &#x27;cleaning&#x27; part.</li>
            <li> I think this flavor is great, not sure what some of the other reviewers are talking about on &#x27;bad taste&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It actually really surprised me how little other reviewers commented on the taste of Sensodyne,</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s like taking a glass of water, labeling it as providing special acid protection, and making profit from the exaggerated claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GlaxoSmithKline</li>
            <li> No more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Minus one star because the whitening isn&#x27;t as noticeable as with other toothpastes, but I bought it for different reasons anyhow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only thus far used it last night and this morning but already the pain is decreased.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth that I have a hard time talking</li>
            <li> It is slightly stronger than the regular Sensodyne toothpaste.</li>
            <li> We are not particularly fond of the taste</li>
            <li> It took away all my sensitivity in a very short tome and it did slightly whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> Dark sodas especially will stain your teeth and it makes it harder for Sensodyne to work at fighting those stains but coffee/tea/wine</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, if you stop using Sensodyne, sensitivity can come back, like it did for me when I got lazy after I ran out and went back to Crest.</li>
            <li> If it also &amp;#34;gently whitens&amp;#34; my teeth, that will be a plus.alizing&amp;#34; the tooth enamel which has been previously damaged&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;It re-hardens softened enamel by restoring lost minerals&amp;#34;,  IT DOES NOT PHYSICALLY REPAIR LOST</li>
            <li> Then that tooth, became extremely sensitive to hot, cold, and the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This version doesn&#x27;t have an after taste that stays with you quite as long as the other version either.  </li>
            <li> These tiny little tubes have some sort of noxious goop.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cheaper in multi-packs here rather than buying locally.</li>
            <li> In the brief time it&#x27;s acidic, there&#x27;s little it can do.</li>
            <li> You can get bigger size from Sam&#x27;s club with a little bit lower unit price.</li>
            <li> It tastes bad, but it&#x27;s the packaging that I dislike the most.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got painfully sensitive teeth, the two minutes of bad taste is definitely worth the rest of the day with no pain.  </li>
            <li> My doctor recommend sensodyne, stared to use it like a month ago, and now I can enjoy cold drinks, ice cream without a problem.</li>
            <li> I can now drink ice cold water and can even enjoy ice cream or frozen yogurt.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve got two sufferers of painful canker sores in the family, and the cause of those sores appears to be sodium lauryl sulfate, a preservative in most toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I can enjoy ice cream and cold fruits without pain.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive teeth, give Sensodyne a try for at least six months</li>
            <li> complained to my dentist about sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;he</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just sort of medicinal, I guess, and bitter.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are not really whiter.</li>
            <li> A bit bitter.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say.</li>
            <li> Not gentle at all.</li>
            <li> consistency of the Sensodyne Pronamel is a thick white paste and very similar to prescription pastes I got through my dentist</li>
            <li> but this time it&#x27;s just oozing out slowly and not getting completely blocked up.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE BRUSHED THE ENAMEL RIGHT OFF MY FRONT TEETH FROM BRUSHING SO HARD AND TOO OFTEN FROM BEING ADDICTED TO ACIDIC JUICE POPS EVERY NIGHT THAT STAINED MY TEETH</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about it, rinse with plain water after the acidic food.&amp;#34; So I won&#x27;t be paying extra for Pronamel.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is white and there is not a strong flavor.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I use Sensodyne Pronamel twice a day, at least, with a soft brush toothbrush (use a circular motion and don&#x27;t press brushes into the teeth and gums, as reduction in the gum line also adds to sensitivity, and other problems).</li>
            <li> teeth are not sensitive, I just wanted less mint.</li>
            <li> I also like that the tube stand up on its own due to the base cap.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I did a pretty bad job brushing my teeth on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I drink lots of coffee and tea and this product manages to keep my teeth whiter than expected due to my caffeine use.</li>
            <li> &quot; product and an equivalent Colgate product, and being unable to identify any secret, powerful new additive for enamel protection, *</li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference when eating cold, hot, and even getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> However, when I use Sensodyne I can chew ice (although occasionally I will feel a twinge) and not worry about anything cold or hot.  </li>
            <li> I pay extra for it sometimes, but I&#x27;m not sure you need to</li>
            <li> It feels cleaner than other pastes.</li>
            <li> : I would buy it again, but wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to get this toothpaste over any other sensitivity-reducing toothpaste.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll use it once a day and choose another toothpaste of my choice to use the other time.</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews</li>
            <li> We should buy stock in it because he won&#x27;t use any other brand</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the whitening effect as I use other products for teeth whitening</li>
            <li> I floss every other day or so and never had my gums bleed</li>
            <li> &gt;  - Strontium (plus anion) and other ingredients</li>
            <li> Then I looked extremely close in the mirror</li>
            <li> I dislike using other toothpaste for any length of time, and like to have my teeth remineralized.</li>
            <li> One of their other flavors, I think mint or something, leaves a numbing sensation in the mouth for maybe 15 minutes after use that</li>
            <li> So, I looked into other alternatives.  </li>
            <li> This is priced comparably on Amazon to other places I have purchased it</li>
            <li> I have been able to ear ice cream and drink cold tea for three years now!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s no better than the regular version.</li>
            <li> My last complaint is that there is not very much toothpaste in this container.  </li>
            <li> A few of my teeth were sensitive to temperature and sweets--but no more!  </li>
            <li> My teeth are far less sensitive to cold foods now.  </li>
            <li> then the average toothpaste</li>
            <li> However, for toothpaste, it really is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not same thick consistency as a tube I bought from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Seriously decreased my sensitive feelings.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, but right now I have a cracked tooth and it has been extremely painful to drink cold water.</li>
            <li> I have narrowed it down to SLS being the exacerbating factor.  </li>
            <li> I think I have found the toothpaste that helps keep sensitivity down after dental work and for the rest of the time when that isn&#x27;t a concern.</li>
            <li> Watered down?</li>
            <li> This is way too creamy and runs off of the toothbrush and out of my mouth and drops down my face and on down to my t-shirt.</li>
            <li> (hello your tooth brush is in the other hand!).</li>
            <li> It arrived on time with my other items from Amazon subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> This works by essentially plugging little pores in your teeth so the cold water that normally bothers you, can&#x27;t get in to your nerve</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used up an entire container of this, possibly because a lot is wasted due to the terrible package design, possibly because there just isn&#x27;t as much in there to begin with.</li>
            <li> I did switch for a few months and just bought this product again as the other did not work.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I changed my diet rather radically for other, non-dental reasons.  </li>
            <li> I got this after my dental hygienist noted that my previous toothpaste was literally shredding my gums.</li>
            <li> Yes, the detail in the FAQ section states: &amp;#34;The sodium fluoride ion helps reverse the process (of acid erosion) by &amp;#34;re-mineralizing&amp;#34; the tooth enamel which has been previously damaged&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;It re-hardens softened enamel by restoring lost minerals&amp;#34;,  </li>
            <li> Less sensitivity?</li>
            <li> , you won&#x27;t taste it all day, it will be gone in half an hour or so.    </li>
            <li> I have periodontal problems (slight recession of gums) and</li>
            <li> I have a lot less pain in the gums when I use this, and of course, whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth used to be terribly sensitive to all sorts of things like cold water, my dentist actually suggested I try this brand out.</li>
            <li> the first couple months, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my teeth sensitivity, but gradually I noticed the pain from eating cold foods was beginning to subside.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste works, I can drink cold or hot liquids and my teeth don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Teeth hurt a lot with cold and hot items.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste since I have sensitive teeth, it helps to prevent those painful moments when drinking a cold drink.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommends this product and improves my sensitivity to hot and cold temperatures in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I went from having 1 approximately every other month to only having one or two per year.  </li>
            <li> Worth the few extra bucks vs dollar store crap.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, after a few days I noticed that I was experiencing less pain.  </li>
            <li> If I go a few days without using this toothpaste I feel the hot cold sensitives when eating or drinking.  </li>
            <li> it does not clean well.</li>
            <li> I used the Arm&amp;Hammer paste previously however I was told by my dentist that it was too harsh on my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little price-y compared to what I</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey comparing to others, but you know where your money is going when you use it.</li>
            <li> I had tried another Sensodyne toothpaste but still had a little sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> something I was unable to do with the Colgate Sensitive (even after using it for years!).</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has been used for a couple of years for my mistreated teeth, it helps with the little aches and pains.</li>
            <li> know if i can tell the difference, but every little bit helps.  </li>
            <li> For me, I had contributing factors for my sensitivity, such as the types of foods I was eating and drinking (coffee/soda/tea/wine), brushing my teeth too hard, using too hard of whitening products and teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a bad taste from using it, but even if I did it would be worth it to make sensitivity go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad sensitive teeth my entire life.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I noticed I don&#x27;t feel cold on my front teeth as much after using for a few days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even drink cold liquids without hurting my front teeth, but this toothpaste really helps take the edge off.</li>
            <li> I have to add that I floss everyday and rinse with scope mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The instructions say not to rinse it with water (as if they realized we would feel compelled to rinse it because of how messy it is).  </li>
            <li> I have been usuing this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, the pain is gone.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to take a few weeks to work.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years and is dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> These were too harsh on my teeth and hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with some of my teeth hurting</li>
            <li> And theres a few choices in  Pro Enamel you can pick from too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pronamel for a few years now, after it was recommended to me by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> and I have purchased nothing else for myself for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I will seek alternatives with the same active ingredients that are less expensive.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Sensodyne, so I tried a sample for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I read a few reviews on this and had to pit in my two cents.</li>
            <li> Also has reduced sensitivity of my teeth since I started using it few months ago.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I started noticing the past few weeks that my teeth are getting transparent all the way from the tips to halfway down the tooth.</li>
            <li> My grandpa said that this toothpaste has been whitening his teeth for the past few months and he has less tooth</li>
            <li> I imagine there is someone at Glaxo/Sensodyne who feels terribly clever over these tops, and is unaware that some longtime customers find them annoying.</li>
            <li> However it became increasingly difficult to enjoy typical cold treats like ice cream and watermelons.</li>
            <li> The tube size seems a little small, and we were always running out.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this tooth paste after radiation dry mouth caused a lot of problems with my teeth including sensitive teeth, bad breathe and an increase in developing</li>
            <li> They need to use a small box not a cheap bag to send it in.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t eat very hot or very cold foods without agony.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the sensitivity has dramatically decreased, if not completely gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve went from getting at least 1 sore a month to less than 1 a year!&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my dentist recommended an expensive flouride rinse to help relieve painful teeth sensitivities to hot and cold (we live in an area that does not have flouridated water)I found the Sensodyne Pronamel to have a similar flouride level to the rinse.  </li>
            <li> change toothpaste every 3 months and brush my teeth at least three times a day and this has helped a little.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it to slow down the erosion of my gums from years of hard living.  </li>
            <li> Just brush,  no more heat sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> No more skin sloughing</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if this is also helping or not</li>
            <li> No more hot and cold sensitivity either!  </li>
            <li> I think I will continue to pay the relatively expensive price for the relatively smaller tube.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well the whitening effect works</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps or not,</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I have heard about Sensodyne for years but didn&#x27;t think it would actually work because of my skeptical personality.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the increased cost compared to regular Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste after my teeth became sensitive to cold chocolate.</li>
            <li> so Pronamel is one of the very few toothpastes I can use.  </li>
            <li> but I believe Sensodyne is not very good.</li>
            <li> Switched to this after reading that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in regular toothpaste may contribute to painful, cracked corners of the mouth.... have not had a single issue since!!  </li>
            <li> but my teeth were getting dull.</li>
            <li> I have terribly sensitive teeth - it&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> Before using this product, even drinking cold water and having it hit the back of my teeth was killer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for at least two years.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste helps to remove any of the negative effects that soda and juice cause.  </li>
            <li> The pain to drink cold liquids came back.</li>
            <li> (During which it had slowly progressed, narrowing the range of foods I could eat.  </li>
            <li> and then it started oozing out slowly and would not stop.  </li>
            <li> What does it mean?  </li>
            <li> I buy other brands randomly</li>
            <li> I mean It is not burning in your mouth.</li>
            <li> They use a screw cap with makes it impossible to open</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried less expensive brands and eventually my teeth start to hurt.</li>
            <li> A little expensive - no doubt.  </li>
            <li> only way I would give a bad review</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t remember the last time I dealt with that painful twinge in my gums from icy cold</li>
            <li> I have some sensitivity to cold, icy drinks.</li>
            <li> if I fail to use Sensodyne for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I wish the amazon price on &amp;#34;mint essence&amp;#34; was still competitive, because this is not a good alternative.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell/taste, but I like that it&#x27;s for sensitive teeth and specifically focuses on enamel protection.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this product to anyone that has trouble with senistive teeth or that have trouble  with bad breath</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a 10-20% less sensitivity when it comes to cold food or liquids.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t numb your teeth or anything, but it does little to irritate them.  </li>
            <li> you can even skip a couple of brushings (with the paste, not skip them altogether) and have the decreased sensitivity remain.  </li>
            <li> You can buy it anywhere, so I buy it where I find it least expensive.  </li>
            <li> My sister has thin enamel</li>
            <li> have below the mechanism behind it if you are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my entire life and hate it.</li>
            <li> toothpaste does NOT have sodium lauryl sulfate, and once I started using it my canker sores recurrence decreased DRAMATICALLY.  </li>
            <li> I am one of the worse people about going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not happy...</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t taste bad as other people suggested, I sort of like the taste.</li>
            <li> I have bad teeth, with some damaged areas, and extreme sugar and temperature sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> So I choose on other features, like how it tastes and how ugly the package is</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to drink mint tooth paste and coffee (not a good combo!).</li>
            <li> so I pushed real hard to get it out</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a toothpaste without SLS is tough to find.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste seemed to cause me to have increased sensitivity, and also increased referred pain when I did have a bad tooth that made it very difficult to distinguish which tooth was actually the bad one, and led to an unnecessary root canal on the wrong tooth.  </li>
            <li> The tubes are a little annoying because the tops are screw on</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had not used this brand before ordering.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I bought 6 tubes of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I thought I would need expensive treatment</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne did a mediocre job of masking sensitivity in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This item came with a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Too expensive from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Usually expensive</li>
            <li> However, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> So expensive everywhere</li>
            <li> Cold is a bit worse than heat, but they&#x27;re also just sore all the time for no reason at all.</li>
            <li> Its expensive, I can vouch for that.</li>
            <li> but I do feel guilty every time I buy it.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep I using it, but I guess that the theory of sulfates causing mouth sores is wrong.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I had worn my enamel very thin</li>
            <li> Years ago I would experience awful pain in my back teeth after eating chocolate bars, drinking cold water, breathing cold air, eating candy with sugar in it, etc.</li>
            <li> The other brands I&#x27;ve tried tasted terrible.</li>
            <li> I have temperature-sensitive teeth and this toothpaste allows me to eat ice cream and cold drinks.</li>
            <li> Buy it if you are crazy about your oral hygiene.</li>

            <li> and they said this tastes bad?</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t even notice a bad taste</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad flavor, and I like the whitening aspect of the product as well.</li>
            <li> Water has no business being that painful.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s Sensodyne.  I try to stock up on these when it&#x27;s ~$1 an oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. I&#x27;ve been using the regular Sensodyne toothpaste but have been wanting to find something that helps protect the enamel on my teeth. I&#x27;m glad I found this. It is slightly stronger than the regular Sensodyne toothpaste. The sensation it csuses on my tongue, and the inside of my cheeks is something that I don&#x27;t care for. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll eventually get use to it. The price is unbeatable, and it&#x27;s incredibly convenient having it delivered. I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Receding gums and my dentist led me to this product.  Just brush,  no more heat sensitivity.  As pleasant tasting and texture as any other product.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used , my teeth don&#x27;t get sensitive at all , amazing!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had not used this brand before ordering.  We are not particularly fond of the taste and I would prefer a cap that snaps open and closed rather than a screw off cap.</li>
            <li> Nice toothpaste. Doesn&#x27;t bother sensitive teeth. Good flavor.</li>
            <li> I guess if you&#x27;re a senior whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t work. This certainly didn&#x27;t for me. Whitening strips are way too strong for me, too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste.  I have a tooth that sometimes has sensitivity, and when I use this toothpaste regularly, the pain stays away.</li>
            <li> my brand...great flavor</li>
            <li> I love this. It is very gentle on my teeth and my gums.  It feels good on my teeth and gums, and I also use it on my tongue.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. No more sensitive teeth. And tastes great too.</li>
            <li> I finally found a toothpaste that not only helps with general sensitivity but also has gentle whitening.  I wouldn&#x27;t use whitening formulas before because my teeth are so sensitive.  This toothpaste does not bother my teeth at all are my teeth appear to be getting whiter.  The cool mint &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; in the mouth a little bit but when all is said and done my mouth feels great.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not sensitive using this and my wife can have a tooth whitening toothpaste. All at the same time, It seems like an oxymoron to me, teeth whitening  and sensitive teeth. I can&#x27;t really confirm how the whitening part works as I don&#x27;t really pay attention to that, especially considering how much soda I drink.</li>
            <li> Noticed my front teeth had become stained and more rough and porous. Dentist said whitening toothpastes can do that and recommended I discontinue using this. Unfortunately for me, I bought 6 tubes of this stuff. Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t identified your favorite toothpaste in the entire world, then you should try this toothpaste.  I&#x27;m not saying it will be your favorite toothpaste in the entire world, but if you&#x27;re on the hunt for the best toothpaste in the entire world you owe it to yourself to try this one.</li>
            <li> Good taste, and it keeps my teeth shining!</li>
            <li> I get my teeth cleaned twice a year at the dentist. Each time I am given a goody package including a free sample of Sensodyne. These tiny little tubes have some sort of noxious goop. Therefore, I was reluctant to buy the real thing (I do not want to be that healthy).  However, I bit the bullet and bought this animal. I did not look closely to see that it comes in three good flavors and not just that goop flavor. I found I like them all. Each different flavor has a different color lid do I do not have to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old timey tube designs force us to squeeze the paste out. I like to from the back end. My wife keeps flattening from the middle. It is sort of like Gulliver&#x27;s travels which end of the egg do you open. We even bough a device to squeeze for us. Well with the unique Sensodyne tube, we no longer have squeeze wars. In addition, the tube stores vertical leaving room for more important clutter.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!  I CAN&#x27;T STRESS ENOUGH HOW SUPER GREAT THIS WORKS!!  I HAVE BRUSHED THE ENAMEL RIGHT OFF MY FRONT TEETH FROM BRUSHING SO HARD AND TOO OFTEN FROM BEING ADDICTED TO ACIDIC JUICE POPS EVERY NIGHT THAT STAINED MY TEETH SO BAD.  MY DENTIST RECOMMENDED THIS YEARS AGO &amp; I&#x27;VE STUCK WITH IT EVER SINCE.  THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A DRASTIC IMPROVEMENT IN THE APPEARANCE, WHITENING &amp; STRENGTH OF MY TEETH PLUS I&#x27;M GETTING SO MANY COMPLIMENTS TOO -&gt; I LOVE IT!!  AND I FINALLY FOUND A PLACE WHERE I CAN AFFORD TO BUY IT TOO -&gt; AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> Always good and for a great price. I&#x27;m glad I can have it delivered to Jordan for a better price than I would pay locally.</li>
            <li> I was using Crest whitening toothpaste for 3 months and made my teeth sensitive to hot/cold and hurt! Started using this, in 2 weeks the pain went away. Now Im back to normal and my teeth are still nice and white.  Will keep on using.</li>
            <li> This product is everything I need in a toothpaste:  Whitening, gentle, and good for sensitive teeth.  Glad to find it on Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li> Sensitivity is gone after using this stuff for just a week!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has tremendously helped with the sensitivity of my teeth.  I can tell a big difference when eating cold, hot, and even getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist.  It also is very gentle.  I have a problem with mouth sores and this toothpaste seems to help with the healing process.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been eating fruits since I was a kid I did not think the acids would harm my teeth. My dentist recommended this to me since my enamel is starting to disappear. Understand that this does not build enamel. Once its gone its gone. It does however re-harden and protects. Plus it taste great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to many toothpastes. For years I bought only Arm &amp; Hammer Peroxicare, since I liked its effectiveness and flavor and it caused no reaction. But recently they changed the formula, and now I&#x27;m allergic to my old fave. Fortunately, I&#x27;d received a sample of this toothpaste at my last dentist appointment. Mild flavor, kind to my sensitive teeth and no allergic reaction. Immensely relieved to find this quality product--just wish it were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years now. I work in Afghanistan and am able to see a dentist occasionally. My dentist back home is impressed with my teeth. I have not had a cavity since I switched. I have to add that I floss everyday and rinse with scope mouthwash. I drink lots of coffee and tea and this product manages to keep my teeth whiter than expected due to my caffeine use. Almost forgot to mention that this toothpaste is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t give me that burning sensation on my tongue or gums like colgate and crest does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. I pay extra for it sometimes, but I&#x27;m not sure you need to</li>
            <li> Great tasting, it is easy to get out of tube with no rolled up left over. It has won my reorder time and again.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY toothpaste I use. I have temperature-sensitive teeth and this toothpaste allows me to eat ice cream and cold drinks.</li>
            <li> Really does get rid of sensitivity after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Stops the cankers! Since making the switch from one of the big name brand toothpastes I no longer get constant canker sores....well worth the slight cost in tease. My sensitive gums have been less tender too. Love this brand!</li>
            <li> This is our go-to toothpaste -- good for sensitive teeth, good for enamel etc.</li>
            <li> For years I was making my own tooth powder, because I found most toothpastes made the inside of my mouth peel away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I visiting a friend, and they suggested I try this, and it didn&#x27;t have that affect. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 6+ months, and I love it. It&#x27;s also whitened my teeth quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth that have been a primary aesthetic asset for 55 years.  This keeps my teeth white and doesn&#x27;t make them hurt.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I think this may be the best toothpaste available.</li>
            <li> My teeth were in despair. After 15 years of not visiting the dentist it turned out I had one cavity for year year in absence. After getting so many cavities filled (7 in one visit, 8 in another), my teeth were becoming extremely sensitive. I also knew that I needed to work on rebuilding the enamel that I presume I lost. After a couple of weeks I am really noticing the difference. My teeth are far less sensitive to cold foods now.  My only gripe is the cost. I can&#x27;t see myself using this for more than the 3-pack I bought. Hoping to rebuild that enamel and go back to the cheaper toothpastes (and regular dentist visits).</li>
            <li> Amazon 2 day Prime shipping, dentist recommended it, it does sooth some tooth ache, so it does as described.  It leaves a chalk like film, it&#x27;s not a screw or flip cap.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I used to use Sensodyne and find this equally effective. In fact, since I&#x27;ve been using it (almost done with first tube), I don&#x27;t remember the last time I dealt with that painful twinge in my gums from icy cold foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a smoker for ten years, 8 years now a nonsmoker, so sensitive teeth have always been an issue for me. The moment I switch to a toothpaste that&#x27;s not for sensitive teeth, I&#x27;m immediately remorseful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because it works well for me. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in whitening (I&#x27;m a coffee drinker but always use a straw, lol) but I haven&#x27;t really been watching for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy with how this cleans, how it tastes (husband commented on fresh taste also), the way it freshens breath, and no sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricing with Subscribe and Save savings is a nice added bonus. Received the 3 tubes as advertised and described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took some up close photos so you can have a look. Like the way the tube stands up on the cap. For some reason when my husband uses my toothpaste, he suddenly remembers to put the cap back on, lol... Bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy this and recommend it to others. Smile. Hope this is helpful!</li>
            <li> Bought it a while ago and am now using it. It is gentle on the teeth. Thank you</li>
            <li> Been using this for years now.  No longer have issue with sensitivity.  Get this on subscribe n save so the price is good.</li>
            <li> First tube opened seemed a little on the watery side</li>
            <li> The Sensodyne toothpaste is the best. My dentist recommended this also. If you have sensitive teeth, try this one and you will not go back to the regular brand.</li>
            <li> like it  very good  will buy it again and again</li>
            <li> I used so many brands of toothpaste to help me with the sensivety of my teeth, nothing work. My doctor recommend sensodyne, stared to use it like a month ago, and now I can enjoy cold drinks, ice cream without a problem.</li>
            <li> This product works just as well as any Sensodyne toothpaste, which is to say it does a good job of reducing sensitivity.    However, after poring over the ingredient list of this \\&quot;enamel protection\\&quot; product and an equivalent Colgate product, and being unable to identify any secret, powerful new additive for enamel protection, *and* noting the Sensodyne Pronamel is significantly more expensive than their regular line, I decided to do a little internet research.    \\&quot;Enamel protection\\&quot; is the latest in dentifrice marketing.  What does it mean?  It means the toothpaste has fluoride in it.  But don&#x27;t 90% of the toothpastes on the market today have fluoride already?  Yes.    Save yourself some money and get the regular Sensodyne toothpaste - it works great!</li>
            <li> We have used Pronamel for several years now and very satisfied.  The travel size is very convenient when need for a trip.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. We use it regularly. The flavor is fairly neutral.</li>
            <li> All of my dentists recommend this for me. Only criticism is the price.  I had been using Sensodyne before but not the Pronamel. Honestly don&#x27;t see or feel and difference.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitivity,</li>
            <li> this stuff take my teeth from yellow  to white  and stronger this tooth past is awsome  great deal for the price</li>
            <li> this toothpaste works miracles. after a few weeks of use my teeth feel stronger and more impervious to damage. when I drink cold water my teeth don&#x27;t hurt anymore which is great!</li>
            <li> All tubes and boxes not sealed, looks like they were opened somewhere along the way, threw them in the trash on arrival, why take a chance..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sensodyne&#x27;s Pronamel Toothpastes for years.  I&#x27;m young(ish) but don&#x27;t have great genes when it comes to teeth, and had suffered off and on from tooth sensitivity as long as I can remember.  In fact, you know how people joke that you never see little kids or \\&quot;invincible in their own minds\\&quot; teens complaining about sore backs or wincing at an ice cream cone?  Well, they didn&#x27;t know me.      The great thing about Pronamel is that it works.  It WORKS!  I used it exclusively for a few months and found that it really helped.  It didn&#x27;t work overnight, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to do so.  At this point, I use it a couple of times a week only, and switch around with a couple of other brands whose flavors I like better.  It actually really surprised me how little other reviewers commented on the taste of Sensodyne, so I&#x27;ll jump in: Sensodyne Pronamel tastes horrible.  It&#x27;s not nearly as bad as the older, non-Pronamel Sensodyne, so if you&#x27;ve only tried that, you may be pleasantly suprised, but if you&#x27;re used to \\&quot;normal\\&quot; (Crest, Colgate, even Tom&#x27;s) toothpaste, don&#x27;t expect to switch to Pronamel and not notice a difference.      It&#x27;s just sort of medicinal, I guess, and bitter.  As I said, I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I&#x27;ve gotten more used to the taste, but it&#x27;s not one I particularly enjoy.  If you&#x27;ve got painfully sensitive teeth, the two minutes of bad taste is definitely worth the rest of the day with no pain.  When I first started out with Pronamel, I&#x27;d combine it with my regular toothpaste to cut down on the bitterness, which is what I&#x27;d suggest you try if you&#x27;re having a hard time with the flavor.  And, though your mileage may vary, I haven&#x27;t found any of the Pronamel flavors to be significantly better or worse than the others.    Nonetheless, I really highly recommend this product for people with sensitive teeth.  It works well enough you can even skip a couple of brushings (with the paste, not skip them altogether) and have the decreased sensitivity remain.  Honestly, it works so well I can rant about its taste and still give it a 5 Star Review; if you&#x27;re looking for a sensitive toothpaste, look no further.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a great value.  I can&#x27;t believe how much toothpaste I got.  The value is great.  The tubes are a little annoying because the tops are screw on so sometimes it is a pain making sure it is closed - in the morning no one wants to be bothered!  This toothpaste really helped me.  I try to whiten my teeth every 6 months, but my teeth are very sensitive.  I used this toothpaste for about a month first and it helped a lot with the sensitivity.  I would recommend this to anyone that has sensitive teeth, receding gums, or basically anyone that always wants to have the best teeth! :-D  My dentist recommended this to me and I plan on using it until I don&#x27;t have teeth anymore - which shouldn&#x27;t be a problem with this stuff!  Buy it if you are crazy about your oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothpaste years ago and I have been using it ever since.  It appears to keep my teeth clean and white, and leaves my mouth feeling fresh after a cleaning.  You can buy it anywhere, so I buy it where I find it least expensive.  This time it was Amazon, so they received my order.</li>
            <li> Has helped my sensitivity and has a pleasant flavor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive teeth, except for when I do whitening treatments. I start using this before treatment to relieve the sensitivity of whitening and also because it restores enamel. It does the job I need it to.</li>
            <li> im more of a colgate guy but the sensodyne has great mouth feel and my teeth are definitely less sensitive.</li>
            <li> Works well, good deal in 3-pack.</li>
            <li> I am just using it because my dentist recommended. I don&#x27;t really see why I have to use this particular one but not the tea tree paste I was using before. But I listen to my dentist.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Pronamel, because we wear the enamel off our teeth and this toothpaste is a proven help in strengthening the tooth.  Plus it is Sensodyne, made for sensitive teeth, and has a gentle whitening additive.  What more could we ask for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sensitive teeth for a few years now and I figured I&#x27;d just learn to live with it. However it became increasingly difficult to enjoy typical cold treats like ice cream and watermelons. I found Sensodyne after doing some research on Google and decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first couple months, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my teeth sensitivity, but gradually I noticed the pain from eating cold foods was beginning to subside. After using the product for about six months, I realized that I hadn&#x27;t even noticed there was no pain whatsoever from eating cold foods. I&#x27;m not sure exactly at what point the pain completely subsided, but it&#x27;s certainly 100% thanks to Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have mentioned the strange taste, and I honestly have no problem with the taste whatsoever. It&#x27;s not as \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; or \\&quot;minty\\&quot; as your typical tube of Colgate and Crest, but it&#x27;s certainly not a bad taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive teeth, give Sensodyne a try for at least six months and you&#x27;ll be enjoying ice cream once more. :)</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in a short time</li>
            <li> Meh. Overpriced, but it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to. It does what it does, which it that it desensitizes your gums/teeth. Really handy if you have a receding gum line.</li>
            <li> Other whitening toothpastes &amp; many regular ones actually burn the inside of my mouth. This one does the job &amp; yet is gentle too. Really like it &amp; will buy more.</li>
            <li> I regret that I now have 3 more tubes of this stuff.  It tastes bad, but it&#x27;s the packaging that I dislike the most.  It&#x27;s in a pressurized can so it shoots out, and I always end up with too much.  Even after you put the top back on, toothpaste continues to seep out of the nozzle and accumulate on the inside of the cap.  The instructions say not to rinse it with water (as if they realized we would feel compelled to rinse it because of how messy it is).  My last complaint is that there is not very much toothpaste in this container.  It would take me maybe 4 months to go through a regular tube of Aquafresh, but it&#x27;s only been a month and I&#x27;ve used up an entire container of this, possibly because a lot is wasted due to the terrible package design, possibly because there just isn&#x27;t as much in there to begin with.</li>
            <li> If you do not want a strong mint toothpaste, this is a good option. Regularly, my teeth are not all that sensitive, but I do eat a lot of acidy food and drink acidy drinks. I have been usuing this for a few weeks and I have already noticed that my teeth feel stronger.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works very well.  My dentist recommended it because my teeth were very sensitive after bleaching.  But not anymore since I started using Pronamel.</li>
            <li> my husband never had any tooth problems until he got older(lucky him) but toothpaste became a problem and thats when we found Sensodyne which he seems to tolerate fine and in addition has floride.</li>
            <li> For anyone with sensitive teeth would recommend the use of sensodyne pronamel gentle whitening toothpaste.  It is a bit more costly then the average toothpaste but well worth it.</li>
            <li> When my dentist recommended an expensive flouride rinse to help relieve painful teeth sensitivities to hot and cold (we live in an area that does not have flouridated water)I found the Sensodyne Pronamel to have a similar flouride level to the rinse.  I was skeptical that a flouride toothpaste alone would work after all these years of using popular brands proclaiming their effectiveness (which did not help alleviate the increasing pain I experienced when drinking hot or cold liquids).  To my surprise, after a few days I noticed that I was experiencing less pain.  After a few weeks, the pain is gone.  Amazing.  And, my teeth feel clean and appear whiter.  Yes, I sound like an ad writer - but I&#x27;m not.  This is a product I can genuinely recommend.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by our dentist to help improve the enamel strength of our teeth. We have noticed a huge difference since switching to this product. And over time we have noticed our teeth have become whiter without becoming sensitive. We&#x27;re sticking to this product for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other toothpastes for sensitivities but Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste is the only one that&#x27;s been true to its word.  If I go a few days without using this toothpaste I feel the hot cold sensitives when eating or drinking.  This toothpaste works for me.  Even my husband who thinks everything is a marketing gimmick started using this toothpaste because his cheap stuff ran out.  Now he won&#x27;t use anything else because even he notices a difference as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected</li>
            <li> Sensodyne is the best sensitive tooth paste i have tried and i have tried a bunch. I have very sensitive teeth and using this makes the sensitivity disappear.&lt;br /&gt;The one con is that it takes alot  of paste on your brush to get it to foam up enough.</li>
            <li> My grandaughter has sensitive teeth, so the dentist recommended she use Sensodyne. I purchased several tubes for her. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase. Glad I listened to the recommendations of my dentist</li>
            <li> I like this product. It really works great</li>
            <li> Anytime I stop using this toothpaste for a prolonged period of time my teeth get really sensitive. I can&#x27;t really drink anything cold or hot without my teeth feeling sore/aching. However, when I use Sensodyne I can chew ice (although occasionally I will feel a twinge) and not worry about anything cold or hot.  If you have sensitive teeth, I&#x27;d recommend buying Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been using this product for 2 years and I believe it works well!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth. I&#x27;m planning to whiten, and I wanted to guard against sensitivity for that. Now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I think I&#x27;ll keep using it even after the whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I noticed I don&#x27;t feel cold on my front teeth as much after using for a few days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t make my mouth feel quite as minty fresh as some other kinds I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with sensitivity. It is more expensive than others but does seem better.</li>
            <li> I had problems with the skin inside my mouth sloughing when I used the 3D White and any of the Pro health line of toothpaste. As I found out doing some searching, this was due to the sulfates present in the toothpaste which act as foaming agents. It was suggested to try Sensodyne as it is sulfate free. Well I tried this Sensodyne Pronamel and I&#x27;m very happy with it. No more skin sloughing and it seems to clean my teeth just as well. I can&#x27;t notice anything with respect to the whitening aspect however. And it definitely does not get as foamy as other toothpaste, but that&#x27;s not the end of the world. Highly recommended for anybody else with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended this toothpaste. It has worked very well. We like it. The taste is good and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> Great product and cannot imagine having to go elsewhere to get it. Would recommend purchasing this product as it is well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I first used this while traveling. A girlfriend had it in her bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this brand ever since. It&#x27;s a little price-y compared to what I what using before.&lt;br /&gt;But I like the fresh taste. It feels cleaner than other pastes.</li>
            <li> Just like you buy in the store. Love sensodyne pronamel. Helps with my sensitive teeth while helping to rebuild the enamel. Great pricing on here! As always with Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> My wife love&#x27;s this product and the price for buying in bulk compared to a grocery store was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying this latest iteration of Sensodyne.  The packaging and the tube are a significant design improvement other other toothpastes I have previously used.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a sensitive toothpaste, we tried this and it worked well. Then I discovered subscribe and save,,and we get this every three months just as we need it. Win win!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used many brands and types. This is by far the best by far for my sensitive teeth! I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years now and don&#x27;t plan on changing.</li>
            <li> This is definitely great for not bothering sensitive teeth. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve noticed any great whitening or enamel effects over the toothpastes I&#x27;ve used previously, but my teeth certainly don&#x27;t bother me as much from brushing! I will definitely stick with this paste for the foreseeable future. Great pricing on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had extremely sensitive teeth for many years now due to nighttime grinding, and I&#x27;ve tried many different toothpastes for reducing sensitivity including most of Sensodyne&#x27;s products.  After going through almost the whole tube of Pronamel Gentle Whitening, I&#x27;d say it works as well as any of them, improving my sensitivity substantially but not eliminating it altogether.  I haven&#x27;t found any ways in which it seems to be more effective than any other Sensodyne toothpaste, in spite of obviously trying to appear more fancy.  It has not seemed to whiten my teeth at all.  It does taste better to me than some other sensitivity-reducing toothpastes.    Bottom line: I would buy it again, but wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to get this toothpaste over any other sensitivity-reducing toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is a nonirritating, protective toothpaste. It was highly recommended by my dentist. It cleared the sensitivity in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I needed to switch toothpastes after realizing that Colgate Optic White was a reason that I was gagging while I was brushing. I didn&#x27;t have this problem before and didn&#x27;t think that it was the toothpaste&#x27;s problem. After switching to Sensodyne&#x27;s Pronamel, I don&#x27;t have that problem as much as I used to. I&#x27;m quite pleased with how the Pronamel is working and while my teeth don&#x27;t seem to be as white as it used to be when I was using Optic White, I believe it&#x27;s absolutely a fair trade off for not gagging every time I brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste of this toothpaste is a light minty taste, definitely not overpowering by any means (just the way I like my toothpaste). While I can&#x27;t verify the benefits of the box of it strengthening my enamel and preventing acid erosion, I certainly feel my mouth is healthier when using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> After years of chewing on ice, which makes hairline cracks in your teeth, being pregnant 4 times and vomiting throughout each pregnancy, I have super sensitive teeth. When I use this it helps a lot, almost to no sensitivity at all. I did switch for a few months and just bought this product again as the other did not work.</li>
            <li> I love it as well. The price is great and the toothpaste is slowly becoming my favorite, in my old age. It still is not as tasty as the cinnamon toothpaste from back in the day, but it is very solid.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do. It tastes great, it helps with my sensitivity and it also whitens (fairly quickly, at that!). The only criticism I have about this product is that the tubes (even when full) are very flimsy. Screwing the cap back on takes a little finesse to not have the toothpaste squirt out or to not drop the tube completely, as the tube itself is very thin plastic that wiggles and twists easily.</li>
            <li> I really like it, I will buy. Shopping is very enjoyable. The next time will buy more. Good quality. Very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental student and I really prefer this toothpaste and will recommend it to my patients.  It&#x27;s gentle on your teeth, so if sensitivity is a problem, it&#x27;s a good choice.  It also does a good job of maintaining whiteness.  My teeth are fairly white, so I can&#x27;t say it has made my teeth any whiter, but I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth haven&#x27;t developed that yellowish tint since using this toothpaste. Any toothpaste with Fluoride is really all you need for good cavity protection so as long as the toothpaste has Fluoride, I&#x27;m pretty happy. Just remember to use a soft bristled toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I had two issues with this toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;1. it does not clean well. I had to brush twice every time and it still felt like the result could have been better.&lt;br /&gt;2. this paste does not taste good.&lt;br /&gt;1+2 &#x3D; no clean and fresh feeling after brushing with this toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;Although this product might be good in dealing with sensitive teeth, I still would not recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.  My dentist recommended it to slow down the erosion of my gums from years of hard living.  Hope it works!  It does clean teeth well, and so far does seem far gentler than the abrasive toothpaste I had been using.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the taste, but that&#x27;s the same way I feel about all toothpaste.  Keeping my fingers crossed...</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste out there!  It&#x27;s the only one that helps my sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne Pronamel which I purchased in Amazon is truly great.  As a family we like to use it all the time.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and does everything that it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I like it a lot</li>
            <li> I noticed the sensitivity has dramatically decreased, if not completely gone! It has mild whitening which is a plus! I have recommended it to my parents... Great product, that&#x27;s why I have it on subscribe &amp; save :)</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste and a better value on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Have used these products for years.  Its consistency is a bit creamy, doesn&#x27;t sit as well on the toothbrush but all in all very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dentist that suffers from aphthous ulcers aka canker sores.  I have narrowed it down to SLS being the exacerbating factor.  This sensodyne helps with my sensitivity and also lets my canker sores heal faster.  I totally love it.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for those of us who are sensitive!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for several years now so I decided to just have it shipped automatically. Has a pleasant taste and texture and I haven&#x27;t needed to re-whiten my teeth since using it regularly- about 3 years. Most importantly it has helped my tooth sensitivity. I forget how sensitive my teeth are without it, then every once in a while I will use a different toothpaste for a few weeks (usually while traveling) and the sensitivity comes back full force and Im glad to come home and use the pronamel. It is a little pricier than others, but I feel it works so much better that it makes it wholly worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Awesome work just like they said</li>
            <li> My husbands dentist recommended this tooth paste and we have yet to go back to another since. We can actually tell the difference when we use a different toothpaste out teeth just do not feel as clean I was happy to add this to my subscription list.</li>
            <li> I have two molars that have ridges in the enamel at the gum line. I began having nerve pain most of the time just with the two teeth then a customer that is a dentist suggested I try Sensodyne. I thought I would need expensive treatment but I was wrong. Within a short period of using this - maybe a week, all of the chronic pain stopped. I know this sounds like a commercial but it&#x27;s not. I am very skeptical about a lot of things and cannot figure out how a $5 tube of toothpaste saved me about $2500. I normally buy this at the grocery or drug store but just added it to my subscribe and save list. When I went to my dentist and told him about the pain, he thought that the ridges did not look like a big deal and said to keep using Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my Dentist and I found that it is indeed helpful and as advertised.  I received this product well packaged and in a fantastic time frame.  I would indeed order from this seller again and was pleasantly surprised that it arrived ahead of schedule.  Thanks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willie &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have two teeth that are very sensitive and this toothpaste really helps.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste for sensitive teeth. I can&#x27;t even drink cold liquids without hurting my front teeth, but this toothpaste really helps take the edge off.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive teeth. Have been using this toothpaste for several years</li>
            <li> 4 stars just because of price.  But, you get what you pay for.  So, maybe it should be 5 stars...  Anyways, this is the toothpaste I like best.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended to us by my son&#x27;s dentist to help strengthen enamel after having braces.  We all like it.  Gentle whitening, no sensitivity issues which we have found some toothpastes can actually cause.  All of us are getting better checkups. Don&#x27;t know if that is the tooth paste or if we are developing better habits.  Could be both but we are sticking with ProNamel! It is more expensive then most. Amazon is about as reasonable a cost as I have seen and like the convenience of if being sent to my door.</li>
            <li> I was feeling sensitiveness in my tooth towards cold and someone suggested me to use this. Not just to brush but to apply some on my tooth right after brushing in night. It helped me, so I think it&#x27;s alright. Just been using for short while but won&#x27;t switch to this permanently. I prefer Glister Products ([[ASIN:B0017KHCB2 Glister Advanced Toothbrush]]) toothpaste &amp; brush for regular use and maintaining healthy teeth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I am a 20 year old and I was not blessed with great teeth, I really have to work hard to keep them clean and feeling great. Teeth sensitivity runs in my family and I really researched toothpaste, trying to find the best product to reduce teeth sensitivity. I actually found out about the greatness of this product from ConsumerSearch.com. It was rated the best toothpaste for teeth sensitivity and it did not disappoint me! Before using this product, even drinking cold water and having it hit the back of my teeth was killer. I was beginning to think my sensitivity would never go away. I began using this product and in about a week or so I noticed a difference. Progressively the sensitivity went away and I could drink cold drinks again without pain! This product also helps with acid errosion which is a plus if you eat a lot of citrus and such. This is about the same price as any other toothpaste, so I suggest if you have sensitive teeth you give it a try! I used this consistently for about a month and my sensitivity virtually went away. I don&#x27;t use it every time I brush now, I&#x27;ll use it once a day and choose another toothpaste of my choice to use the other time. I read some other reviews and they said this tastes bad? I actually don&#x27;t think so, I don&#x27;t even notice a bad taste and I have used flavored toothpastes, Crest, Colgate, etc. I don&#x27;t get a bad taste from using it, but even if I did it would be worth it to make sensitivity go away. Go get this product if you struggle with teeth sensitivity, you won&#x27;t regret your purchase!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders. I normally don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, but right now I have a cracked tooth and it has been extremely painful to drink cold water. Water has no business being that painful. I picked up some sensodyne pronamel, OMG that stuff works wonders. Am currently on antibiotics and scheduled for a root canal, but the pain level has dropped from a 10 to a 1 in the meantime. I went back to my old toothpaste thinking that the pain level should go down with the antibiotics...nope. Despite the antibiotic treatment the pain was still excruciating without the sensodyne. I&#x27;ll probably be using this for the next couple of weeks. I was so surprised to realize that a product could actually be as good as a commercial claims, better even in this case. 5 stars isn&#x27;t enough for this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had always great experience using this product and I recommend it to anyone! The only thing is it is kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about these toothpastes is the top, it&#x27;s really easy to work with. It doesn&#x27;t POP with a mess around the opening to clean or squirting stuff in your eyes, nor does it require screwing. Just a simple twist! The material inside is more gooey than other Sysodyne products that I&#x27;ve used, but it tastes and cleans fine.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne has been my tooth paste for many years and this new product is recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> This seems to do what it intends, though it doesn&#x27;t foam much, like a regular toothpaste.  I find I have to use a full brush-length of paste to brush all my teeth, whereas with other pastes I can use less.  I&#x27;ve used it for at least 15 years and it resolved all sensitivity I once experienced, and if it&#x27;s true, the anti-acidity protection may be beneficial.  I can vouch for the sensitivity elimination, though not for acidity protection.</li>
            <li> My favorite tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I love Sensodyne but I&#x27;m not altogether thrilled about it&#x27;s whitening ability. It&#x27;s a little to gentle to do much in the whitening arena. Gentle is kind of what most of us want from Sensodyne, I imagine.</li>
            <li> If your mouth gums, or tounge get irritated, or sores pop up it may be time to switch to an SLS free toothpaste. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in all non natural or non sensitive  toothpastes. It is a powerful irritant, and is a mouth culprit for pain, redness, and ulcers.  This will go a long way towards your goal of a pain free mouth. </li>
            <li> Recommended by hygienist. Good for my teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this in real life....and yes indeed, it;s all I use as far as toothepaste</li>
            <li> better than any other tooth paste out there great for people with sensitive teeth i use along side my Colgate maybe 1 hour after just for the mint breath but sensodyne as help my sensitive teeth alot my enamel was pretty much gone so if you need help protecting your enamel get this paste</li>
            <li> This tooth paste works, I can drink cold or hot liquids and my teeth don&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;ll use this forever.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth less sensitive and really does whiten them, although, that takes some time. cleans well too. I was recommended this brand by my dentist.</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive teeth and will only use this toothpaste! We should buy stock in it because he won&#x27;t use any other brand and it doesn&#x27;t bother his teeth.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. Have been using this for years. Just found it on Amazon. Love the bulk pricing. Very effective for sensitive teeth. Nice flavor, leaves mouth feeling clean, not gritty.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste is so-so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sulfate free, which I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;It contains saccharine, something I wish it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is a real pain to deal with as well.  They use a screw cap with makes it impossible to open/close the thing one handed (hello your tooth brush is in the other hand!). The cap is also large enough that I can not manipulate it with one hand (I can normally open other screw on caps easily since the cap fits in between my fingers.)</li>
            <li> Sensodyne makes wonderful sensistive teeth dentifrices...this is one of them.  I have no idea if it actually whitens...I confess to paying no attention to that aspect</li>
            <li> This is a more expensive toothpaste, but it is so worth the money! It took away all my sensitivity in a very short tome and it did slightly whiten my teeth. I am very satisfied and I will continue using this brand which, in my opinion, is head and shoulders over the others. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I suddenly have pain in my back tooth to the point it hurts to drink even room temperature water. Dentist told me to use sensodyne. I&#x27;ve only thus far used it last night and this morning but already the pain is decreased.  I was expecting it to take a few weeks to work. So far very excited. Also it doesn&#x27;t taste bad as other people suggested, I sort of like the taste. But my tongue does feel/taste a bit strange for a minute or two after.</li>
            <li> It works really well for my sensitive teeth, and I also noticed whiter teeth with use. Will keep on buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years and it works very good. Leaves a nice fresh breath and teeth feeling clean. I would definitely recommend it. I can&#x27;t speak to the whitening effect as I use other products for teeth whitening so I&#x27;m not sure if this is also helping or not but I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> i love brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different types of toothpaste over the years, but the one to consistently keep my teeth shining the brightest was always Pronamel. It has a nice taste and keeps my dentist happy, what more can you ask for? It is a little pricey comparing to others, but you know where your money is going when you use it.</li>
            <li> This Is the only toothpaste my wife will buy. I buy other brands randomly but we always revert back!  Perfect.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is white and there is not a strong flavor. I mean It is not burning in your mouth. My teeth are not really whiter. But it&#x27;s good product</li>
            <li> Love  this product! did not check on size. Compared to Sam&#x27;s club the price is higher.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I have Invisalign and go through toothpaste very quickly brushing 3-5 times a day after any food.  I also have an allergy to SLS so Pronamel is one of the very few toothpastes I can use.  It&#x27;s a little cheaper in multi-packs here rather than buying locally.</li>
            <li> I got this after my dental hygienist noted that my previous toothpaste was literally shredding my gums. This toothpaste tastes good and makes my mouth feel clean without feeling sandblasted as the other stuff did. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> For me, I had contributing factors for my sensitivity, such as the types of foods I was eating and drinking (coffee/soda/tea/wine), brushing my teeth too hard, using too hard of whitening products and teeth grinding. While I&#x27;d taken personal and professional dental steps to reduce the habits that erode enamel and causes sensitivity, I still had intermittent sensitivity. I tried a lot of brands for sensitive teeth, including a different version of Sensodyne and wasn&#x27;t all that impressed--until now and this specific product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three months, I forgot I used to have teeth sensitivity. After six months, my teeth, while not blazingly white, were whiter! Dark sodas especially will stain your teeth and it makes it harder for Sensodyne to work at fighting those stains but coffee/tea/wine don&#x27;t as much. Keep in mind, if you stop using Sensodyne, sensitivity can come back, like it did for me when I got lazy after I ran out and went back to Crest. I also use [[ASIN:B001MIZMJS ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)]] twice a day, which also has high fluoride concentration to help harden the existing enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the Sensodyne Pronamel is a thick white paste and very similar to prescription pastes I got through my dentist but unlike that, it&#x27;s also a toothpaste meant to clean your teeth so it foams up a little more, just like regular toothpaste but not as much. For those of you who&#x27;ve gotten the high concentrated fluoride paste through your dentist, it&#x27;s a thick paste that you coat your teeth with and let it sit there for a few minutes before rinsing it out, then you have to actually brush your teeth with regular toothpaste for the &#x27;cleaning&#x27; part. Kind of a hassle. Anyway, I use Sensodyne Pronamel twice a day, at least, with a soft brush toothbrush (use a circular motion and don&#x27;t press brushes into the teeth and gums, as reduction in the gum line also adds to sensitivity, and other problems). You don&#x27;t need as much as it recommends but my mouth doesn&#x27;t always feel as clean as when I use Crest for some reason. The Alpine Breeze flavor is okay, not stellar but it&#x27;s not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s also really great about this product is that it&#x27;s also sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)-free. So if you get canker sores, and I do on occasion, this product just does it all. A tube (around 4-5 bucks at your local Target) can last me for a good two months. The extra 1.50 or so is worth every penny and is a must have winner and a keeper!as much as it recommends but my mouth doesn&#x27;t always feel as clean as when I use Crest for some reason.

            <li> Love this toothpaste, but wish there was a tad more whitening in it. Still, will continue to use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> good stuff, sensitivity to heat/cold much better after using this product.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne did a mediocre job of masking sensitivity in my teeth.  I still could not eat many acidic foods while using this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have recently experienced for myself the role of diet -- particularly the consumption of whole milk products -- in remineralizing porous, sensitive teeth.  I&#x27;ve suffered from sensitivity for about a decade.  (During which it had slowly progressed, narrowing the range of foods I could eat.  Near the end I couldn&#x27;t even eat grapes, orange juice, fresh pineapple, coffee, or even salsa without inducing sensitivity.)  A few months ago I changed my diet rather radically for other, non-dental reasons.  I started eating whole milk products, cheeses, eggs, and nuts more liberally and greatly reduced my sugar intake.  I also tried to reduce processed foods in general and replace them with more nutritious whole foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidentally, this was also when I STOPPED using sensitivity toothpaste (didn&#x27;t like putting oxidizing, likely mutagenic chemicals in my mouth.)  After what was probably a few weeks I noticed that my tooth sensitivity had completely gone.  For the first time in ten years I can eat lemons, vinegar, Granny Smith apples...you name it.  No more hot and cold sensitivity either!  And all without a drop of sensitivity toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I challenge anyone with sensitivity to try dietary changes first before putting carcinogens into their mouth (which I never found to be very effective anyway, and they certainly did nothing to address the root cause of the problem).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried less expensive brands and eventually my teeth start to hurt. So I stopped trying the others, and order this Subscribe and Save. This way we get it all...Convenience. Price. Quality.</li>
            <li> Used to use Crest till I got old....but of course the alternative is undesirable.  Dentist recommended and we really like it.</li>
            <li> This item came with a weird smell. I think it&#x27;s expired;however, there is no expiration date on this item. Please be aware before you purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I like the flavor and the freshness.  It feels clean and not super heavy.  If it strengthens my enamel, even better, as I&#x27;m a grinder.  I think I will continue to pay the relatively expensive price for the relatively smaller tube.  It&#x27;s not too much more in cost, nor less in size than normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I buy this toothpaste because it has no SLA which seems to aggravate/cause mouth ulcers.  Usually toothpastes without SLA don&#x27;t foam as well, but this brand foams better than other brands that don not have SLA.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste is really good. For sensitive teethe, for whitening and enamel. My sister has thin enamel so it is a must.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste helps curb my temperature sensitivity.  The taste is not bad.  It leaves a nice clean feeling without a lot of foam.</li>
            <li> I had been having some sensitivity in my teeth.  My dentist recommended Sensodyne  toothpaste.  It has helped to stop the sensitivity. I also love the taste and do not use any other tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I had tried another Sensodyne toothpaste but still had a little sensitivity.  With this toothpaste, my teeth are never sensitive.  I&#x27;m not sure how well the whitening effect works but it can&#x27;t hurt.  Typically, whiteners make the teeth even more sensitive.  That has not been the case with this toothpaste.  I will stick to this one in the future.</li>
            <li> This is very good toothpaste.  If you need whitening and you have sensitive teeth do NOT hesitate to give it a try.  It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> not so good as it was described!&lt;br /&gt;I will not probably buy it any more!&lt;br /&gt;not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> that is what I been looking for thanks</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> This tastes more mild than the normal sensodyne and is more gentle on the mouth, stops the sensitivity and really helps my tender teeth and I will use it forever because it works.</li>
            <li> My first try of this toothpaste , it is good you can feel it ,if you are looking for new toothpaste try it</li>
            <li> This product has really saved the enamel on my teeth.  I love to eat acidic foods which soften the enamel.  The pronamel really does harden the surface of the tooth.  I use it 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my dentist but I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see a substantial difference in the sensitivity in my teeth.  So far, so good.  No bad taste.  Came packaged as described.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Thank you.  And the price was right.  I have been using sensodyne for a number of years.  And will not change. R. A. Boyd</li>
            <li> After a year of using a stiff toothbrush, my gums are no slightly over exposed and super sensitive. My dentist recommended this brand, and I love how cost efficient it is to get these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My life change after I used Pronamel</li>
            <li> Subscribe and Save w/ auto ship.  I like this brand and have used since they came out.  Saw this on Amazon no brainer added to my subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is very good. I have been using it for a few years and is dentist recommended. I think its a good deal to buy 3 at a time. The only thing I dislike about getting it on amazon is that they mail it in a cheap see through bag in a manila envelope. There is a very high chance it will be squashed when delivered since it is not packaged in a box. Mine were in good shape no damage, but its a cheap way of sending it. They need to use a small box not a cheap bag to send it in.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My dentist recommended I use it for my sensitive teeth, especially with my gums receding a bit from brushing too hard, as well as when I whiten my teeth.  The taste is pretty good, and it definitely helps with the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by my hygienist, and it honestly does as it promises. My teeth are much happier now, I can turn my electric toothbrush up to the highest setting with no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for years as per my dentist.  It is a great product!  I recommend it for people who have sensitive teeth like me!  It arrived on time with my other items from Amazon subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Doing a 30-day challenge to see how white my teeth will be.</li>
            <li> Feel better than other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works exactly as described and has reduced my sensitivity.  I love buying this product in bulk from Amazon.  It&#x27;s cheaper than the local store.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush and comes packaged with a very good tootpaste.  A fine combination.  I would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> So I tried this because my dentist told me I was either &#x27;grinding&#x27; or eating foods that were wearing my enamel down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t believe I was grinding (and still don&#x27;t) but I have been known to eat spicier foods so I thought i&#x27;d give this a try to help strengthen my enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well what I found was that it made my gums bleed. I floss every other day or so and never had my gums bleed but using this toothpaste made it happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After consulting my dentist, they suggested i stop the toothpaste and I did and the bleeding stopped.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste.  It has a great mint taste.  It cleans well.  It reduces sensitivity.  Best of all, it rinses easily, so it is easy to keep an electric tooth brush clean.  Older Sensodyne varieties did not rinse so easily.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Ok, no sensitivity problems, but...  Was using it for 6-7 month straight, but noticed that it does not clean the teeth well.  Everything is good - the smell, the taste, it fixes sensitivity, but again, does not clean. Changed to Aquafresh, but will have this one at home anyway just to use it from time to time to manage sensitivity. Actually, Aquafresh Extreme Clean is very good, does not irritate the inside of the mouth, very gentle, and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. It make my teeth stronger and prevent acid burn from coffee.  My dentist can&#x27;t tell I drink coffee</li>
            <li> my favorite toothpaste. I have sensitive teeth and a tube of these remedies the issue immediately. These are basically all I use anymore.</li>
            <li> Tastes good, does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate, and protects teeth &#x3D; winning combination!</li>
            <li> This handle all my brushing problems in one. It takes away the sensivity, whitens my teeth and helps build my enamel!</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. My husband is allergic to sodium lauryl sulfate which is in most toothpastes. Not this one!! Great toothpastes. Safe for sensitive teeth. Easy stand up tube. Great buy at good price.</li>
            <li> A GOOD TOOTH PASTE, EQUAL TO BOTH CREST AND COLGATE TOTAL</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Not sure. It&#x27;s sensodyne, for sensitive tooth. Probably I should&#x27;ve bought what&#x27;s the best they do, not the side product.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.  You can brush and brush without getting any sensitivity.  My front teeth used to be kind of brittle (and I grind my teeth in my sleep sometimes), but I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and haven&#x27;t had any chips.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling very clean and fresh. A bit bitter. Not bad, but some may not like the taste. Too expensive from this vendor. I only ordered it because there is nowhere to buy it where I am.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say. I would try it in the store first and see if you like it. I have sensitive teeth and have used some version of Sensodyne for years. Not sure if it helps or not, but I keep using it. I like the taste of this and how it feels in my teeth. ANd the container is pretty good for getting most of it out of the tube instead of having to leave a bunch inside and waste it</li>
            <li> Which ingredient is the one that is helping protect your teeth against the acid erosion? Please don&#x27;t spoil the surprise by going to the Sensodyne website just yet!  I am a retired chemist with too much time on my hands, and I just had to know the answer to this question. OK, the information on the box of this toothpaste states that it &amp;#34;strengthens and re-hardens enamel to help protect against the effects of acid erosion&amp;#34; from liquids such as soda and wine, and acidic foods like tomatoes. Let&#x27;s start with the inactive ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INACTIVE INGREDIENTS: SORBITOL? no, this is a  sugar substitute.  HYDRATED SILICA? no, this is an abrasive which helps remove plaque and stains. GLYCERINE? no, this is a humectant that keeps things moist. PEG-8? No, a thickener.  COCAMIDOROPYL BETAINE? no, this is a foam booster and emulsifier. FLAVOR? I doubt it. TITANIUM DIOXIDE? no, this is a white pigment. XANTHAN GUM? thickening agent. SODIUM SACCHARIN? no, another sugar substitute, that I didn&#x27;t think was being used these days. SODIUM HYDROXIDE? whitener. Well, the ingredient is not here, must be one of the &amp;#34;active ingredients&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTIVE INGREDIENTS: POTASSIIUM NITRATE? The box specifically says this is for hypersensitivity. By the way, this chemical is also used in food preservation, fertilizers, rocket propellants, and  gun powder.  The major source in nature is bat guano found in caves. Hey, that&#x27;s a nice little factoid! (If you&#x27;re ever on Jeopardy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that leaves us with the only other  ingredient: FLOURIDE, the same fluoride that is found in almost every toothpaste and in just about the same amount. The box states this is for anti-cavity protection.  SO......where is the ingredient that helps protect against acid erosion???? Turns out it IS the fluoride! I had to go to the website to find this out. Yes, the detail in the FAQ section states: &amp;#34;The sodium fluoride ion helps reverse the process (of acid erosion) by &amp;#34;re-mineralizing&amp;#34; the tooth enamel which has been previously damaged&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;It re-hardens softened enamel by restoring lost minerals&amp;#34;,  IT DOES NOT PHYSICALLY REPAIR LOST ENAMEL&amp;#34;.  Does this sound contradictory to you? It does to me. It &amp;#34;restores the minerals&amp;#34; but does not &amp;#34;repair the lost enamel&amp;#34;. HUH?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS FOR USE: The suggested method of use is equally  strange, although perhaps logical. It suggests that we DO NOT brush immediately after eating or drinking acidic foods because that is when the teeth are softest. We are told to wait at least an hour, or better yet, brush BEFORE meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION This has been fun (for me at least), and I will continue to use Sensodyne brand toothpaste, even knowing that it contains no special, secret ingredient that will magically restore my enamel to the condition it was in my youth. I guess it never did say that anyway. It is enough that this is very effective in diminishing the sensitivity I have, which of course is due to the acid erosion over the years. If it also &amp;#34;gently whitens&amp;#34; my teeth, that will be a plus.alizing&amp;#34; the tooth enamel which has been previously damaged&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;It re-hardens softened enamel by restoring lost minerals&amp;#34;,  IT DOES NOT PHYSICALLY REPAIR LOST ENAMEL&amp;#34;.

            <li> Exactly as described! Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using ProNamel toothpaste for over a year on the recommendation from my dentist. The toothpaste works great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste seemed to cause me to have increased sensitivity, and also increased referred pain when I did have a bad tooth that made it very difficult to distinguish which tooth was actually the bad one, and led to an unnecessary root canal on the wrong tooth.  Then that tooth, became extremely sensitive to hot, cold, and the toothpaste.  Every time I touched that tooth directly with the toothpaste, I felt immediate, extreme, excruciating pain!  But I still did guess that the toothpaste was actually the cause of the whole problem.  But when I finished to tube, I decided to go back to my old toothpase, and guess what, within two days my pain and sensitivity was greatly reduced!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:974f6c3b3dec96d6f9e227782e4dca0f]] Sensodyne is a great product if you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I have below the mechanism behind it if you are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product does mention \\&quot;gentle whitening\\&quot;, my teeth are no different as far as a brighter shade of white. It&#x27;s possible maybe it&#x27;s because all other toothpastes do the same amount of whitening and I&#x27;m at a plateau point for whitening. However, you most likely aren&#x27;t buying this product for this feature. You are likely buying it because you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package (i.e. the tube) is better than other tubes as it seems you can get most of the product out. Tooth paste tubes are notorious for leaving 10-20% of the product in there that you can&#x27;t get out (thereby wasting it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product has two main ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Fluoride&lt;br /&gt;  - This works by exchanging the hydroxyl groups on the surface of your teeth for fluorine.&lt;br /&gt;  - What this does is it increases the resistance of the the teeth to acid, thereby strengthening your teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potassium Nitrate&lt;br /&gt;  - Depolarizes the nerve, basically anesthetizing the tooth so it doesn&#x27;t hurt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this has helped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products have ingredients such as:&lt;br /&gt;  - Strontium (plus anion) and other ingredients&lt;br /&gt;  - This works by essentially plugging little pores in your teeth so the cold water that normally bothers you, can&#x27;t get in to your nerve</li>
            <li> Love this product will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste.  Not a bad price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and have never been disappointed.  The product is more expensive than regular toothpaste but ever since i started using it, my teeth have not been sensitive.</li>
            <li> My teeth always get sensitive in the winter time and I am forced to brush with warm water. Switching to this took care of the problem.</li>
            <li> I had been using the same brand of toothpaste for years when my dentist gave me a sample of this Pronamel.  I tried it and immediately noticed how much cleaner my mouth felt after brushing.  It definately helps with sensitivity too.  I think I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have the chalky, flouride-ish taste. It is also my destist&#x27;s preference and recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My BF is really picky about toothpaste as far as taste and texture, but he likes this one. Also, for a 3-pack, the price is a steal!</li>
            <li> this is like the 3rd time that we have purchased this and it works just as well as the first</li>
            <li> A little expensive - no doubt.  But it definitely feels like my teeth are stronger since we started using this toothpaste about 2 years ago.  I also make sure to get enough vitamins D, A, and K, and my teeth have never been in better shape.  Of course, I am not a scientist - just reporting on my own results.  But with Subscribe &amp; Save, it&#x27;s definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Wish it did more whitening, but my sensitive teeth are pain free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is any better toothpaste if you have sensitive teeth. Good taste and effective leaning.  Foamy to get between teeth,</li>
            <li> I like it. My family all love it as well.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day since 2012.  No problems at the dentist.  The price has ranged from 14 to 18 dollars for a 3-pack of 4-oz tubes.  I like that the top of the cap is flat so I can stand it vertically, allowing the toothpaste to stay near the opening (don&#x27;t have to work hard to get most of it out).</li>
            <li> Gets rid of my tooth sensitivity, everytime I brush my teeth.  Sensitivity always comes back when i switch to another brand so i know it works.</li>
            <li> Good product but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size I purchased and thought I was getting more ounces for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Fairly strong flavor that I had to get used to...</li>
            <li> Dentist noticed the improvement after just 3 months of use!</li>
            <li> love to bulk order this</li>
            <li> This is the toothpaste my dentist recommends for my sensitive teeth. I used to have to avoid ice all together but by using this toothpaste I can have drinks with ice again.</li>
            <li> Sensitive teeth and issues with gumlines. I basically can&#x27;t use anything but this product. I&#x27;m very happy with it and my teeth are clean of course :-)</li>
            <li> These were too harsh on my teeth and hurt my gums. Stuck with Colgate Sensitive which I find better for me.</li>
            <li> This tooth pase is the best. The only problem is that it is so expensive. I would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I have had extremely sensitive teeth my entire life and hate it. I can barely drink water with ice in it and have never been able to truly enjoy eating ice cream because it hurts so bad. Chewing on ice is definitely out of the option as it shoots chills of pain throughout my body. What I am trying to say is that my teeth are extremely sensitive. I have heard about Sensodyne for years but didn&#x27;t think it would actually work because of my skeptical personality. Well, to my pleasant surprise, Sensodyne definitely works. I can now drink ice cold water and can even enjoy ice cream or frozen yogurt. It does take a couple of weeks to truly kick it but consistent use will definitely take away some sensitivity. I can&#x27;t really speak for the whitening aspect but that is because I didn&#x27;t really buy it for that purpose. If you are looking to reduce teeth sensitivity, I definitely recommend Sensodyne!</li>
            <li> Ever since I used this stuff, my no-enamel pains disappear. It is as if I have enamel. Dentist Recommended, Patient Approved.</li>
            <li> I adore this tooth paste. I have bad teeth, with some damaged areas, and extreme sugar and temperature sensitivity.  This never irritates my teeth, and does a great job keeping them feeling clean throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mild flavor, very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foams less than most name-brand tooth pastes, but still froths more than enough for comfortable and effective brushing</li>
            <li> Great Toothpaste. Good flavor, seems to get the job done.  Not sure if the enamel stuff really does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I used to have super sensitive teeth, but after using this product I rarely have sensitive teeth anymore.  I also use MI Paste on occasion if I know I&#x27;m going to the dentist or I notice a particular sensitivity, but this tooth paste makes a HUGE difference in my life.  My dentist approves of using it all the time.  I like that it actually promotes healthier teeth by hardening the enamel.  This has definitely happened for me.  I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM SENSODYNE, BUT IT IS CHEAPER HERE THAN THE STORES, MUCH CHEAPER SO I RATHER GET IT FROM HERE.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell/taste, but I like that it&#x27;s for sensitive teeth and specifically focuses on enamel protection.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste! Not too minty and doesn&#x27;t tear my mouth apart. I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for at least two years.</li>
            <li> It is good quality and a decent price... but so is more toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I loved it! My teeth felt super clean and my breath was fresh for hours. I really felt like I deep cleaned my mouth.</li>
            <li> Hope it works, but why do toothpastes always taste 1. Sweet and 2. Minty? Who needs a mouth-searingly refreshing blast of peppermint at night before bed. Who I ask you?!? This si not brain surgery people. What about cinnamon... or blackberry? Let&#x27;s just chill (ahem) on the mints eh?</li>
            <li> Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tbone</li>
            <li> Works great for my sensitive teeth I have an issue where one tooth is very sensitive if I drink any beverage with sugar using this toothpaste solves the issue very happy that the discomfort goes away with this product. I will continue to buy this to have a peace of mind.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with some of my teeth hurting and my dentist suggested using this toothpaste.  I use it every night and don&#x27;t rinse after brushing with it and the problems I have been having have gone away.  In the morning I just use regular toothpaste and rinse so I don&#x27;t have to drink mint tooth paste and coffee (not a good combo!).</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> My teeth are always very sensitive, so my dentist recommended Sensodyne. Now I&#x27;m able to eat and drink cold things without the pain I used to get.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Good value.</li>
            <li> good product. been using it for years</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended by my dentist for thin enamel and it&#x27;s been really great. My teeth are sensitive and after using this I very rarely feel the same sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that this sounds sensationalized, and may be psychosomatic - but it&#x27;s the truth as I see it: five stars. ;)</li>
            <li> Very good for its price. I love it because I feel it is not hard on teeth.I really find it very useful and good.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works well and I have noticed a difference in my teeth looking whiter.</li>
            <li> My breath has begun to smell alot.  My teeth have become alot cleaner as well.  I would reccomend this product to anyone that has trouble with senistive teeth or that have trouble  with bad breath</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to experience sensitivity. After using strips I bought through my dentist I noticed that my teeth would be more sensitive but all that went away over time. Then I looked extremely close in the mirror and n</li>
            <li> Even though its more expensive than Crest, I get more than what I pay for. Clean feeling? Check. Good breath? Check. Less sensitivity? Double check. That my dentist recommends it, without having samples and a sales rep touting how good it is? I don&#x27;t even have to say how awesome that is.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth with this stuff. It helps with sensitivity and tastes good. Seems to work well!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Smooth teeth, comfortable mouth.  I dislike using other toothpaste for any length of time, and like to have my teeth remineralized.</li>
            <li> This may seem pricey, but your pain goes away and your teeth feel clean and fresh for 24 hrs. I won&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this review if premature, but I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about two weeks now and I&#x27;m not noticing any decrease in sensitivity to cold food or drink.</li>
            <li> My mom-in-law has very sensitive gums and teeth, and this is the only brand of toothpaste that she can use without any discomfort. Additionally, I like the fact that it is not too minty, and the packing is very convenient, especially as you get to the end of the tube.</li>
            <li> fast delivery  &amp; good Deal, Thanks</li>
            <li> Loved it and met all my expectations</li>
            <li> i love limes and orange juice food that is pretty much acidic but unfortunately I had worn my enamel very thin so I was recommended by my dentist to try this tooth paste. Amazing!! Not only have my teeth sensitivity has improved but I actually slowed down eating as much acidic food as I used too AND my teeth are healthier. :-)</li>
            <li> Very economical to purchase the 3-pack as a subscription (every 3 months or so) from Amazon if you need this toothpaste. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For some reason I love chewing on ice cubes and my teeth would sometimes hurt when doing that, but now I can chew on all the ice cubes I want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I change toothpaste every 3 months and brush my teeth at least three times a day and this has helped a little. The main reason I got it is because my fiance is always saying her teeth hurt when she drinks something really hot or really cold, so it has actually helped me mentally a lot because now I don&#x27;t have to hear her complain anymore which is a plus! I&#x27;m not going to lie my teeth are pretty white and clean so the whitening hasn&#x27;t really done anything for me. The scent isn&#x27;t to strong which is my opinion kind of sucks but it works.</li>
            <li> I will only use this brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It truly was a deal......How do I get more?</li>
            <li> Teeth are whiter and my sensitivity is gone. My dentist recommended this tooth paste after radiation dry mouth caused a lot of problems with my teeth including sensitive teeth, bad breathe and an increase in developing cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 3 months later, all the problems were gone and I got an unexpected bonus. My teeth were noticeably whiter. Of course, the medical issues were considerably more important than the cosmetic elements. Great toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Cant believe what a difference this toothpaste made with my teeth and mouth. Always feel super clean after every use. Teeth feel stronger too</li>
            <li> I have some sensitivity to cold, icy drinks. This toothpaste has improved level of sensitivity. I&#x27;m not sure regarding how cost effective it is to buy online vs store.</li>
            <li> i have supper sensative teeth. and i have tried several brands of tooth paste. sensodyne is the one that cosistently works the best for me no more cold and heat sensativity and no chalky taste</li>
            <li> Ever since my dentist recommended this product, I never switched to any other kind.  Costly, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and taste of this toothpaste. It seems to clean very well and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and minty. I will keep buying this toothpaste. I found my favorite!!!</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference in my teeth and my heat/cold sensitivity after 6 months. Will not go back to Colgate or Crest.</li>
            <li> Tastes good keeps the teeth safe, and whiteness is better.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste seems to whiten my teeth with repeated continuous use and it makes my mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sensodyne for a while, so I just decided to try out the Pronamel line.  I can&#x27;t really notice a difference between this and the original Sensodyne.  I&#x27;m just going to switch back to the original since it is cheaper by volume.</li>
            <li> This works great for sensitivity, whitening, and cleaning.  I hate the cap design, however.  You have to open with two hands- there is no way around it.  The locking cap forces you to have to close it tight...with two hands.  I have two hands, but need both when in a hurry.  This is the 21st century already.  (and what is an alpine breeze??)</li>
            <li> This product really was recommended by my dentist!  It seems to be &#x27;doing a great job!&#x27;  And, I don&#x27;t find that it leaves my mouth feeling like I have just swallowed a bunch of medicine!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommend to use this Toothpaste because my Gum desise ,did not find it in CVS/Rite Aid...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it will deliver...</li>
            <li> The product protects my tooth enamel. It&#x27;s not like the old formula that caused taste changes.</li>
            <li> Does the job on all sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic for tender teeth and aphthous ulcers!  I have used it for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth/gums.  This toothpaste is perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t numb your teeth or anything, but it does little to irritate them.  I recommend this toothpaste with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> subscribe and save really spoils me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this toothpaste is great for sensitive teeth, and it shows up at my door automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is very mild and not that refreshing. Good for brushing before you go to bed.</li>
            <li> THANKS! Great ebayer:-)</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste. Usually expensive but this was a good deal on three.</li>
            <li> The product was great but I believe Sensodyne is not very good.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and have found that using Sensodyne brand paste seems to keep my teeth happy.  That said, I was a bit surprised at how smooth this paste feels.  I suppose that reduces the abrasiveness and protects teeth.  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied, but am just used to the grittier stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Details: I use a Sonicare toothbrush with this paste.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste, gives me that clean feeling I want without an overpowering flavor. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste I use now, I have sensitivity from time to time and this keeps it undercontrol</li>
            <li> There is nothing on the market hat compares to this, it&#x27;s worth the extra money. I don&#x27;t want to get too technical but just compare the ingredients to other products on the market...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it will actually whiten your teeth it will not happen over night, though. After about 3 weeks I started to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I used the Arm&amp;Hammer paste previously however I was told by my dentist that it was too harsh on my teeth. This paste is just as effective, tastes great and leaves me confident with its results.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended to me by my dentist several years ago, and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. It helps to strengthen your teeth, and this new version even adds a gentle whitening agent to make your teeth look even better. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> As a canned response to a requested review, I state this:&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;br /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc&lt;br /&gt;the only way I would give a bad review is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product it works very good</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. I have very sensitive teeth. My dentist recommends it too.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended to my husband because of tooth sensitivity.  I started using it, too, and it has completely cleared up my tooth sensitivity.  The tube size seems a little small, and we were always running out.  I now receive it on Subscribe &amp; Save so we never run out.  It has a great taste and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use I do feel that the sensitivity got better and I think the teeth are whiter too.&lt;br /&gt;Who would of though that a mainstream product would be this good? Well, it is...</li>
            <li> sensodyne does reduce tooth sensitivity.  If you put a dab on an especially sensitive spot, after brushing, and leave it there, just on the tender spot, it calms it down in a day or two. Yes, don&#x27;t rinse it out, and don&#x27;t worry, you won&#x27;t taste it all day, it will be gone in half an hour or so.    All of the other sensitive-tooth toothpastes work too, they all contain the same stuff -- strontium chloride. So I choose on other features, like how it tastes and how ugly the package is (one looks at it twice a day!), whether the package works.    I don&#x27;t much like the fancy new tops.  They allow toothpaste to get between the top and tube, and get goopy and messy.  I imagine there is someone at Glaxo/Sensodyne who feels terribly clever over these tops, and is unaware that some longtime customers find them annoying. I wonder if they read Amazon reviews. Just go back to the plain tube top. I won&#x27;t buy this package again.    Update, Jan 2015:  They got rid of the goofy top, and are back to a sensible old design.  Whew. Now they get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, but I purchased this toothpaste because I started wearing Invisalign and, as a result, began brushing my teeth far more often than I used to. My concern was that brushing my teeth 4-5 times a day (any time I ate or drank something other than water) would cause enamel erosion, so I wanted to use something a little more gentle than my old standby (Colgate Total).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff definitely does the trick. It cleans my teeth gently and effectively, and I&#x27;m definitely starting to see some whitening effects. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I docked it one star is because this toothpaste really doesn&#x27;t taste great. It&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s certainly not as pleasant as your standard toothpaste (Crest, Colgate, Aquafresh, etc.). Still, it works very well, so I&#x27;ll be sticking to Pronamel for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I did a pretty bad job brushing my teeth on a regular basis. Because of that, I developed a pretty high sensitivity to crunchy things, cold things, and hot things. I started using Sensodyne toothpaste about 10 years ago, and it has made a massive difference in my life. How do I know if I have been using it for the last 10 years? Recently, my wife accidentally purchased a different kind of toothpaste, and so I decided to use that up before switching back to Sensodyne. I figured, there can&#x27;t be that much of a difference, right? Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kind she bought was even for &#x27;sensitive teeth&#x27;. After 2 weeks of using that product, I went to the Amazon and immediately got a Subscribe and Save shipment to my door. It took three days for Sensodsyne to undo whatever it is the other toothpaste did to my teeth, but now my teeth are back to feeling good again, and I cannot believe the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive teeth, I firmly believe that this is the best toothpaste for. I firmly recommend this toothpaste, and I will never use another kind, ever again.</li>
            <li> I like that my teeth feel stronger and the gentle whitening is a plus that I&#x27;ve noticed as well.  Sensodyne is not as harsh as many other toothpastes and the taste is not bad in my opinion👍</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, and drink a lot soda.  This toothpaste helps to remove any of the negative effects that soda and juice cause.  It doesn&#x27;t have a bad flavor, and I like the whitening aspect of the product as well.</li>
            <li> not as viscous/thick as regular toothpaste. the manufacturer said that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s made. good price.</li>
            <li> I had sensitive teeth before I used this toothpaste, it really helped a lot</li>
            <li> For me, I have always had very sensitive teeth to hot and cold and just fussy and sensitive teeth altogether. Always had to watch what I ate and drank as I had to baby my fussy teeth! So I began using the original Sesodyne toothpaste and found the taste pretty bad, but stayed with it. Then the Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste came out and this is just what I was looking for. The first thing I noticed is that the taste is medicinal or pretty bad, however, the results are truly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take about 2 weeks or so to see and FEEL results, but it is so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this is you have sensitive teeth and want to protect the enamel on your teeth (also it does whiten some after a while).</li>
            <li> This is good toothpaste and no sodium laural sulfate in it.  My dentist recommended it several years ago and if I use anything else, with SLR&#x27;s in it, my mouth will get sores.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this from a dentist&#x27;s sample. I was skeptical because of the increased cost compared to regular Sensodyne. However, I was wrong. This is better tasting, smoother, and you need to use much less so it actually saves money.</li>
            <li> I want to be able to use other toothpastes but this is the only brand that actually helps our teeth sensitivity.  So expensive everywhere but I have to suck it up and buy it.  Helps that I&#x27;m buying it in mini-bulk and on subscription to save a teeny bit.</li>
            <li> I developed sensitive teeth as I have gotten older (boo hiss)  I have found this toothpaste very helpful to reduce the sensitivity in my teeth.  The taste is not very minty but is pleasant enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t use anything else anymore. To put things into perspective, this product is just as reliable at saving your teeth from the cold as a condom is as effective at preventing child birth. nuff said...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years in one form or another. This one has a mild refreshing taste. It also helps to some degree with sensitive teeth. One of their other flavors, I think mint or something, leaves a numbing sensation in the mouth for maybe 15 minutes after use that I didn&#x27;t like. Another person also had the same experience.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with sensitive teeth in my life. I started using this toothpaste about a year ago to fight coffee stains and acid erosion. I only have one or two cups of coffee a day and I never drink soda or juice (just water) but my teeth were getting dull. Anyway, I started noticing the past few weeks that my teeth are getting transparent all the way from the tips to halfway down the tooth. So transparent that when I looked closely in the mirror this morning they appeared blue! I know that can happen with over-bleaching but I have not bleached them, I&#x27;ve only used this product which I thought was \\&quot;gentle.\\&quot; Within the last couple days all of my front teeth have become EXTREMELY sensitive! Cold is a bit worse than heat, but they&#x27;re also just sore all the time for no reason at all. I have always had very healthy teeth! Haven&#x27;t even had a cavity since I was a kid (almost 33 years old). I&#x27;m going to discontinue using this product and make a dentist appointment immediately.</li>
            <li> I have been more sensitive since using this paste, it makes your breath worse, and it makes funny noises when brushing.</li>
            <li> Purchased on dentist recommendation after my husbands root canal and discovery of sensitive teeth. Found no difference from other other, non sensitive, toothpaste. Didn&#x27;t seem to clean very well, maybe because of the gentle whitening part. No scrubbies in it, very smooth texture. For the price I can buy a different brand.  Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, I highly recommend this product.  It also has a nice minty flavor which I prefer to the regular Synsodyne flavor.</li>
            <li> My teeth used to always hurt.  Now they don&#x27;t.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dentist to maintain caps or crowns.  I works to keep your teeth white along with the Listerine Whitening rinse.  Also it does not scratch your caps or crowns like regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> best toothpaste in my opinion</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste for sensitive teeth I know it helps me a lot.</li>
            <li> Switched to this after reading that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in regular toothpaste may contribute to painful, cracked corners of the mouth.... have not had a single issue since!!  I will never go back to regular toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste...my hubby has very sensitive teeth and this helps him so much.</li>
            <li> sooooo... had my teeth filled and they hurt super bad. Was told by dentist to use this to make feel better. Yeah right dentist I upsell for a living, no thanks. Two weeks of pain later I figured I&#x27;d try anything. Two days later the pain is gone. Subscribe and save ever since.</li>
            <li> Good product and does exactly what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed anything major difference with the color of my teeth.  Most of the Sensodynes seem to help with my teeth sensitivity but personally I&#x27;m not big on this taste and I don&#x27;t think the whitening is really doing anything.</li>
            <li> It is very good product.  Its price is lower than target. After using it for 3 weeks, I find out I like it.</li>
            <li> Great fast delivery, have been using this for the last few years it is a good product.</li>
            <li> In using this toothpaste my sensitivity has diminished! I can now drink cold liquids without a problem. For two weeks I tried a different toothpaste. The pain to drink cold liquids came back. I went right back on Sensodyne and problem resolved! I bought the three pack so I can put one at work and one in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve got two sufferers of painful canker sores in the family, and the cause of those sores appears to be sodium lauryl sulfate, a preservative in most toothpaste. Trust me, as long as they don&#x27;t use toothpaste with SLS, they don&#x27;t get the sores, but the minute they do, they&#x27;re going to be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste does not contain SLS. We started buying it after Rembrandt stopped making their SLS-free version. Unfortunately, according to our users, this toothpaste does not taste good and they miss their Rembrandt. So, what can I say? Three stars for doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, but not five since it tastes like crap.</li>
            <li> I began using this toothpaste after I felt like the Colgate Sensitive was doing it&#x27;s job. I was a bit hesitant to try this toothpaste, simply because it was more expensive than the Colgate Sensitive and am I on a tight budget. However, I cannot be more happy that I chose to spend that extra couple of dollars. I have been using this toothpaste for about one month and can tell a difference in the sensitivity of my teeth...something I was unable to do with the Colgate Sensitive (even after using it for years!). This toothpaste glides on smoothly to my toothbrush and foams up nicely (I HAAAATE when my toothpaste does not &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; up...if that is the right word for it). It has a nice minty taste, though not overwhelming. I will continue to use this toothpaste as long as it keeps working for me and helps keep my sensitivity down!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Works better than any other sensitive toothpaste I have ever tried&lt;br /&gt;2. Minty fresh, although not overwhelmingly so&lt;br /&gt;3. Has a nice &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; to it when you use it&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Expensive&lt;br /&gt;2. Only comes in a 4oz tube, versus the 6oz tubes other toothpaste&#x27;s come it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see the whitening. But feels good because of the taste.</li>
            <li> Works great for sensitivity and tastes pretty good!</li>
            <li> I swear by this toothpaste. It&#x27;s the only brand that I use and my sensitivity has disappeared. I will definitely keep using this product FOREVER!!! If you have sensitive teeth, give this brand a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK toothpaste, but it foams way too much and makes me gag every time. I am going back to regular sensodyne with less foam.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste I will ever use for the rest of my life.  I used to have terrible canker sores that would pop up in my mouth, and they were PAINFUL.  One time I had 3 at once!  I scoured the internet for solutions, and found out that &amp;#34;sodium lauryl sulfate&amp;#34; is a chemical in many common toothpastes (like crest of colgate, etc) is a potential cause of canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste does NOT have sodium lauryl sulfate, and once I started using it my canker sores recurrence decreased DRAMATICALLY.  I get at most 2-3 a year now (mostly at times when I&#x27;m stressed), when typically I would get 2-3 a month, each time lasting a week or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using a different, more common toothpaste like Colgate once when I was visiting family and forgot my toothpaste, and BOOM a week later I got canker sores.  This toothpaste is a lifesaver for me!</li>
            <li> Not gentle at all. My dentist recommended sensodyne so got the gentle whitening one. Been using for 5days and have blisters all over gums and my gums are shedding. My teeth are now so sensitive I cant even drink tap water even with a straw without it hurting!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpast and purchasing it online is worth it with the price! It&#x27;s a better value to buy online than in the store.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste after my teeth became sensitive to cold chocolate. Within about 2  weeks after using I felt improvement when eating chocolate. Now about 6 or so months later i do not have sensitive teeth. This is the only toothpaste I use and I love it.</li>
            <li> tates good, hope it works</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth that I have a hard time talking if I fail to use Sensodyne for a few days.  This particular product also addresses the enamel erosion. I could actually see my enamel of the teeth improving after continued use.</li>
            <li> Best for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have to brush my teeth frequently - and - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s hype or real - but I feel like this toothpaste is actually strengthening rather than weaking my teeth when I brush.</li>
            <li> Tastes fine, works great and my teeth are not aching. I use an Oral B electronic brush with sensitive head and this toothpaste. After many many many years of dental work I think I have found the toothpaste that helps keep sensitivity down after dental work and for the rest of the time when that isn&#x27;t a concern. Its really a good price with free shipping using Prime. I don&#x27;t even bother looking for it at local stores anymore. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i like this toothpaste.. no sls... no sls.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend non SLS toothpaste to anyone that gets cancer sores.</li>
            <li> I was using some whitening strips and my teeth started to become more sensitive to hot and cold, this toothpaste reversed that.</li>
            <li> Excellent, simple as that. I eat a lot of fruits, I don&#x27;t drink, I don&#x27;t smoke &amp; I am 23 years old. I like to eat a lot of fruits, I have very white teeth &amp; I had a lot of cavities when I was younger. I believe this toothpaste is the best one on the market. Its expensive, I can vouch for that. Would you rather go to a dentist office and spend $200 per cavity or whatever it costs ? Instead, you can prevent these cavities! Not to mention this toothpaste whites your teeth. This toothpaste also prevents tooth sensation. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for 2 months. Think of this way, its like cleaning your teeth vitamins. Thats how I look at it. Before I bought this toothpaste..I have done a lot of research on the best toothpaste on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also send this toothpaste to my grandparents in Russia. My grandparents do not visit the dentist ever. My grandpa said that this toothpaste has been whitening his teeth for the past few months and he has less tooth sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple review from a broke Russian college student.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has been used for a couple of years for my mistreated teeth, it helps with the little aches and pains.</li>
            <li> Started using the Sensodyne, and within a week, I had less sensitivity in my teeth, which was great!!! I defenately recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Years ago I would experience awful pain in my back teeth after eating chocolate bars, drinking cold water, breathing cold air, eating candy with sugar in it, etc. Now it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth. Teeth hurt a lot with cold and hot items. Used this product and that problem went away. I can enjoy ice cream and cold fruits without pain.</li>
            <li> I love pronamel- used for years.  No complaints ; )</li>
            <li> This is actually one toothpaste that did help the pain in my teeth. I tried several and this was the best of all. And theres a few choices in  Pro Enamel you can pick from too</li>
            <li> Use this everyday for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> been ordering via amazon for yrs, one of my favorite toothpaste, the moment i get off sensodyne, my sensitivities will come back, that&#x27;s why this is on s&amp;s now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pronamel for a few years now, after it was recommended to me by my dentist.  A few of my teeth were sensitive to temperature and sweets--but no more!  I use it every day.  No weird taste or aftertaste.  It&#x27;s hard to find in local drugstores, so I&#x27;m glad that Amazon will send it to my door at a good price.</li>
            <li> I think this flavor is great, not sure what some of the other reviewers are talking about on &#x27;bad taste&#x27;.  I switched from crest and find it comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has helped my acid reflux - turns out my body hates sodium laurel sulfate for some reason.  I also switched to a shampoo without this and it has helped as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should try it :)</li>
            <li> works as advertised and tastes great, priced right and was give to me at my last dentist visit as a sample</li>
            <li> Love the flavor of the Alpine Breeze.  This works great on my sensitive teeth.  The whole family is using this product.  This is one of the best toothpaste I have ever purchased.  Thanks.  Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Yes!!! great toothpaste... I want no other :)  Cleans my teeth well, and helping their whiteness!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pronamel for a long time, and Sensodyne for an even longer time.  I was pretty much ordered by my dentist to use it because I have extremely sensitive teeth (can&#x27;t even eat ice cream without it hurting).  A couple of years after that I started getting terrible cavities and no one could figure out why.  It turned out to be from all the bread I ate (who would have thought), and I just had awful enamel to begin with.  So they gave me this toothpaste to use.  I also started using Listerine enamel restoring mouthwash.  Between the two of them I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since.  About a year ago I became interested in whitening my teeth.  I started off by using Crest Whitestrips.  These worked great, but played havoc with my teeth.  They became super sensitive again and I worried that I would get more cavities.  So, I looked into other alternatives.  I now use this in combination with whitening enamel restoring mouthwash and I&#x27;m thrilled about the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, there is one major downside.  It tastes terrible.  It&#x27;s not something that you gag from, but it&#x27;s also not something that I would consider pleasant.  If they fixed that it would be an easy 5 stars.  And, while this might seem like a huge problem, keep in mind that I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars despite the taste.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks. It caused my tongue to swell and eventually turned into welts that wouldn&#x27;t go away. Eating anything spicy was miserable.  I didn&#x27;t put 2 and 2 together for awhile but once I stopped using it the problem went away.  There must be something in this product that causes a reaction.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had this problem with a toothpaste before.</li>
            <li> I find Sensodyne to be better than the other toothpastes for sensitive teeth.  It does what it is supposed to do, and has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I have very sensitive teeth and this works wonders. without it, I cant drink cold drinks without a straw, because the pain on my front teeth is too great. My teeth feel very clean with a lot less pain.</li>
            <li> Both of my daughters have sensitive teeth because of their braces. This toothpaste has helped them. I like the price of ordering online.</li>
            <li> So keep your teeth white and that enamel healthy with this toothpaste. Also as an added benefit it helps with sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> I have terribly sensitive teeth - it&#x27;s so bad I can&#x27;t eat very hot or very cold foods without agony.  This doesn&#x27;t solve that.  However, it does make it so that when I eat them anyway, the pain is bearable.  No other product (wash or toothpaste) has done that for me.  The taste is pleasant and i like the stand up top.  This is priced comparably on Amazon to other places I have purchased it and I have purchased nothing else for myself for a few years.  However, for toothpaste, it really is too expensive.  I feel beholden to it since it makes my tooth pain decrease - but I do feel guilty every time I buy it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this toothpaste for a couple years now. We love it. I don&#x27;t know that it really helps whiten your teeth--certainly not like Crest White Strips or anything. But this toothpaste definitely does decrease your teeth&#x27;s sensitivity. I really can&#x27;t believe how much more comfortable my teeth feel since I started using this toothpaste. Overall, we think it&#x27;s a nice tasting, effective product.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne Pronamel does seem to protect my teeth against staining, though I&#x27;ve since heard that a toothpaste I used before I tried this one actually promoted staining. I don&#x27;t know if it works better than less expensive brands. It might. I just don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s a good deal from Amazon though.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth this is the toothpaste you need.Helps to make sensitive teeth less so. The Alpine Breeze flavor is nice and mild.</li>
            <li> it does whiten teeth.. very pleased</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, my dentist recommended this toothpaste, and I have been using it ever since..I like this product</li>
            <li> This is our family choice toothpaste, Helps maintain our oral health. Recommended.</li>
            <li> best toothpaste i have ever used</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste. It gave me the results I was looking for; whiter teeth and healthy gums. I save some money by buying it from Amazon using my subscription discount. This is also a good tasting toothpaste. Give it a try you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all. I like Colgate sensitive better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sensodyne Pronamel for about a year. In that time, I&#x27;ve gotten no cavities. While there have been many years in which I&#x27;ve had no cavities, my dental hygienist has mentioned in a real change for the better in regard to plaque. I&#x27;m not having to have my teeth cleaned as often.  The taste is pleasantly minty without being too strong.</li>
            <li> great toothpaste but a bit expensive for the amt.  I will seek alternatives with the same active ingredients that are less expensive.</li>
            <li> Gentle whitening was a little to gentle for me.  Great product, just not the right flavor as I like a little bit more of a minty blast in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended this one to me. Seems to be working well</li>
            <li> Watered down? Not same thick consistency as a tube I bought from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month.  I drink a lot of hot coffee and tea.  Hoping it will protect my enamel.</li>
            <li> I am one of the worse people about going to the dentist. So, when one of my teeth started being very sensitive I was looking for help! I ordered ProNamel and am here to tell you...it works! I know I will still need to go to the dentist sometime...but I am pain free right now!</li>
            <li> I Loooove dis toothpaste it gets d job done. 4 d price I paid dat wuz a steal 4 3 in a pack.</li>
            <li> As a consistent user of this toothpaste for several years, Sensodyne Pronamel has made it bearable for me to eat/drink hot &amp; cold without nerve pain.  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It has noticeably strengthened my enamel. It has great flavor and I got it for a good price. Recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I have very sensible teeth. I can&#x27;t eat ice-cream without &amp;#34;hurting&amp;#34; myself or use cold water tap when brushing my teeth. There was a kind of toothpaste from my country that helped me a lot, but Sensodyne isn&#x27;t even close. I&#x27;ve purchased another kind of Sensodyne toothpaste after I&#x27;ve used up what I bought this time, and hopefully it will work well.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. It really does help sensitive teeth a lot.  I have whitened my teeth a lot which makes them sensitive. I only use this toothpaste now.  Slight whitening effect - good for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from overly sensitive teeth or necessarily want a whitening product.  However, I do suffer from frequent canker sores.  Some online research led me to believe that choosing a toothpaste without sodium lauryl sulfate (a foaming agent found in toothpaste, soap, body wash, etc.) would help reduce the appearance of canker sores.  Unfortunately, a toothpaste without SLS is tough to find.  Even Tom&#x27;s of Maine &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste contains it.  Sensodyne Pronamel, however, is the first I&#x27;ve found that did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using it, I&#x27;ve experienced a drastic reduction in the number of canker sores that I&#x27;ve had.  I went from having 1 approximately every other month to only having one or two per year.  I can&#x27;t attest to this product&#x27;s effectiveness for reducing sensitivity or whitening, but I can say that it helps in reducing canker sores.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a miracle cure for anyone with sensitive teeth.  It literally only took a few uses for it to completely eliminate the sensitivity that I was having.  I have decent teeth that I take care of pretty well but from time to time they get sensitive to something too cold or perhaps something sweet.  By using this toothpaste I no longer have this problem.  It&#x27;s awesome and I highly recommend it for anyone with similar sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Only toothpaste my dentist recommends. I have been using for 3+ years and my teeth never looked or felt so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really helps with my sensitive teeth as I don&#x27;t see a major difference.  Maybe a 10-20% less sensitivity when it comes to cold food or liquids.  Or maybe it&#x27;s just all in my mind.  Anyhow, not sure if I will continue to purchase this item since it is more expensive than regular toothpaste for nominal (at best) results.</li>
            <li> Used for YEARS and it works</li>
            <li> All flavors of Sensodyne Pronamel are pleasant tasting.  This product protects your teeth from acid erosion, tooth decay and makes your mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothpaste. I feel like I have to put more on my toothbrush than the crest we used to use, but regardless, I am happy with the results. My teeth actually are less sensitive. I also like that the tube stand up on its own due to the base cap. I can&#x27;t say the whitening aspect of it works because I use another whitening product.</li>
            <li> I had a root scaling done by my periodontist,and my teeth became very sensitive to hot/cold. The Pronamel helps, and it tastes good enough. The other brands I&#x27;ve tried tasted terrible.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt.and the price was good.  The toothpaste works as advertised. It has our recommendation.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste have used for years, now on auto delivery, love it.</li>
            <li> Good product but just slightly overpriced. I was gonna have it set with Amazon pantry and sent to me regularly, but the cost just adds up too quickly for me.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth. This is the product for you!!!. I have very sensitive teeth. Many toothpaste that i use will have always hurt teeth Sensodyne Pro does the job right. I am able to brush my teeth without the fear of feeling pain or an uncomfortable feeling. I highly recommend Sesodyne if your teeth is very sensitive to the touch. This product helps alot.</li>
            <li> for my older teeth this toothpaste is worth every penny helps me out for sensitive teeth and hopefully helps me keep my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have had a great deal of dental work in the last couple years: implants and caps, zoom whitening, and bone grafts.  My teeth have become sensitive from all the dental work.  My dentist gave me a prescription crest sensitive toothpaste.  When the prescription ran out, I purchased this product.  I have not had any issues with sensitivity; I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now.  As far as whitening ... i don;t know if i can tell the difference, but every little bit helps.  light mint flavor.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste eliminates my sensitivity to cold when used as directed. You need to use it twice a day and if you do it works great. The ability to purchase at a discount thru Amazon and have it sent regularly is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth paste with no dye. Too tasty for my wife.</li>
            <li> Very great products. Seriously decreased my sensitive feelings.  But may be addict to it.  Now I can&#x27;t use Crest any more.</li>
            <li> a little sharp taste otherwise good</li>
            <li> Very good for cleaning sensitive teeth. i&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> It is a good toothpaste but its a little disappointing that the tubes weren&#x27;t bigger (didn&#x27;t contain more toothpaste basically). Good paste though would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I do  have sensitive teeth and this helps me a lot... no sensitivity when I&#x27;m using it daily.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my sensitive teeth! I&#x27;m wary of most toothpastes and mouthwash products, because my teeth are easily irritated. This one doesn&#x27;t have any type of aftertaste either. Minus one star because the whitening isn&#x27;t as noticeable as with other toothpastes, but I bought it for different reasons anyhow.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  It took me a while to want to spend the extra few dollars to get the Pronamel version, but I&#x27;m really glad I tried it.  Now I get it in bulk and it&#x27;s just as cheap as the original stuff.  I suggest this toothpaste for everyone, not just if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> complained to my dentist about sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;he recommended sensodyne and act total care rinse:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001MS73GS ACT Total Care Rinse, Fresh Mint, 33.8-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no more sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Sensodyne, so I tried a sample for a few weeks.  It worked to lessen sensitivity to cold/hot temps on the teeth and gums, so I decided to make the switch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got sensitive teeth and my dentist recommended I use this toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It really works!</li>
            <li> This is the one toothpaste I can use long term which gives me the most resistance to sensitivity. Ice cream still bothers me but I should not be eating it anyway. I had trouble using the extra-whitening but this stuff is safe to use and cleans very well, too.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is fine. I can&#x27;t really say if does a good or bad job at protecting/restoring enamel. What I do not like is the tube design. When there is less paste in the tube, when you try to squeeze out the paste a big glob of paste flies out, usually not onto the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that this product works!  I am no longer sensitive to ultrasonic cleaning at the dental office and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that got me to this outcome.  I&#x27;m on my second container of this product.  The first container got completely blocked up that it no longer would dispense so I pushed real hard to get it out and then it started oozing out slowly and would not stop.  I left it in the sink overnight and had a big pile of artistic looking toothpaste in my sink in the morning.  I contacted Sensodyne and they immediately sent me another container.  I&#x27;m having the same problems with this one but this time it&#x27;s just oozing out slowly and not getting completely blocked up.  Sometimes I have to vigorously hold the top down for several seconds before anything comes out.  In addition, like other users I have had issues with the product continuing to ooze out after putting the cap back on.  I wish they would just put this in a regular tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another flavor, &amp;#34;mint essence&amp;#34;, for years and it sort of tastes like a vanilla breath mint. This stuff is rancid and tastes like chalk and medicine. The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have SLS that causes ulcers, and has fluoride to prevent cavities (which is good), but the taste is really bad. I wish the amazon price on &amp;#34;mint essence&amp;#34; was still competitive, because this is not a good alternative.</li>
            <li> This really works! After using this religiously for three months, my teeth are now two shades lighter. I&#x27;m not kidding.</li>
            <li> Great product but a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> My teeth have become sensitive over the years, and this toothpaste really helps with that.  It has been my favorite for a long time.</li>
            <li> great product - good price</li>
            <li> great for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tooth paste.</li>
            <li> El producto y el tiempo de entrega cumplio al 100% mi expectativas. sin duda alguna volveria comprar. recomiendo hacer compras con este vendedor.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> Great product.  On subscribe &amp; save the price keeps changing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my standard toothpaste, great to get multiple tube at this good price.</li>
            <li> great for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I have periodontal problems (slight recession of gums) and sensodyne was recommended to me by my dentist. I have a lot less pain in the gums when I use this, and of course, whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> like the way it works</li>
            <li> Love it for the product, not the price.  Should not be so expensive imo. :(</li>
            <li> I think this works well, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the flavor.</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep, but it&#x27;s some pretty good toothpaste. My teeth have gotten whiter from using it.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended.  Teeth feel very clean since started using pronamel.  Helps significantly reduce sensitivity. much better than some of the other sensitive toothpastes on the market.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, but It runs very soon, i use one tube within three weeks, really very fast compared to other toothpastes</li>
            <li> I must say I do like the Senodyne; it&#x27;s the only toothpaste I use because it really helps the sensitive teeth. BUT as for Pronamel . . . I get my teeth worked on at Western Dental College. Last time I was there, while a teacher was checking what the student was do with my teeth, I asked the teacher (a professional dentist, and not 90 years old and out of date) about acid erosion. His answer. &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a non-problem. The acid is neutralized by the alkaline chemistry of your mouth. In the brief time it&#x27;s acidic, there&#x27;s little it can do. If you&#x27;re worried about it, rinse with plain water after the acidic food.&amp;#34; So I won&#x27;t be paying extra for Pronamel.</li>
            <li> It worked as well as always. You can get bigger size from Sam&#x27;s club with a little bit lower unit price.</li>
            <li> have already reviewed this product</li>
            <li> My teeth used to be terribly sensitive to all sorts of things like cold water, my dentist actually suggested I try this brand out. After about 2 days, I don&#x27;t think I was sensitive too anything at all! Also I actually noticed whiter teeth after a while (use an electric toothbrush you can find one on Amazon, it also makes a big difference in terms of whiteness/strengthening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has just been my experience.</li>
            <li> Best sensitive toothpaste. I do two tubes of this then one crest pro health. Then back to sensodyne. My dentist said every two tubes to switch to another brand. I have been able to ear ice cream and drink cold tea for three years now! Worth the few extra bucks vs dollar store crap.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive teeth. My dentist said to try this and I think it really, really works. Try it for a couple months.</li>
            <li> This is good toothpaste for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> No cavities.  I guess that&#x27;s all that needs to be said.</li>
            <li> Most toothpaste has too strong of mint flavor for my taste, I tried the Sensodyne Fresh Breath and it was better but still too strong. After reading the reviews I tried this Alpine Breeze and it has a very mild flavor.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are not sensitive, I just wanted less mint. After four weeks I am noticing some whitening. Overall I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne is a must in our sensitive gum house.  It tastes great and helps with toughen up our sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I would like to write an engaging review of toothpaste, but the prose is simply not in me.  Overall the taste is not overpowering and my teeth feel clean after use.</li>
            <li> I love Sensodyne Pronamel, this is the best product and I will always use this product.  I wish I would have started to use this product years ago!  i recommend everyone to use this product.  Especially coffee and tea lovers!  Got to have this product!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste since I have sensitive teeth, it helps to prevent those painful moments when drinking a cold drink.  Also, it is an awesome thing to be able to purchase it on a subscription so that I get it in advance of when I need it and never have to worry about forgetting it when I go to the store :)</li>
            <li> I like sensitive toothpaste and I like this price. I think the flavor is a bit strong and burny, but it keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Went to my dentist, thought I had a loose filling or a cavity because one of my teeth had been getting progressively more sensitive to cold.  There were no problems with my tooth so my dentist recommended switching to Sensodyne to see if that helped.  After brushing with Sensodyne for about a month I have noticed an improvement in the sensitivity of that one tooth and feel that it will continue to improve if I follow my dentists recommendations.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews on this and had to pit in my two cents. Yes, it helps sensitivity, but it just seems weak when it comes to really feeling like you have a clean mouth. I&#x27;d rather use regular Sensodyne because it does the same thing and leaves me with a cleaner feeling mouth.  I notice no whitening effect either.  This one just isn&#x27;t worth extra money.</li>
            <li> The package came on time.&lt;br /&gt;This tooth paste is good.Feels clean after using it. Also has reduced sensitivity of my teeth since I started using it few months ago.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste, probably a little more than the standard version of Sensodyne.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive by volume but you&#x27;re getting more cleaning power form my experience.  This version doesn&#x27;t have an after taste that stays with you quite as long as the other version either.  The toothpaste is a little more liquidy, which I prefer to the thicker paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-D</li>
            <li> So far I am really liking this toothpaste. Makes my mouth feel really clean. I hope that doesn&#x27;t change! :~]</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends this product and improves my sensitivity to hot and cold temperatures in my mouth.</li>
            <li> great product I have a lot of enamel lose on my teeth and this helps allot.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth and this product really helps out with that. No harsh flavors and keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> This is a gentler, but still effective way to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday. Not sure if it whitens teeth, but it is gentle</li>
            <li> Really does help with my sensitive teeth. They could work on the taste but beggars cant be choosers. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample from my dentist.  I have white spots from enamel loss and I&#x27;m not happy... SO she gave me this and honestly, it tastes terrible.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because of the taste.  It isn&#x27;t refreshing and though I&#x27;m sure it cleans my teeth, it doesn&#x27;t leave me with that &#x27;fresh mouth&#x27; feeling.  I&#x27;ll go back to my crest toothpaste and live happily ever after.</li>
            <li> Actually noticing a whitening with due diligence.</li>
            <li> used prior, really like</li>
            <li> I think it is really good to try to keep the enamel on your teeth as long as possible</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist. I like the results, taste and feel of cleanliness after each use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothpaste because I was getting canker sores in my mouth and I read that may be caused by the sulfate in the toothpaste that we use. Pro Namel does not have sulfate so I tried it but just got a canker sore this week. It&#x27;s no fault of the toothpaste. I plan to keep I using it, but I guess that the theory of sulfates causing mouth sores is wrong.  Overall it&#x27;s a good product and I recommend all Sensdyne products.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, this is the best. I can definitely tell the difference when I use other brands.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> The only toothpaste I use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to avoid GlaxoSmithKline products for their deceptive toothpaste marketing tricks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are labeling this one as a special acid fighter simply because it contains fluoride, the same ingredient that every other toothpaste contains.  That&#x27;s like taking a glass of water, labeling it as providing special acid protection, and making profit from the exaggerated claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GlaxoSmithKline also recently purchased the company that makes Biotene toothpaste, and then Glaxo completely changed the Biotene enzyme system formula into generic ingredients containing simple detergents, and continue to market Biotene riding on the good reputation it used to have as an enzyme based system.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the taste but is easy on the gums</li>
            <li> I have used the regular Sensodyne for years now and I love how it removed sensitivity. Don&#x27;t let this product fool you though, it&#x27;s no better than the regular version. The Pronamel claims to stop acid erosion of your teeth when in reality the ingredients are exactly the same as the regular version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this toothpaste has a MUCH better flavor than the regular Sensodyne. That was my biggest gripe with the original, the flavor left my mouth lacking that clean feeling and taste. This product fixes that issue.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this toothpaste and after two days my tongue had sores on it and felt like I had burned my tongue.  I have stopped using this toothpaste for three days now and my tongue is still very sensitive to food.  I would not recommend using the Pronamel.</li>
            <li> Really helped my sensitive teeth. Works very well, would highly recommend. Have used for years, wouldn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> Its the only toothpaste I use. Started using it when i got sensitive teeth. I dont have any cavities and it seems to do the trick in keeping my teeth less sensitive.</li>
            <li> Was great at helping my sensitive teeth, but terrible at cleaning my teeth. I had a chat with my dental hygienist and told her about my predicament and she recommended moving away from Sensodyne because it&#x27;s too much of a creamy paste and doesn&#x27;t have a grit to aid in cleaning your teeth as many of the normal toothpastes have. For two years I had a crazy amount of tartar build up even with flossing. Switching to Crest&#x27;s 3d sensitive fixed my problems and I haven&#x27;t felt any sensitivity changes. My dental hygienist also observed a significant decrease in tartar as well in my last visit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad sensitive teeth my entire life.  Sensodyne has always made this bearable regardless of brand or type.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve also had frequent mouth sores that have really rough pain for long periods of time.  What I found out was that this could be caused by a frequent ingredient in toothpaste called sodium lauryl sulfate.  Guess what, this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t include that particular ingredient.  I&#x27;ve went from getting at least 1 sore a month to less than 1 a year!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely get if you have cancre sores and sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> it does what they say it does.  very gentle on gums sd has a soothing flavor</li>
            <li> My dentist, a close friend, recommended this paste  as it is gentle on tooth enamel.  I find it cleans well and tastes quite good.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste, no more sensitive teeth and it tastes great.</li>
            <li> Great product.  If you have sensitive teeth this is wonderful!  You can tell a difference when you don&#x27;t use it!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I had run out of regular Sensodyne, which I have been using for years, and decided to give this a try for whatever reason I still can&#x27;t figure out. This is way too creamy and runs off of the toothbrush and out of my mouth and drops down my face and on down to my t-shirt. Also, the taste is really gross which may be the reason it won&#x27;t stay in my mouth. The packaging suks. In addition it bears mentioning that as it turns out the price is far higher than this product is worth.. It will be back to regular Sensodyne when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive teeth and my docter recommended me this. i have been using it so far instead of other brands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t for one second believe there is an issue with food acidity and enamel wear.  I do believe however, that dental fluorosis results in people believing the hype that the enamel is wearing off their teeth.  I&#x27;ve logged the Pronamel advertising under scam.  http://www.webmd.com/children/fluorosis-symptoms-causes-treatments</li>
            <li> What can I say product came as described and I saved some coin by buying multiple tubes at once. Good deal.</li>
            <li> I like it the most of the Sensodyne toothpastes I&#x27;ve used. Teeth feel better every day I use it and a little whiter, too.</li>
            <li> Although best for oral care. But get much more quantity from Sam&#x27;s Club with same price</li>
