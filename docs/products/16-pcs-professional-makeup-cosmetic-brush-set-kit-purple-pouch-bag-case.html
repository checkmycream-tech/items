            <li>But it&#x27;s okay, its still nice for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these brushes for nearly a year now, and they are just awesome.</li>
            <li>The brushes didn&#x27;t come in the color that the pictures show, they were purple instead, but I actually liked it a lot better.</li>

            <li>but brushes are in great condition on arrival, work well, and clean easily.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was more suitable for me to use.</li>
            <li>A great collection of make-up brushes for any situation whether you&#x27;re getting ready for the ball or a Monster&#x27;s Ball!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased make up brushes and this is a great starter kit without spending tons of money on high-end brands.</li>
            <li>smells not that good but still cool.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The coloring of the top of the brushes is very pretty - bright, just like the pictures.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>i love the bag they came in and the color.</li>

            <li>but it was okay.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure as hell not using that on my face.</li>
            <li>i still love them ^^</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay if you wash them before using (which you should to prevent getting bacteria on the face).</li>
            <li>Just received this product yesterday and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the smell will go away with time.  </li>
            <li>Can not wait to start applying make up. :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone looking for very useable brushes for a great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for what it is.</li>
            <li>They come with an interesting factory smell,</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you buy something to remove makeup from the brushes when you use them</li>
            <li>I like these for the most part</li>
            <li>I love the softness of the brushes, a must for me to have.</li>

            <li>I opened my package last evening and was very happy about what I had received, but when I took a whiff of the brush holder bag it took my breathe away</li>
            <li>I do love my brushes and recommend purchasing this though, but did give 4 stars because of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>all - Just OK for what I paid.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Every kind of cosmetic brush available.  </li>
            <li>I received the same color advertised and they are beautiful!</li>
            <li>Love them, can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice brushes, but they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li>The set has more brushes in it than I had wanted but with how cute they were and the price I couldn&#x27;t pass them up.  </li>

            <li>Love the color too.</li>
            <li>However, with some improvisation I was able to make these work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to add the customer service is top notch --</li>
            <li>I give this product an A+ :)</li>
            <li>They did have a plastic sort of smell, I&#x27;m sure from the packaging, just wash them, it will go away.</li>
            <li>I wish however the foundation brush was just a bit more sturdy so it would pick up more makeup.</li>
            <li>And I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Most have held up.</li>
            <li>None of the bristles came out while washing, so I’m sure I won’t have any issues during application.</li>
            <li>One thing I will give them is they are cute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d not have so many already.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them!!!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the service and brushes this seller has provided!&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li>They hold together very well, I&#x27;ve had mine a couple weeks now and have experienced no shedding at all.</li>
            <li>I love them :)</li>
            <li>the brush hairs don&#x27;t seem to be those colors, but they still are a very pretty set, and a very cute wrap case that I love.</li>
            <li>&gt; perfectly protected against damage-four largest Brushes have a special clear overlay on top of the brush.</li>
            <li>The quality is pretty good and the brushes look lovely in my acrylic organizers on my vanity.</li>
            <li>Super soft and work so great!</li>
            <li>This set is perfect sized and super soft.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I loved the color, and the price of this product once I first got it.</li>
            <li>A good first brush set.</li>
            <li>Good pretty brushes.</li>
            <li>She did say two of the brushes were unusable because they were too soft to pick up the makeup, but she loved them and even posted them on Instagram in a nice photo spread.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding yet</li>
            <li>i am in love with these brushes they look just like the picture are super low priced and are the best brushes i have ever had</li>
            <li>Very cool ombre effect.</li>
            <li>The brushes are lovely, has a strange scent, but they are of very good quality.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are delightful, they are soft and they look exactly how they look in the picture.</li>
            <li>Soft, great variety, and</li>
            <li>Brush were soft and looked great.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and a great case.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this set at first, there&#x27;s no way brushes so cheap could be any good.</li>
            <li>They are soft and feel great on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Exactly like the picture, the brushes are soft and are the perfect size.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes work excellent wet or with a product like MAC Fix+.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>No missing bristles, no bristles pointing in every direction pretty impressive since they aren&#x27;t made or shipped from USA.  </li>
            <li>Very amazed at the quality, good starter set.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t apply makeup every day and certainly not a lot of it when I do, so these will be wonderful for me.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product with soft bristles and puts on make-up well.</li>
            <li>soft, well to clean, beautiful color,&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great product for the price!</li>
            <li>It is pretty cute, though!</li>
            <li>Other than that they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft, gorgeous, and haven&#x27;t shed at all!</li>
            <li>and it was so easy to straighten out.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to clean them before use.</li>
            <li>The travel case makes it really easy to transport.</li>
            <li>but it is easily cured after washing them</li>
            <li>It smells like paint, an extremely strong and unpleasing scent.</li>
            <li>Anyway - these are decent brushes and there is a good variety of sizes and thicknesses.</li>
            <li>I touched the brushes and they feel so soft, I am sure they are good on your face too.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a STRONG smell on the case.</li>
            <li>:) they are smooth and soft, no shedding whatsoever, and the color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>They are pretty nice</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price but could be better quality</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re like me who is new to make up, this is a good practice brush kit.</li>
            <li>They do have a paint smell but after washed are just fine.</li>
            <li>they were fine.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll be fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li>They do the job just fine for me.</li>
            <li>So if you are a beginner like me then this will work just fine.</li>
            <li>They are fine brushes.</li>
            <li>but I just let them air out for a day or two and they were fine.</li>
            <li>The brushes are just fine for my daughter.</li>
            <li>For the price I like them the brushes do have a smell but after washing they were fine.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve been fine since then.</li>
            <li>the case for them is super convenient and some even come with brush guards!</li>
            <li>They are very soft and good quality</li>
            <li>Now the brushes feel of really good quality, very soft.</li>
            <li>the bristles are super soft and great for eye shadow.</li>
            <li>The blush brush adds a light dusting that can be built up, and works fine for contouring with bronzer.</li>
            <li>but I love them so much!!</li>
            <li>I washed mine with a little bit of my baby sisters shampoo and they smell perfect after that!</li>
            <li>The brushes are gorgeous and vibrant, true to color, and work fantastically.</li>
            <li>3 stars because the large brushes are awesome and the smaller ones need work.</li>
            <li>Not as good as some make up brushes that are much more expensive but very good value for the price.</li>
            <li>But who ever places the brushes in the cover and then wires them to the purchases has either made a huge mistake or who ever put the pictures up needs to fix this.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t shed at all and they were easy to clean.</li>
            <li>great starter set for someone just starting out.</li>
            <li>The brushes do not shed and clean easily</li>
            <li>but I just bought the cheap set for costume makeup anyways</li>
            <li>Nothing fabulous but do well for the price.</li>
            <li>They apply makeup smoothly.</li>
            <li>The case makes them look cheap.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these brushes.</li>
            <li>I do recommend these to anyone that is looking for a nice set of brushes at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem cheap at all</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and the case is an added bonus no serching around for brushes in a draw.</li>
            <li>This brush set is great for a teenager just starting out wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>They brushes are FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>Brushes were way toooo light, but i guess datz wat i paid for</li>
            <li>The case is a bit cheap though, so I may look into replacing it.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal.</li>
            <li>This seller is great I totally recommend!</li>
            <li>but they were gorgeous and felt soft.</li>
            <li>For the price, including shipping, I was pleasantly surprised at the good quality.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 13 year old niece and she loved them, purple is her fav color.</li>
            <li>The smell everyone is describing is kind of plastic-y and goes away pretty quick.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so pretty!!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t very impressed, yes the brushes are soft but the face brushes are slippery and don&#x27;t pick up powder very well</li>
            <li>absolutely love it, and I&#x27;ve had sets that costed more that weren&#x27;t this high quality.</li>
            <li>The case is super helpful and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too successful with is applying powder, if you like a light dusting these give you that</li>
            <li>good set, for price though i would&#x27;ve liked more of the little brushes to have been useful</li>
            <li>Great price, cute colors, soft brushes, but non appealing smell when you open the package.</li>
            <li>but once you get more advanced, I suggest getting more professional ones.</li>
            <li>This brush set is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>But overall the whole kit has been of great use, and the shiny purple pouch is just adorable.</li>
            <li>Brushes are well made clean.</li>
            <li>I just wanted some colorful brushes for my easy school make up</li>
            <li>it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services</li>
            <li>They are very soft, would be nice if they were labeled.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the brushes and I love the purple case!</li>
            <li>Beautiful brushes but doesn&#x27;t hold makeup extremely well.</li>
            <li>These are better than buying the essential ELF set which is $10 for 10 barely usable brushes but this is $11(Give or take a bit) and pretty great!</li>
            <li>Brushes were soft and new in plastic, nice variety to choose from to form amazing looks.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for is damn right!</li>
            <li>Great had weird smell though have not yet used yet but seem ok hope they are good nice enough.</li>
            <li>These are true to color.</li>
            <li>Nice, some brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li>The only thing good about this set is the spolie for your eyebrows and the eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li>(why do cats love doing that so much?</li>
            <li>/&gt;They don&#x27;t shed, they came on time, but overall, good quality for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a full brush set for foundation, blush, eyeshadow, etc.</li>
            <li>I thought they would be bigger but they are good for traveling or carrying along in purse.</li>
            <li>unfortunately true -but</li>
            <li>of the smaller brushes are good</li>
            <li>So i canceled my order and expect a FULL refund.</li>
            <li>good enough though).</li>
            <li>These brushes are very pretty and unique</li>
            <li>Love these so much</li>
            <li>Since there are no fluffy-type blending brushes, if you need more help blending use the fan brush or gently sweep with one of the largest eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>Still good 6mts later.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my little sister for Christmas and she loved them, so did I!</li>
            <li>They did have a strong paint smell when I first got them, but that went away within a day or two.</li>
            <li>The brushes are great, and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with them not picking up color, even with my concealer palette, which is an issue for other brushes.</li>
            <li>Pretty color and perfect for a young teen or a treat for a mom too.</li>
            <li>I love the color of the brushes, they are as vibrant as they were in the picture.</li>
            <li>so hopefully the smell will have subsided tremendously.</li>
            <li>Overall good brushes and worth the price.</li>
            <li>they got shipped to quickly.</li>
            <li>Obviously, there are better brushes out there, but I really felt I received pretty good quality for what I paid.</li>
            <li>Great price for these professional make up brushes, definitely recommend to everyone that wants good quality brushes for a decent price.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and work amazing and pretty colors.</li>
            <li>I enjoy my brushes so much!</li>
            <li>Although they are beautiful, my fan brush seemed like it was to weak and the top part of the brush fell off.</li>
            <li>such a amazing product, neatly wrapped, brushes clean.</li>
            <li>When she opened them Christmas am she was so excited and everyone else also wanted to try them they are extremely soft, durable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and it allows you to easily see how much make up is on the brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be using them very frequently and can&#x27;t wait to try the looks that I want with the thinner bristle brushes :)</li>
            <li>These are very pretty brushes, the case is nice and snaps closed easily.</li>
            <li>I love the color of the brushes, and they are actually really soft!</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, i love these brushes!</li>
            <li>One fell apart in my hands when I took it out of the bag for the first time; the bristles fell out and scattered all over the floor!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I was pretty nervous about them because they were so inexpensive, and then I wasn&#x27;t sure I really wanted to wait so long for them to be shipped (took almost a month), but I am in love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a special brushes cleaner because I want to wash them first before I use them.</li>
            <li>I HAVE FOUND THE PAINT BRUSHES TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE,AND CHEAPLY MADE..</li>
            <li>These brushes are cheap and for this price, what can you really expect?</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and arrived on time with air bubble things to secure it.</li>
            <li>But the fluffy brushes are great.</li>
            <li>I only gave this product 4 stars because it took a while to receive the product.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the brushes are AMAZING.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and so cute.</li>
            <li>They are nice enough for traveling which is what they were bought for.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone as well worth the money</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buy ELF&#x27;s foundation and blush brushes ($3 each at target) to replace the largest 3 and you are golden.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $11 I paid</li>
            <li>, the brushes feel soft and it will more then do the job.</li>
            <li>The larger ones have their own covers over the brush portion and each brush has a pocket to slide into in the case.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so fun colored, and soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have liked to review the actual brushes, but they were ordered 10 days ago</li>
            <li>I love them so far, which is since yesterday.</li>
            <li>I like the variety of brushes in this kit, each of the brushes are soft to the touch and they clean easily without worry about the bristles falling out.</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth the buy.</li>
            <li>This is pretty cool for the price, I suppose.</li>
            <li>and worth every penny spent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shipping took about a week (California) but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>These brushes are an absolute deal and the shipping was fast considering it came all the way from China and have free shipping!</li>
            <li>Pretty but not super great quality brushes.</li>
            <li>However for normal daily use doing my own make-up, they work just fine.</li>
            <li>First they came quickly.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice sturdy soft the pouch was a bit wrinkled and old looking not bad for the price</li>
            <li>, I ordered them on Sunday and the delivery was right on point.</li>
            <li>And as for the quality, the bristles were coming out right away.</li>
            <li>but when I was cleaning them, as I always do when I buy brushes online, it came right off.</li>
            <li>So I watched this go from New Jersey to Washington very quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use all of them (my make up is pretty simple) but the ones I do use are amazing.</li>
            <li>I received these brushes, the entire set had a very strong smell (like a mixture of plastic and nail polish).</li>
            <li>If I did make-up for a living or had to clean my brushes more frequently than normal, I would not use these.</li>
            <li>Loved the color however there a little to soft for me but still Use able</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call them &#x27;professional&#x27; brushes, just because they are not anything super fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great starter brush kit for people who are learning to put on makeup or amateur makeup artists.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how nice they are for such a cheap price...  </li>
            <li>these makeup brushes are professional and actually a nice pretty color, they are also very soft.</li>
            <li>Had a strong smell to them but other than that they&#x27;re ok</li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>They were clean with a vibrant color.</li>
            <li>No, these brushes won&#x27;t last forever, but for teens just starting to experiment with makeup, this is a great way to go.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase, the price was extremely affordable.</li>
            <li>Use a light hand with the eye brushes, they are kind of stiff</li>
            <li>Super smooth, no loose</li>
            <li>comes with little cover which is bright magenta in color, I like it.</li>
            <li>The brushes are hard to clean, I didn&#x27;t think they would be as cheap but other than that they are very good brushes and case</li>
            <li>The fan brush would shed so much that it would get all in the pack and in my eyes!</li>
            <li>she is not use to so many different size brushes!</li>
            <li>and I think its actually the case more so with the odor.</li>
            <li>more then the big brushes.</li>
            <li>So Pretty.</li>
            <li>Sending back for sure.</li>
            <li>If you apply makeup every day and use a lot of technique, I would recommend in investing in some higher end brushes.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this set.</li>
            <li>Brushes look exactly as pic.</li>
            <li>And yes, there is a chemical smell at first, but it did dissipate after afew days.</li>
            <li>I love the bigger brushes for blush application but</li>
            <li>They are pretty brushes.</li>
            <li>I feel like these will last a good long time especially since I&#x27;m going to keep them in this nice case and not laid out on the counter where the cats can nibble at the bristles</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to take the whole package for a spin when I put on makeup for a night out!</li>
            <li>the first night I just let them air out that took care of that.</li>
            <li>Almost too pretty to use.</li>
            <li>They do smell like paint for the first week or so.</li>
            <li>They are basic brushes - better than the freebies that come with make up</li>
            <li>I feel like I have way too many of the same brush though.  </li>
            <li>My makeup goes on so smoothly and these brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>They did have an odor at first</li>
            <li>Ok, enough with that stuff, but I do suggest to wash them before you use them.</li>
            <li>Pretty brush colors as well.</li>
            <li>These would be excellent for travel in case you don&#x27;t want to take your expensive set with you.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>it got shipped fast and it looks just like the picture!</li>
            <li>The only drawback, however, was the nearly overwhelming odor of plastic upon opening.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exact color and size as in pics.</li>
            <li>I love all the different shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li>When I order a product, I expect to get that exact product.</li>
            <li>They are surprisingly soft for the cheap price.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with the purchase and I am looking forward to having my matching brushes in use.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be cheaply made , I was pleasantly surprised when I received my brush kit promptly</li>
            <li>I only ordered these brushes because they are my favorite color.</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes are higher quality than others.</li>
            <li>And the eye shadow brushes seem too sturdy, and pick up too much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;they look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>I am not a makeup wearer however the set is a pretty purple and the bag is convenient to use.</li>
            <li>The brushes I received are exactly as pictured, fluffy and a gorgeous cornflower blue-purple ombre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is my first set of brushes ever.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft &amp; silky, absolutely adorable, I love the long handles, and they have (so far)</li>
            <li>but I just used a little super glue, and the brush is as good as new.</li>
            <li>But half were still usable for the most part, and they were cheap, so what did I expect?</li>
            <li>very soft and tender drushes even if they are not natural the quality is the best , the one who doent know much will never finde out that its not natural product!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good brushes but kinda seems like a lot of the same brushes just different sizes</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;d prefer the inside pf the case to be darker or to exhibit more of an ombre effect additionally but who really cares about that</li>
            <li>super soft !</li>
            <li>Also, they definitely smell strongly like plastic/paint when they first come out of the packaging,</li>
            <li>I have had a positive experience with this product</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t even consider that a negative.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is individually wrapped, the brushes are soft, the colors are actually very pretty, and you get a good variety for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I love this set because it came with two brushes that were the same size that I really needed and this really works well with all of my eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Brushes themselves were soft and really cool looking, but fell apart after a couple uses.</li>
            <li>There super soft, the color is so pretty and the the little pouch it comes with is super cute.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft.</li>
            <li>and they are SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>but I love the material of these brushes, its not rough but not too soft</li>
            <li>they are super soft</li>
            <li>they are super soft.</li>
            <li>They do look dirty easy, if this bothers you you can easily wash them often to keep them looking nice.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use, it&#x27;s all there for you but the only thing I would change is the fact that they don&#x27;t have a large foundation brush.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and soft.</li>
            <li>I am ok with the smell (after all they are brand new) and with the (as my inner Wednesday Addams said)</li>
            <li>The only thing that I did not like was the STRONG plastic smell of the case, all I recommend is letting it  air out on the porch for about two hours, the brushes themselves don&#x27;t really smell though.</li>
            <li>I checked them all carefully to make sure they are secure on the handle and the brush heads are not loose.</li>
            <li>For the price, the quality is pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>Would be a decent first set for someone just getting started.</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes are very hard so they don&#x27;t pick up powders very well, they also don&#x27;t blend that great.</li>
            <li>I wish the bigger brushes were a little firmer, but otherwise, this set is great.</li>
            <li>When it is opened it lays flat so that you can easily access the brushes.</li>
            <li>anyways-the brushes are honestly comparable to more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a lot better than what I had expected for the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the case but will keep it for traveling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve bought a set, and I really like these.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>One for the girlfriend and I. Thanks</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but still the previews reviews made me think otherwise.  </li>
            <li>bristles are real hair</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>What do you really expect?</li>
            <li>also they hold my eye shadow on very well and doesn&#x27;t crumble when you put it on your eyelid</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are also very well constructed</li>
            <li>The brushes don&#x27;t pick up eyeshadow and it goes on very flaky.</li>
            <li>I was very unimpressed.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t bother too much, however.</li>
            <li>but I really like this kit.</li>
            <li>and I got it in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>but they also really grab the makeup</li>
            <li>i really do like them &amp; will be ordering them again.</li>
            <li>Im very into makeup, and i have Sephora brushes, and i prefer these powder brushes to the sephoras.but</li>
            <li>Overall, these are fairly cheaply made brushes.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smells, make sure and open and leave these in a well-ventilated area for a day or two before using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft, pretty and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>These are super soft, high quality brushes.</li>
            <li>these brushes worked good, but mine broke in half, but you could easily hot glue them back together.</li>
            <li>I know they won&#x27;t last me too long, but I&#x27;m enjoying them in the meantime!</li>
            <li>The hair is &amp;uuml;ber soft and the color is very vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li>So sad because all of the others were so good!</li>
            <li>It could look more high quality in velvet or some other material.  </li>
            <li>Love my brushes they are very long but a lil too soft but</li>
            <li>noticed a lot of reviews about a slight smell, but maybe mine just had a more intense smell to it than others.</li>
            <li>The package does need to be aired out once you open it, it has a strong chemical odor.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like much is that the eyeshadow brushes don&#x27;t grasp the color super well (</li>
            <li>The brushes are really pretty and the bristles and soft and get the job done, however, the tip came off one of the brushes that I didn&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re soft &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li>If you add a tiny bit of hair gel to the fan brush when it is wet it will make it more useful to sweep away fallout under your eyes.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes but the smaller brushes are all the same but not fluffy, kinda can be used for concealer brushes</li>
            <li>and it was nice, not cheap soft durable brushes !</li>
            <li>I love how they arent too stiff, or too fluffy and the colors are amazing.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my neice, shes not new to makeup but new to having a full set of make up brushes, I was plesantly suprised with quality for price!</li>
            <li>They do a better job than some more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I got these based on the decent reviews I found on the website for this product.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are more purple than blue, as pictured, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  </li>
            <li>Totally took the smell away with just regular antibacterial soap :)</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a decent buy.</li>
            <li>decent brushes considering the price.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a couple of brushes are decent.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my older sister two years ago.</li>
            <li>Did have a mild odor from packaging but when left out odor disapated.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t as strong as I expected  </li>
            <li>Such soft high quality brushes for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>These brushes are sorta pretty, do be aware when you purchase these that colors do vary from pictures a little, mine are more of a baby blue with purple tips.</li>
            <li>I love that some are stiff and some are very pliable.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that the case the brushes came in smells strongly of plastic and gave me a bit of a headache, so i won&#x27;t be keeping that bit but other than that it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who uses makeup often.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Would probably be better suited to a very young teen or for someone who is JUST starting out experimenting with their makeup.</li>
            <li>I love the little ones way</li>
            <li>These are great brushes, just one thing I didn&#x27;t like, the weird looking brush, I have no clue what its called.</li>
            <li>Theyre soft and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Worth the price definitely!!!!</li>
            <li>well, I really have to pile it on the brushes to get the amount I normally used with my old set of Mary Kay brushes.</li>
            <li>It had the smell of a normal new brush.</li>
            <li>When I received these they smelled like strong sour glue.</li>
            <li>No strange smell...works well as a first makeup brush set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner, and some of the brushes seem a little soft, but that&#x27;s ok for me.</li>
            <li>I bought these needing new brushes and not wanting to spend a lot.</li>
            <li>Just rinse them off, as you would any new brush before using it on your face.</li>
            <li>Since I am new to trying on make up</li>
            <li>The smell is just from the brushes being packaged and processed, it smells like new plastic and goes away after a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I recieved them and they still look brand new.  </li>
            <li>No big deal, but whoever is opening the boxes at the warehouse should be more careful.</li>
            <li>The case is convenient and there&#x27;s obviously a wide range of brushes for those who do use more than the basic brushes.</li>
            <li>They are also very soft (something I noticed when I had to pull the cover up on two of them which I should not have had to do) and they are seemingly well made (have not taken out of the package) but they are not what I bought.</li>
            <li>Very soft pliable brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft as well.</li>
            <li>Very soft which I like</li>
            <li>she says the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of brushes and they are very soft bristled, and not cheap at all!</li>
            <li>The only thing is that you should be aware of is the smell.</li>
            <li>The brushes don&#x27;t look exactly like the photo (they are white with purple tips).  </li>
            <li>I mostly use the small angled brush for shaping (and shading in)</li>
            <li>these are soooo incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>The reason I gave only a 4 rating is because I did not receive the exact brushes that are shown.</li>
            <li>I received brushes with light purple that fades to dark purple.</li>
            <li>Just like professional brushes !</li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>They do shed a little&lt;br /&gt; bit, but it is not excessive.</li>
            <li>Yup they smell but only at first.</li>
            <li>so maybe that makes it worth it in the long run...</li>
            <li>I liked a few of the brushes but many of these fell apart after a few uses and were very rough feeling.</li>
            <li>They were very quick and very polite, sending me a replacement set of brushes just a few days later.</li>
            <li>I am not typically a review writer but WOW!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if I would use them professionally</li>
            <li>The brushes were soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>She loves them and has been using them  frequently</li>
            <li>which was one of my biggest pet peeves about my old brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them out and have had no problems so far.</li>
            <li>My set came in and are completely purple.  </li>
            <li>But I have to say they&#x27;re really soft</li>
            <li>There are extremely soft, I am in</li>
            <li>I am not a professional make up artist, so I assume for that a higher quality would be required if I was.</li>
            <li>far as the brushes go, they are way beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>The brushes are too soft to get any product on them.</li>
            <li>I was initially worried about the smell I kept reading about in reviews, but that wasn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems so far</li>
            <li>Stayed soft  after cleaning</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something chic and soft (oh let me rephrase that...too soft)</li>
            <li>The smell was gone after they aired out a while.</li>
            <li>I even asked a professional artist(makeup) and she was clueless.....</li>
            <li>They are so soft to the touch and feel even nicer on the skin.</li>
            <li>I bought these to replace an old brush set.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft, and the color doesn&#x27;t come off act brushing.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it professional.</li>
            <li>They offer her every imaginable brush to keep her busy for hours.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>The netting is not sewn completely on the bottom of some of the slots allowing the brushes to fall through.</li>
            <li>The bristle brushes are extremely soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li>It smells like an old factory smell.</li>
            <li>and there are no fluffy eyeshadow brushes for blending.</li>
            <li>the brushes are soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m far to picky, I know.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have used almost all of the brushes so far, and the quality is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>Aired them out for a week</li>
            <li>will order again when these start to get old.</li>
            <li>Speaking of washing them, They DO have a very pungent smell of paint or dye as you open the package</li>
            <li>im 20 years old</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really cute, the only problem I have with them is that there isn&#x27;t a blending brush or a crease fluffy brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these brushes for years and only one has broken good buy</li>
            <li>However, the problem was easily solved by wiping down the entire makeup case with a clorox disinfecting wipe (and drying it with a paper towel), and carefully washing each brush with warm water and antibacterial dial hand soap (and lying them flat to dry).</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the case smells very strongly of paint.</li>
            <li>but I just twist them back down and they seem fine for awhile.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you if they are high or low quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommend especially for this price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my old standbys until I can spring for a new M.K. set.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This product was a personal purchase at the normal retail price.</li>
            <li>There was a little smell but after a quick wash it evantually went away</li>
            <li>/&gt;my advice-pull brush from the Pouch Bag Case and spray them gently with alcohol and allow them  to dry -odor disappears&lt;br /&gt;Pouch</li>
            <li>and that is a major plus.</li>
            <li>and I am not due to get them until the jan 10th - jan 28th.</li>
            <li>but again, as some other reviewers were saying, the powder brushes are a bit too soft and don&#x27;t pick up much product.</li>
            <li>Loose bristles occasionally come out at first.</li>
            <li>they are a long lasting product and it arrived really fast.</li>
            <li>Soft enough and the hairs don&#x27;t repeatedly fall off when using the brushes on your face.</li>
            <li>The face brushes barely apply anything.</li>
            <li>I actually only wanted an eyeshadow brush set and this item far superceded my expectations.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t use any of the larger brushes for contouring or liquid foundation because they&#x27;re way too soft and not dense at all, they just bend when you try to blend.</li>
            <li>Also, one of the magnetic closures is barely attached.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 12 year old daughter, who thinks she&#x27;s the next contestant on &amp;#34;Face Off&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>The case does kind of have a weird smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i absolutely love this company, i did have a bit of a problem with a broken brush and within hours the problem was solved.</li>
            <li>Anyways, they do have a little bit of a smell, but I know that is just from coming straight to me brand new.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell at first, but it does fade and really isn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li>For less than a fiver, I got all these pretty brushes AND a carrying case?</li>
            <li>Of course, I expected it to smell like plastic or paint, but it&#x27;s brand new!  </li>
            <li>I only used one or two brushes then went back to my old ones.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see that that was the only brush that was bent, especially since it is a roll up case.</li>
            <li>This brush set contains every brush you would need to complete a look without spending a lot of money for the more expensive name brand brushes.</li>
            <li>did have a funny smell when I received them, but nothing a little baby shampoo couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>All the  smaller \\&quot;eyeshadow\\&quot; brushes are all flat there is no fluffy, blending eyeshadow brush</li>
            <li>I like the fluffy brushes, the eyeshadow brushes are pretty meh</li>
            <li>The brushes were very soft and was everything I expected according to the product description.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality (not super expensive) set of brushes</li>
            <li>bought this as a gift for my little sister who is really into makeup now.</li>
            <li>This product has a good side to it and a bad side.</li>
            <li>As many others have rated this product low, the smell is real and bad.</li>

            <li> But it&#x27;s okay, its still nice for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for nearly a year now, and they are just awesome.</li>

            <li> but brushes are in great condition on arrival, work well, and clean easily.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was more suitable for me to use.</li>
            <li> A great collection of make-up brushes for any situation whether you&#x27;re getting ready for the ball or a Monster&#x27;s Ball!</li>

            <li> smells not that good but still cool.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>

            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure as hell not using that on my face.</li>
            <li> i still love them ^^</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay if you wash them before using (which you should to prevent getting bacteria on the face).</li>
            <li> Just received this product yesterday and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the smell will go away with time.  </li>
            <li> Can not wait to start applying make up. :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone looking for very useable brushes for a great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for what it is.</li>
            <li> They come with an interesting factory smell,</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you buy something to remove makeup from the brushes when you use them</li>
            <li> I like these for the most part</li>
            <li> I love the softness of the brushes, a must for me to have.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very much enjoying all the brushes with this product.</li>

            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Also, when I opened them, I immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li> You get more than what you pay for :)</li>
            <li> I really love the color of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the color of them and would recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> I opened my package last evening and was very happy about what I had received, but when I took a whiff of the brush holder bag it took my breathe away</li>
            <li> I do love my brushes and recommend purchasing this though, but did give 4 stars because of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so happy with the shipping just how fast it was</li>

            <li> These are ok considering the price.  </li>
            <li> Still love, though.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to buy a nice set that was cheap but would get the job done.</li>
            <li> I get better results from my dollar store brushes.</li>
            <li> all - Just OK for what I paid.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> Every kind of cosmetic brush available.  </li>

            <li> They&#x27;re nice brushes, but they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li> The set has more brushes in it than I had wanted but with how cute they were and the price I couldn&#x27;t pass them up.  </li>
            <li> And such a great price!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Okay brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are better than I thought.</li>
            <li> Love the color too.</li>
            <li> However, with some improvisation I was able to make these work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to add the customer service is top notch --</li>
            <li> I give this product an A+ :)</li>
            <li> They did have a plastic sort of smell, I&#x27;m sure from the packaging, just wash them, it will go away.</li>
            <li> I wish however the foundation brush was just a bit more sturdy so it would pick up more makeup.</li>
            <li> And I love the color.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> Most have held up.</li>
            <li> None of the bristles came out while washing, so I’m sure I won’t have any issues during application.</li>
            <li> One thing I will give them is they are cute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d not have so many already.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them!!!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the service and brushes this seller has provided!&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li> They hold together very well, I&#x27;ve had mine a couple weeks now and have experienced no shedding at all.</li>
            <li> I love them :)</li>
            <li> the brush hairs don&#x27;t seem to be those colors, but they still are a very pretty set, and a very cute wrap case that I love.</li>
            <li> &gt; perfectly protected against damage-four largest Brushes have a special clear overlay on top of the brush.</li>

            <li> She did say two of the brushes were unusable because they were too soft to pick up the makeup, but she loved them and even posted them on Instagram in a nice photo spread.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding yet</li>
            <li> i am in love with these brushes they look just like the picture are super low priced and are the best brushes i have ever had</li>
            <li> Very cool ombre effect.</li>
            <li> The brushes are lovely, has a strange scent, but they are of very good quality.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are delightful, they are soft and they look exactly how they look in the picture.</li>
            <li> Soft, great variety, and</li>
            <li> Brush were soft and looked great.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and a great case.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this set at first, there&#x27;s no way brushes so cheap could be any good.</li>
            <li> They are soft and feel great on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Exactly like the picture, the brushes are soft and are the perfect size.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes work excellent wet or with a product like MAC Fix+.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> No missing bristles, no bristles pointing in every direction pretty impressive since they aren&#x27;t made or shipped from USA.  </li>
            <li> Very amazed at the quality, good starter set.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t apply makeup every day and certainly not a lot of it when I do, so these will be wonderful for me.  </li>
            <li> Very nice product with soft bristles and puts on make-up well.</li>
            <li> soft, well to clean, beautiful color,&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Other than that its a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> It is pretty cute, though!</li>
            <li> Other than that they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft, gorgeous, and haven&#x27;t shed at all!</li>
            <li> and it was so easy to straighten out.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to clean them before use.</li>
            <li> The travel case makes it really easy to transport.</li>
            <li> but it is easily cured after washing them</li>
            <li> It smells like paint, an extremely strong and unpleasing scent.</li>
            <li> Anyway - these are decent brushes and there is a good variety of sizes and thicknesses.</li>
            <li> I touched the brushes and they feel so soft, I am sure they are good on your face too.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a STRONG smell on the case.</li>
            <li> :) they are smooth and soft, no shedding whatsoever, and the color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> They are pretty nice</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price but could be better quality</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re like me who is new to make up, this is a good practice brush kit.</li>
            <li> They do have a paint smell but after washed are just fine.</li>
            <li> they were fine.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll be fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li> They do the job just fine for me.</li>
            <li> So if you are a beginner like me then this will work just fine.</li>
            <li> They are fine brushes.</li>
            <li> but I just let them air out for a day or two and they were fine.</li>
            <li> The brushes are just fine for my daughter.</li>
            <li> For the price I like them the brushes do have a smell but after washing they were fine.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve been fine since then.</li>
            <li> the case for them is super convenient and some even come with brush guards!</li>
            <li> They are very soft and good quality</li>
            <li> Now the brushes feel of really good quality, very soft.</li>
            <li> the bristles are super soft and great for eye shadow.</li>
            <li> The blush brush adds a light dusting that can be built up, and works fine for contouring with bronzer.</li>
            <li> but I love them so much!!</li>
            <li> I washed mine with a little bit of my baby sisters shampoo and they smell perfect after that!</li>
            <li> The brushes are gorgeous and vibrant, true to color, and work fantastically.</li>
            <li> 3 stars because the large brushes are awesome and the smaller ones need work.</li>
            <li> Not as good as some make up brushes that are much more expensive but very good value for the price.</li>
            <li> But who ever places the brushes in the cover and then wires them to the purchases has either made a huge mistake or who ever put the pictures up needs to fix this.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t shed at all and they were easy to clean.</li>
            <li> great starter set for someone just starting out.</li>
            <li> The brushes do not shed and clean easily</li>
            <li> but I just bought the cheap set for costume makeup anyways</li>
            <li> Nothing fabulous but do well for the price.</li>
            <li> They apply makeup smoothly.</li>
            <li> The case makes them look cheap.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these brushes.</li>
            <li> I do recommend these to anyone that is looking for a nice set of brushes at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem cheap at all</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and the case is an added bonus no serching around for brushes in a draw.</li>
            <li> This brush set is great for a teenager just starting out wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> They brushes are FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> Brushes were way toooo light, but i guess datz wat i paid for</li>
            <li> The case is a bit cheap though, so I may look into replacing it.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal.</li>
            <li> This seller is great I totally recommend!</li>
            <li> but they were gorgeous and felt soft.</li>
            <li> For the price, including shipping, I was pleasantly surprised at the good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 13 year old niece and she loved them, purple is her fav color.</li>
            <li> The smell everyone is describing is kind of plastic-y and goes away pretty quick.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so pretty!!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t very impressed, yes the brushes are soft but the face brushes are slippery and don&#x27;t pick up powder very well</li>
            <li> absolutely love it, and I&#x27;ve had sets that costed more that weren&#x27;t this high quality.</li>
            <li> The case is super helpful and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too successful with is applying powder, if you like a light dusting these give you that</li>
            <li> good set, for price though i would&#x27;ve liked more of the little brushes to have been useful</li>
            <li> Great price, cute colors, soft brushes, but non appealing smell when you open the package.</li>
            <li> but once you get more advanced, I suggest getting more professional ones.</li>
            <li> This brush set is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> But overall the whole kit has been of great use, and the shiny purple pouch is just adorable.</li>
            <li> Brushes are well made clean.</li>
            <li> I just wanted some colorful brushes for my easy school make up</li>
            <li> it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services</li>
            <li> They are very soft, would be nice if they were labeled.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the brushes and I love the purple case!</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes but doesn&#x27;t hold makeup extremely well.</li>
            <li> These are better than buying the essential ELF set which is $10 for 10 barely usable brushes but this is $11(Give or take a bit) and pretty great!</li>
            <li> Brushes were soft and new in plastic, nice variety to choose from to form amazing looks.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for is damn right!</li>
            <li> Great had weird smell though have not yet used yet but seem ok hope they are good nice enough.</li>
            <li> These are true to color.</li>
            <li> Nice, some brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li> The only thing good about this set is the spolie for your eyebrows and the eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> (why do cats love doing that so much?</li>
            <li> /&gt;They don&#x27;t shed, they came on time, but overall, good quality for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a full brush set for foundation, blush, eyeshadow, etc.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be bigger but they are good for traveling or carrying along in purse.</li>
            <li> unfortunately true -but</li>
            <li> of the smaller brushes are good</li>
            <li> So i canceled my order and expect a FULL refund.</li>
            <li> good enough though).</li>
            <li> These brushes are very pretty and unique</li>
            <li> Love these so much</li>
            <li> Since there are no fluffy-type blending brushes, if you need more help blending use the fan brush or gently sweep with one of the largest eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> Still good 6mts later.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my little sister for Christmas and she loved them, so did I!</li>
            <li> They did have a strong paint smell when I first got them, but that went away within a day or two.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great, and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with them not picking up color, even with my concealer palette, which is an issue for other brushes.</li>
            <li> Pretty color and perfect for a young teen or a treat for a mom too.</li>
            <li> I love the color of the brushes, they are as vibrant as they were in the picture.</li>
            <li> so hopefully the smell will have subsided tremendously.</li>
            <li> Overall good brushes and worth the price.</li>
            <li> they got shipped to quickly.</li>
            <li> Obviously, there are better brushes out there, but I really felt I received pretty good quality for what I paid.</li>
            <li> Great price for these professional make up brushes, definitely recommend to everyone that wants good quality brushes for a decent price.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and work amazing and pretty colors.</li>
            <li> I enjoy my brushes so much!</li>
            <li> Although they are beautiful, my fan brush seemed like it was to weak and the top part of the brush fell off.</li>
            <li> such a amazing product, neatly wrapped, brushes clean.</li>
            <li> When she opened them Christmas am she was so excited and everyone else also wanted to try them they are extremely soft, durable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and it allows you to easily see how much make up is on the brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be using them very frequently and can&#x27;t wait to try the looks that I want with the thinner bristle brushes :)</li>
            <li> These are very pretty brushes, the case is nice and snaps closed easily.</li>
            <li> I love the color of the brushes, and they are actually really soft!</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, i love these brushes!</li>
            <li> One fell apart in my hands when I took it out of the bag for the first time; the bristles fell out and scattered all over the floor!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was pretty nervous about them because they were so inexpensive, and then I wasn&#x27;t sure I really wanted to wait so long for them to be shipped (took almost a month), but I am in love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a special brushes cleaner because I want to wash them first before I use them.</li>
            <li> I HAVE FOUND THE PAINT BRUSHES TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE,AND CHEAPLY MADE..</li>
            <li> These brushes are cheap and for this price, what can you really expect?</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and arrived on time with air bubble things to secure it.</li>
            <li> But the fluffy brushes are great.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product 4 stars because it took a while to receive the product.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the brushes are AMAZING.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and so cute.</li>
            <li> They are nice enough for traveling which is what they were bought for.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone as well worth the money</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy ELF&#x27;s foundation and blush brushes ($3 each at target) to replace the largest 3 and you are golden.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $11 I paid</li>
            <li> , the brushes feel soft and it will more then do the job.</li>
            <li> The larger ones have their own covers over the brush portion and each brush has a pocket to slide into in the case.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so fun colored, and soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have liked to review the actual brushes, but they were ordered 10 days ago</li>
            <li> I love them so far, which is since yesterday.</li>
            <li> I like the variety of brushes in this kit, each of the brushes are soft to the touch and they clean easily without worry about the bristles falling out.</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This is pretty cool for the price, I suppose.</li>
            <li> and worth every penny spent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shipping took about a week (California) but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> These brushes are an absolute deal and the shipping was fast considering it came all the way from China and have free shipping!</li>
            <li> Pretty but not super great quality brushes.</li>
            <li> However for normal daily use doing my own make-up, they work just fine.</li>
            <li> First they came quickly.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice sturdy soft the pouch was a bit wrinkled and old looking not bad for the price</li>
            <li> , I ordered them on Sunday and the delivery was right on point.</li>
            <li> And as for the quality, the bristles were coming out right away.</li>
            <li> but when I was cleaning them, as I always do when I buy brushes online, it came right off.</li>
            <li> So I watched this go from New Jersey to Washington very quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use all of them (my make up is pretty simple) but the ones I do use are amazing.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes, the entire set had a very strong smell (like a mixture of plastic and nail polish).</li>
            <li> If I did make-up for a living or had to clean my brushes more frequently than normal, I would not use these.</li>
            <li> Loved the color however there a little to soft for me but still Use able</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call them &#x27;professional&#x27; brushes, just because they are not anything super fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great starter brush kit for people who are learning to put on makeup or amateur makeup artists.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how nice they are for such a cheap price...  </li>
            <li> these makeup brushes are professional and actually a nice pretty color, they are also very soft.</li>
            <li> Had a strong smell to them but other than that they&#x27;re ok</li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> They were clean with a vibrant color.</li>
            <li> No, these brushes won&#x27;t last forever, but for teens just starting to experiment with makeup, this is a great way to go.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase, the price was extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> Use a light hand with the eye brushes, they are kind of stiff</li>
            <li> Super smooth, no loose</li>
            <li> comes with little cover which is bright magenta in color, I like it.</li>
            <li> The brushes are hard to clean, I didn&#x27;t think they would be as cheap but other than that they are very good brushes and case</li>
            <li> The fan brush would shed so much that it would get all in the pack and in my eyes!</li>
            <li> she is not use to so many different size brushes!</li>
            <li> and I think its actually the case more so with the odor.</li>
            <li> more then the big brushes.</li>
            <li> So Pretty.</li>
            <li> Sending back for sure.</li>
            <li> If you apply makeup every day and use a lot of technique, I would recommend in investing in some higher end brushes.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this set.</li>
            <li> Brushes look exactly as pic.</li>
            <li> And yes, there is a chemical smell at first, but it did dissipate after afew days.</li>
            <li> I love the bigger brushes for blush application but</li>
            <li> They are pretty brushes.</li>
            <li> I feel like these will last a good long time especially since I&#x27;m going to keep them in this nice case and not laid out on the counter where the cats can nibble at the bristles</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to take the whole package for a spin when I put on makeup for a night out!</li>
            <li> the first night I just let them air out that took care of that.</li>
            <li> Almost too pretty to use.</li>
            <li> They do smell like paint for the first week or so.</li>
            <li> They are basic brushes - better than the freebies that come with make up</li>
            <li> I feel like I have way too many of the same brush though.  </li>
            <li> My makeup goes on so smoothly and these brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li> They did have an odor at first</li>
            <li> Ok, enough with that stuff, but I do suggest to wash them before you use them.</li>
            <li> Pretty brush colors as well.</li>
            <li> These would be excellent for travel in case you don&#x27;t want to take your expensive set with you.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> it got shipped fast and it looks just like the picture!</li>
            <li> The only drawback, however, was the nearly overwhelming odor of plastic upon opening.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exact color and size as in pics.</li>
            <li> I love all the different shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li> When I order a product, I expect to get that exact product.</li>
            <li> They are surprisingly soft for the cheap price.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with the purchase and I am looking forward to having my matching brushes in use.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be cheaply made , I was pleasantly surprised when I received my brush kit promptly</li>
            <li> I only ordered these brushes because they are my favorite color.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are higher quality than others.</li>
            <li> And the eye shadow brushes seem too sturdy, and pick up too much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;they look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup wearer however the set is a pretty purple and the bag is convenient to use.</li>
            <li> The brushes I received are exactly as pictured, fluffy and a gorgeous cornflower blue-purple ombre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is my first set of brushes ever.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft &amp; silky, absolutely adorable, I love the long handles, and they have (so far)</li>
            <li> but I just used a little super glue, and the brush is as good as new.</li>
            <li> But half were still usable for the most part, and they were cheap, so what did I expect?</li>
            <li> very soft and tender drushes even if they are not natural the quality is the best , the one who doent know much will never finde out that its not natural product!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good brushes but kinda seems like a lot of the same brushes just different sizes</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;d prefer the inside pf the case to be darker or to exhibit more of an ombre effect additionally but who really cares about that</li>
            <li> super soft !</li>
            <li> Also, they definitely smell strongly like plastic/paint when they first come out of the packaging,</li>
            <li> I have had a positive experience with this product</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t even consider that a negative.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is individually wrapped, the brushes are soft, the colors are actually very pretty, and you get a good variety for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I love this set because it came with two brushes that were the same size that I really needed and this really works well with all of my eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Brushes themselves were soft and really cool looking, but fell apart after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> There super soft, the color is so pretty and the the little pouch it comes with is super cute.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft.</li>
            <li> and they are SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> but I love the material of these brushes, its not rough but not too soft</li>
            <li> they are super soft</li>
            <li> they are super soft.</li>
            <li> They do look dirty easy, if this bothers you you can easily wash them often to keep them looking nice.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use, it&#x27;s all there for you but the only thing I would change is the fact that they don&#x27;t have a large foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and soft.</li>
            <li> I am ok with the smell (after all they are brand new) and with the (as my inner Wednesday Addams said)</li>
            <li> The only thing that I did not like was the STRONG plastic smell of the case, all I recommend is letting it  air out on the porch for about two hours, the brushes themselves don&#x27;t really smell though.</li>
            <li> I checked them all carefully to make sure they are secure on the handle and the brush heads are not loose.</li>
            <li> For the price, the quality is pretty decent.  </li>
            <li> Would be a decent first set for someone just getting started.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are very hard so they don&#x27;t pick up powders very well, they also don&#x27;t blend that great.</li>
            <li> I wish the bigger brushes were a little firmer, but otherwise, this set is great.</li>
            <li> When it is opened it lays flat so that you can easily access the brushes.</li>
            <li> anyways-the brushes are honestly comparable to more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a lot better than what I had expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the case but will keep it for traveling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve bought a set, and I really like these.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> One for the girlfriend and I. Thanks</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but still the previews reviews made me think otherwise.  </li>
            <li> bristles are real hair</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> However, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> What do you really expect?</li>
            <li> also they hold my eye shadow on very well and doesn&#x27;t crumble when you put it on your eyelid</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are also very well constructed</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t pick up eyeshadow and it goes on very flaky.</li>
            <li> I was very unimpressed.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t bother too much, however.</li>
            <li> but I really like this kit.</li>
            <li> and I got it in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> but they also really grab the makeup</li>
            <li> i really do like them &amp; will be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> Im very into makeup, and i have Sephora brushes, and i prefer these powder brushes to the sephoras.but</li>
            <li> Overall, these are fairly cheaply made brushes.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smells, make sure and open and leave these in a well-ventilated area for a day or two before using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft, pretty and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> These are super soft, high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> these brushes worked good, but mine broke in half, but you could easily hot glue them back together.</li>
            <li> I know they won&#x27;t last me too long, but I&#x27;m enjoying them in the meantime!</li>
            <li> The hair is &amp;uuml;ber soft and the color is very vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li> So sad because all of the others were so good!</li>
            <li> It could look more high quality in velvet or some other material.  </li>
            <li> Love my brushes they are very long but a lil too soft but</li>
            <li> noticed a lot of reviews about a slight smell, but maybe mine just had a more intense smell to it than others.</li>
            <li> The package does need to be aired out once you open it, it has a strong chemical odor.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like much is that the eyeshadow brushes don&#x27;t grasp the color super well (</li>
            <li> The brushes are really pretty and the bristles and soft and get the job done, however, the tip came off one of the brushes that I didn&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re soft &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li> If you add a tiny bit of hair gel to the fan brush when it is wet it will make it more useful to sweep away fallout under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes but the smaller brushes are all the same but not fluffy, kinda can be used for concealer brushes</li>
            <li> and it was nice, not cheap soft durable brushes !</li>
            <li> I love how they arent too stiff, or too fluffy and the colors are amazing.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my neice, shes not new to makeup but new to having a full set of make up brushes, I was plesantly suprised with quality for price!</li>
            <li> They do a better job than some more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I got these based on the decent reviews I found on the website for this product.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are more purple than blue, as pictured, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> Totally took the smell away with just regular antibacterial soap :)</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a decent buy.</li>
            <li> decent brushes considering the price.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a couple of brushes are decent.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my older sister two years ago.</li>
            <li> Did have a mild odor from packaging but when left out odor disapated.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t as strong as I expected  </li>
            <li> Such soft high quality brushes for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are sorta pretty, do be aware when you purchase these that colors do vary from pictures a little, mine are more of a baby blue with purple tips.</li>
            <li> I love that some are stiff and some are very pliable.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the case the brushes came in smells strongly of plastic and gave me a bit of a headache, so i won&#x27;t be keeping that bit but other than that it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone who uses makeup often.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Would probably be better suited to a very young teen or for someone who is JUST starting out experimenting with their makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the little ones way</li>
            <li> These are great brushes, just one thing I didn&#x27;t like, the weird looking brush, I have no clue what its called.</li>
            <li> Theyre soft and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Worth the price definitely!!!!</li>
            <li> well, I really have to pile it on the brushes to get the amount I normally used with my old set of Mary Kay brushes.</li>
            <li> It had the smell of a normal new brush.</li>
            <li> When I received these they smelled like strong sour glue.</li>
            <li> No strange smell...works well as a first makeup brush set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner, and some of the brushes seem a little soft, but that&#x27;s ok for me.</li>
            <li> I bought these needing new brushes and not wanting to spend a lot.</li>
            <li> Just rinse them off, as you would any new brush before using it on your face.</li>
            <li> Since I am new to trying on make up</li>
            <li> The smell is just from the brushes being packaged and processed, it smells like new plastic and goes away after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I recieved them and they still look brand new.  </li>
            <li> No big deal, but whoever is opening the boxes at the warehouse should be more careful.</li>
            <li> The case is convenient and there&#x27;s obviously a wide range of brushes for those who do use more than the basic brushes.</li>
            <li> They are also very soft (something I noticed when I had to pull the cover up on two of them which I should not have had to do) and they are seemingly well made (have not taken out of the package) but they are not what I bought.</li>
            <li> Very soft pliable brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft as well.</li>
            <li> Very soft which I like</li>
            <li> she says the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of brushes and they are very soft bristled, and not cheap at all!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that you should be aware of is the smell.</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t look exactly like the photo (they are white with purple tips).  </li>
            <li> I mostly use the small angled brush for shaping (and shading in)</li>
            <li> these are soooo incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> The reason I gave only a 4 rating is because I did not receive the exact brushes that are shown.</li>
            <li> I received brushes with light purple that fades to dark purple.</li>
            <li> Just like professional brushes !</li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> They do shed a little&lt;br /&gt; bit, but it is not excessive.</li>
            <li> Yup they smell but only at first.</li>
            <li> so maybe that makes it worth it in the long run...</li>
            <li> I liked a few of the brushes but many of these fell apart after a few uses and were very rough feeling.</li>
            <li> They were very quick and very polite, sending me a replacement set of brushes just a few days later.</li>
            <li> I am not typically a review writer but WOW!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if I would use them professionally</li>
            <li> The brushes were soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li> She loves them and has been using them  frequently</li>
            <li> which was one of my biggest pet peeves about my old brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them out and have had no problems so far.</li>
            <li> My set came in and are completely purple.  </li>
            <li> But I have to say they&#x27;re really soft</li>
            <li> There are extremely soft, I am in</li>
            <li> I am not a professional make up artist, so I assume for that a higher quality would be required if I was.</li>
            <li> far as the brushes go, they are way beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> The brushes are too soft to get any product on them.</li>
            <li> I was initially worried about the smell I kept reading about in reviews, but that wasn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems so far</li>
            <li> Stayed soft  after cleaning</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something chic and soft (oh let me rephrase that...too soft)</li>
            <li> The smell was gone after they aired out a while.</li>
            <li> I even asked a professional artist(makeup) and she was clueless.....</li>
            <li> They are so soft to the touch and feel even nicer on the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace an old brush set.</li>
            <li> They are incredibly soft, and the color doesn&#x27;t come off act brushing.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it professional.</li>
            <li> They offer her every imaginable brush to keep her busy for hours.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft.</li>
            <li> The netting is not sewn completely on the bottom of some of the slots allowing the brushes to fall through.</li>
            <li> The bristle brushes are extremely soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li> It smells like an old factory smell.</li>
            <li> and there are no fluffy eyeshadow brushes for blending.</li>
            <li> the brushes are soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m far to picky, I know.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have used almost all of the brushes so far, and the quality is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> Aired them out for a week</li>
            <li> will order again when these start to get old.</li>
            <li> Speaking of washing them, They DO have a very pungent smell of paint or dye as you open the package</li>
            <li> im 20 years old</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really cute, the only problem I have with them is that there isn&#x27;t a blending brush or a crease fluffy brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for years and only one has broken good buy</li>
            <li> However, the problem was easily solved by wiping down the entire makeup case with a clorox disinfecting wipe (and drying it with a paper towel), and carefully washing each brush with warm water and antibacterial dial hand soap (and lying them flat to dry).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the case smells very strongly of paint.</li>
            <li> but I just twist them back down and they seem fine for awhile.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you if they are high or low quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommend especially for this price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my old standbys until I can spring for a new M.K. set.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This product was a personal purchase at the normal retail price.</li>
            <li> There was a little smell but after a quick wash it evantually went away</li>
            <li> /&gt;my advice-pull brush from the Pouch Bag Case and spray them gently with alcohol and allow them  to dry -odor disappears&lt;br /&gt;Pouch</li>
            <li> and that is a major plus.</li>
            <li> and I am not due to get them until the jan 10th - jan 28th.</li>
            <li> but again, as some other reviewers were saying, the powder brushes are a bit too soft and don&#x27;t pick up much product.</li>
            <li> Loose bristles occasionally come out at first.</li>
            <li> they are a long lasting product and it arrived really fast.</li>
            <li> Soft enough and the hairs don&#x27;t repeatedly fall off when using the brushes on your face.</li>
            <li> The face brushes barely apply anything.</li>
            <li> I actually only wanted an eyeshadow brush set and this item far superceded my expectations.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t use any of the larger brushes for contouring or liquid foundation because they&#x27;re way too soft and not dense at all, they just bend when you try to blend.</li>
            <li> Also, one of the magnetic closures is barely attached.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 year old daughter, who thinks she&#x27;s the next contestant on &amp;#34;Face Off&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> The case does kind of have a weird smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i absolutely love this company, i did have a bit of a problem with a broken brush and within hours the problem was solved.</li>
            <li> Anyways, they do have a little bit of a smell, but I know that is just from coming straight to me brand new.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell at first, but it does fade and really isn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> For less than a fiver, I got all these pretty brushes AND a carrying case?</li>
            <li> Of course, I expected it to smell like plastic or paint, but it&#x27;s brand new!  </li>
            <li> I only used one or two brushes then went back to my old ones.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that that was the only brush that was bent, especially since it is a roll up case.</li>
            <li> This brush set contains every brush you would need to complete a look without spending a lot of money for the more expensive name brand brushes.</li>
            <li> did have a funny smell when I received them, but nothing a little baby shampoo couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> All the  smaller \\&quot;eyeshadow\\&quot; brushes are all flat there is no fluffy, blending eyeshadow brush</li>
            <li> I like the fluffy brushes, the eyeshadow brushes are pretty meh</li>
            <li> The brushes were very soft and was everything I expected according to the product description.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality (not super expensive) set of brushes</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for my little sister who is really into makeup now.</li>
            <li> This product has a good side to it and a bad side.</li>
            <li> As many others have rated this product low, the smell is real and bad.</li>
            <li> I did not expect much from something so cheap, but I was sooo wrong!</li>
            <li> well as having been double packaged for security so that it would not get bent and break the brushes or that it would get wet and ruin the cover color (if that&#x27;s possible which since I&#x27;m a first time buyer I&#x27;m not sure)</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for pretty things</li>
            <li> They seem well made, like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are basically the same brushes as another set I reviewed, white with pink tips--must be made by the same factory.</li>
            <li> fact that a few brushes were bent and being brand new</li>
            <li> Brushes are a little too soft, not porous enough for loose powders.</li>
            <li> I can understand it being the holiday season, but i ordered other products the same time i odered the brushes and got ALL but these 3 -5 days later, 2 weeks BEFORE CHristmas...</li>
            <li> Other&#x27;s have bought this same set after seeing the quality and shape that mine are still in after multiple use</li>
            <li> Maybe a little too soft</li>
            <li> Some people complained about the smell, I didn&#x27;t really smell what they were talking about.</li>
            <li> but if it was a gift for someone else I probably would not have given it to them because of the fact the brush pouch was in such rough shape</li>
            <li> They came 5 days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> in reality they are almost white and the purple can be mistaken by pink (depending on the person).</li>
            <li> Package came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Its a complete kit for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time actually earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> WAY to long just for some makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these because the brushes I had before were too rough and scratched my face, and I definitely don&#x27;t have that problem with these!</li>
            <li> The smell that other viewers have mentioned is the plastic holders they are placed in Not the actual brushes.</li>
            <li> 2 days earlier than my expected arrival day!</li>
            <li> It makes them different from any other brushes.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers.</li>
            <li> I mean they won&#x27;t irritate your skin as some of them do, especially if you have sensitive skin/acne or rash problems.</li>
            <li> After just a month of using them every single one had fallen out of the handle.</li>
            <li> They are soft but hold very little makeup.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is how long it took to ship, but still reached me before the set date, which really wasn&#x27;t bad with free shipping.</li>
            <li> brissles are waay too soft and smell like eggs :/</li>
            <li> No problem with loose brush hairs at all.  </li>
            <li> One of the brush heads came loose from the handle</li>
            <li> No particular problems.</li>
            <li> The feather/fanning brush was missing a ton of hair along with others it also to SO long to finally arrive.</li>
            <li> I use them all the time, and the smell isn&#x27;t very strong or bad like the other comments say.</li>
            <li> I have used them for a month and haven&#x27;t had any problems with rough bristles or loose brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The picture makes it look a little blue, but it&#x27;s all purple with darker purple tips.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set because of my 13 yr old that loses everything.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews before purchasing these, one of the common problems is that the color was not the same.</li>
            <li> but I just tried to use the eye shadow brushes and they pick up absolutely no makeup.</li>
            <li> but a few weeks later they began to Break off:/.I</li>
            <li> The only thing missing would be a foundation brush, but I bought a foundation brush from E.L.F for a dollar.</li>
            <li> I just grabbed a pink sharpie and masked it.</li>
            <li> However, this set does only include the essentials for everyday makeup...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest you buy  this unless only for the powder (fluffy) brushes.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t use it because it was so rough compared to these.</li>
            <li> I spent forever looking for quality brushes without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li> the smaller eyeshadow brushes just aren&#x27;t thick enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are so, so soft...not bristly or rough like the e.l.f brushes I had a few years back.</li>
            <li> my eyebrows and a few other smaller brushes for blending my concealer.</li>
            <li> Package made the brushes smell a little strange.</li>
            <li> Too soft, no good for blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews about how they smelled like paint.</li>
            <li> I ordered even though other reviews said so, but I ended up returning them.</li>
            <li> for the brushes, like other reviewers, they did have a plastic smell to them, but after a wash with some e.l.f.</li>
            <li> They make due for that ourpose.</li>
            <li> The fan brush is pretty useless as well.</li>
            <li> I think this is due to over use.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make any other</li>
            <li> I ordered based off the other reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other ones on amazon and they were either bulky or scratched my skin(Sensitive skin:D).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems some of the other reviews had.</li>
            <li> sometimes they get a little loose around the metal and wood connection</li>
            <li> There is 6 of the small flat brushes</li>
            <li> I thought since of the cheap price it would be bad quality</li>
            <li> my only complaint is the smell</li>
            <li> The bristles were too long and too thin for them to actually work.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that I wish there was at least one stiffer brush for applying liquid foundation or a really big poofy brush, but I have both of those separately.</li>
            <li> They are average quality and still working well.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft but the fan brsh is so thin</li>
            <li> I mean, I only got this set for like $13!</li>
            <li> Personally, Id freak if there was no smell because to me that would mean they weren&#x27;t and firsthand item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them almost a half year</li>
            <li> However, I did get a slightly bent brush, but it was the one that looks like a mascara wand</li>
            <li> /&gt;However there is a slight smell, so i suggest washing the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , i was expecting blue brushes and got plain purple!!</li>
            <li> Too stiff should have listened to the other rewrites...</li>
            <li> is no good, entirely flimsy, basically worthless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (how can you mess those up?)</li>
            <li> the fault of foil which they are tightly packed and also</li>
            <li> A little bit of glue will solve that problem and I will continue using them.</li>
            <li> but you can build color and blend with a little work.</li>
            <li> the little carrying case is cute.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are very few mishaps and it arrived AHEAD of schedule (due Wednesday the 10 and received Tuesday the 09)as</li>
            <li> seriously its called WASH the brushes and case if you want and once dry...</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;ve decided to use them for everyday wear instead of for my make up designing, that is alright.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes a few weeks before Christmas with no intentions of getting them before the holidays.</li>
            <li> so beware if you are buying as a gift - I would recommend opening the package and airing them out for a few days before wrapping them and giving them to someone.</li>
            <li> and i go through a lot of brushes everyday.</li>
            <li> and I dont wear heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll take that as not cheap.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any bristles come out, or anything wrong so far, and I have had the product for a couple of months now.</li>
            <li> the Purple  Pouch Bag Case -which smells like chemical waste</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using these everyday, or else they might fall apart.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice but the smell is terrible.  </li>
            <li> They are way to stiff.</li>
            <li> They are a little small</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty worthless.</li>
            <li> None of them are broken and I&#x27;ve used every single brush.</li>
            <li> They had a slight smell but it was a new plastic smell not as bad as some of the reviews had read.</li>
            <li> It went away soon after opening them and really was not that bad.</li>
            <li> NO MORE BRISTLES IN AND ON SOMETHING I AM</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and would like to speak to the seller privately for further details.</li>
            <li> (some of which may ruin brushes/friends using my makeup stuff usually doesn&#x27;t end well).</li>
            <li> but not top of the line.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> was not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> I always track my packages and watch their journey, not sure why, but I do.</li>
            <li> , there is a weird smell, sort of like industrial paint - I think it is the case itself, but I just opened everything up and left it on my bathroom</li>
            <li> Not sure I want to use this on my face.</li>
            <li> So when I got them in the mail today (I ordered them like four days ago), I was so anxious to see what they were like.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with blue brushes..</li>
            <li> to so it is hard to put eyeliner on.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are too hard to use.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the crazy odor some people complain about</li>
            <li> but .. honestly -do not recommend</li>
            <li> I was hesitant and assumed before purchasing the brushes that they might be of horrible quality since they were cheap (11ish bucks), but since they weren&#x27;t pricey, I just decided.....</li>
            <li> I NEEDED A SMALL ONE AND DECIDED TO TRY MY EYE LINER BRUSH!</li>
            <li> Heck i could use the small brushes for my paintings!</li>
            <li> but the texture is not good for make up application..at least for my preference.</li>
            <li> I received the purple brushes instead of the blue/purple ones I ordered and the seller refunded half the price since I got the wrong ones.</li>
            <li> The brushes are too hard and poor quality.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is the case smells bad</li>
            <li> but fall apart after a few weeks&lt;br /&gt;nice color but very poor quality...............</li>
            <li> But the smell was weird :/.</li>
            <li> The handles of my brushes are a dark maroon color that does not match the tops of the brushes or the carrying case which is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is there is no eyeshadow blending brush!! :(</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes have frayed within one use which is a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not great quality bushes and</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any shedding.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> i even sprayed perfume on it because it smell really bad but other than thaT  </li>
            <li> very soft but smelled badly :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the case.</li>
            <li> they do smell weird, but like another reviewer stated, it goes away if you wash them.</li>
            <li> They do have a weird plastic smell to them which didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Got the wrong color</li>
            <li> It was weird.</li>
            <li> I did notice the larger brushes do shed somewhat, but nothing terrible.  </li>
            <li> &gt; The larger brushes are awful.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is they have a terrible chemical smell, I guess from the plastic inside.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> , I was wrong</li>
            <li> My only grievance about this kit is the horrible rubber/paint-like smell when I opened up the box.</li>
            <li> my assumption was SOOO wrong.</li>
            <li> One con would be that it had a faint paint smell (that faded)</li>
            <li> These brushes were very thin.</li>
            <li> Strange smell but nothing terrible.</li>
            <li> Sorry to write a bad review.</li>
            <li> I thought they were dirty.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the case it came in, the shiny purple, but for the price I couldn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> about which ones she uses because she&#x27;s afraid of ruining some of the nicer ones.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointing.</li>
            <li> You will NOT go wrong buying these brushes!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> , it was very faint.</li>
            <li> I must say this set is not so bad...  </li>
            <li> It is not as bad as others claim it to be.  </li>
            <li> but im kinda disappointed</li>
            <li> But I was disappointed that when I used them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now I  have every brush ill ever need for my make-up !!</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE when ladies whine and byotch about the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; of these things when they get them-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no make-up artist, I use grocery store brands and don&#x27;t do anything real crazy</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I should have known they would be terrible based on the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why people are so upset about some awful smell?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> I love them. They&#x27;re a lot better than what I had expected for the price. They may not be the BEST makeup brushes ever, but they&#x27;re definitely worth the money if you&#x27;re looking to try makeup brushes out, or if you&#x27;re just on a budget. :)</li>
            <li> they do smell weird, but like another reviewer stated, it goes away if you wash them. I used dawn and warm water. The brushes are great, and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with them not picking up color, even with my concealer palette, which is an issue for other brushes. Theyre not the best brushes in the world, but may be for the price. :)</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY CRAFTING, OVER THE YEARS I HAVE FOUND THE PAINT BRUSHES TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE,AND CHEAPLY MADE..ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO I NEEDED A SMALL ONE AND DECIDED TO TRY MY EYE LINER BRUSH! PERFECT...AND THESE ARE GOING TO BE TOO..NO MORE BRISTLES IN AND ON SOMETHING I AM MAKING..THEY WASH UP GREAT AND IF YOU CARE FOR THEM , THEY WILL LAST...</li>
            <li> These are true to color. They do have a paint smell but after washed are just fine. I don&#x27;t really like the case but will keep it for traveling.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  The brushes are so affordable and an all-around great value!  I recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> looks very low quality</li>
            <li> They do have a weird plastic smell to them which didn&#x27;t bother me. They are very soft and good quality but I don&#x27;t know if I would use them professionally that aside they do a descent job at applying make up. I would definately recommend if you need an inexpensive brush set.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and beautiful. i love the bag they came in and the color. the came before delivery dat so that was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;  my only complaint is the smell</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they were blue. They aren&#x27;t. They are purple. If I had known they were purple, I would not have bought them. They are a little small but since I&#x27;ve decided to use them for everyday wear instead of for my make up designing, that is alright. I am ok with the smell (after all they are brand new) and with the (as my inner Wednesday Addams said) barbie purple cover. I think that it is nice in fact and would look like a cute (if preppy) clutch. My issues are these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The color is not what I was shown in the pictures&lt;br /&gt;*The fact that a few brushes were bent and being brand new this is unacceptable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very few mishaps and it arrived AHEAD of schedule (due Wednesday the 10 and received Tuesday the 09)as well as having been double packaged for security so that it would not get bent and break the brushes or that it would get wet and ruin the cover color (if that&#x27;s possible which since I&#x27;m a first time buyer I&#x27;m not sure) so  brownie points for whoever packages and ships them. But who ever places the brushes in the cover and then wires them to the purchases has either made a huge mistake or who ever put the pictures up needs to fix this. They are also very soft (something I noticed when I had to pull the cover up on two of them which I should not have had to do) and they are seemingly well made (have not taken out of the package) but they are not what I bought. I am disappointed and would like to speak to the seller privately for further details.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great they blend makeup flawlessly. The smell that other viewers have mentioned is the plastic holders they are placed in Not the actual brushes. They are great brushes and the case easily fits anywhere LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> At first they were really good! But the smell was weird :/. After using them some, the bristles started to shed. The fan brush would shed so much that it would get all in the pack and in my eyes! This product has a good side to it and a bad side.</li>
            <li> Product is as described, and my daughter loved them!</li>
            <li> Very good makeup kit.</li>
            <li> My daughter liked the brushes and the pouch.  They are very soft, would be nice if they were labeled.</li>
            <li> Great starter brushes!!</li>
            <li> i like it but wish there were more brushes.</li>
            <li> Too stiff should have listened to the other rewrites... like 5brushes are useable and that&#x27;s the big brushes and fan brushes</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice sturdy soft the pouch was a bit wrinkled and old looking not bad for the price but if it was a gift for someone else I probably would not have given it to them because of the fact the brush pouch was in such rough shape</li>
            <li> Nice, some brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes were soft and luxurious. They didn&#x27;t shed at all and they were easy to clean. The case is super helpful and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> The brushes are lovely, has a strange scent, but they are of very good quality.  So happy i went with this item!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve bought a set, and I really like these. It has just about everything I need.</li>
            <li> Daughter was very happy...she is not use to so many different size brushes!</li>
            <li> These are great brushes, just one thing I didn&#x27;t like, the weird looking brush, I have no clue what its called. But there were only 10 bristles in that brush......</li>
            <li> Okay, so I needed these brushes ASAP and I got them yesterday, I ordered them on Sunday and the delivery was right on point. The only thing that I did not like was the STRONG plastic smell of the case, all I recommend is letting it  air out on the porch for about two hours, the brushes themselves don&#x27;t really smell though. I still give these brushes 5 stars because they are WONDERFUL :) they are smooth and soft, no shedding whatsoever, and the color is gorgeous. You will NOT go wrong buying these brushes!</li>
            <li> I got my brush set in three days! 2 days earlier than my expected arrival day! That was awesome. Now the brushes feel of really good quality, very soft. All the  smaller \\&quot;eyeshadow\\&quot; brushes are all flat there is no fluffy, blending eyeshadow brush but I am okay with that. There is 6 of the small flat brushes all look the same just different sizes that is the only \\&quot;con\\&quot; for me but again I&#x27;m okay with that. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift and my sister loves them. They&#x27;re nice brushes and you do get what you pay for. I use Sigma, MAC, and Morphe brushes daily and these just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> These suck. Too flimsy to put makeup on.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it&#x27;s easy to use, it&#x27;s all there for you but the only thing I would change is the fact that they don&#x27;t have a large foundation brush. It&#x27;s good for a beginner but once you get more advanced, I suggest getting more professional ones.</li>
            <li> The brushes are delightful, they are soft and they look exactly how they look in the picture. The only downside is the bag that it comes in. It smells like paint, an extremely strong and unpleasing scent. However, you can always ditch the bag. If you&#x27;re looking for cheap but good brushes you should get these.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for my little sister who is really into makeup now. Very nice brushes for the price. I had read other reviews about how they smelled like paint. It did have that smell but it wasn&#x27;t as strong as I expected  and I think its actually the case more so with the odor. She loves them and has been using them  frequently and she&#x27;s still very happy about them. great starter set for someone just starting out.</li>
            <li> They are working great</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple days and am really enjoying them! The smell everyone is describing is kind of plastic-y and goes away pretty quick. The brushes are very soft and I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding yet which was one of my biggest pet peeves about my old brushes. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I love the brush but im kinda disappointed, i was expecting blue brushes and got plain purple!! I love the little ones way more then the big brushes. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is great for the price. I&#x27;m a beginner, and some of the brushes seem a little soft, but that&#x27;s ok for me. Love the bag and the color of the brushes. I&#x27;ve tried them out and have had no problems so far.</li>
            <li> Awesome Set and So Pretty. Bought 2. One for the girlfriend and I. Thanks</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews for brush sets and settled on this one.  It does have a strong smell at first, but it does fade and really isn&#x27;t that bad.  The brushes seem to be a very good quality, very flexible.  They do a better job than some more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve used.  My set came in and are completely purple.  The picture makes it look a little blue, but it&#x27;s all purple with darker purple tips.  I like it and it allows you to easily see how much make up is on the brush.  I would recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality (not super expensive) set of brushes</li>
            <li> havent had any issued with the brush. they are a long lasting product and it arrived really fast. love the color my fave is the angle brush. perfect for up comming/ just starting to be a MUA</li>
            <li> very soft and tender drushes even if they are not natural the quality is the best , the one who doent know much will never finde out that its not natural product! really great</li>
            <li> Came as photographed but I just tried to use the eye shadow brushes and they pick up absolutely no makeup. The brushes are too hard and poor quality.  I bought them after reading the reviews and thought I was going to be getting amazing brushes but that was not the case.  I would not recommend buying these...I can&#x27;t wait till the brushes I just ordered from elf come in.</li>
            <li> Got the wrong color but it was okay. Happy.</li>
            <li> I got these based on the decent reviews I found on the website for this product.  But I was disappointed that when I used them.  The bristles were too long and too thin for them to actually work.  For example to apply blush, I had to hold the bristles halfway to apply and still that was was ineffective.  I haven&#x27;t used all of them but I probably won&#x27;t.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but still the previews reviews made me think otherwise.  I&#x27;ll go back an buy Mary Kay brushes any day even if way more expensive.</li>
            <li> Soft, great variety, and I love that some are stiff and some are very pliable. Would definitely buy again---it also helps so my roommates don&#x27;t take my brushes!!!</li>
            <li> very soft but smelled badly :( I ordered even though other reviews said so, but I ended up returning them.</li>
            <li> Had a strong smell to them but other than that they&#x27;re ok</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes a few weeks before Christmas with no intentions of getting them before the holidays. But a month later I still hadn&#x27;t received them, so I contacted the seller. They were very quick and very polite, sending me a replacement set of brushes just a few days later. I was very happy with the customer service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for the brushes, like other reviewers, they did have a plastic smell to them, but after a wash with some e.l.f. brush cleaner they were fine. the bristles are super soft and great for eye shadow. but again, as some other reviewers were saying, the powder brushes are a bit too soft and don&#x27;t pick up much product. only complaint is that the case the brushes came in smells strongly of plastic and gave me a bit of a headache, so i won&#x27;t be keeping that bit but other than that it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Great set, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my mom and she loves them. She says they work great and are awesome.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are extremely soft and so cute. They came 5 days earlier than expected. The carrying case is also a plus. I am in love with these brushes !!!!</li>
            <li> When I received these they smelled like strong sour glue. It was weird. I&#x27;m sure as hell not using that on my face. And as for the quality, the bristles were coming out right away. There were bristles all over the inside of the case and not all of the brushes had coverings. Mine looked like it was opened by someone or tampered with. Sending back for sure.</li>
            <li> I got these brush as a gift to myself being a makeup artist. They made the wedding party look wonderful</li>
            <li> Received these brushes today....great deal for the price.  I did notice the larger brushes do shed somewhat, but nothing terrible.  They work great and are beautiful!  I don&#x27;t apply makeup every day and certainly not a lot of it when I do, so these will be wonderful for me.  If you apply makeup every day and use a lot of technique, I would recommend in investing in some higher end brushes.  Also, they definitely smell strongly like plastic/paint when they first come out of the packaging, so beware if you are buying as a gift - I would recommend opening the package and airing them out for a few days before wrapping them and giving them to someone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting some brushes. These are perfect now I always want to do my make up. Material is great and the brushes are awesome.</li>
            <li> Got the brushes today. Nice collection, but man... the pouch stinks. It literally gave me a headache... I&#x27;ve ordered a special brushes cleaner because I want to wash them first before I use them. But I have to say they&#x27;re really soft and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying them out. I don&#x27;t like the color though, but that&#x27;s just my two cents</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!!! There are extremely soft, I am in love&amp;lt;3 There was a little smell but after a quick wash it evantually went away</li>
            <li> bristles are real hair and i simply love the color combination! I&#x27;m a beauty student and i go through a lot of brushes everyday. got these as extras and now they&#x27;re my favorite! :)&lt;br /&gt;*one side note. in the picture the bristles look blue and purple. in reality they are almost white and the purple can be mistaken by pink (depending on the person). i still love them ^^</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item! I love the variety of brushes and they are very soft bristled, and not cheap at all!</li>
            <li> For the price, the quality is pretty decent.  The brushes are more purple than blue, as pictured, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  I have used them for a month and haven&#x27;t had any problems with rough bristles or loose brush heads.  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this set.</li>
            <li> My friend is a makeup artist so I bought this as a gift for a fashion show she was doing.  I never used them myself but they were gorgeous and felt soft. The case was very nice. She did say two of the brushes were unusable because they were too soft to pick up the makeup, but she loved them and even posted them on Instagram in a nice photo spread.</li>
            <li> Brushes look exactly as pic. Brushes are a little too soft, not porous enough for loose powders. Brushes do not pick up enough pigment for my taste. They are nice enough for traveling which is what they were bought for. They make due for that ourpose. And yes, there is a chemical smell at first, but it did dissipate after afew days.</li>
            <li> I must say this set is not so bad...  Some brushes are good for practicing make up applications.  When you receive them, you do have to air them for a while because they do have a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> I BROUGHT THIS FOR A PHOTO SHOOT AND THIS WORKED PERFECT. I WILL BUY AGAIN. GREAT PRODUCT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> Not great quality bushes and if you let the case air out, it&#x27;s a great case.</li>
            <li> Loved the color however there a little to soft for me but still Use able and I wish it came with a eyeahadow blending brush.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I had no doubt when buying because of all the good reviews, so to be able to write a good review for myself is amazing. The hair is &amp;uuml;ber soft and the color is very vibrant and pretty. The only thing is that you should be aware of is the smell. When you open the package, it sort of smells as spray paint. It&#x27;s okay if you wash them before using (which you should to prevent getting bacteria on the face). Other than that its a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try these, but they worked out awesome. I am not a professional make up artist, so I assume for that a higher quality would be required if I was. The brushes do not shed and clean easily and that is a major plus. The package does need to be aired out once you open it, it has a strong chemical odor.  I would recommend these to anyone as well worth the money</li>
            <li> I love them! First they came quickly. They are a perfect size. There super soft, the color is so pretty and the the little pouch it comes with is super cute. If you&#x27;re into make up, they are a must !</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good brushes but kinda seems like a lot of the same brushes just different sizes but everything you need to do your make up flawless (:</li>
            <li> Super soft and work so great! They don&#x27;t lose their shape after you wash them either. Oh and to get rid of the funky smell everyone was talking about, just wash them before use! Totally took the smell away with just regular antibacterial soap :)</li>
            <li> This is one of the cheapest makeup brush sets on Amazon so it&#x27;s a decent buy. The brushes are really pretty and the bristles and soft and get the job done, however, the tip came off one of the brushes that I didn&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> smells not that good but still cool. like the bag and those purple brushes. thank you ! love it awee!</li>
            <li> These brushes are cheap and for this price, what can you really expect? I love the bigger brushes for blush application but the smaller eyeshadow brushes just aren&#x27;t thick enough to do the job. The bristles don&#x27;t flex the way I&#x27;m used to so it is hard to put eyeliner on. 3 stars because the large brushes are awesome and the smaller ones need work.</li>
            <li> decent brushes considering the price. No particular problems. Soft enough and the hairs don&#x27;t repeatedly fall off when using the brushes on your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this set because of my 13 yr old that loses everything. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the brushes and I love the purple case!</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t look exactly like the photo (they are white with purple tips).  I bought them for a good price so I will keep them</li>
            <li> Super smooth, no loose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it, and I&#x27;ve had sets that costed more that weren&#x27;t this high quality.</li>
            <li> This brush set reminds me the make up brushes you use to get when you were like 5. The face brushes barely apply anything. The only thing good about this set is the spolie for your eyebrows and the eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> Just received this product yesterday and I&#x27;m in love.  Of course, I expected it to smell like plastic or paint, but it&#x27;s brand new!  It is not as bad as others claim it to be.  I&#x27;m sure the smell will go away with time.  Can not wait to start applying make up. :)</li>
            <li> I Liked this product. They are pretty brushes. I only wish they were numbered. I&#x27;m a beginner to using them.</li>
            <li> So I used to wear make up a lot but started working in a kitchen after graduating culinary school and had to stop--the makeup was just melting away and making my face greasy. However, I thought it was just because I was wearing makeup and not because of the way I applied it--wrong!  Using brushes to apply my foundation, finishing powder, and eyeshadow (instead of using my fingers and the flimsy sponge that came with the powder) has increased their longevity and made it possible for me to wear makeup again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brushes go, they are way beyond my expectations. For less than a fiver, I got all these pretty brushes AND a carrying case? Amazing. The brushes themselves are so, so soft...not bristly or rough like the e.l.f brushes I had a few years back. I feel like these will last a good long time especially since I&#x27;m going to keep them in this nice case and not laid out on the counter where the cats can nibble at the bristles (why do cats love doing that so much? Weirdos.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is that when I opened the package the entire thing REEKED of chemical--like, nail polish and nail polish remover mixed together. If you are sensitive to smells, make sure and open and leave these in a well-ventilated area for a day or two before using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, no complaints. I can&#x27;t wait to take the whole package for a spin when I put on makeup for a night out!</li>
            <li> This product is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller brushes, are reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual case it comes in is no good, entirely flimsy, basically worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The larger brushes are awful. Too soft, no good for blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t shed, they came on time, but overall, good quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy ELF&#x27;s foundation and blush brushes ($3 each at target) to replace the largest 3 and you are golden.</li>
            <li> Very soft pliable brushes. Great range for almost all applications. Best of all, I liked the fact when it&#x27;s described as 16 pcs they aren&#x27;t including the case as a piece. The set I received didn&#x27;t come with any kind of funky smell or dust in the brushes. They were clean with a vibrant color. Definitely worth the $11 I paid and I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone looking for very useable brushes for a great price.</li>
            <li> I actually only wanted an eyeshadow brush set and this item far superceded my expectations. It is a full brush set for foundation, blush, eyeshadow, etc. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star is the smell once I opened the package but the set looks great, the brushes feel soft and it will more then do the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for what it is. They come with an interesting factory smell, the first night I just let them air out that took care of that. I like the fluffy brushes, the eyeshadow brushes are pretty meh but I just bought the cheap set for costume makeup anyways (some of which may ruin brushes/friends using my makeup stuff usually doesn&#x27;t end well). They&#x27;ll be fine for my purposes. Would be a decent first set for someone just getting started. Nothing fabulous but do well for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the color of the brushes, they are as vibrant as they were in the picture. They apply makeup smoothly.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and affordable - you can be your own make up artist!  Pick a brush, any brush!  You&#x27;ve got them all handy in a great travel pouch!</li>
            <li> Almost too pretty to use. They do smell like paint for the first week or so. The bristles are super soft.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a couple of brushes are decent. I mostly use the small angled brush for shaping (and shading in) my eyebrows and a few other smaller brushes for blending my concealer. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty worthless. The brushes are too soft to get any product on them. However, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I mean, I only got this set for like $13! What do you really expect? The fan brush is pretty useless as well. I gave it to my boyfriend to dust his gaming collectors items. I&#x27;m not even joking!</li>
            <li> The very excellent deal and I am pleased to deal with you again, and I will recommend my friends to this product.</li>
            <li> I was initially worried about the smell I kept reading about in reviews, but that wasn&#x27;t really a problem. It went away soon after opening them and really was not that bad. I think it is from the vinyl case that they are in. Anyway - these are decent brushes and there is a good variety of sizes and thicknesses. The larger ones have their own covers over the brush portion and each brush has a pocket to slide into in the case. I wouldn&#x27;t call them &#x27;professional&#x27; brushes, just because they are not anything super fantastic. They are basic brushes - better than the freebies that come with make up but not top of the line. The one thing I have noticed is that some of the heads come off of the wooden handles. This has happened to three of my brushes - one of them I have never even used! A little bit of glue will solve that problem and I will continue using them. If I did make-up for a living or had to clean my brushes more frequently than normal, I would not use these. However for normal daily use doing my own make-up, they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Ive been searching on Amazon.com for cosmetic brushes. I love this set because it came with two brushes that were the same size that I really needed and this really works well with all of my eyeshadows. The brushes are very soft as well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> after reading all the reviews I decided to go ahead and buy this brush set. I have had no problems so far and I am satisfied with my purchase. They do the job just fine for me. I am not a makeup expert and I dont wear heavy makeup. I only wear powder pressed makeup, eye liner and eye shadow. The brushes make applying the eye shadow very easy because of the variety. So if you are a beginner like me then this will work just fine. Just make sure you buy something to remove makeup from the brushes when you use them</li>
            <li> very cute and good for price ! I thought they would be bigger but they are good for traveling or carrying along in purse.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes are pretty good which makes me very happy.  No problem with loose brush hairs at all.  I feel like I have way too many of the same brush though.  There is not enough variety in the brush sizes and angles for the eye-shadow and concealer brushes.  I can&#x27;t tell which are for what and some just feel like extra.  I want every brush to have a purpose.  The color of the case is too disco for me.  It could look more high quality in velvet or some other material.  The case makes them look cheap.</li>
            <li> Very soft which I like but makeup doesn&#x27;t get on the brush as I would like.</li>
            <li> This brush set is well worth the money! I love the color of the brushes, and they are actually really soft! My only complaint is that the case smells very strongly of paint. It is pretty cute, though!</li>
            <li> I like these for the most part but I can&#x27;t use any of the larger brushes for contouring or liquid foundation because they&#x27;re way too soft and not dense at all, they just bend when you try to blend. :/</li>
            <li> Pretty but not super great quality brushes. Would probably be better suited to a very young teen or for someone who is JUST starting out experimenting with their makeup.</li>
            <li> good set, for price though i would&#x27;ve liked more of the little brushes to have been useful</li>
            <li> the brush hairs don&#x27;t seem to be those colors, but they still are a very pretty set, and a very cute wrap case that I love. I love the softness of the brushes, a must for me to have. sometimes they get a little loose around the metal and wood connection but I just twist them back down and they seem fine for awhile. I&#x27;ve had them almost a half year and I&#x27;m still fond of them &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Brush were soft and looked great. I bought these as a gift and she loved them. They had a slight smell but it was a new plastic smell not as bad as some of the reviews had read.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it was great..but a few weeks later they began to Break off:/.I was not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and work amazing and pretty colors. I would recommend them to anyone starting out. I love them</li>
            <li> Good quality. Stayed soft  after cleaning</li>
            <li> I enjoy my brushes so much! However some of the brush heads came off the wooden handle. I simply glued them back together, problem solved. I do recommend these brushes, cheap and good quality.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are too hard to use. The face brushes are amazing. I love them! The only thing missing would be a foundation brush, but I bought a foundation brush from E.L.F for a dollar. So no big deal. The brushes aren&#x27;t labeled either. You get what you pay for. A great starter brush set!</li>
            <li> These are the most amazing makeup brushes. I was pretty nervous about them because they were so inexpensive, and then I wasn&#x27;t sure I really wanted to wait so long for them to be shipped (took almost a month), but I am in love! My makeup goes on so smoothly and these brushes are so soft. The hairs do not shed (one of my biggest pet peeves). I am not typically a review writer but WOW! Buy these</li>
            <li> Not what i&#x27;m looking for. Very nice in color (brushes and bag) but the texture is not good for make up application..at least for my preference. If you&#x27;re looking for something chic and soft (oh let me rephrase that...too soft) then this is for you. I only used one or two brushes then went back to my old ones. You get what you pay for is damn right! Heck i could use the small brushes for my paintings! So i&#x27;m not butt hurt..k bye!</li>
            <li> I got these as a gift for someone, and they came on time and all that. They are fine brushes. The only drawback is they have a terrible chemical smell, I guess from the plastic inside. I just let them sit open for a couple days. The smell was gone after they aired out a while.</li>
            <li> These brushes were very thin. It looked like they were thicker by the photo. Very cheaply made. I guess that&#x27;s what you get for the price. Sorry to write a bad review. Wish it was more suitable for me to use.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, holds together and cleans well. I&#x27;m very much enjoying all the brushes with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these needing new brushes and not wanting to spend a lot. I love the color and feel of them. They were shipped fast, but they do smell heavy of plastic. I like that they all come individually wrapped so the bristles don&#x27;t get bent out of shape. Maybe if I leave them out the smell will go away.</li>
            <li> They were beautiful when received but one or two months after purchase I started seeing streaks of color showing up on my face. So I washed the brushes cause I thought they were dirty. After that they were bleeding color onto my face every time I used them. Maybe you need a sealant or something on them but I had to throw mine away. I even asked a professional artist(makeup) and she was clueless..... I&#x27;m disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these brushes. The color is nice and the texture is great. I do recommend these to anyone that is looking for a nice set of brushes at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I do body art and faux tattoos, so I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of money on makeup brushes. They tend to get thrashed after a while. But THESE brushes are GREAT! They don&#x27;t seem cheap at all and they are SUPER soft. I checked them all carefully to make sure they are secure on the handle and the brush heads are not loose. The hairs are staying put. The colors are awesome. The handles match the metallic case. Nice looking case. (Except somebody slit the outside of mine with an Xacto, probably from opening the box). Mine came in an envelope, so that wasn&#x27;t me. I just grabbed a pink sharpie and masked it. No big deal, but whoever is opening the boxes at the warehouse should be more careful. Some folks wouldn&#x27;t stand for that. Me, I just need the brushes to be sturdy and they are so I&#x27;m happy. 5 Stars despite the scratch.</li>
            <li> It is a great makeup kit for a novice MUA. The bristles, however, have been coming out. I think this is due to over use.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes. They did have an odor at first but I just let them air out for a day or two and they were fine. Definitely not the crazy odor some people complain about, it was very faint. I&#x27;m no make-up artist, I use grocery store brands and don&#x27;t do anything real crazy so these are great for me. I couldn&#x27;t tell you if they are high or low quality but the bristles haven&#x27;t started falling out so I&#x27;ll take that as not cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never spend hundreds on store bought brushes ever again!!  These are amazing and I all the sizes I need in this one pack.  They are great quality and I&#x27;m in love with them and the great pouch they come in.  Highly highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This set is amazing. I did not expect much from something so cheap, but I was sooo wrong! I will admit there was a plastic smell but after washing there was no smell. When I use these brushes I feel like a pro! My friends noticed a difference in how my make-up was perfectly blended and it is because of these!! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I loved this. so amazing I loved the brushes, definetly buy this. such a amazing product, neatly wrapped, brushes clean. recommending everyone to buy this!</li>
            <li> these makeup brushes are professional and actually a nice pretty color, they are also very soft. the case it comes in is also nice, but they do smell like plastic.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I had placed an order, for they were cheap and got all these great reviews! I always track my packages and watch their journey, not sure why, but I do. So I watched this go from New Jersey to Washington very quickly. It didn&#x27;t make any other stops(that I know of). Also, I ordered it on the 15th which was a Friday or Thursday and got here about a week later. Which was very nice. Anyways, they do have a little bit of a smell, but I know that is just from coming straight to me brand new. Also, when I opened them, I immediately fell in love. They are so soft to the touch and feel even nicer on the skin. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a blending brush for the eyes, so I ran over to my discount store and picked one up by elf for $0.99. They are a beautiful color, and the bag is so nice and lovely! However, I did get a slightly bent brush, but it was the one that looks like a mascara wand and it was so easy to straighten out. I was pleasantly surprised to see that that was the only brush that was bent, especially since it is a roll up case. Ok, enough with that stuff, but I do suggest to wash them before you use them. (I always use shampoo).</li>
            <li> The brushes are so fun colored, and soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smells like a came straight out of a factory but over all great brushes for an awesome price!!</li>
            <li> Great price! Great product!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They&#x27;re really cute, the only problem I have with them is that there isn&#x27;t a blending brush or a crease fluffy brush. Other than that they&#x27;re great! You get more than what you pay for :)</li>
            <li> Great starter brush kit for people who are learning to put on makeup or amateur makeup artists. Nice kit at a nice price. I like these brushes a lot. Great find!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace an old brush set. I liked a few of the brushes but many of these fell apart after a few uses and were very rough feeling.</li>
            <li> chemical smell kill by washing Brushes under warm water with soap. but fall apart after a few weeks&lt;br /&gt;nice color but very poor quality...............sorry but .. honestly -do not recommend</li>
            <li> I loved the color, and the price of this product once I first got it. My friend and I see makeup as an art, and are kind of crazy about brushes. Some people complained about the smell, I didn&#x27;t really smell what they were talking about. It had the smell of a normal new brush. Just rinse them off, as you would any new brush before using it on your face. They are incredibly soft, and the color doesn&#x27;t come off act brushing. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the case it came in, the shiny purple, but for the price I couldn&#x27;t complain. Along with the brush covers inside. I highly recommend this for anyone who uses makeup often. I haven&#x27;t had any bristles come out, or anything wrong so far, and I have had the product for a couple of months now.</li>
            <li> I really love the color of these brushes. It makes them different from any other brushes. Although they are beautiful, my fan brush seemed like it was to weak and the top part of the brush fell off. But overall the whole kit has been of great use, and the shiny purple pouch is just adorable.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and a great case. Love the color of them and would recommend them to others. Great product for the money</li>
            <li> I opened my package last evening and was very happy about what I had received, but when I took a whiff of the brush holder bag it took my breathe away and my step mothers (She actually kicked me out of her room because of the smell). I did set my brushes &amp; bag outside overnight so hopefully the smell will have subsided tremendously. I do love my brushes and recommend purchasing this though, but did give 4 stars because of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a lot of reviews about a slight smell, but maybe mine just had a more intense smell to it than others.</li>
            <li> Package came earlier than expected. Brushes are well made clean. Exactly what I expected. Easy to clean and the case is an added bonus no serching around for brushes in a draw.</li>
            <li> I bought these a week ago and recieved them in a week I was so happy with the shipping just how fast it was but I love the material of these brushes, its not rough but not too soft also they hold my eye shadow on very well and doesn&#x27;t crumble when you put it on your eyelid I&#x27;m going to be using them very frequently and can&#x27;t wait to try the looks that I want with the thinner bristle brushes :) I love this order</li>
            <li> soft, well to clean, beautiful color,&lt;br /&gt; perfectly protected against damage-four largest Brushes have a special clear overlay on top of the brush.NO shedding,&lt;br /&gt;made it very solidly and aesthetically&lt;br /&gt;bad smell about whom I read in some review -is unfortunately true -but the fault of foil which they are tightly packed and also the Purple  Pouch Bag Case -which smells like chemical waste&lt;br /&gt;my advice-pull brush from the Pouch Bag Case and spray them gently with alcohol and allow them  to dry -odor disappears&lt;br /&gt;Pouch Bag Case- I threw out-I can&#x27;t get rid of the smell .but even so I would not have used I keep my brush in ... glass cup.&lt;br /&gt;great price for great brushes</li>
            <li> I love the product, its great for the price, and the color is so pretty! I use them all the time, and the smell isn&#x27;t very strong or bad like the other comments say.</li>
            <li> perfect for me!! I just wanted some colorful brushes for my easy school make up and it worked perfectly some reviews say that the brushes shed but I haven&#x27;t had that problem and I have been using then since September</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft. Absolutely. Those are the two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they are also so floppy and flimsy that they don&#x27;t create good coverage with my powders and I can&#x27;t really use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the smaller brushes are good (how can you mess those up?) but None of the brushes are substantial enough to blend foundation or evenly disburse bronzer/blush. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> These are ok considering the price.  A good first brush set.</li>
            <li> For the price (~$10), these brushes are great! The purple is different and the brushes hold makeup well. Just make sure to clean them before use. The travel case makes it really easy to transport. However, this set does only include the essentials for everyday makeup... I wouldn&#x27;t call it professional. Still love, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for years and only one has broken good buy</li>
            <li> Our granddaughter loved these.  They offer her every imaginable brush to keep her busy for hours. LOL Great price.</li>
            <li> My expectations were blown away when I got this. I thought since of the cheap price it would be bad quality, I was wrong these are soooo incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> I like these brushes, definitely good value for the money. I wish the bigger brushes were a little firmer, but otherwise, this set is great. I use it daily with makeup application. The case is nice and compact.</li>
            <li> Product is great for this asking price. Very amazed at the quality, good starter set. Pretty brush colors as well. Purchased 2 sets, one for each of my daughters for Christmas, they are totally jazzed. These would be excellent for travel in case you don&#x27;t want to take your expensive set with you. Nice variety. I am recommending these.</li>
            <li> The brushless I received are white with purple tips, not blue with purple tips. They are soft but hold very little makeup.</li>
            <li> This brush set is great for a teenager just starting out wearing makeup. This brush set contains every brush you would need to complete a look without spending a lot of money for the more expensive name brand brushes. They are also very well constructed and I have not experienced any shedding.</li>
            <li> Great had weird smell though have not yet used yet but seem ok hope they are good nice enough. K</li>
            <li> I use it every day.  They brushes are FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> All the brushes were really great and I would recommend it to a friend if they did ask.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. I was hoping to buy a nice set that was cheap but would get the job done. The brushes don&#x27;t pick up eyeshadow and it goes on very flaky. I was very unimpressed. These brushes are of no use to me.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s good for how cheap it was. The feather/fanning brush was missing a ton of hair along with others it also to SO long to finally arrive. When I got it it smelt like burned plastic so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I were you.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted. Theyre soft and gentle on my skin. I would recommend anyone to purchase these.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this set at first, there&#x27;s no way brushes so cheap could be any good. WRONG! These brushes are super soft &amp; silky, absolutely adorable, I love the long handles, and they have (so far) never shed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there is a weird smell, sort of like industrial paint - I think it is the case itself, but I just opened everything up and left it on my bathroom counter overnight &amp; the smell went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish there was at least one stiffer brush for applying liquid foundation or a really big poofy brush, but I have both of those separately.</li>
            <li> Received these in the mail today. I ordered based off the other reviews but they&#x27;re just not doing it for me. Some of the brushes are very hard so they don&#x27;t pick up powders very well, they also don&#x27;t blend that great. I get better results from my dollar store brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my older sister two years ago. She loved and she still has it.</li>
            <li> For the buy it was a good deal. The brushes are really soft. The case does kind of have a weird smell. I would recommend this to someone looking for brushes</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft , works great and price is just so good (:</li>
            <li> brushes are wonderful. case is flimsier than wanted but im o.k with ha since im buying my on</li>
            <li> The case the brushes came in immediately started peeling as soon as I took it out of the box. That doesn&#x27;t bother too much, however. Some of the brushes have frayed within one use which is a little disappointing. I still use these brushes, but maybe only two times a month. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using these everyday, or else they might fall apart.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price but could be better quality</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND SERVICE</li>
            <li> This product was a personal purchase at the normal retail price. I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers. I did not purchase it in connection to a review company.  I have received no compensation for my review nor do I have any relationship with the seller or manufacturer of this product.  I have had a positive experience with this product it solved the issue that I purchased it for. I appreciate the opportunity to review this item</li>
            <li> Its a complete kit for everyday use. The brushes are soft.Since I am new to trying on make up I have to put the label on brushes but I really like this kit.</li>
            <li> The brushes are just fine for my daughter. I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the case. The netting is not sewn completely on the bottom of some of the slots allowing the brushes to fall through. Also, one of the magnetic closures is barely attached. Things that should have been caught in quality control from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;Over all - Just OK for what I paid.</li>
            <li> It good and get it on time</li>
            <li> i love this makeup brushes! the only thing is the case smells bad i even sprayed perfume on it because it smell really bad but other than thaT  i love it it got shipped fast and it looks just like the picture! they are super soft i highly recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li> Brushes were way toooo light, but i guess datz wat i paid for</li>
            <li> these brushes worked good, but mine broke in half, but you could easily hot glue them back together.</li>
            <li> Very cute, nice brushes. Obviously, there are better brushes out there, but I really felt I received pretty good quality for what I paid.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft but the fan brsh is so thin and I was using one of the eye brushes and it just fell apart on my face! I only had them for two days. So sad because all of the others were so good!</li>
            <li> brissles are waay too soft and smell like eggs :/</li>
            <li> This set is amazing!!! The bristle brushes are extremely soft and do not shed. I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend</li>
            <li> Awesome make up brush kit.  Every kind of cosmetic brush available.  A beautiful set for yourself or a gift.  Love the shaded colors!</li>
            <li> Good brushes, nice quality. Worth the price definitely!!!! Pretty damn awesome!! Like the color!! Like the case they came in!</li>
            <li> This is a very very good start up kit. I&#x27;ve bought other ones on amazon and they were either bulky or scratched my skin(Sensitive skin:D). This set is perfect sized and super soft. Maybe a little too soft but it&#x27;s okay because it still does a good job. These are better than buying the essential ELF set which is $10 for 10 barely usable brushes but this is $11(Give or take a bit) and pretty great! Shipping was fast and arrived on time with air bubble things to secure it. Nothing to complain about. One of my brushes had glue on the handle but when I was cleaning them, as I always do when I buy brushes online, it came right off. Super good buy and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews before purchasing these, one of the common problems is that the color was not the same. I received the same color advertised and they are beautiful! I am giving them for a gift and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, was happy with the product exactly as shown in pictures.  Shipped on time actually earlier than expected.  Would order again, definitely</li>
            <li> Overall, i love these brushes! They&#x27;re soft, yet durable, and my make up looks the best it ever has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However there is a slight smell, so i suggest washing the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i absolutely love this company, i did have a bit of a problem with a broken brush and within hours the problem was solved. I would definitely buy this product, and buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes in a glittery purple roll.,it seems to cover any makeup application imaginable, feels nice. The only drawback, however, was the nearly overwhelming odor of plastic upon opening. I had to let it off gas for 2 days.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to review the actual brushes, but they were ordered 10 days ago and I am not due to get them until the jan 10th - jan 28th. WAY to long just for some makeup brushes. I can understand it being the holiday season, but i ordered other products the same time i odered the brushes and got ALL but these 3 -5 days later, 2 weeks BEFORE CHristmas...smh... So i canceled my order and expect a FULL refund.</li>
            <li> For the price I like them the brushes do have a smell but after washing they were fine. This set is Perfect for a beginner and I love the color.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty good! They don&#x27;t shed and they look good. There was a smell but you just have to wash it for it to go away. I would would reccomend others to buy these brushes! ^_^</li>
            <li> The brushes are hard to clean, I didn&#x27;t think they would be as cheap but other than that they are very good brushes and case is good too.</li>
            <li> Great price, cute colors, soft brushes, but non appealing smell when you open the package. It smells like an old factory smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use all of them (my make up is pretty simple) but the ones I do use are amazing. They&#x27;re very soft and easy to clean. None of them have shed. The case is convenient and there&#x27;s obviously a wide range of brushes for those who do use more than the basic brushes.</li>
            <li> My sister loves these brushes. They&#x27;re beautiful! She&#x27;s actually quite picky about which ones she uses because she&#x27;s afraid of ruining some of the nicer ones. Thanks!</li>
            <li> So many brushes, for a great price!  No, these brushes won&#x27;t last forever, but for teens just starting to experiment with makeup, this is a great way to go.  Loved the color of the brushes and the carrying pouch.</li>
            <li> Good selection of brushes, my daughter has told me</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> I love them so far, which is since yesterday. Exact color and size as in pics. comes with little cover which is bright magenta in color, I like it. I touched the brushes and they feel so soft, I am sure they are good on your face too. I mean they won&#x27;t irritate your skin as some of them do, especially if you have sensitive skin/acne or rash problems. Love them, can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these as Christmas gifts.  They&#x27;re nicely packaged and made good stocking stuffers for my daughters-in-law.  Not as good as some make up brushes that are much more expensive but very good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Love my brushes they are very long but a lil too soft but they get the job done&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice brushes, but they&#x27;re cheap. I love all the different shapes and sizes. I&#x27;m really happy with them for the price I paid. I know they won&#x27;t last me too long, but I&#x27;m enjoying them in the meantime!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 year old daughter, who thinks she&#x27;s the next contestant on &amp;#34;Face Off&amp;#34;! A great collection of make-up brushes for any situation whether you&#x27;re getting ready for the ball or a Monster&#x27;s Ball! Great quality too!</li>
            <li> This is my second review after purchasing these brushes and they are garbage. After just a month of using them every single one had fallen out of the handle. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> This was a great product and I got it in a very timely manner. Includes every brush I would want in my brush kit!</li>
            <li> I like the variety of brushes in this kit, each of the brushes are soft to the touch and they clean easily without worry about the bristles falling out. And it&#x27;s for a great price. My only grievance about this kit is the horrible rubber/paint-like smell when I opened up the box. Before I began using it, I had to leave it out in the open hoping for the smell to go away but after a month there is still a hint of the smell.</li>
            <li> These are nice.  They are soft and feel great on your skin.  Pretty color and perfect for a young teen or a treat for a mom too.</li>
            <li> Very nice product with soft bristles and puts on make-up well. The reason I gave only a 4 rating is because I did not receive the exact brushes that are shown. I received brushes with light purple that fades to dark purple. When I order a product, I expect to get that exact product. Over all, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have not started using theses brushes yet, but I have opened them up and looked them over.  They are surprisingly soft for the cheap price.  The coloring of the top of the brushes is very pretty - bright, just like the pictures. The handles of my brushes are a dark maroon color that does not match the tops of the brushes or the carrying case which is disappointing.  The set has more brushes in it than I had wanted but with how cute they were and the price I couldn&#x27;t pass them up.  Overall I am pleased with the purchase and I am looking forward to having my matching brushes in use.</li>
            <li> These are super soft, high quality brushes. They seem well made, like they will last a long time. Defiantly worth the buy. The only complaint is how long it took to ship, but still reached me before the set date, which really wasn&#x27;t bad with free shipping. I roccoment these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this set! And such a great price!</li>
            <li> I really liked the packaging &amp; the brushes they&#x27;re soft &amp; pretty. The only thing I don&#x27;t like much is that the eyeshadow brushes don&#x27;t grasp the color super well (good enough though). I do love the eyebrow brushes though those are my favorite!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my neice, shes not new to makeup but new to having a full set of make up brushes, I was plesantly suprised with quality for price! Did have a mild odor from packaging but when left out odor disapated.Great gift idea! will reorder for anyone needing brushes!</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes but doesn&#x27;t hold makeup extremely well. Some of them fell apart but just glued them back together. Overall good brushes and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. It is a great starter for people that are just getting into makeup. i loves them to death!!</li>
            <li> I love these! Great product for a great price. I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems some of the other reviews had. (Smell, shedding, ect)</li>
            <li> These brushes are very pretty and unique-yes.... but they also really grab the makeup and it comes off on my face perfectly! I love how they arent too stiff, or too fluffy and the colors are amazing. The brushes are a periwinkle blue with deeper violet tips-gorgeous! Very cool ombre effect. The case is bright purple metallic with a cream inside. Personally, I&#x27;d prefer the inside pf the case to be darker or to exhibit more of an ombre effect additionally but who really cares about that anyways-the brushes are honestly comparable to more expensive brands. I absolutely HATE when ladies whine and byotch about the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; of these things when they get them-....seriously its called WASH the brushes and case if you want and once dry...BAM-no smell left. Personally, Id freak if there was no smell because to me that would mean they weren&#x27;t and firsthand item. Love these so much Im ordering another set now and 5 for gifts!</li>
            <li> NO shedding, beautiful color, hold eye-shadow or foundation perfectly. Just like professional brushes ! This is a must buy !</li>
            <li> For the bargain price I got the brush kit for I thought it was going to be cheaply made , I was pleasantly surprised when I received my brush kit promptly and it was nice, not cheap soft durable brushes ! Now I  have every brush ill ever need for my make-up !!</li>
            <li> Okay brushes. Pouch came ripped and somehow this brush set has no blending brush. Of all things not to include!</li>
            <li> Best makeup brushes ever.  High quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are better than I thought. For the price, It&#x27;s a good buy. Works Well for foundation, Concealer application, gel liner, and blending.</li>
            <li> The pouch bag case doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. It doesn&#x27;t have that mesh fabric, its just the same purple fabric. But it&#x27;s okay, its still nice for the price. I decided to buy this because I&#x27;m just starting to learn how to put on make up. I wish it had labels on the brushes though, so I know what type of brush it is. So, if you&#x27;re like me who is new to make up, this is a good practice brush kit.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the picture, the brushes are soft and are the perfect size. The smell is just from the brushes being packaged and processed, it smells like new plastic and goes away after a couple of days. None of them are broken and I&#x27;ve used every single brush. Great deal for great brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so pretty!! Mine weren&#x27;t the same color as in the picture, mine were purple but I love them so much!! It is an amazing price for the brushes! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
            <li> I like it it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services and i like to give 5 stares</li>
            <li> So soft! No strange smell...works well as a first makeup brush set. Love the color too. Great product, would buy again.</li>
            <li> To see what I use each of these brushes for read my blog post:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are basically the same brushes as another set I reviewed, white with pink tips--must be made by the same factory. I am a sucker for pretty things so I gave these a try. At first I wasn&#x27;t very impressed, yes the brushes are soft but the face brushes are slippery and don&#x27;t pick up powder very well and there are no fluffy eyeshadow brushes for blending. However, with some improvisation I was able to make these work. Use a light hand with the eye brushes, they are kind of stiff but you can build color and blend with a little work. Since there are no fluffy-type blending brushes, if you need more help blending use the fan brush or gently sweep with one of the largest eyeshadow brushes. If you add a tiny bit of hair gel to the fan brush when it is wet it will make it more useful to sweep away fallout under your eyes. The blush brush adds a light dusting that can be built up, and works fine for contouring with bronzer. The fan brush, angled to your cheekbone, is also good for applying contour and then you can blend it out with the fan brush or one of the powder brushes. These might not be what you are used to but you can definitely make them work. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too successful with is applying powder, if you like a light dusting these give you that but if you need heavier coverage you might want to try something else or just keep layering until you get enough coverage. The eyeshadow brushes work excellent wet or with a product like MAC Fix+.&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;d like to add the customer service is top notch -- I received the purple brushes instead of the blue/purple ones I ordered and the seller refunded half the price since I got the wrong ones. A++++ customer service!!!</li>
            <li> but brushes are in great condition on arrival, work well, and clean easily.  they apply makeup evenly and hold the makeup evenly and it doesn&#x27;t take multiple dips in the makeup.  Been using them since day I recieved them and they still look brand new.  No missing bristles, no bristles pointing in every direction pretty impressive since they aren&#x27;t made or shipped from USA.  I was pleasantly surprised at how nice they are for such a cheap price...  Other&#x27;s have bought this same set after seeing the quality and shape that mine are still in after multiple use</li>
            <li> These are very pretty brushes, the case is nice and snaps closed easily. They do not pick up powder or eyeshadow well, I really have to pile it on the brushes to get the amount I normally used with my old set of Mary Kay brushes. The brushes themselves did not smell when they arrived, but the case did. It smelled of paint. I let it air out on my deck for a day and it was gone. I&#x27;m going back to my old standbys until I can spring for a new M.K. set.</li>
            <li> For the price, including shipping, I was pleasantly surprised at the good quality. It arrived the day I was told it would. The brushes are good, although I will be keeping my Kabuki brush. Loose bristles occasionally come out at first.</li>
            <li> I only ordered these brushes because they are my favorite color. Surprisingly they are good brushes for the price. They do shed a little&lt;br /&gt; bit, but it is not excessive.</li>
            <li> The brushes are gorgeous and vibrant, true to color, and work fantastically. I would definitely recommend them to someone who is looking at Makeup Brushes</li>
            <li> Entire brush set smells like it was dipped in paint thinner and even airing it out does not seem to get rid of the smell.  Not sure I want to use this on my face.</li>
            <li> she says the bristles are very soft. Case is nice and well built&lt;br /&gt;showed up on time. Very happy !</li>
            <li> Brushes were soft and new in plastic, nice variety to choose from to form amazing looks. Great price for these professional make up brushes, definitely recommend to everyone that wants good quality brushes for a decent price.</li>
            <li> the brushes are soft to the touch. they work in wondrous ways. i really do like them &amp; will be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> This is pretty cool for the price, I suppose. Some of the brushes are higher quality than others. It&#x27;s great for amateurs but veterans at cosmetic application (adults) should invest in better.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great beginners set, this is it. The quality is pretty good and the brushes look lovely in my acrylic organizers on my vanity.</li>
            <li> These brushes are truly beautiful and sooo WORTH THE MONEY. I was hesitant and assumed before purchasing the brushes that they might be of horrible quality since they were cheap (11ish bucks), but since they weren&#x27;t pricey, I just decided.....why not? So when I got them in the mail today (I ordered them like four days ago), I was so anxious to see what they were like. MAN! my assumption was SOOO wrong. The brushes were sooooo pretty and were of really great quality!! I give this product an A+ :) Plus they&#x27;re BLUE.....you can&#x27;t go wrong with blue brushes..lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase, the price was extremely affordable. The brushes were very soft and was everything I expected according to the product description. They did have a plastic sort of smell, I&#x27;m sure from the packaging, just wash them, it will go away. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased make up brushes and this is a great starter kit without spending tons of money on high-end brands. Would certainly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes. Very pretty and soft. I wish however the foundation brush was just a bit more sturdy so it would pick up more makeup. And the eye shadow brushes seem too sturdy, and pick up too much! I&#x27;m far to picky, I know. But that can be corrected just by altering how you apply just a bit. I bought these because the brushes I had before were too rough and scratched my face, and I definitely don&#x27;t have that problem with these! I&#x27;ve been using them for almost a week, and no bristles had fallen out. And I love the color. They did have a strong paint smell when I first got them, but that went away within a day or two. The case is a bit cheap though, so I may look into replacing it. But I can see myself using these brushes for a while!</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out of the brushes</li>
            <li> Nice brushes but the smaller brushes are all the same but not fluffy, kinda can be used for concealer brushes</li>
            <li> Yup they smell but only at first. A couple of them had bristles come out but that&#x27;s it. I love them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this for they eyeshadow brushes. They are way to stiff. But the fluffy brushes are great. Im very into makeup, and i have Sephora brushes, and i prefer these powder brushes to the sephoras.but the eyeshadow brushes are on my vanity collecting dust. I don&#x27;t suggest you buy  this unless only for the powder (fluffy) brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about a year now. Most have held up. They are average quality and still working well.</li>
            <li> so i got this within 5 days of ordering! i am in love with the brushes! they are super soft. and worth every penny spent.&lt;br /&gt;i have used almost all of the brushes so far, and the quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;they look exactly like the picture so no worries.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i did not like was the smell when i opened them.&lt;br /&gt;i washed mine and suggest the same for you if you purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;highly recomend!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a STRONG smell on the case. I tried airing it out for two days and the smell never diminished. I had to remove the brushes and put them in a canister and threw away the purple smelly case.</li>
            <li> i am in love with these brushes they look just like the picture are super low priced and are the best brushes i have ever had</li>
            <li> I bought this for friend as a gift who loves makeup. I am not a makeup wearer however the set is a pretty purple and the bag is convenient to use. When it is opened it lays flat so that you can easily access the brushes. It is an awesome kit to have and really stands out. One con would be that it had a faint paint smell (that faded) which I think is from the bag/case.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid for these brushes ($7.65) they were a Steal! The brushes I received are exactly as pictured, fluffy and a gorgeous cornflower blue-purple ombre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received these brushes, the entire set had a very strong smell (like a mixture of plastic and nail polish). The brush handles left a gross filmy feeling on my fingers. However, the problem was easily solved by wiping down the entire makeup case with a clorox disinfecting wipe (and drying it with a paper towel), and carefully washing each brush with warm water and antibacterial dial hand soap (and lying them flat to dry). None of the bristles came out while washing, so I’m sure I won’t have any issues during application. One of the brush heads came loose from the handle but I just used a little super glue, and the brush is as good as new.</li>
            <li> I should have known they would be terrible based on the price. One thing I will give them is they are cute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for nearly a year now, and they are just awesome. So soft. I actually bought an Elf brand brush on sale and I couldn&#x27;t use it because it was so rough compared to these. Such a great deal.</li>
            <li> Package made the brushes smell a little strange. Aired them out for a week and they still had that plastic/vinyl smell to them. Brushes themselves were soft and really cool looking, but fell apart after a couple uses. They served their purpose.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet, I kinda just order stuff just because, but love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing purchase! The blending of these brushes makes your makeup look flawless! I have received many compliments! :)</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 13 year old niece and she loved them, purple is her fav color. When she opened them Christmas am she was so excited and everyone else also wanted to try them they are extremely soft, durable and easy to clean. I would buy this set for myself if I I&#x27;d not have so many already. I own a nice set of sigma brushes over 100$ and the softness is comparable to these.  Highly recommend especially for this price.</li>
            <li> these are awesome brushes at an awesome price i will order more when i need them. they got shipped to quickly.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product 4 stars because it took a while to receive the product.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the brushes are AMAZING. I absolutely love them!!!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re super soft ! The brushes didn&#x27;t come in the color that the pictures show, they were purple instead, but I actually liked it a lot better. I would recommend these brushes to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the service and brushes this seller has provided!&lt;br /&gt;Considering the fact that they&#x27;re only $12 these brushes are AMAZING! They&#x27;re super soft, gorgeous, and haven&#x27;t shed at all! The shipping took about a week (California) but it was well worth the wait. I don&#x27;t see why people are so upset about some awful smell? The brushes themselves don&#x27;t smell they all come individually plastic wrapped, the smell is coming from the faux leather inside the case, as soon as I opened them I smelled them lol. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, THE BRUSHES DON&#x27;T SMELL. These brushes are an absolute deal and the shipping was fast considering it came all the way from China and have free shipping! This seller is great I totally recommend!</li>
            <li> love the case mostly!</li>
            <li> Overall, these are fairly cheaply made brushes. One fell apart in my hands when I took it out of the bag for the first time; the bristles fell out and scattered all over the floor! A few of the brushes had very misshapen and bent bristles, they can&#x27;t serve their intended purpose. But half were still usable for the most part, and they were cheap, so what did I expect? If you&#x27;re looking for a quality brush, this is NOT the set to buy. The case itself is great so maybe that makes it worth it in the long run...</li>
            <li> Brushes are great on quality.  They give you a lot of brushes for the price and I will probably never use them all!</li>
            <li> These brushes are easily as pretty as pictured, and the quality is great!</li>
            <li> I spent forever looking for quality brushes without spending a fortune. These are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;They did have a funny smell when I received them, but nothing a little baby shampoo couldn&#x27;t fix. Of course you&#x27;d wash them anyway so I wouldn&#x27;t even consider that a negative.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is individually wrapped, the brushes are soft, the colors are actually very pretty, and you get a good variety for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;Even the little carrying case is cute.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will order again when these start to get old.</li>
            <li> These brushes are sorta pretty, do be aware when you purchase these that colors do vary from pictures a little, mine are more of a baby blue with purple tips. They are very soft. Hold make up better than the target store brand brushes i had previously, lol. They do look dirty easy, if this bothers you you can easily wash them often to keep them looking nice. Speaking of washing them, They DO have a very pungent smell of paint or dye as you open the package but it is easily cured after washing them (I washed mine with baby shampoo, or you can spend the money for a nice brush cleanser if you want). They&#x27;ve been fine since then. They hold together very well, I&#x27;ve had mine a couple weeks now and have experienced no shedding at all. They are pretty nice and so is the bag they come with. I love them :)</li>
            <li> Such soft high quality brushes for a cheap price. Only downside is there is no eyeshadow blending brush!! :( Kinda disappointing. Nonetheless great product, cute packaging. Strange smell but nothing terrible.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft, pretty and exactly as pictured. the case for them is super convenient and some even come with brush guards!</li>
            <li> I bought a kit for me and as a Christmas gift. They arrived in time for Christmas and I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Good pretty brushes. Still good 6mts later.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice but the smell is terrible.  I have removed them from the pouch to air out.  But, be prepared if you purshase these.  As many others have rated this product low, the smell is real and bad.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my little sister for Christmas and she loved them, so did I! I might have to order me a set.</li>
            <li> I was sooo undecisive if i wanted these or not. I had read about how freakin smelly they were. I washed mine with a little bit of my baby sisters shampoo and they smell perfect after that! its not as big of a deal as people say it is! im 20 years old and this is my first set of brushes ever. they are flippin adorbz and good quality :) i am super pleased!!! &amp;lt;3</li>
