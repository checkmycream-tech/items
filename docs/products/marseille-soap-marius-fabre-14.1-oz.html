            <li>I am updating this review to reflect my increasing pleasure and joy in using this soap.  </li>
            <li>... do you know that Marseille Soap is also great for  washing your laundry and for brushing your teeth?</li>

            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>This is a most excellent soap.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s still a bit of an aroma to the soap, but it&#x27;s a pleasant, earthy smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good but doesn&#x27;t linger after you wash it off.</li>
            <li>You can get a good month out of one, at least.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of it!</li>
            <li>Nice vendor experience: Delivered on time.</li>
            <li>High quality, smells delicious!</li>
            <li>found this by virtue of first trying the legendary Aleppo Soap - Which is indeed an EXCELLENT soap, but not remotely cost effective for me.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a very neutral and subtly pleasant smell, best described as clean.  </li>
            <li>wood.&lt;br /&gt;it smells the coal , very strong, smoky.</li>
            <li>The product is excellent for folks with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling it leaves on my skin.</li>
            <li>OK, just me then.  </li>
            <li>Pre de Provence is a better choice in this respect.</li>
            <li>I wanted an authentic Savon de Marseille, and I am glad I stumbled upon this one by Marius Fabre.  </li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>Lovely soap and I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>hope this helps you! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it dries a bit more than it moisturizes, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless I come across something dramatically better, I&#x27;ll be ordering this again for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Works wonders and is way better than anything you would find at CVS.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I tried this on a whim, and it&#x27;s OUTSTANDING -</li>
            <li>I consider it more of a novelty item.</li>
            <li>Anyone who has discovered that olive oil content in soap is the answer to lovely skin should be pleased with this soap.</li>
            <li>skin looks really clean and nice after I wash my face with this.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Marius Fabre is a good brand and very well known in France.</li>
            <li>but my favorite is still the original.</li>
            <li>so good - none of the things I mentioned seem like they ought to have this light, soapy fragrance - but it really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the smell is to strong to use this.</li>
            <li>you cut it though... enjoy.</li>
            <li>she will use and enjoy it whe</li>
            <li>Please secure it so the soaps don&#x27;t arrive with cracked edges and dust.  </li>
            <li>natural, really good quality.  </li>
            <li>I was not expecting this soap to be anywhere near as good as it is.  </li>
            <li>soap smells great, feels great, lathers well, and the giant block lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one off Amazon, and I love the size -- a nice huge chunk of soap that is going to last me a looong time.</li>
            <li>It lathers up well, but rinses away cleanly, leaving no noticeable film or residue.</li>
            <li>It might clean</li>
            <li>, how do you make sure you are buying REAL Marseille</li>
            <li>I tried this soap because I can&#x27;t stand the overly floral, chemical smell of most modern bar soaps.</li>
            <li>Even most homemade soaps have too much perfume or floral material in them.</li>
            <li>Feels natural and nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>ever get the feeling that we&#x27;re off track as a civilization, inventing ever newer and fancier ways to screw ourselves up, when the old tried and true standbys languish, available but abandoned on the march to ever more relentless consumer capitalism?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the other versions of this -- the lavender, for one, which is also great</li>
            <li>My skin feels not quite \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean, but it does a good job on both oily and dry spots.</li>
            <li>In good (dry, not too soapy) condition.</li>
            <li>It gets you VERY clean, and rinses away easily, and does not dry out skin.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have noticed that this block produces more residual soap slush than some,but I can easily incorporate it into my following shower or wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought from the three top companies and this is the first time I&#x27;ve used this particular</li>
            <li>Other than the residue problem it&#x27;s a very nice soap to use and very gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>It is a 100% natural soap which I really enjoyed using.</li>
            <li>yeah, it will be distinct - but that smell has no correlation with how you smell after using it.  </li>
            <li>I feel better about myself as a person as a direct result of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think this is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It seems like it dries out you skin right after you use it, but it just gets rid of the excess oils in your skin.  </li>
            <li>But if your body is used to strange chemicals making it smell nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying different products for years to try to find something that won&#x27;t make me itch, will still make me smell clean, and will not leave any strong residue or odor...  </li>
            <li>It is 99% as good as Aleppo, which puts it still far above anything else out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this soap for exactly the reason it is produced; it is soothing, has a nice smell and does not leave my body with a soap scum feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>So I was interested in learning about Castile soap, and that Wikipedia article led me to Marseille soap, and that led me here.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty close.</li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>Mine came with some cracked edges, most likely from shaking in the box during shipping.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty neutral ph.</li>
            <li>And my hair is better off with simply this than it is with any fancy conditioners/</li>
            <li>However, it rinses off easily and quickly and leaves hair and skin supple and soft, not stripped of natural oils.  </li>
            <li>After showering, I am fresh and clean, and the soap does not dry out my skin or make me itchy at all.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to chemicals and odors, and this soap, which has been made the same way for hundreds of years, was so gentle and pleasing, and yet incredibly effective.</li>
            <li>The big square block is a bit unusual in that it doesn&#x27;t rest in the soap dish like most modern bar soaps, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will seriously never buy another kind of soap again, especially since I don&#x27;t have to order it from France or drive hours to the one quirky cool store in the city that carries it.</li>
            <li>You maintain a healthy balance between oily and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I find this size is perfect,but I am used to a large sized soap.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my LIFE, my skin is clean, clear, and not dried out...</li>
            <li>The size of the bar is huge, and will last me about 9 months.  </li>
            <li>The real savon de Marseille.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on all the exposed mucous membranes of the body - it does sting if you get it in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>a reasonable amount of suds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possibly a bit more on the masculine side if anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several products and soap, including the vastly overrated bronners - which makes an excellent hand degreaser, and has other good applications, but is NOT a good full body soap, and I&#x27;ve never found a smell that&#x27;s not ultimately an assault on the senses in some way</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easier on my skin than most other soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for your skin, gentle enough for your face and strong enough to be used on your delicate lingerie.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is extremely high quality soap.  </li>
            <li>I really like this soap because of its simplicity and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Therefore, anyone in China, Turkey or any other place in the world can make  cheap industrial soap and name it \\&quot;Savon</li>
            <li>It is very soft on your skin and hasn&#x27;t perfumes or chemicals that often cause allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>A friend says it has a very masculine scent.</li>
            <li>This soap smells really clean and it is gentle on private parts, but it seems to dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>not excessively so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know about this soap; I wouldn&#x27;t know about it, except that I visited central Spain a few months ago, and that area is famous for Castile soap, which as a physician, I know is one of the few things safe for use as an enema.  </li>
            <li>They got it right a long time ago.</li>
            <li>This huge block should last a very long time, and then I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this soap works well for me.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing soap leaves your skin soft by leaving a layer of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on your skin.</li>
            <li>This soap does it naturally.</li>
            <li>For the past several years I have been buying it (sometimes scented but most often not) on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Cleans really well, lasts a long time, olive oil is soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>, the only way to be certain is to only get soap that comes from one of these 4 factories :</li>
            <li>I had originally just been using it as a kitchen hand soap, but I took it into the shower a few days ago, though I worried it might dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li>The big block feels solid when wet and feels like it will last a long time which makes it an economical choice for those looking for a natural olive oil bar soap.</li>
            <li>It will probably last a long time, I recommend it to any natural soap lover!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good for your skin, gentle enough for your face and strong enough to be used on your delicate lingerie.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is extremely high quality soap.  </li>
            <li> I really like this soap because of its simplicity and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Therefore, anyone in China, Turkey or any other place in the world can make  cheap industrial soap and name it \\&quot;Savon</li>
            <li> It is very soft on your skin and hasn&#x27;t perfumes or chemicals that often cause allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> A friend says it has a very masculine scent.</li>
            <li> This soap smells really clean and it is gentle on private parts, but it seems to dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> not excessively so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know about this soap; I wouldn&#x27;t know about it, except that I visited central Spain a few months ago, and that area is famous for Castile soap, which as a physician, I know is one of the few things safe for use as an enema.  </li>
            <li> They got it right a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This huge block should last a very long time, and then I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this soap works well for me.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing soap leaves your skin soft by leaving a layer of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on your skin.</li>
            <li> This soap does it naturally.</li>
            <li> For the past several years I have been buying it (sometimes scented but most often not) on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Cleans really well, lasts a long time, olive oil is soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> , the only way to be certain is to only get soap that comes from one of these 4 factories :</li>
            <li> I had originally just been using it as a kitchen hand soap, but I took it into the shower a few days ago, though I worried it might dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> The big block feels solid when wet and feels like it will last a long time which makes it an economical choice for those looking for a natural olive oil bar soap.</li>
            <li> It will probably last a long time, I recommend it to any natural soap lover!</li>
            <li> So it actually ends up CHEAPER in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The size is a little awkward, but the value is good.</li>
            <li> This soap is pricey but will last you very long time.</li>
            <li> of all the soaps I&#x27;ve used, this one definitely leaves me feeling the cleanest, without leaving my skin dry or with residue.</li>
            <li> And while it is pretty, the huge square shape is a little awkward.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, if there is a fragrance it is very subtle which I like and it leaves your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> Product can be used on hair and face - taking my routine down to ONE soap I use while showering, no other cleaners or conditioners</li>
            <li> then it will think something made of olive oil is strange</li>
            <li> I would also like to mention that the soap does leave my skin feeling slightly dry, but nothing too bothersome.</li>
            <li> ... expect 2-4 weeks of odd bodily behavior...</li>
            <li> Also, it is not full of chemicals like the regular soap you find at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> If you like to cut off slices of soap for a more manageable size, it fragments badly.  </li>
            <li> will buy another block in a few months, when this one is finally done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s olive oil based, and aged, so</li>
            <li> It has a couple of dents in it where I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple of times (and one dent in my toe from it of course landing on my foot), but I would recommend this soap a million times over for anyone, not just those with chemical or other sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the packaging.</li>
            <li> it could be me as I usually have dry skin with any soap I use.  </li>
            <li> You can cut it with a wire (DON&#x27;T use a knife) but it does get a little crumbly</li>
            <li> Clearly, there is something wrong with the picture and</li>
            <li> This is green and my product is brown.</li>
            <li> And, if it gets in your eyes, it hardly irritates them.</li>
            <li> Hard to get up a lather though.</li>
            <li> Just a guy who has some skin trouble, is tired of every synthetic thing under the sun, wanted to try something tried and true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I came across this type of soap in a shop and have been addicted ever since.</li>
            <li> What is wrong with that picture.</li>
            <li> it silly or overdramatic to say that a soap has changed my life?  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> when i opened the amazon box, i was dismayed because the soap smelled so bad to me.</li>
            <li> too bad.</li>
            <li> This soap smells very bad.</li>
            <li> my skin out something awful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a most excellent soap. It is very soft on your skin and hasn&#x27;t perfumes or chemicals that often cause allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This is very good soap.&lt;br /&gt;I use this soap to wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks really clean and nice after I wash my face with this.&lt;br /&gt;All natural, really good quality.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This soap smells really clean and it is gentle on private parts, but it seems to dry my skin.  It is not a quality olive oil soap.</li>
            <li> The real savon de Marseille. High quality, smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Had to send it back because it smelled like gasoline. Too bad.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from my local soap store for years. Clearly, there is something wrong with the picture and what they send you. This is green and my product is brown. What is wrong with that picture.</li>
            <li> Great soap!!! This huge block should last a very long time, and then I&#x27;ll order again. This would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> This marseille soap smells great and lathers perfectly! I love the feeling it leaves on my skin.It is a 100% natural soap which I really enjoyed using. It will probably last a long time, I recommend it to any natural soap lover!</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of trying something all-natural, buy this soap. Hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers the perfect amount (just don&#x27;t expect anything out of a commercial).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually all-natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that there is a &amp;#34;transition period...&amp;#34; there wasn&#x27;t for me, since I hadn&#x27;t been using *any* soap for a while, so I had already gone through it. But if your body is used to strange chemicals making it smell nice then it will think something made of olive oil is strange... expect 2-4 weeks of odd bodily behavior... and then bliss for the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using this regularly because I&#x27;ve stopped using soap regularly. Call me a hippie but I just don&#x27;t think we need it. I *do* use it to brush my teeth with, and again, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only rating it four stars because it&#x27;s so dang big. You can cut it with a wire (DON&#x27;T use a knife) but it does get a little crumbly (it crumbles to pieces with a knife).Once you cut it though... enjoy.</li>
            <li> in the description, it doesn&#x27;t specified that the soap has been made / bake with sone wood.&lt;br /&gt;it smells the coal , very strong, smoky.</li>
            <li> I love this soap for exactly the reason it is produced; it is soothing, has a nice smell and does not leave my body with a soap scum feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> Not a soap connoisseur here.  Just a guy who has some skin trouble, is tired of every synthetic thing under the sun, wanted to try something tried and true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap smells great, feels great, lathers well, and the giant block lasts a long time.  It is a touch drying, but despite that my skin loves it.  I was not expecting this soap to be anywhere near as good as it is.  Ingredients are 72% olive oil and some coconut oil, saponified with vegetable-ash lye; sea salt; and water.  I don&#x27;t know why it smells so good - none of the things I mentioned seem like they ought to have this light, soapy fragrance - but it really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another block in a few months, when this one is finally done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I am updating this review to reflect my increasing pleasure and joy in using this soap.  I already gave the product 5 stars; I wish I could give it 6.  I had originally just been using it as a kitchen hand soap, but I took it into the shower a few days ago, though I worried it might dry my skin out.  Nope - it works perfectly well as a body soap, conditioner, and shampoo.  It is gentle on all the exposed mucous membranes of the body - it does sting if you get it in your eyes.  However, it rinses off easily and quickly and leaves hair and skin supple and soft, not stripped of natural oils.  I have occasionally used olive oil as a skin moisturizer and this soap leaves my skin feeling the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer endorsed this soap because she didn&#x27;t want to be applying \\&quot;someone&#x27;s chemistry experiment\\&quot; to her skin.  I have come along to feeling the same way.  I didn&#x27;t even know about this soap; I wouldn&#x27;t know about it, except that I visited central Spain a few months ago, and that area is famous for Castile soap, which as a physician, I know is one of the few things safe for use as an enema.  So I was interested in learning about Castile soap, and that Wikipedia article led me to Marseille soap, and that led me here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You ever get the feeling that we&#x27;re off track as a civilization, inventing ever newer and fancier ways to screw ourselves up, when the old tried and true standbys languish, available but abandoned on the march to ever more relentless consumer capitalism?  No?  OK, just me then.  Get some of this soap anyway.  It&#x27;s totally excellent.</li>
            <li> This soap is brittle.  If you like to cut off slices of soap for a more manageable size, it fragments badly.  Pre de Provence is a better choice in this respect.</li>
            <li> I am from Marseille and though it&#x27;s not the same that the ones I used to get, it&#x27;s pretty close. It&#x27;s good for your skin, gentle enough for your face and strong enough to be used on your delicate lingerie.&lt;br /&gt;I have tendency to break out when I use regular soap on my skin but with Le Savon de Marseille, I don&#x27;t. Marius Fabre is a good brand and very well known in France.</li>
            <li> I wanted an authentic Savon de Marseille, and I am glad I stumbled upon this one by Marius Fabre.  The product is excellent for folks with sensitive skin. After showering, I am fresh and clean, and the soap does not dry out my skin or make me itchy at all.  I use it as shampoo as well.  It cleans my hair and scalp without drying out my chemically treated hair.  The size of the bar is huge, and will last me about 9 months.  If you have any issues with commercial products at all, or would just like to use something made without a bunch of chemicals, I recommend this Savon de Marseille by Marius Fabre.</li>
            <li> This is extremely high quality soap.  I used to get Marseille soap from a French store in Nantucket.  Then, my cousin who is from Marseille used to bring it to me.  For the past several years I have been buying it (sometimes scented but most often not) on amazon.  I&#x27;ve bought from the three top companies and this is the first time I&#x27;ve used this particular brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  This is the brand I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Lovely soap and I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> One thing you have to know about Marseille Soap (\\&quot;Savon de Marseille\\&quot;) is that its name is not registered or protected by a trademark. Therefore, anyone in China, Turkey or any other place in the world can make  cheap industrial soap and name it \\&quot;Savon de Marseille\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;So, how do you make sure you are buying REAL Marseille Soap?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the only way to be certain is to only get soap that comes from one of these 4 factories :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Savonnerie Marius Fabre, located in Salon de Provence (brand name \\&quot;Marius Fabre\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;-Savonnerie Le Sérail, located in Marseille (brand name: \\&quot;Le Sérail)&lt;br /&gt;-Savonnerie Le Fer à Cheval, located in Marseille (brand name: \\&quot;Le Fer à Cheval\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;-Savonnerie du Midi, located in Marseille (brand Names: \\&quot;La Corvette\\&quot; and \\&quot;Compagnie du Savon de Marseille\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my knowledge, these are the only 4 factories that still produce Marseille soap the old-fashion way, cooking it and stirring it manually for several days (the whole process of making this soap takes about 10 to 14 days, when industrial soaps are produced in just a few hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And... do you know that Marseille Soap is also great for  washing your laundry and for brushing your teeth?</li>
            <li> Very nice soap &amp; very nice feel. The only drawback is I need to scrub my shower room floor every 2 days or so since this soap leaves residue on the floor and it looks like mold (consider the color of the soap). Other than the residue problem it&#x27;s a very nice soap to use and very gentle to the skin. Really like it!</li>
            <li> this was a gift to someone for xmas  she will use and enjoy it whe she refininshes that table she bought</li>
            <li> I really like this soap because of its simplicity and natural ingredients. Also, it is not full of chemicals like the regular soap you find at the supermarket. The big block feels solid when wet and feels like it will last a long time which makes it an economical choice for those looking for a natural olive oil bar soap. My only complaint is the packaging. Mine came with some cracked edges, most likely from shaking in the box during shipping. Please secure it so the soaps don&#x27;t arrive with cracked edges and dust.  I would also like to mention that the soap does leave my skin feeling slightly dry, but nothing too bothersome. It might not even be the soap...it could be me as I usually have dry skin with any soap I use.  I have sensitive skin and this soap works well for me.</li>
            <li> This soap is pricey but will last you very long time. I bought it in July and now, about 4 months later, I&#x27;m about halfway through it. It&#x27;s also easier on my skin than most other soaps I&#x27;ve tried. It smells good but doesn&#x27;t linger after you wash it off.</li>
            <li> i bought two of these, one for me and one for my daughter. when i opened the amazon box, i was dismayed because the soap smelled so bad to me. i rewrapped the items and shipped them immediately back without even trying the soap as i didn&#x27;t want anything so stinky in my bathroom, let alone rubbed on me. too bad.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I&#x27;ve used for years. It seems like it dries out you skin right after you use it, but it just gets rid of the excess oils in your skin.  It thoroughly cleans your skin gently without harsh chemicals and leaves no residue. Moisturizing soap leaves your skin soft by leaving a layer of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on your skin. This soap does it naturally. It doesn&#x27;t strip all the oils from your skin. You maintain a healthy balance between oily and dry skin.  Olive oil has been used for centuries for bathing. They got it right a long time ago. And, if it gets in your eyes, it hardly irritates them. It has a pretty neutral ph.</li>
            <li> Nice vendor experience: Delivered on time. In good (dry, not too soapy) condition. Would order from this vendor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself? The big square block is a bit unusual in that it doesn&#x27;t rest in the soap dish like most modern bar soaps, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell: I tried this soap because I can&#x27;t stand the overly floral, chemical smell of most modern bar soaps. Even most homemade soaps have too much perfume or floral material in them. This is great. There&#x27;s still a bit of an aroma to the soap, but it&#x27;s a pleasant, earthy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather: Very nice. It lathers up well, but rinses away cleanly, leaving no noticeable film or residue. My skin feels not quite \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean, but it does a good job on both oily and dry spots. I&#x27;d say it dries a bit more than it moisturizes, but not excessively so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless I come across something dramatically better, I&#x27;ll be ordering this again for quite some time. Now if Amazon would only make this a \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> I came across this type of soap in a shop and have been addicted ever since. I am extremely sensitive to chemicals and odors, and this soap, which has been made the same way for hundreds of years, was so gentle and pleasing, and yet incredibly effective. I bought this one off Amazon, and I love the size -- a nice huge chunk of soap that is going to last me a looong time. I love the smell and feel of it! It has a couple of dents in it where I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple of times (and one dent in my toe from it of course landing on my foot), but I would recommend this soap a million times over for anyone, not just those with chemical or other sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the soaps I&#x27;ve used, this one definitely leaves me feeling the cleanest, without leaving my skin dry or with residue. I will seriously never buy another kind of soap again, especially since I don&#x27;t have to order it from France or drive hours to the one quirky cool store in the city that carries it. I&#x27;ve also tried the other versions of this -- the lavender, for one, which is also great but my favorite is still the original.</li>
            <li> I actually went to marseille and went to the soap factory. Could not manage to find the same soap back home. I found this online and love it!! Works wonders and is way better than anything you would find at CVS.</li>
            <li> Cleans really well, lasts a long time, olive oil is soothing to my skin. A friend says it has a very masculine scent.</li>
            <li> This soap smells very bad. Like petroleum. Disappointing.  It might clean okay but the smell is to strong to use this.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, if there is a fragrance it is very subtle which I like and it leaves your skin very soft.  The size is a little awkward, but the value is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different products for years to try to find something that won&#x27;t make me itch, will still make me smell clean, and will not leave any strong residue or odor...  I&#x27;ve tried several products and soap, including the vastly overrated bronners - which makes an excellent hand degreaser, and has other good applications, but is NOT a good full body soap, and I&#x27;ve never found a smell that&#x27;s not ultimately an assault on the senses in some way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this by virtue of first trying the legendary Aleppo Soap - Which is indeed an EXCELLENT soap, but not remotely cost effective for me.  I tried this on a whim, and it&#x27;s OUTSTANDING - It is 99% as good as Aleppo, which puts it still far above anything else out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial smell may be offensive to some - It&#x27;s olive oil based, and aged, so yeah, it will be distinct - but that smell has no correlation with how you smell after using it.  It leaves a very neutral and subtly pleasant smell, best described as clean.  It&#x27;s possibly a bit more on the masculine side if anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now, and I won&#x27;t go back to anything else...&lt;br /&gt;- The blocks last FOREVER.  You can get a good month out of one, at least.&lt;br /&gt;- It gets you VERY clean, and rinses away easily, and does not dry out skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Product can be used on hair and face - taking my routine down to ONE soap I use while showering, no other cleaners or conditioners&lt;br /&gt;- For the first time in my LIFE, my skin is clean, clear, and not dried out... And my hair is better off with simply this than it is with any fancy conditioners/shampoos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of skin products to prevent the breakouts I tend to have over my body, and none of them have held a candle to this simple, olive-oil based soap...  The breakouts have stopped entirely, and this has replaced shampoo, conditioner, face wash... you name it.  So it actually ends up CHEAPER in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it silly or overdramatic to say that a soap has changed my life?  Because this one has.  I feel better about myself as a person as a direct result of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a man who is considering this, stop considering and order already.  It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> -dries my skin out something awful&lt;br /&gt;-smells okay&lt;br /&gt;-produces a reasonable amount of suds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this is worth the money. I consider it more of a novelty item. Try CO Bigelows line up.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for four years, this is why I have rated it at 5 stars and continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Feels natural and nice on the skin. Hard to get up a lather though. And while it is pretty, the huge square shape is a little awkward.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has discovered that olive oil content in soap is the answer to lovely skin should be pleased with this soap.I find this size is perfect,but I am used to a large sized soap.I have noticed that this block produces more residual soap slush than some,but I can easily incorporate it into my following shower or wash.For the artists who bathe with this,an added plus is that olive oil soap is an excellent paint brush cleanser!</li>
