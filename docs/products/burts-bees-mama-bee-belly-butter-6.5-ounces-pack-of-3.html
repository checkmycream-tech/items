            <li>Did I say love it?!</li>
            <li>Very light and smells good.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing on my growing belly.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is not greasy like cocoa butter and it absorbs into your skin nicely.</li>
            <li>I ordered one jar and I was honestly amazed (and still am) by how supple my skin became from using it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a smell which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I have used it on my face as well as belly and it feels nice on.</li>
            <li>but it made my itchy skin feel great while pregnant.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, which is a shame because I love this company.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I got many stretch marks.</li>
            <li>The butter absorbs into the skin like a cream, it doesn&#x27;t sit on top like a lotion.  </li>
            <li>Kept my belly supple and moist, and kept the skin healthy.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Use it the entire pregnancy for best results.  </li>
            <li>I ended up ordering a park of three more.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Great product, very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I am much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am 25 weeks pregnant with twins and have no stretch marks and no itching!</li>
            <li>I have used this product since the moment we found out I was pregnant!  </li>
            <li>but it helps stop itching and makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I started to use this Mama Bee Belly Butter when I was four months pregnant, which I started off with just one I found on clearance at walgreens drug store.</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law got it for me when I found out I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Although nothing is going to prevent you from getting stretch marks if you are prone to them, this product hydrates your skin so you don&#x27;t get the itchy feeling when your stomach is expanding while pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this since I was 5 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is simply the best product I&#x27;ve tried to prevent dry skin.</li>
            <li>I honestly credit this product entirely.</li>
            <li>Anyways, HIGHLY recommend this product if you are pregnant or know someone who is!</li>
            <li>I really liked the faint but pleasant smell of this product compared to Palmers and Basq.  </li>
            <li>This stuff I fell in love with, I can only find it on amazon</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first tub (I use it at bedtime ~2 out of every 3 nights).  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s my first pregnancy).  </li>
            <li>I gave one jar as a gift, but I&#x27;ll order more for myself when I&#x27;m running low!!  </li>
            <li>Guilt free using it all over my skin during pregnancy, even on the belly, because I trust \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees\\&quot; natural products .</li>
            <li>I actually like it better for my face than any face lotion I have tried, so I may keep buying it for that reason.</li>
            <li>I like that this is an environmentally friendly, natural product and have no reason to try another brand.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason my sensitive skin gets MORE sensitive during and after pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t claim to be miraculous in preventing stretch marks, but I definitely think that it has helped tremendously in minimizing them by keeping my belly moisturized, boosting elasticity and providing the right nutrients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It moisturizes really well without leaving a sticky feeling and no residue on clothing.  </li>
            <li>I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees for most other products, but this was a very hard wax and had to be really warm in order to apply smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive dry skin which breaks out to many products.</li>
            <li>At 32 weeks pregnant with twins, I still have not a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li>I tried Mothers Special Blend skin toning oil and never looked back!</li>
            <li>And so far at 7 months pregnant, I don&#x27;t have anything near to stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I am currently 26 weeks pregnant and have been using the Belly Butter for 12 weeks now.  </li>
            <li>It may be expensive but it&#x27;s worth it for a good nights</li>
            <li>It dries quite quickly but for some reason you need to use more so it doesn&#x27;t last a month for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I use it daily from the time I know I am pregnant until delivery and so far I haven&#x27;t gotten stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I still have a ways to go, but so far, no stretch marks!  </li>
            <li>I bought some for my sister-in-law for Christmas, she is 28 weeks and loves it so far too!</li>
            <li>I used this product with my first pregnancy and am purchasing it for my second.</li>
            <li>I used this throughout my first and second pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to try multiple days of any other products to see if I&#x27;m also allergic to them, mostly because I can&#x27;t stand the smell.  </li>
            <li>I used this belly butter for my first 2 pregnancies and am using it now on my 3rd.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that there&#x27;s a slight cocoa buttery, bees waxy smell, but it was totally worth it and not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li>I still have stretch marks even though I used this 3 months prior to my pregnancy and throughout the whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li>As far as my skin,,, no stretch marks,,, no itchy itchy anywhere on my body.</li>
            <li>Silky shea butter leaves skin soft and suptle.  </li>
            <li>like the idea of natural products, but I ended up going with Noodle and Boo perfecting creme (</li>
            <li>hope that eventually my skin will return to normal after my hormones go back normal.</li>
            <li>Has little to no smell and absorbs to a clean feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sad that I can&#x27;t use this product as I thought it was perfect, but I would highly recommend it to someone with less sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product anymore, especially during the winter.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find not a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li>I am about due with y first baby</li>
            <li>I used Bella Bee for the first few months - starting at 12 weeks.</li>
            <li>I live in New England and winters can be brutal on the skin, but this winter was completely itch free thanks to a daily all body application of this belly butter.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, or skin that isn&#x27;t very dry, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>

            <li> I used Bella Bee for the first few months - starting at 12 weeks.</li>
            <li> I live in New England and winters can be brutal on the skin, but this winter was completely itch free thanks to a daily all body application of this belly butter.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, or skin that isn&#x27;t very dry, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got sick of putting it near my heater just so it would be warm enough to apply.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin hydrated all day long.  </li>
            <li> In January, my skin was beyond dry and itchy (belly, thighs, etc.), so I tried everything--I even tried vaseline and olive oil!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of other belly butters but my skin still itches.  </li>
            <li> The ones I do have are a dark pink and not a hideous purple.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had put it all over my body, as I did get marks on other areas.  </li>
            <li> Some other reviewers have complainted about the amount of butter in each pot, but the pots are sold by weight (so not sure why they are judging the pot based on volume) and a little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited about using this belly butter, but after applying it a few times I discovered that I am allergic to it :(.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no scent to it and a little goes along way.  </li>
            <li> I got little clogged pores from it, and felt like I couldn&#x27;t put on any clothes I cared about for a while after applying it</li>
            <li> bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some stretch marks, but not very many at all</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> The smell is not strong, but it did take awhile to get used to.  </li>
            <li> My mother and sister had HORRIBLE stretch marks during pregnancy, so I was expecting to get some as my doctor told me that getting those depends on genetics in most cases.  </li>
            <li> But not effective at all.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s called butter, but it really is incredibly thick.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for something that would alleviate my severely dry skin without soaking into my clothes.</li>
            <li> It is very thick lotion</li>
            <li> I bought it to prevent pregnancy stretch marks, which it didn&#x27;t do, but I can&#x27;t say that it didn&#x27;t help to prevent them from being worse!  </li>
            <li> ..doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Purchased for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I am 25 weeks pregnant with twins and have no stretch marks and no itching! I had lots of itching around 15-17 weeks. I bought this product because was referred to me at destination maternity, and it relieved all my itching! I am much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very light and smells good. But not effective at all. I still have stretch marks even though I used this 3 months prior to my pregnancy and throughout the whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> At 32 weeks pregnant with twins, I still have not a single stretch mark. I honestly credit this product entirely. Love the feel, the richness and the results!</li>
            <li> 9 pound baby. No stretch marks. This does what it says. This product delivers. I also used it on my feet with great results.</li>
            <li> Great product. ..doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. Buy the oil as well</li>
            <li> Smells like cooking oil. Has a great texture, though. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, which is a shame because I love this company. I bought two jars, assuming it would be awesome. What a waste.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry skin which breaks out to many products. This lotion truly is the blessing of all lotions for me. I started to use this Mama Bee Belly Butter when I was four months pregnant, which I started off with just one I found on clearance at walgreens drug store. This stuff I fell in love with, I can only find it on amazon, walgreens does not sell this product anymore. As far as my skin,,, no stretch marks,,, no itchy itchy anywhere on my body. I put this body butter on when I get out of the shower when my skin is still moist and it truly is Gods gift for my type of skin. I am about due with y first baby and I plan on using this amazing product even after the baby comes!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife seems to like it. Has little to no smell and absorbs to a clean feel.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My sister-in-law got it for me when I found out I was pregnant.  I believe I&#x27;m on jar 5 of this product and I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant.  Although nothing is going to prevent you from getting stretch marks if you are prone to them, this product hydrates your skin so you don&#x27;t get the itchy feeling when your stomach is expanding while pregnant.  My friend used something different and she always had that itchy feeling.  I can say I haven&#x27;t had that feeling once.  I like it because it is not greasy like cocoa butter and it absorbs into your skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I used Bella Bee for the first few months - starting at 12 weeks. Then... I got a stretchmark so I switched to Mama Bee Belly Butter. I got many stretch marks. I think it is just a genetic thing. I didn&#x27;t find anything that worked for me.</li>
            <li> I am currently 26 weeks pregnant and have been using the Belly Butter for 12 weeks now.  There&#x27;s no scent to it and a little goes along way.  I still have a ways to go, but so far, no stretch marks!  I bought some for my sister-in-law for Christmas, she is 28 weeks and loves it so far too!</li>
            <li> Great product.....will suggest to friends &amp; family etc! Love it! A must have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd jar. Love this belly butter! Idk if it helps with stretch marks but it helps stop itching and makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is simply the best product I&#x27;ve tried to prevent dry skin. I live in New England and winters can be brutal on the skin, but this winter was completely itch free thanks to a daily all body application of this belly butter. No, I haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks, even now at week 32. However, I don&#x27;t think this product or any product can prevent stretch marks during pregnancy if they&#x27;re on the horizon for you. Nonetheless, I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product anymore, especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> Silky shea butter leaves skin soft and suptle.  I bought it to prevent pregnancy stretch marks, which it didn&#x27;t do, but I can&#x27;t say that it didn&#x27;t help to prevent them from being worse!  Just great for hydration and ease skin tightening.</li>
            <li> I bought these a couple months ago and I&#x27;m still on my first tub (I use it at bedtime ~2 out of every 3 nights).  Some other reviewers have complainted about the amount of butter in each pot, but the pots are sold by weight (so not sure why they are judging the pot based on volume) and a little goes a LONG way.  I&#x27;m 25 weeks and no stretch marks yet (it&#x27;s my first pregnancy).  I&#x27;m just starting to feel some itching from my skin stretching.  The butter absorbs into the skin like a cream, it doesn&#x27;t sit on top like a lotion.  I like that this is an environmentally friendly, natural product and have no reason to try another brand.</li>
            <li> I used this product with my first pregnancy and am purchasing it for my second. I used it daily and at the end my my pregnancy I was pleasantly surprised to find not a single stretch mark. I only applied it once a day and it stayed put, maybe it&#x27;s the bees wax. Kept my belly supple and moist, and kept the skin healthy. I love it.  The only drawback is that there&#x27;s a slight cocoa buttery, bees waxy smell, but it was totally worth it and not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li> It dries quite quickly but for some reason you need to use more so it doesn&#x27;t last a month for everyday use. No smell at all contrary to what others.</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my first and second pregnancy.  For whatever reason my sensitive skin gets MORE sensitive during and after pregnancy.  Only this Mama Bee Belly Butter can stop the skin on my tummy from itching.  I don&#x27;t know why, it just works.  I&#x27;ve tried plenty of other belly butters but my skin still itches.  It may be expensive but it&#x27;s worth it for a good nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that eventually my skin will return to normal after my hormones go back normal.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin hydrated all day long.  I haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks yet.  Mmmm Belly Butter . . .</li>
            <li> I have been using this since I was 5 weeks pregnant and I am now 33 weeks.  It moisturizes really well without leaving a sticky feeling and no residue on clothing.  The smell is not strong, but it did take awhile to get used to.  I&#x27;ve noticed that on days I might forget to use it, my belly itches, so I am convinced tht this product helps minimize the itchiness quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some stretch marks, but not very many at all and they did not show up until about 4 weeks ago.  The ones I do have are a dark pink and not a hideous purple.  They do not look like they will traumatize me for life either.  My mother and sister had HORRIBLE stretch marks during pregnancy, so I was expecting to get some as my doctor told me that getting those depends on genetics in most cases.  The product doesn&#x27;t claim to be miraculous in preventing stretch marks, but I definitely think that it has helped tremendously in minimizing them by keeping my belly moisturized, boosting elasticity and providing the right nutrients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend to all you moms-to-be out there!  Use it the entire pregnancy for best results.  Don&#x27;t wait until you start seeing signs of stretch marks to do so.</li>
            <li> I really liked the faint but pleasant smell of this product compared to Palmers and Basq.  It was also not too greasy.  All in all I was very excited about using this belly butter, but after applying it a few times I discovered that I am allergic to it :(.  I have yet to try multiple days of any other products to see if I&#x27;m also allergic to them, mostly because I can&#x27;t stand the smell.  I&#x27;m very sad that I can&#x27;t use this product as I thought it was perfect, but I would highly recommend it to someone with less sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> In January, my skin was beyond dry and itchy (belly, thighs, etc.), so I tried everything--I even tried vaseline and olive oil!  I was desperate for something that would alleviate my severely dry skin without soaking into my clothes. This Burt&#x27;s Bees is the BEST product!!  I ordered one jar and I was honestly amazed (and still am) by how supple my skin became from using it.  I ended up ordering a park of three more.  I gave one jar as a gift, but I&#x27;ll order more for myself when I&#x27;m running low!!  I LOVE this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I tried this, thankfully from a place that sold it individually (not a pack of 3), and did not like it. I know it&#x27;s called butter, but it really is incredibly thick. If you have sensitive skin, or skin that isn&#x27;t very dry, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I got little clogged pores from it, and felt like I couldn&#x27;t put on any clothes I cared about for a while after applying it--they stuck to my belly and I was worried about staining them.&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of natural products, but I ended up going with Noodle and Boo perfecting creme (way more expensive, but it&#x27;s worked for me). Noodle &amp; Boo oil had the same problem as the Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter.</li>
            <li> I used this belly butter for my first 2 pregnancies and am using it now on my 3rd.  I use it daily from the time I know I am pregnant until delivery and so far I haven&#x27;t gotten stretch marks.  Doesn&#x27;t have a smell which is nice.  I use this all over my body and my face also.</li>
            <li> I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees for most other products, but this was a very hard wax and had to be really warm in order to apply smoothly. I got sick of putting it near my heater just so it would be warm enough to apply. I tried Mothers Special Blend skin toning oil and never looked back!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Guilt free using it all over my skin during pregnancy, even on the belly, because I trust \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees\\&quot; natural products . I had twins &amp; never had a stretch mark at all, to show for them.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since the moment we found out I was pregnant!  Love it!  Did I say love it?!</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion. I have used it on my face as well as belly and it feels nice on. It feels creamy and non-greasy to me. And so far at 7 months pregnant, I don&#x27;t have anything near to stretch marks. However, I can&#x27;t say that that is a result of this product. I actually like it better for my face than any face lotion I have tried, so I may keep buying it for that reason.</li>
            <li> Put this on my belly every night and morning with my last pregnancy and had not ONE stretch mark.....on my belly!  Wish I had put it all over my body, as I did get marks on other areas.  It is very thick lotion and you can&#x27;t put clothes immediately on after application because they will stick to you.  So I put it on and relax for a few minutes under the fan to let it soak in and then continue getting ready.  Anyways, HIGHLY recommend this product if you are pregnant or know someone who is!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It feels amazing on my growing belly. Used it on my last pregnancy and again on this one. I did still get strech marks but it made my itchy skin feel great while pregnant. I also use the Mama Bees oil and put this on top, its the perfect relief.</li>
            <li> Great product, very moisturizing.  I&#x27;ve used it for several months, and I&#x27;m hoping it will prevent stretch marks throughout my pregnancy.  I&#x27;ll post an update later.</li>
