            <li> I really enjoyed the original Charlie, it was so fresh and modern. Women were coming up in the world, for those of you who remember the days!  After reading about Charlie Gold on a perfume blog, I looked forward to trying this. Perfume is highly subjective, of course. But from my point of view the aldehydes and the spices clash in quite an unpleasant manner. I certainly would not wear this to the office, it would offend many people. Too bad, I love to find cheap but wearable scents, but this is not.</li>
            <li> Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But looks like this is old bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and the fragrance lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Charlie Gold is proof that it does not cost a lot to smell good. It&#x27;s a warm, spicy oriental with a small &#x27;s&#x27; and a small &#x27;o.&#x27; Charlie Gold does not last as long as I would like. At this price, who cares? It&#x27;s a good one for those who like soft spicy orientals that wear close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It opens alot like Lady Stetson &amp; Tresor to me - must be all that fleshy fruit (peaches, apricots). It&#x27;s quite nice. The heart is fairly straight up, a bit sweet &amp; powdery. The base gets smokey, tobacco-y, and I like it! Overall, quite similar to Ciara and to Fire &amp; Ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Gold is a real winner! It&#x27;s best in the line &amp; not at all like the original, which is shrill and cheap to me. I should know - I was a Charlie girl.</li>
            <li> Nicely shipped.  Bought as a gift and it was loved!</li>
            <li> WOULD BY THIS ANY TIME AND WEAR THIS PARFUM  ANY WHERE. WOULD TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS  PRODUCT. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> that is my name,been a fan for years</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT. I WILL BUY IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all the color and smell partum is a remarkable colony of a well being and security to those who uses it, is not cloying, like a good colony composition makes us feel the smell of her natural makeup is glamorous young Bid valley to feel sorry charlie</li>
            <li> Charlie Gold is indeed well suited for the holiday season. It is sweet...evoking a sense of well being with an hint of nutmeg and cinnamon about it. More so meant for an older person than a younger person. It has a certain quality about it. It is made in England, and it is absolutely marvelous...How else can a pussycat describe this most luscious eau de toilette except to purr and say...purr-fect!</li>
            <li> I Like ,Thanks very much</li>
            <li> This is a pretty scent which I gave as a gift.  I tried it on myself and noticed it didn&#x27;t last.  Hopefully it will last on my friend for whom I gave it as a gift as everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different.</li>
            <li> love the way it smile on me will buy agine soon.</li>
            <li> It was old, didn&#x27;t smell anything like it should and it was not returnable. I will not buy perfumes from amazon again.</li>
            <li> I did not like charlie gold at all. very overbearing and harsh smelling. the funniy thing is i like charlie, charlie red and charlie blue.</li>
            <li> My gal enjoyed this quite a  lot.</li>
