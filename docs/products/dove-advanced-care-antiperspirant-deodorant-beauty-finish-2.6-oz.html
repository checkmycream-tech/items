            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the cucumber-scented ones I bought.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it works well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think most people have that problem tho.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since we realized, we have found many deodorants that are MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleased at how well it worked.</li>
            <li>Just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Love Dove in deodorant and all products.</li>
            <li>Love Dove deodorant though.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I found these better priced at store</li>
            <li>i love it i been using this and the sleeveless for a couple months i love them</li>
            <li>It smells more like figs than pomegranates, which is a shame.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, it just could be better.  </li>
            <li>am so glad i got it on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>and If I forget to put on deodorant again I&#x27;ll be ok</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>However I love Dove.</li>
            <li>family favorite Deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, it always does what it should.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell and have used this scent since it came out.</li>
            <li>AS WELL OR BETTER THAN MOST DEODERANTS</li>
            <li>CAUSE I LOVE HAVING A CHOICE</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job a winner will buy more</li>
            <li>I love deals like this.</li>
            <li>The product keeps its promises, for the most part.</li>
            <li>More like 8 hours.</li>
            <li>and maybe a couple more times day should buy this product.</li>
            <li>I love that I can buy it on Amazon using Subscribe and Save</li>
            <li>I will be buying some more.</li>
            <li>Works great to deoderize and prevent too much sweating.</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>She loves this brand and the scent even more</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re just glad that she smells better</li>
            <li>Love pomegranate....</li>
            <li>Smells nice, and perfectly does the job of keeping me dry and odour free.  </li>
            <li>The scent is so pleasant and lasting and it makes me feel good even at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I only use this or the powder scent, works fantastic, smells great, feels good on.</li>
            <li>This application - after you put your clothes on and with careful access - is best to keep you from staining your clothes.</li>
            <li>Good stuff and smells very feminine.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I decided to subscribe.</li>
            <li>This one, (and the cucumber one, from the same Dove line, Go Fresh), works wonderfully, I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>It rolls on easily, and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>Dove deodorant is really the best on the market as far as moisture goes.</li>
            <li>Amazon makes ordering this product easy and convenient.</li>
            <li>The date is fine on product, so age is not the issue.</li>
            <li>This deodorant slides on easily, is non-irritating, and offers good wetness/odor protection.  </li>
            <li>I hope this helps and please do wear your deodorant for a better smelling world ;)!</li>
            <li>Plus, amazon had a great deal on Dove products, buy 2 at regular price and get one free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now, and I&#x27;m really happy with</li>
            <li>where I&#x27;ve used it feels smooth</li>
            <li>Try it, it&#x27;s truly fantastic.</li>
            <li>Lasts throughout my work day, and keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>awesome pantry filler item straight from Amazon w/ no extra trip to the supermarket needed!</li>
            <li>I love having everything shipped right to my door.</li>
            <li>Has a great, soft, clean smell that keeps you fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Not only does this keep you fresh all day but it has a pleasant non overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>Its fragrance and texture make this deodorant unique.</li>
            <li>and it keeps me fresh all day!</li>
            <li>Fruity and clean.  </li>
            <li>This new scent is eye catching with the pink color and smells great.</li>
            <li>I love this scent so much that I bought this twin pack</li>
            <li>I Love the Dove body wash in this scent, but in the deodorant it has too much perfume</li>
            <li>and it gives off a sweet chemical scent.</li>
            <li>thanks for the dual pack:-)</li>
            <li>and i can happily say my pits have made a full recovery from years of rough treatment and in grown hairs.</li>
            <li>It smells nice when you first apply, but this quickly wears off after about an hour, even without intense activity.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get my whole order shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly inoffensive enough that I&#x27;m happy to wear it.  </li>
            <li>but it tends to wear off fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li>or if i am in a rush and can&#x27;t wash up i HAVE to reapply or i will be super funky within the hour.</li>
            <li>I love the new fragrance.  </li>
            <li>(She tried various brands because I let her choose her own</li>
            <li>Fresh smell would recommend.</li>
            <li>It keeps me fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>Love this product it lasts all day has a nive soft smell and it does</li>
            <li>It has a fresh scent and it is hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>but for me it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel really fresh all day with this deodorant</li>
            <li>, i have to reapply if i having a super hot days</li>
            <li>(Here&#x27;s a tip I heard once, by the way -- if you get deodorant on your clothes, rub the area with pantyhose, and it&#x27;ll take the deodorant right off.  </li>
            <li>My husband realized right away when the men&#x27;s line was introduced &amp; told me not to buy again.  </li>
            <li>Right after my shower and a bedtime works well.</li>
            <li>NOW THEY HAVE THIS WHOLE EXTENDED LINE OF NEW FRAGRANCES WHICH I LOVE</li>
            <li>Baby powder scent is my ultimate favorite in Dove Deodorant, go fresh</li>
            <li>and they were the first to not leave the area around my armpits chapped.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>Pretty smell.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant really lasts!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to order something that will be used in the future</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>AS GENTLE 2 FRESHLY SHAVED UNDERARMS</li>
            <li>THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I GOT.</li>
            <li>THANKS, DOVE!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so strong that everyone around me can smell it, but whenever I lift up my arms, it smells like fruity candy mixed with fresh linen.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most economical and best smelling and long lasting deodorants, especially when I do my long yoga routine when I am sweating bullets for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>It really works and I certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It leaves white stuff on clothes, but that&#x27;s easily removed with a microfiber cloth.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, soft and soothing, truly the best deodorant for troubled armpits.</li>
            <li>I was actually hesitant about using another scented deodorant product after that experience, but I got a free sample of this from somewhere</li>
            <li>Very overpowering.</li>
            <li>It really works, even when doing yardwork in 90 degree weather all day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>very Pomegranate flavor is really scare, but online.</li>
            <li>The smell/fragrance was much stronger than anticipated.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It came fast and there was no damage to it.</li>
            <li>The thing I don&#x27;t really like about this product is that I still have to put deodorant on at night even when it says &amp;#34;48 hour protection&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used so many deodorants over the years, including liquid brands that you spray on and clear gel brands that are supposed to keep your clothes stain-free, and I keep coming back to Dove anti-perspirant deodorant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to be OK if I use this only a few days a week and the older Dove ones most of the week.</li>
            <li>I ordered this particular scent because it was the only one Amazon had available in value packs through subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t give me a rash, though many other kinds of deodorant do!&lt;br /&gt;*Works well as an antiperspirant and deodorant and lasts all day (barring vigorous exercise, of course).  </li>
            <li>I found that dove was significantly cheaper though, especially when bought in two packs, so I switched it up and tried this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I get more compliments than any other fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have bought it before and will keep buying them due to the cost and quality of this product.</li>
            <li>One of the last times I helped her clean out and organize her room</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter was the first to say, &amp;</li>
            <li>like it but full of chemicals I now only use goat milk products</li>
            <li>I will remain a Dove user, but will not order this particular Dove deodorant again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell quite as much as secret, and it&#x27;s definitely not as strong, but I wear so many other fragranced things (lotions, hair products) that this is probably actually a good thing.  </li>
            <li>You can never go wrong when you buy a Dove product, everything they make it great whether it be this product or soap etc.</li>
            <li>I now wear sleeveless clothes in the summer without being self conscious dove really saved me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had issues with finding the right antiperspirant/deodorant for me, since most either dry my underarms out SO much or offer too little protection</li>
            <li>But, this is my new ol&#x27; reliable.</li>
            <li>And in addition to that, it smells amazing, I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So instead, first, put on your clothes, and then just reach from above or below - depending on your type of clothing and apply the deodorant under your arms.</li>
            <li>Dove antiperspirant/deodorant keeps my armpits dry and smelling fresh during my miles and miles of exploring Hawaii on foot.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as good as other Dove products that I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value pack, and I do like the smell, but unfortunately, this deodorant leaves white stains on clothes.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to scents and this does not bother me.</li>
            <li>but with these, they last the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, allergy-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I started using the natural crystal deodorant because I assumed any deodorant stick would be like that.  </li>
            <li>I use this during the summer, and use a natural one during the rest of the year.</li>
            <li>I would like to use a natural product, but this works so well to control sweat and smell.  </li>
            <li>I still use it some times, but have switched to an all natural product.</li>
            <li>Teh doedorant is okay, but not strong enough to keep me &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; all day.</li>
            <li>Totally keeps me dry and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason this particular twin pack is not long lasting.</li>
            <li>I have bought this from a local store in the past and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Much better than what I normally buy, doesn&#x27;t leave the distasteful clumps at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I keep using Dad&#x27;s deodorant.&amp;#34;  My 17 year old daughter, like me, just thought it was her &amp; would apply her deodorant several times per day.  </li>
            <li>but this is the first deodorant products to help cut down on them.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t even used half of the first one.  </li>
            <li>To me it has a slight funk to already(probably just me) but that&#x27;s why i am still looking for a cleaner crisp scent.</li>

            <li> Great fresh smell.</li>
            <li> is suitable to people who are allergic to scent.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very light also very strong</li>
            <li> The price was right and the scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love the Pomegranate smell</li>
            <li> Love the smell, feel, and price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than the cucumber-scented ones I bought.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it works well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think most people have that problem tho.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since we realized, we have found many deodorants that are MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> and I was pleased at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Love Dove in deodorant and all products.</li>
            <li> Love Dove deodorant though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I found these better priced at store</li>
            <li> i love it i been using this and the sleeveless for a couple months i love them</li>
            <li> It smells more like figs than pomegranates, which is a shame.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, it just could be better.  </li>
            <li> am so glad i got it on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> and If I forget to put on deodorant again I&#x27;ll be ok</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> However I love Dove.</li>
            <li> family favorite Deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Love the product, it always does what it should.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell and have used this scent since it came out.</li>
            <li> AS WELL OR BETTER THAN MOST DEODERANTS</li>
            <li> CAUSE I LOVE HAVING A CHOICE</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job a winner will buy more</li>
            <li> I love deals like this.</li>
            <li> The product keeps its promises, for the most part.</li>
            <li> More like 8 hours.</li>
            <li> and maybe a couple more times day should buy this product.</li>
            <li> I love that I can buy it on Amazon using Subscribe and Save</li>
            <li> I will be buying some more.</li>
            <li> Works great to deoderize and prevent too much sweating.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> She loves this brand and the scent even more</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re just glad that she smells better</li>
            <li> Love pomegranate....</li>
            <li> Smells nice, and perfectly does the job of keeping me dry and odour free.  </li>
            <li> The scent is so pleasant and lasting and it makes me feel good even at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I only use this or the powder scent, works fantastic, smells great, feels good on.</li>
            <li> This application - after you put your clothes on and with careful access - is best to keep you from staining your clothes.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and smells very feminine.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I decided to subscribe.</li>
            <li> This one, (and the cucumber one, from the same Dove line, Go Fresh), works wonderfully, I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> It rolls on easily, and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> Dove deodorant is really the best on the market as far as moisture goes.</li>
            <li> Amazon makes ordering this product easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> The date is fine on product, so age is not the issue.</li>
            <li> This deodorant slides on easily, is non-irritating, and offers good wetness/odor protection.  </li>
            <li> I hope this helps and please do wear your deodorant for a better smelling world ;)!</li>
            <li> Plus, amazon had a great deal on Dove products, buy 2 at regular price and get one free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now, and I&#x27;m really happy with</li>
            <li> where I&#x27;ve used it feels smooth</li>
            <li> Try it, it&#x27;s truly fantastic.</li>
            <li> Lasts throughout my work day, and keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> awesome pantry filler item straight from Amazon w/ no extra trip to the supermarket needed!</li>
            <li> I love having everything shipped right to my door.</li>
            <li> Has a great, soft, clean smell that keeps you fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Not only does this keep you fresh all day but it has a pleasant non overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> Its fragrance and texture make this deodorant unique.</li>
            <li> and it keeps me fresh all day!</li>
            <li> Fruity and clean.  </li>
            <li> This new scent is eye catching with the pink color and smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this scent so much that I bought this twin pack</li>
            <li> I Love the Dove body wash in this scent, but in the deodorant it has too much perfume</li>
            <li> and it gives off a sweet chemical scent.</li>
            <li> thanks for the dual pack:-)</li>
            <li> and i can happily say my pits have made a full recovery from years of rough treatment and in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> It smells nice when you first apply, but this quickly wears off after about an hour, even without intense activity.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get my whole order shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly inoffensive enough that I&#x27;m happy to wear it.  </li>
            <li> but it tends to wear off fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li> or if i am in a rush and can&#x27;t wash up i HAVE to reapply or i will be super funky within the hour.</li>
            <li> I love the new fragrance.  </li>
            <li> (She tried various brands because I let her choose her own</li>
            <li> Fresh smell would recommend.</li>
            <li> It keeps me fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> Love this product it lasts all day has a nive soft smell and it does</li>
            <li> It has a fresh scent and it is hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> but for me it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel really fresh all day with this deodorant</li>
            <li> , i have to reapply if i having a super hot days</li>
            <li> (Here&#x27;s a tip I heard once, by the way -- if you get deodorant on your clothes, rub the area with pantyhose, and it&#x27;ll take the deodorant right off.  </li>
            <li> My husband realized right away when the men&#x27;s line was introduced &amp; told me not to buy again.  </li>
            <li> Right after my shower and a bedtime works well.</li>
            <li> NOW THEY HAVE THIS WHOLE EXTENDED LINE OF NEW FRAGRANCES WHICH I LOVE</li>
            <li> Baby powder scent is my ultimate favorite in Dove Deodorant, go fresh</li>
            <li> and they were the first to not leave the area around my armpits chapped.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Pretty smell.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant really lasts!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to order something that will be used in the future</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> AS GENTLE 2 FRESHLY SHAVED UNDERARMS</li>
            <li> THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I GOT.</li>
            <li> THANKS, DOVE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so strong that everyone around me can smell it, but whenever I lift up my arms, it smells like fruity candy mixed with fresh linen.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most economical and best smelling and long lasting deodorants, especially when I do my long yoga routine when I am sweating bullets for 2 hours.</li>
            <li> It really works and I certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It leaves white stuff on clothes, but that&#x27;s easily removed with a microfiber cloth.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, soft and soothing, truly the best deodorant for troubled armpits.</li>
            <li> I was actually hesitant about using another scented deodorant product after that experience, but I got a free sample of this from somewhere</li>
            <li> Very overpowering.</li>
            <li> It really works, even when doing yardwork in 90 degree weather all day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> very Pomegranate flavor is really scare, but online.</li>
            <li> The smell/fragrance was much stronger than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It came fast and there was no damage to it.</li>
            <li> The thing I don&#x27;t really like about this product is that I still have to put deodorant on at night even when it says &amp;#34;48 hour protection&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used so many deodorants over the years, including liquid brands that you spray on and clear gel brands that are supposed to keep your clothes stain-free, and I keep coming back to Dove anti-perspirant deodorant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to be OK if I use this only a few days a week and the older Dove ones most of the week.</li>
            <li> I ordered this particular scent because it was the only one Amazon had available in value packs through subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t give me a rash, though many other kinds of deodorant do!&lt;br /&gt;*Works well as an antiperspirant and deodorant and lasts all day (barring vigorous exercise, of course).  </li>
            <li> I found that dove was significantly cheaper though, especially when bought in two packs, so I switched it up and tried this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I get more compliments than any other fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have bought it before and will keep buying them due to the cost and quality of this product.</li>
            <li> One of the last times I helped her clean out and organize her room</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter was the first to say, &amp;</li>
            <li> like it but full of chemicals I now only use goat milk products</li>
            <li> I will remain a Dove user, but will not order this particular Dove deodorant again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell quite as much as secret, and it&#x27;s definitely not as strong, but I wear so many other fragranced things (lotions, hair products) that this is probably actually a good thing.  </li>
            <li> You can never go wrong when you buy a Dove product, everything they make it great whether it be this product or soap etc.</li>
            <li> I now wear sleeveless clothes in the summer without being self conscious dove really saved me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with finding the right antiperspirant/deodorant for me, since most either dry my underarms out SO much or offer too little protection</li>
            <li> But, this is my new ol&#x27; reliable.</li>
            <li> And in addition to that, it smells amazing, I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So instead, first, put on your clothes, and then just reach from above or below - depending on your type of clothing and apply the deodorant under your arms.</li>
            <li> Dove antiperspirant/deodorant keeps my armpits dry and smelling fresh during my miles and miles of exploring Hawaii on foot.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as other Dove products that I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value pack, and I do like the smell, but unfortunately, this deodorant leaves white stains on clothes.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to scents and this does not bother me.</li>
            <li> but with these, they last the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, allergy-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I started using the natural crystal deodorant because I assumed any deodorant stick would be like that.  </li>
            <li> I use this during the summer, and use a natural one during the rest of the year.</li>
            <li> I would like to use a natural product, but this works so well to control sweat and smell.  </li>
            <li> I still use it some times, but have switched to an all natural product.</li>
            <li> Teh doedorant is okay, but not strong enough to keep me &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; all day.</li>
            <li> Totally keeps me dry and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason this particular twin pack is not long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have bought this from a local store in the past and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Much better than what I normally buy, doesn&#x27;t leave the distasteful clumps at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I keep using Dad&#x27;s deodorant.&amp;#34;  My 17 year old daughter, like me, just thought it was her &amp; would apply her deodorant several times per day.  </li>
            <li> but this is the first deodorant products to help cut down on them.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even used half of the first one.  </li>
            <li> To me it has a slight funk to already(probably just me) but that&#x27;s why i am still looking for a cleaner crisp scent.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me, and the scent is not strong.</li>
            <li> Works, doen&#x27;t leave residue on clothes, does not offend my husband&#x27;s overly sensitive nose (unlike every other one I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular scent for a few years now</li>
            <li> I think Dove products are usually quite gentle</li>
            <li> Sometimes scents are strange for different people and deodorants</li>
            <li> Unlike all the others I wear religiously for long lasting confidence and assurance, this stops working after only a few short hours.</li>
            <li> I am a long distance runner.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing i can say is it doesn&#x27;t last very long as far effectiveness</li>
            <li> I was extremely anxious about trying out a new deodorant.</li>
            <li> began using other Dove Deodorants (Invisible Solid, I think) years ago</li>
            <li> I have found they last longer on me than any other product.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> tried and true has always been the typical Secret brand deodorant - you know of it</li>
            <li> I usually buy from target, but it is about 1-2$ more expensive in store, depending on what day you go.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little cheaper here than in the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I actually have had very few instances of this getting on my clothes, which is a big improvement over other products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Usually my deodorant doesn&#x27;t last so long</li>
            <li> Always delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant since a few years back.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the plain white slab of deodorant goodness.</li>
            <li> It leaves me with the dry/chapped areas on my torso and arms the way other brands do.</li>
            <li> My husband loves dove soap, so I purchased the deodorants &amp; other products for my family of 5.  </li>
            <li> I use other Dove deodorant products and they work well.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it isnt a four pack.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s usually at least 3 tiny clump balls of my deodorant on my office chair at work by the end of the day, even when I&#x27;m wearing a sleeved shirt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is not natural, so I am not sure how it affects the skin.</li>
            <li> I by dove because secret and sauve look like old lady deodorant.</li>
            <li> I do however see deodorant marks on my black tank tops despite claims that it does not transfer.</li>
            <li> It cuts your razor bumps in half, sometimes making them no existent.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave a mess, keeps on all day</li>
            <li> I also apply a little to under my breasts and below my navel, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> IS THE NO STING APPLICATION + NO ITCHY LITTLE BUMPS</li>
            <li> It helps with wetness protection, a little bit.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it left less of a residue than secret and each tube lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I use only this brand &amp; secret,</li>
            <li> I had watched some reviews on Youtube and decided to buy it on Amazon, because it is not available in Brazil.</li>
            <li> I see a difference but not a huge one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands - even other types of Secret deodorant - but nothing has done the trick</li>
            <li> horrible smell - very strong</li>
            <li> - I commonly get the sweaty feet and pits due to anxious stress sweating, but still nothing!</li>
            <li> I am usually an Arrid customer.  </li>
            <li> No more stinky pits.</li>
            <li> I usually shop.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is going on with this pack.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great Price!!!  Smells nice also!  Love the Pomegranate smell</li>
            <li> I have used this for a while and I like it.  Good buy with two in the pack.  I am sensitive to scents and this does not bother me.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, feel, and price.  I have had them both for almost a month now and I haven&#x27;t even used half of the first one.  Usually my deodorant doesn&#x27;t last so long but with these, they last the whole day.  I only have to apply once in the morning and doesn&#x27;t fade all day.  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me, and the scent is not strong. It&#x27;s much better than the cucumber-scented ones I bought.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it works well. I love having everything shipped right to my door.I will keep buying all my household amd personal needs from Amazon</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, allergy-prone skin.  I used to use one of the Secret gels, and it worked very well, but it made me itch something terrible.  I was actually hesitant about using another scented deodorant product after that experience, but I got a free sample of this from somewhere and I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now, and I&#x27;m really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I happen to like the scent.  It&#x27;s not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;*It doesn&#x27;t give me a rash, though many other kinds of deodorant do!&lt;br /&gt;*Works well as an antiperspirant and deodorant and lasts all day (barring vigorous exercise, of course).  However, is not overly drying.&lt;br /&gt;*Skin where I&#x27;ve used it feels smooth (though I, personally, have never had a problem with bumps after shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid (e.g. white) type of deodorant, not a gel.  However, I actually have had very few instances of this getting on my clothes, which is a big improvement over other products I&#x27;ve used.  (Here&#x27;s a tip I heard once, by the way -- if you get deodorant on your clothes, rub the area with pantyhose, and it&#x27;ll take the deodorant right off.  Has always worked for me.)</li>
            <li> I love this scent so much that I bought this twin pack, it&#x27;s a little cheaper here than in the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using other Dove Deodorants (Invisible Solid, I think) years ago and they were the first to not leave the area around my armpits chapped. I assumed this version would be the same. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not. It leaves me with the dry/chapped areas on my torso and arms the way other brands do. I don&#x27;t think most people have that problem tho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be OK if I use this only a few days a week and the older Dove ones most of the week. Sure do love the scent! Also, it is quite effective.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the dove deodorants over the years. My husband loves dove soap, so I purchased the deodorants &amp; other products for my family of 5.  It took years of trial &amp; error to discover that dove deodorants do not work! My husband realized right away when the men&#x27;s line was introduced &amp; told me not to buy again.  I thought it was just my own body chemistry.. I would put on whichever dove deodorant I would have on hand.  The cool cucumber was the worst. By noon I would smell like Body odor mixed with the scent. When I showered, it was impossible to wash off so I would have this stinky BO &amp; fragrance stuck to my underarms.  I started using the natural crystal deodorant because I assumed any deodorant stick would be like that.  My 12 year old daughter was the first to say, &amp;#34;mom, this dove deodorant is horrible! It doesn&#x27;t work!&amp;#34;  (She tried various brands because I let her choose her own so she could compare) Then my teenage son chimed it.. &amp;#34;Yeah, I hate it, I stink by the end of the day at school! I keep using Dad&#x27;s deodorant.&amp;#34;  My 17 year old daughter, like me, just thought it was her &amp; would apply her deodorant several times per day.  Since we realized, we have found many deodorants that are MUCH better.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t work.  Like, at all,</li>
            <li> Great deal, using Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> I am usually an Arrid customer.  but these were tempting with the price and scent and I was pleased at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> Teh doedorant is okay, but not strong enough to keep me &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; all day. So perhaps i wil try another.</li>
            <li> I Love the Dove body wash in this scent, but in the deodorant it has too much perfume and it gives off a sweet chemical scent. Also, after a couple of uses it all crumbled apart. Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I only use this or the powder scent, works fantastic, smells great, feels good on. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Its fragrance and texture make this deodorant unique. It smells delicious and is wonderfully soft to skin. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> **Still one of the only deodorants I use and I trust!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used so many deodorants over the years, including liquid brands that you spray on and clear gel brands that are supposed to keep your clothes stain-free, and I keep coming back to Dove anti-perspirant deodorant. This is one of the most economical and best smelling and long lasting deodorants, especially when I do my long yoga routine when I am sweating bullets for 2 hours. I still don&#x27;t smell disgusting at the end of my yoga practice, and it&#x27;s thanks to this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you have to take care of is how you put it on, because if you just apply it out of the shower and then put on your clothes, unless you are wearing white, you will stain your clothes after which you need to take a damp towel and rub it off. So instead, first, put on your clothes, and then just reach from above or below - depending on your type of clothing and apply the deodorant under your arms. I also apply a little to under my breasts and below my navel, but that&#x27;s just me. This application - after you put your clothes on and with careful access - is best to keep you from staining your clothes. I hope this helps and please do wear your deodorant for a better smelling world ;)!</li>
            <li> Best &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; deodorant I have used. I use this during the summer, and use a natural one during the rest of the year.</li>
            <li> Pretty smell.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as other Dove products that I have bought in the past. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> The deodorant is a nice size and smells good when it is applied to my underarms.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant. Smells great and does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> Love Dove in deodorant and all products. Fresh smell would recommend.</li>
            <li> I would like to use a natural product, but this works so well to control sweat and smell.  It works even when I exercise.  I do have to use it 2x a day.  Right after my shower and a bedtime works well.</li>
            <li> Smells so yummy. I usually buy from target, but it is about 1-2$ more expensive in store, depending on what day you go.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong when you buy a Dove product, everything they make it great whether it be this product or soap etc.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave a mess, keeps on all day, it has a great smell, great price, I love this deodorant .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand the smell of this scent. Very overpowering. Love Dove deodorant though.</li>
            <li> Great value and convenient</li>
            <li> It really works, even when doing yardwork in 90 degree weather all day. This deodorant really lasts! The smell is very pleasant and not overpowering, and the price is the best out there!</li>
            <li> I used secret deodorant for years, and I&#x27;ve also used a couple of other brands from time to time.  I found that dove was significantly cheaper though, especially when bought in two packs, so I switched it up and tried this stuff.  To my surprise, it left less of a residue than secret and each tube lasted longer. I don&#x27;t love the smell quite as much as secret, and it&#x27;s definitely not as strong, but I wear so many other fragranced things (lotions, hair products) that this is probably actually a good thing.  Also, I work out a fair amount and sweat a lot, and this protects me well!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Works great and it smells great also. I&#x27;ve already recommended this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Have this on subscribe and save with Amazon.  Always delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this deodorant.  I&#x27;ve always had issues with finding the right antiperspirant/deodorant for me, since most either dry my underarms out SO much or offer too little protection - this is a perfect balance.  I never have to worry about sweating  and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  The scent is AMAZING! I also have the body wash and spray and I get more compliments than any other fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li> No more stinky pits. Good stuff and smells very feminine.</li>
            <li> I needed an add-on product and zeroed in on this deodorant twin pack.  It&#x27;s better to order something that will be used in the future and I hadn&#x27;t seen the &amp;#34;Revive&amp;#34; scent in local stores.  The twin pack was no more expensive than what I pay at discount stores and I was able to get my whole order shipped quickly.  I like the scent and you can&#x27;t go wrong with Dove deodorant.  I&#x27;ll look for the same deal the next time I need an add-on item.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and it keeps me fresh all day! Only complaint is that it isnt a four pack. ;)</li>
            <li> I use other Dove deodorant products and they work well.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem to offer the same staying power.  I&#x27;m also not thrilled with the smell.  It reminds me OF body odor a bit.  Sometimes scents are strange for different people and deodorants are the same way so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Good deodorant &amp; like the scent.</li>
            <li> I had never found an affordable antiperspirant that actually works. This one, (and the cucumber one, from the same Dove line, Go Fresh), works wonderfully, I am very impressed. No sweat stains and a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  The price was right and the scent is pleasant. It does the job and no sweaty arm pits!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value pack, and I do like the smell, but unfortunately, this deodorant leaves white stains on clothes.</li>
            <li> Makes your underarms smell horrible so nasty threw it in the garbage will never buy again.</li>
            <li> The scent is so pleasant and lasting and it makes me feel good even at the end of the day. It rolls on easily, and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. Been using this for years.</li>
            <li> awesome pantry filler item straight from Amazon w/ no extra trip to the supermarket needed!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t irritate me.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth...invisible. Nice scent. Keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me perspire all throughout the day. No yellow stains on my shirt either.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Everything is super!!!!</li>
            <li> The best deodorant I have ever used, and at 82, that says all you need to know!</li>
            <li> Great smell, and I&#x27;m no ape of a woman or sweat hog or anything but it tends to wear off fairly quickly.  And there&#x27;s the deodorant clothing stains....but I don&#x27;t think this claimed to be an invisible solid.</li>
            <li> Swear this is the only stuff that&#x27;s doing the trick nowadays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular scent for a few years now and I won&#x27;t use anything else.  Even the newer Dove that tauts 24 hour protection isn&#x27;t as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell. I found these better priced at store I usually shop.</li>
            <li> I like the Dove deodorant products.  I have found they last longer on me than any other product.  I will definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> By far the worst deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Never mind 48 hour protection, it doesn&#x27;t even last 48 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It leaves hideous white marks all over clothes.&lt;br /&gt;2. The deodorant chaffs and falls everywhere. There&#x27;s usually at least 3 tiny clump balls of my deodorant on my office chair at work by the end of the day, even when I&#x27;m wearing a sleeved shirt.&lt;br /&gt;3. It smells nice when you first apply, but this quickly wears off after about an hour, even without intense activity.&lt;br /&gt;4. It doesn&#x27;t stop perspiration at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this deodorant to anybody.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dove brand for years. This new scent is eye catching with the pink color and smells great. I do however see deodorant marks on my black tank tops despite claims that it does not transfer.</li>
            <li> i love it i been using this and the sleeveless for a couple months i love them dont mind spending the extra couple of bucks for this stuff</li>
            <li> Came on time smells amazing</li>
            <li> This deodorant slides on easily, is non-irritating, and offers good wetness/odor protection.  It keeps me fresh all day.  The scent is t not as fruity as I might like.  It smells more like figs than pomegranates, which is a shame.  It&#x27;s not horrible, it just could be better.  It&#x27;s certainly inoffensive enough that I&#x27;m happy to wear it.  I ordered this particular scent because it was the only one Amazon had available in value packs through subscribe and save.  I&#x27;d definitely order this Dove deodorant again, but I&#x27;d probably seek out a different, fresher scent.</li>
            <li> my best deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;this very Pomegranate flavor is really scare, but online. am so glad i got it on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;its stays from morning till end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars or more.&lt;br /&gt;just scared it is disappearing from our shelves in store..</li>
            <li> I like this one because it does not have a overpowering smell it smells good but it&#x27;s very light also very strong I use it and take a bath the next day and If I forget to put on deodorant again I&#x27;ll be ok</li>
            <li> It smells good, it&#x27;s a good anti-perspirant/deoderant. It leaves white stuff on clothes, but that&#x27;s easily removed with a microfiber cloth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell of this deodorant and was really happy with the price. I loved it so much that I decided to subscribe.</li>
            <li> The smell/fragrance was much stronger than anticipated. Not my favorite. However I love Dove.</li>
            <li> like it but full of chemicals I now only use goat milk products</li>
            <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li> family favorite Deodorant.  great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Totally keeps me dry and smelling fresh.  Not all deodorants do!  Very nice smell too.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love the product, it always does what it should. It came fast and there was no damage to it. I also love the smell and have used this scent since it came out. I get the body spray to go along with it. Great pair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING DOVE DEODERANT/ANTIPERSPERANT SINCE IT 1ST CAME ON THE MARKET. THEY MARKETED IT AS GENTLE 2 FRESHLY SHAVED UNDERARMS + THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED. ITS EXACTLY WHAT I GOT. IT WORKS AS WELL OR BETTER THAN MOST DEODERANTS BUT WHAT KEEPS ME COMING BACK IS THE NO STING APPLICATION + NO ITCHY LITTLE BUMPS AS THE HAIR BEGINS 2 GROW BACK IN. NOW THEY HAVE THIS WHOLE EXTENDED LINE OF NEW FRAGRANCES WHICH I LOVE CAUSE I LOVE HAVING A CHOICE DEPENDING ON MY MOOD OR THE OCCASION. THEY ARRIVED QUICKLY, IN PERFECT CONDITION + I WOULD BUY THIS FRAGRANCE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Faye and I love it.</li>
            <li> Great smell, great deal.</li>
            <li> Love this product it lasts all day has a nive soft smell and it does it&#x27;s job a winner will buy more</li>
            <li> I love Dove! This is a good price on the 2-pack deodorant. I always have good luck with their antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I use this brand because I am allergic to all others.  It smells great, but doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Dove deodorant numerous times through Amazon. For whatever reason this particular twin pack is not long lasting. Unlike all the others I wear religiously for long lasting confidence and assurance, this stops working after only a few short hours. I have to rewash and reapply. That defeats the purpose of me buying 48hr deodorant. Morning and night showers are routine for me, but to feel like an underarm wash is needed by 12pm is simply ridiculous when you have no health issues in that area. The date is fine on product, so age is not the issue. I have bought this from a local store in the past and it worked fine. Not sure what is going on with this pack. I will remain a Dove user, but will not order this particular Dove deodorant again.</li>
            <li> Keeps me in control all day without irritation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant since a few years back. It has a fresh scent and it is hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> Nice, soft fragrance and works wonderfully.  I think Dove products are usually quite gentle and this is just perfect.  5 stars</li>
            <li> The only brand and scent I use. I also use the body wash as well. I have always used Dove.</li>
            <li> horrible smell - very strong</li>
            <li> I love this product and the scent was great, too. Plus, amazon had a great deal on Dove products, buy 2 at regular price and get one free. I love deals like this.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  Just perfect!  Smells great!  Works great, too!!</li>
            <li> Worst # incredulous!!!!</li>
            <li> The product keeps its promises, for the most part. It defiantly doesn&#x27;t get rid of odor for 48 hours. More like 8 hours. It helps with wetness protection, a little bit. I see a difference but not a huge one. It does help replenish underarm skin though. The good thing about this product is that it helps my skin and it has a really nice smell to it. The thing I don&#x27;t really like about this product is that I still have to put deodorant on at night even when it says &amp;#34;48 hour protection&amp;#34;. People who don&#x27;t mind putting deodorant on at night too and maybe a couple more times day should buy this product. You can find this product at any big company store.</li>
            <li> Dove deodorant is really the best on the market as far as moisture goes. It cuts your razor bumps in half, sometimes making them no existent. I suffered from razor bumps for years and i got the scars to prove it but this is the first deodorant products to help cut down on them. It also has helped with the scars and darker coloring of my armpits as well. It is very gentle, soft and soothing, truly the best deodorant for troubled armpits. I have stop shaving and now use veet type product and i can happily say my pits have made a full recovery from years of rough treatment and in grown hairs. I now wear sleeveless clothes in the summer without being self conscious dove really saved me. The only negative thing i can say is it doesn&#x27;t last very long as far effectiveness, i have to reapply if i having a super hot days or if i am in a rush and can&#x27;t wash up i HAVE to reapply or i will be super funky within the hour. I used to use mitchem and it lasted 48 hours no problems but again it not as soothing as dove. If you don&#x27;t have problem skin you might not need dove and can get away with a stronger or cheaper alternative  but for me it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is nice but to me not the best. I probably wouldn&#x27;t order this scent again. To me it has a slight funk to already(probably just me) but that&#x27;s why i am still looking for a cleaner crisp scent.</li>
            <li> I by dove because secret and sauve look like old lady deodorant. Seriously that&#x27;s why I buy it.</li>
            <li> So, let me preface this with I was extremely anxious about trying out a new deodorant. There&#x27;s no denying that if I don&#x27;t have on a reliable stick, I&#x27;m going to stank. And not just stank - I mean staaaaaank. With pit stains and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tried and true has always been the typical Secret brand deodorant - you know of it, it&#x27;s the plain white slab of deodorant goodness. It leaves no scent, and only sometimes leaves deodorant on your clothing. I&#x27;ve tried other brands - even other types of Secret deodorant - but nothing has done the trick (don&#x27;t get me STARTED on Secret pH Balance... I threw that in the trash after one use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I bought this on a whim to get to 5 subscribe and save deals, I was a little bit skeptical. But, this is my new ol&#x27; reliable. I haven&#x27;t had one ounce of moisture develop - I commonly get the sweaty feet and pits due to anxious stress sweating, but still nothing! And in addition to that, it smells amazing, I&#x27;m serious. It&#x27;s not so strong that everyone around me can smell it, but whenever I lift up my arms, it smells like fruity candy mixed with fresh linen. It&#x27;s great. Try it, it&#x27;s truly fantastic.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> I love Dove deodorant and this fragrance is incredible.  I love that I can buy it on Amazon using Subscribe and Save so I never run out!</li>
            <li> Works, doen&#x27;t leave residue on clothes, does not offend my husband&#x27;s overly sensitive nose (unlike every other one I&#x27;ve tried). Amazon makes ordering this product easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, and perfectly does the job of keeping me dry and odour free.  I feel really fresh all day with this deodorant and I would definitely recommend it.  I will be buying some more.</li>
            <li> Perfect pricing...never go to a store for this again</li>
            <li> Works great to deoderize and prevent too much sweating. The smell is also pleasant and not too strong. I will reorder this product when mine starts running low.</li>
            <li> I love the new fragrance.  Fruity and clean.  And the twin pack is great - always have one to spare...</li>
            <li> I use only this brand &amp; secret, anything else does not work for me and I&#x27;m not don&#x27;t sweat a lot. Not only does this keep you fresh all day but it has a pleasant non overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> I am a long distance runner. Dove antiperspirant/deodorant keeps my armpits dry and smelling fresh during my miles and miles of exploring Hawaii on foot. Meanwhile the rest of me sweats like a pig and smells of manure rooting. No heat rash under the pits, though! THANKS, DOVE!</li>
            <li> Great Product at a great price and very fast shipping!  Will definitely purchase again from this company.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant. Great fresh smell. Lasts throughout my work day, and keeps my skin smooth. Have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This is the best out there and for the price it is amazing.  I love this product and have bought it before and will keep buying them due to the cost and quality of this product. It is a must buy and I would recommend this to all my friends and family to buy this.  I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Its a good deo, just like all Dove products. But it is not natural, so I am not sure how it affects the skin. I still use it some times, but have switched to an all natural product.</li>
            <li> Lovely sent, always keeps me smelling great!</li>
            <li> Much better than what I normally buy, doesn&#x27;t leave the distasteful clumps at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Baby powder scent is my ultimate favorite in Dove Deodorant, go fresh is suitable to people who are allergic to scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but deodorant is expensive and for some reason, my youngest daughter is constantly \\&quot;losing\\&quot; hers.  One of the last times I helped her clean out and organize her room, I found about 8 of them in the weirdest places.  She loves this brand and the scent even more and we&#x27;re just glad that she smells better so we&#x27;ll keep buying! (Jk, DD!)</li>
            <li> I had watched some reviews on Youtube and decided to buy it on Amazon, because it is not available in Brazil. Well... it arrived in time and well packaged. The product is the best anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve used so far! It really works and I certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love pomegranate....thanks for the dual pack:-)</li>
            <li> Has a great, soft, clean smell that keeps you fresh all day. I will buy this again.</li>
