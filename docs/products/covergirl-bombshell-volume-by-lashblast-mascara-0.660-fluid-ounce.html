            <li>I am happy with the look of my lashes.</li>

            <li>I really liked it!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how the curl would hold but it holds wonderfully!</li>
            <li>and I really liked it!  </li>
            <li>but I use a good eye make up remover</li>
            <li>This mascara is good for day and night.</li>
            <li>I think this product is great or summer honestly</li>
            <li>I applied it and loved the volumizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>This mascara gives nice volume and great length</li>
            <li>I purchased the brown-black, which looks really good.  </li>
            <li>marketing was good</li>
            <li>Loved this mascara.</li>
            <li>so, this is a nice product to have in my bag for those special occasions when I want to look my best</li>
            <li>I have had great success many covergirl products and they are usually especially good with mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t know how anyone is giving this a good review.</li>
            <li>and i must say im a huge fan!!</li>
            <li>When I tried to take it off I had to double-check the packaging to make sure I didn&#x27;t grab waterproof!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with this mascara!</li>
            <li>I had been wearing &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; by Elizabeth Mott and found that it was taking more and more to get them to look good, and for a $20 mascara, that did not make me happy.  </li>
            <li>This morning, I put this on again and it looks ever better!  </li>
            <li>looking forward to more products like it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve earned bombshell in my influenster #surfsupvoxbox and it&#x27;s so amazing</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with receiving it for free via Influenster to test it,</li>
            <li>(Clump crusher by lashblast/ covergirl is amazing)</li>
            <li>The waterproof is amazing.</li>
            <li>It was nice to try out, but I don&#x27;t know if I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>It will be nice to use either side for day or night looks, but I&#x27;ve never been a fan of piling on two mascaras.</li>
            <li>I liked how the brush was curved; it made it easier to get the sides.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it made my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li>but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it on my own.</li>
            <li>I love mascara, it is my one staple for makeup every day, so I need a good one.  </li>
            <li>so when i got this i was ready to try it now as it might not be for everyone it was perfect for me</li>
            <li>I really liked the application of side one but side two made my lashes stick together a bit and were a bit sticky they felt like I had walked through a spider web.</li>
            <li>This mascara is perfect if you are looking for something great to wear on your lashes for a night out or even just a pick me up after a long night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this on my lashes for nights out with my husband or my girlfriends! :)</li>
            <li>Bery nice mascara, I love using it.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best mascara.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s pretty great</li>
            <li>Once you have fought the packaging to get it on, you have to hurry and find a clean mascara brush to separate all of the lashes that have gone from being full and beautiful to spiky tarantula legs protruding from your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>I use makeup remover wipes and then also a magic makeup remover cloth and that does the trick.</li>
            <li>To top it off</li>
            <li>I love love love mascara.</li>
            <li>and you might, too. :)</li>
            <li>Love the style.</li>
            <li>When I finally got around to using it, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed as I hoped.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day it got sticky and every time I blinked it would stick top and bottom lashes together.  </li>
            <li>I love how it looks once applied.</li>
            <li>I found its best to just wash my face with my regular soap and then pat the rest off with a towel.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li>This was okay.  </li>
            <li>One of my top favorites.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>i see many commercials about it on t.v and what not</li>
            <li>It makes it more time consuming.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love that it is waterproof</li>
            <li>If you wipe off most of what comes out of the tube and then apply you have a much better chance of not losing your eyelashes when removing it.</li>
            <li>It does an okay job and does get the job done</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get it on your skin because it won&#x27;t just wipe off with a Q-tip like most products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still learning to apply it more evenly.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Step one is ok.  </li>
            <li>, I know you can do better, I&#x27;ve seen you do much better.</li>
            <li>and I actually thought it did an excellent job,</li>
            <li>you read the info on the package, it does say that the formula works like waterproof mascara and to be sure to use an oil based makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I have used MANY products in my day</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure, it just hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  </li>
            <li>I received this in my Influenster box for testing and was honestly kind of excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>However, I like to be able to more easily remove my makeup at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>and I thought I loved it at first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this mascara is pretty good, it gives you the volume and the bombshell</li>
            <li>and I loved the first step of the process.</li>
            <li>My once long beautiful lashes are gone!</li>
            <li>so I was happy to start trying a new one.</li>
            <li>Very cool product; I would recommend this to others looking to highlight their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As far as the mascara part, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>i received this product free from Influenster to test and its ok.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about both products!</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, lasts all day, gives length and fullness WITHOUT any clumping at all.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply</li>
            <li>, the mascara goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>some spaces.&lt;br /&gt;Second side can get clumpy very quickly</li>
            <li>I do not have a problem with my lashes sticking together or with it washing off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Removal wasn&#x27;t easy either.</li>
            <li>It came off easily.</li>
            <li>Beauty blogger Kandee Johnson&#x27;s positive review of this mascara on YouTube sold me on giving it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li>CG eye makeup remover, hot showers, warm compresses, baby shampoo,</li>
            <li>I liked the way it went on and didn&#x27;t clump with the first coat.</li>
            <li>Sophia Vergara is beautiful and can really sell products) and it looked like an interesting new concept.</li>
            <li>and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>it wasnt a huge issue with me</li>
            <li>I got this mascara free in my #SurfsUpVoxBox from Influenster.</li>
            <li>I received this product free from Influenster to try</li>
            <li>I received this mascara free from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I received this for free from Influenster as a test product as part of the Surfs Up VoxBox.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Influenster sent me this for free to test out</li>
            <li>I received a free sample in a #surfsUpVoxBox from @Influenster...</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from Influenster.</li>
            <li>Everyone loves free beauty supplies.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has potential to be a great mascara....</li>
            <li>I received the Covergirl Bombshell Volume Mascara free from Inlfuenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Layers on full, beautiful volume and length, and the second step seals it in so it doesn&#x27;t flake off or smudge into your eyes, and it lasts until you take it off.</li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>I very, very, rarely give one star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Covergirl mascaras in general, and tend to purchase their mascara products, which all have been really great at making my eyelashes look full and pretty!</li>
            <li>I always use Covergirl mascara, so I was really excited to see this in my box.</li>
            <li>I lost too many eyelashes after the first time wearing this to every try it again.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the trouble though because it is the best stuff ever.</li>
            <li>After finishing the step, my eyelashes had formed spikes, so I had to take a clean mascara applicator to my eyelashes to separate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on clean for me without clumping, and I like the brushes.  </li>
            <li>For a special occasion or if I am doing more dramatic make up this would be more ideal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not doing anything special that they&#x27;re not</li>
            <li>and wow amazing</li>
            <li>Washed until my eyelids were bright red.</li>
            <li>but I was really hoping for more results.</li>
            <li>the good thing about the masara is that it gave me volume and also got my smaller lashes,</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have always been full, but I would like them to be longer.</li>
            <li>finished product, after I separated my eyelashes, was actually not bad.</li>
            <li>Originally, I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li>The wands are super think and clunky.</li>
            <li>I would have loved to have found a more economical substitute for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>But, step one does exactly what it says: it made my lashes appear much thicker, well defined and put a lovely curl on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>I liked it okay to use for an everyday mascara.</li>
            <li>{i received a complimentary product for testing purposes}</li>
            <li>received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>

            <li>I received this mascara complimentary from #Ifluenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I received this item complimentary from Influenster for testing</li>
            <li>I received this COVERGIRL&#x27;s Bombshell Curvaceous by LashBlast Mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product that I like, but I most likely wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have to laugh</li>
            <li>Bristles are wider spiral like more old school mascara wands.</li>
            <li>I got this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li>and this comes right off.</li>
            <li>It costs a bit more than your average drug store makeup, but is better than any $30 mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li>It came off easily with some warm water and a little help from makeup remover to get the excess.  </li>
            <li>definitely gives the sexy mysterious look  love it!</li>
            <li>I love the look of the mascara after the first step of the application; it makes my eyes look huge and my lashes very long.  </li>
            <li>At first, I noticed that it definitely made my eyelashes look longer, but it smeared very easily-</li>
            <li>It made my eyelashes look good, but a little clumpy.  </li>
            <li>While I agree that the tub is big, and it does take a bit longer to put on and get off, I still love this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product really works for me!</li>
            <li>I will not be using this mascara again, and will more than likely throw it away.</li>
            <li>Really brings out my eyes by fluffing my lashes up!</li>
            <li>the only goodish thing about is it the applicator there are two one at the top and one at the bottom.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, for a drugstore mascara it totally lives up to its name.  </li>
            <li>I love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I think the way the mascara looks is pretty</li>
            <li>...claims that in no way represent actual results you will be able to receive from using this product.</li>
            <li>First of all, there was not a difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li>I love my current mascara</li>
            <li>should i use it on my bottom lashes now, thanks covergirl!</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>I love that it gives the option of creating three different looks, and being it&#x27;s attached, I don&#x27;t need a variety of mascaras in my makeup</li>
            <li>fair enough, but if this required special specific remover it should be written in large print so a reasonable person could purchase it at thesame time.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have difficulty finding good mascara for my eyelashes (black, short, not thick) - this product worked okay, but I most likely would not purchase it myself.</li>
            <li>I was interested in this when I read positive articles online</li>
            <li>If you buy the product, a different wand may be a good idea, or perhaps use step one and add a different mascara.</li>
            <li>The wands are too fat and short to make application easy.  </li>
            <li>(maybe ok for people with hand difficulties/ limited dexterity?)  </li>
            <li>The huge packaging is kind of unique though and the color IS dark, but it also seems like less product for your buck.</li>
            <li>The first step (add volume and curl) worked decently.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to every woman or man;)</li>
            <li>It makes my long eyelashes look very full, and the two wands/formulas is a really neat idea.</li>
            <li>This really does plump them up and colors them, and the color stays on very well.  </li>
            <li>I see there are some folks for whom this mascara worked really well</li>
            <li>You really do need to use an oils based remover to get it off.</li>
            <li>but it dosent work very well.</li>
            <li>One thing that I really appreciated about this mascara was that it was NOT waterproof.</li>
            <li>I made taking it off much easier.</li>
            <li>Both do their job very well&lt;br /&gt;spaces lashes out and doesn&#x27;t clump them together.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I got this from Influenster to test it out, I found that is clumps to much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seemed to have much luck with 2-step mascaras.</li>
            <li>This mascara did not really lengthen my lashes or give them more volume.  </li>
            <li>This mascara really does thicken and lengthen.  </li>
            <li>Really gives volume to my lashes.</li>
            <li>Paid almost $10 for it and went straight to the trash after two applications.  </li>
            <li>(promoted much maybe?)</li>
            <li>it (with much fear- makeup</li>
            <li>Rather than picking at it, because my eyelashes were so stuck together by this product, I would get an eye makeup remover wipe and gently go over my eyelash line to try to loosen the clump and catch the eyelash if it had fallen out.</li>
            <li>Just saying, I&#x27;m very picky about my mascara</li>
            <li>When taking the product off you have to really work.</li>
            <li>I washed the other mascara off of one of my eyes and applied this to one eye, and it looked BETTER than the $25 mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will use it for a VERY LONG TIME!!!</li>
            <li>Ain&#x27;t messy like the others and very easy to put on.</li>
            <li>I do love other Covergirl mascaras though!  </li>
            <li>Now, instead of having full eyelashes that aren&#x27;t quite as long as I&#x27;d like, I flat out have NO eyelashes in huge patches along the line of my eyelids.</li>
            <li>but i would love to see this in water proof, and maybe a brush that clumps less?</li>
            <li>First you apply the first coat that helps thicken and curl your lashes and then the second coats adds some color and seals the color in.</li>
            <li>I always go big and bold qith my eye makeup</li>
            <li>But what I didn&#x27;t understand was how it managed to raccoon under my eyes by dinner but took super duper makeup remover to actually remove it at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>, I came directly here to give a positive review</li>
            <li>in my opinion this mascara is priced to high for the quality.</li>
            <li>You MUST use a high quality make up remover to get it off or the CoverGirl remover as suggested on package</li>
            <li>My lashes are full and curly and so long they almost touch my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I will use it a few more times before making a decision on it.</li>
            <li>-- I normally have to use &amp;#34;underwear for eyelashes&amp;#34; before putting on my mascara to get volume.  </li>
            <li>I have used the same mascara for years, i recieved this product complimentary from influenster</li>
            <li>Brush has more dense fluffy bristles.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T WANT TO WASTE MORE MONEY</li>
            <li>It leaves my lashes looking long and full.</li>
            <li>I actually got this in a voxbox to try complimentary....</li>
            <li>I noticed some yellow gunk in the corner of my right eye.  </li>
            <li>I can see how it would clump up if you don&#x27;t wait long enough in between coats, or if you glob it on, but if you have a little patience and don&#x27;t cake it on, it does not clump and works great.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and thus fine blonde eyelashes</li>
            <li>The first wand is nice and made my eyelashes look really dramatic</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t Clump, the brushes didn&#x27;t rip out my lashes like some of the new ones I have tried has.</li>
            <li>I felt compelled to write this because as a person who enjoys trying new makeup</li>
            <li>Overall, I would use this for a very special all day event where I really, really don&#x27;t want my mascara to come off, but other than that I think it will sit in my makeup drawer.</li>
            <li>I got this from  Influenster for testing purposes, and glad I did I typically stick to the same brands and don&#x27;t change it up much.</li>
            <li>Finally when I did both eyes filled with yellow goop like pus!  </li>
            <li>I received the COVERGIRL Bombshell Volume by Lashblast Mascara last week from Influenster free for test purposes, but already plan to buy it in the future!</li>
            <li>After applying, my lashes were wet and heavy for a good 20 minutes, and don&#x27;t even get me started about removing it.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about the lengthening aspect because i have short, thick lashes, however, I was less than impressed with some of the other attributes of the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mascara comes right off and my lashes remain silky soft for the next application.</li>
            <li>I applied the first coat which gave volume and separated the lashes, once I got to the second coat</li>
            <li>The tube is pretty big</li>
            <li>Okay I have been wearing all kinds of mascara for the past 35 years or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty hacked, and was very upset for the first few days after it happened.</li>
            <li>I would immediately have tiny spots of mascara above my upper eyelid from blinking, but after I fixed that, it seemed ok.</li>
            <li>I had hard clumped eyelashes for days and every time I tried to get it off, more of my lashes would fall out.</li>
            <li>This looks great on for about two hours, then it clumps and sticks making you look like a crazy person.</li>
            <li>This is by far my least favorite.</li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive eyes and contacts and no problems with this mascara whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>they frequently do have CoverGirl coupons.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your time and buy this.</li>
            <li>Tried getting it off with makeup remover, and it still won&#x27;t come off completely.</li>
            <li>But I plan to use the whole sample and possibly order again....  </li>
            <li>I was at a comedy show last night, laughing until tears and the mascara made it through the whole night!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my &#x27;everyday&#x27; mascara, but definitely a staple for when I want a more glam look.  </li>
            <li>While the tube itself is a little big and awkward to use, the application process is quite smooth and gives a good, thick look without very many coats.</li>
            <li>Except there are No little specks of mascara flaking off into my makeup during the day</li>
            <li>I found that soaking your lashes for a minute or two brings it right off with no loss of lashes like the other reviews.</li>
            <li>For me it went on easy and my lashed were long and dark and there was no clumping at all (for me).</li>
            <li>I already have decently long eyelashes, but this really made it pop.</li>
            <li>When you have very light blonde lashes, you don&#x27;t want that color coming off the ends of your lashes, at least I know I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>to the &amp;#34;super glue, spidery lashes, hard to remove comments:&amp;#34; first of all, ANY mascara is capable of making your lashes spidery if you don&#x27;t put it on correctly, so don&#x27;t blame the product- learn to put mascara on!</li>
            <li>mascara dried quickly, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it smudging</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive eyes, so not easy to find the right product.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is really bulky and it was confusing at first it seemed backwards.</li>
            <li>Thought maybe I was getting pinkeye but no pink or itching.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my lashes looked after using it, it gave volume and made me feel like I have false eyelashes</li>
            <li>I lost SO many eyelashes trying to get this stiff black cement off my lashes.</li>
            <li>But other than the difficulty in getting it off, it really does work well.</li>
            <li>I was able to get this off with vaseline and no smudges or streaks left behind.</li>
            <li>And it does not dry quicly either.</li>
            <li>A possible solution could be to use less of the first mascara so that lashes are not completely dried by the time the second type is added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal was quite simple.</li>
            <li>Use side one for a simple look and side two for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li>But overall, it makes my lashes look a lot more dramatic.</li>
            <li>The tube itself is so big I could barely handle it well enough to apply the mascara.</li>
            <li>Okay, I agree with one thing, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get off, hahaha.  </li>
            <li>I found it typically didn&#x27;t clump as much if you only used that side instead of using both sides.  </li>
            <li>the mascara started clumping a little, but that was probably cause I wasn&#x27;t fast enough when applying the second coat.</li>

            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how the curl would hold but it holds wonderfully!</li>
            <li> and I really liked it!  </li>
            <li> but I use a good eye make up remover</li>
            <li> This mascara is good for day and night.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great or summer honestly</li>
            <li> I applied it and loved the volumizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product</li>

            <li> I purchased the brown-black, which looks really good.  </li>
            <li> marketing was good</li>
            <li> Loved this mascara.</li>
            <li> so, this is a nice product to have in my bag for those special occasions when I want to look my best</li>
            <li> I have had great success many covergirl products and they are usually especially good with mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t know how anyone is giving this a good review.</li>
            <li> and i must say im a huge fan!!</li>
            <li> When I tried to take it off I had to double-check the packaging to make sure I didn&#x27;t grab waterproof!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this mascara!</li>
            <li> I had been wearing &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; by Elizabeth Mott and found that it was taking more and more to get them to look good, and for a $20 mascara, that did not make me happy.  </li>
            <li> This morning, I put this on again and it looks ever better!  </li>
            <li> looking forward to more products like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve earned bombshell in my influenster #surfsupvoxbox and it&#x27;s so amazing</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really happy with receiving it for free via Influenster to test it,</li>
            <li> (Clump crusher by lashblast/ covergirl is amazing)</li>
            <li> The waterproof is amazing.</li>
            <li> It was nice to try out, but I don&#x27;t know if I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> It will be nice to use either side for day or night looks, but I&#x27;ve never been a fan of piling on two mascaras.</li>
            <li> I liked how the brush was curved; it made it easier to get the sides.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it made my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li> but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it on my own.</li>
            <li> I love mascara, it is my one staple for makeup every day, so I need a good one.  </li>
            <li> so when i got this i was ready to try it now as it might not be for everyone it was perfect for me</li>
            <li> I really liked the application of side one but side two made my lashes stick together a bit and were a bit sticky they felt like I had walked through a spider web.</li>
            <li> This mascara is perfect if you are looking for something great to wear on your lashes for a night out or even just a pick me up after a long night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this on my lashes for nights out with my husband or my girlfriends! :)</li>
            <li> Bery nice mascara, I love using it.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best mascara.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s pretty great</li>
            <li> Once you have fought the packaging to get it on, you have to hurry and find a clean mascara brush to separate all of the lashes that have gone from being full and beautiful to spiky tarantula legs protruding from your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> I use makeup remover wipes and then also a magic makeup remover cloth and that does the trick.</li>
            <li> To top it off</li>
            <li> I love love love mascara.</li>
            <li> and you might, too. :)</li>
            <li> Love the style.</li>
            <li> When I finally got around to using it, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed as I hoped.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day it got sticky and every time I blinked it would stick top and bottom lashes together.  </li>
            <li> I love how it looks once applied.</li>
            <li> I found its best to just wash my face with my regular soap and then pat the rest off with a towel.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li> This was okay.  </li>
            <li> One of my top favorites.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> i see many commercials about it on t.v and what not</li>
            <li> It makes it more time consuming.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love that it is waterproof</li>
            <li> If you wipe off most of what comes out of the tube and then apply you have a much better chance of not losing your eyelashes when removing it.</li>
            <li> It does an okay job and does get the job done</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it on your skin because it won&#x27;t just wipe off with a Q-tip like most products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning to apply it more evenly.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Step one is ok.  </li>
            <li> , I know you can do better, I&#x27;ve seen you do much better.</li>
            <li> and I actually thought it did an excellent job,</li>
            <li> you read the info on the package, it does say that the formula works like waterproof mascara and to be sure to use an oil based makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I have used MANY products in my day</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure, it just hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  </li>
            <li> I received this in my Influenster box for testing and was honestly kind of excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> However, I like to be able to more easily remove my makeup at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> and I thought I loved it at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this mascara is pretty good, it gives you the volume and the bombshell</li>
            <li> and I loved the first step of the process.</li>
            <li> My once long beautiful lashes are gone!</li>
            <li> so I was happy to start trying a new one.</li>
            <li> Very cool product; I would recommend this to others looking to highlight their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As far as the mascara part, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> i received this product free from Influenster to test and its ok.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about both products!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, lasts all day, gives length and fullness WITHOUT any clumping at all.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply</li>
            <li> , the mascara goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> some spaces.&lt;br /&gt;Second side can get clumpy very quickly</li>
            <li> I do not have a problem with my lashes sticking together or with it washing off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Removal wasn&#x27;t easy either.</li>
            <li> It came off easily.</li>
            <li> Beauty blogger Kandee Johnson&#x27;s positive review of this mascara on YouTube sold me on giving it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li> CG eye makeup remover, hot showers, warm compresses, baby shampoo,</li>
            <li> I liked the way it went on and didn&#x27;t clump with the first coat.</li>
            <li> Sophia Vergara is beautiful and can really sell products) and it looked like an interesting new concept.</li>
            <li> and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> it wasnt a huge issue with me</li>
            <li> I got this mascara free in my #SurfsUpVoxBox from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I received this product free from Influenster to try</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from Influenster as a test product as part of the Surfs Up VoxBox.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Influenster sent me this for free to test out</li>
            <li> I received a free sample in a #surfsUpVoxBox from @Influenster...</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Influenster.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves free beauty supplies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has potential to be a great mascara....</li>
            <li> I received the Covergirl Bombshell Volume Mascara free from Inlfuenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Layers on full, beautiful volume and length, and the second step seals it in so it doesn&#x27;t flake off or smudge into your eyes, and it lasts until you take it off.</li>
            <li> It really works!!!</li>
            <li> I very, very, rarely give one star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Covergirl mascaras in general, and tend to purchase their mascara products, which all have been really great at making my eyelashes look full and pretty!</li>
            <li> I always use Covergirl mascara, so I was really excited to see this in my box.</li>
            <li> I lost too many eyelashes after the first time wearing this to every try it again.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the trouble though because it is the best stuff ever.</li>
            <li> After finishing the step, my eyelashes had formed spikes, so I had to take a clean mascara applicator to my eyelashes to separate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on clean for me without clumping, and I like the brushes.  </li>
            <li> For a special occasion or if I am doing more dramatic make up this would be more ideal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not doing anything special that they&#x27;re not</li>
            <li> and wow amazing</li>
            <li> Washed until my eyelids were bright red.</li>
            <li> but I was really hoping for more results.</li>
            <li> the good thing about the masara is that it gave me volume and also got my smaller lashes,</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have always been full, but I would like them to be longer.</li>
            <li> finished product, after I separated my eyelashes, was actually not bad.</li>
            <li> Originally, I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li> The wands are super think and clunky.</li>
            <li> I would have loved to have found a more economical substitute for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> But, step one does exactly what it says: it made my lashes appear much thicker, well defined and put a lovely curl on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> I liked it okay to use for an everyday mascara.</li>

            <li> I received this item complimentary from Influenster for testing</li>
            <li> I received this COVERGIRL&#x27;s Bombshell Curvaceous by LashBlast Mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good product that I like, but I most likely wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have to laugh</li>
            <li> Bristles are wider spiral like more old school mascara wands.</li>
            <li> I got this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> and this comes right off.</li>
            <li> It costs a bit more than your average drug store makeup, but is better than any $30 mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li> It came off easily with some warm water and a little help from makeup remover to get the excess.  </li>
            <li> definitely gives the sexy mysterious look  love it!</li>
            <li> I love the look of the mascara after the first step of the application; it makes my eyes look huge and my lashes very long.  </li>
            <li> At first, I noticed that it definitely made my eyelashes look longer, but it smeared very easily-</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes look good, but a little clumpy.  </li>
            <li> While I agree that the tub is big, and it does take a bit longer to put on and get off, I still love this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product really works for me!</li>
            <li> I will not be using this mascara again, and will more than likely throw it away.</li>
            <li> Really brings out my eyes by fluffing my lashes up!</li>
            <li> the only goodish thing about is it the applicator there are two one at the top and one at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, for a drugstore mascara it totally lives up to its name.  </li>
            <li> I love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I think the way the mascara looks is pretty</li>
            <li> ...claims that in no way represent actual results you will be able to receive from using this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, there was not a difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I love my current mascara</li>
            <li> should i use it on my bottom lashes now, thanks covergirl!</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> I love that it gives the option of creating three different looks, and being it&#x27;s attached, I don&#x27;t need a variety of mascaras in my makeup</li>
            <li> fair enough, but if this required special specific remover it should be written in large print so a reasonable person could purchase it at thesame time.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have difficulty finding good mascara for my eyelashes (black, short, not thick) - this product worked okay, but I most likely would not purchase it myself.</li>
            <li> I was interested in this when I read positive articles online</li>
            <li> If you buy the product, a different wand may be a good idea, or perhaps use step one and add a different mascara.</li>
            <li> The wands are too fat and short to make application easy.  </li>
            <li> (maybe ok for people with hand difficulties/ limited dexterity?)  </li>
            <li> The huge packaging is kind of unique though and the color IS dark, but it also seems like less product for your buck.</li>
            <li> The first step (add volume and curl) worked decently.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to every woman or man;)</li>
            <li> It makes my long eyelashes look very full, and the two wands/formulas is a really neat idea.</li>
            <li> This really does plump them up and colors them, and the color stays on very well.  </li>
            <li> I see there are some folks for whom this mascara worked really well</li>
            <li> You really do need to use an oils based remover to get it off.</li>
            <li> but it dosent work very well.</li>
            <li> One thing that I really appreciated about this mascara was that it was NOT waterproof.</li>
            <li> I made taking it off much easier.</li>
            <li> Both do their job very well&lt;br /&gt;spaces lashes out and doesn&#x27;t clump them together.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I got this from Influenster to test it out, I found that is clumps to much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seemed to have much luck with 2-step mascaras.</li>
            <li> This mascara did not really lengthen my lashes or give them more volume.  </li>
            <li> This mascara really does thicken and lengthen.  </li>
            <li> Really gives volume to my lashes.</li>
            <li> Paid almost $10 for it and went straight to the trash after two applications.  </li>
            <li> (promoted much maybe?)</li>
            <li> it (with much fear- makeup</li>
            <li> Rather than picking at it, because my eyelashes were so stuck together by this product, I would get an eye makeup remover wipe and gently go over my eyelash line to try to loosen the clump and catch the eyelash if it had fallen out.</li>
            <li> Just saying, I&#x27;m very picky about my mascara</li>
            <li> When taking the product off you have to really work.</li>
            <li> I washed the other mascara off of one of my eyes and applied this to one eye, and it looked BETTER than the $25 mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and will use it for a VERY LONG TIME!!!</li>
            <li> Ain&#x27;t messy like the others and very easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I do love other Covergirl mascaras though!  </li>
            <li> Now, instead of having full eyelashes that aren&#x27;t quite as long as I&#x27;d like, I flat out have NO eyelashes in huge patches along the line of my eyelids.</li>
            <li> but i would love to see this in water proof, and maybe a brush that clumps less?</li>
            <li> First you apply the first coat that helps thicken and curl your lashes and then the second coats adds some color and seals the color in.</li>
            <li> I always go big and bold qith my eye makeup</li>
            <li> But what I didn&#x27;t understand was how it managed to raccoon under my eyes by dinner but took super duper makeup remover to actually remove it at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> , I came directly here to give a positive review</li>
            <li> in my opinion this mascara is priced to high for the quality.</li>
            <li> You MUST use a high quality make up remover to get it off or the CoverGirl remover as suggested on package</li>
            <li> My lashes are full and curly and so long they almost touch my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I will use it a few more times before making a decision on it.</li>
            <li> -- I normally have to use &amp;#34;underwear for eyelashes&amp;#34; before putting on my mascara to get volume.  </li>
            <li> I have used the same mascara for years, i recieved this product complimentary from influenster</li>
            <li> Brush has more dense fluffy bristles.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WANT TO WASTE MORE MONEY</li>
            <li> It leaves my lashes looking long and full.</li>
            <li> I actually got this in a voxbox to try complimentary....</li>
            <li> I noticed some yellow gunk in the corner of my right eye.  </li>
            <li> I can see how it would clump up if you don&#x27;t wait long enough in between coats, or if you glob it on, but if you have a little patience and don&#x27;t cake it on, it does not clump and works great.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and thus fine blonde eyelashes</li>
            <li> The first wand is nice and made my eyelashes look really dramatic</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t Clump, the brushes didn&#x27;t rip out my lashes like some of the new ones I have tried has.</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to write this because as a person who enjoys trying new makeup</li>
            <li> Overall, I would use this for a very special all day event where I really, really don&#x27;t want my mascara to come off, but other than that I think it will sit in my makeup drawer.</li>
            <li> I got this from  Influenster for testing purposes, and glad I did I typically stick to the same brands and don&#x27;t change it up much.</li>
            <li> Finally when I did both eyes filled with yellow goop like pus!  </li>
            <li> I received the COVERGIRL Bombshell Volume by Lashblast Mascara last week from Influenster free for test purposes, but already plan to buy it in the future!</li>
            <li> After applying, my lashes were wet and heavy for a good 20 minutes, and don&#x27;t even get me started about removing it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about the lengthening aspect because i have short, thick lashes, however, I was less than impressed with some of the other attributes of the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mascara comes right off and my lashes remain silky soft for the next application.</li>
            <li> I applied the first coat which gave volume and separated the lashes, once I got to the second coat</li>
            <li> The tube is pretty big</li>
            <li> Okay I have been wearing all kinds of mascara for the past 35 years or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty hacked, and was very upset for the first few days after it happened.</li>
            <li> I would immediately have tiny spots of mascara above my upper eyelid from blinking, but after I fixed that, it seemed ok.</li>
            <li> I had hard clumped eyelashes for days and every time I tried to get it off, more of my lashes would fall out.</li>
            <li> This looks great on for about two hours, then it clumps and sticks making you look like a crazy person.</li>
            <li> This is by far my least favorite.</li>
            <li> Also, I have sensitive eyes and contacts and no problems with this mascara whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> they frequently do have CoverGirl coupons.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your time and buy this.</li>
            <li> Tried getting it off with makeup remover, and it still won&#x27;t come off completely.</li>
            <li> But I plan to use the whole sample and possibly order again....  </li>
            <li> I was at a comedy show last night, laughing until tears and the mascara made it through the whole night!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my &#x27;everyday&#x27; mascara, but definitely a staple for when I want a more glam look.  </li>
            <li> While the tube itself is a little big and awkward to use, the application process is quite smooth and gives a good, thick look without very many coats.</li>
            <li> Except there are No little specks of mascara flaking off into my makeup during the day</li>
            <li> I found that soaking your lashes for a minute or two brings it right off with no loss of lashes like the other reviews.</li>
            <li> For me it went on easy and my lashed were long and dark and there was no clumping at all (for me).</li>
            <li> I already have decently long eyelashes, but this really made it pop.</li>
            <li> When you have very light blonde lashes, you don&#x27;t want that color coming off the ends of your lashes, at least I know I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> to the &amp;#34;super glue, spidery lashes, hard to remove comments:&amp;#34; first of all, ANY mascara is capable of making your lashes spidery if you don&#x27;t put it on correctly, so don&#x27;t blame the product- learn to put mascara on!</li>
            <li> mascara dried quickly, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it smudging</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive eyes, so not easy to find the right product.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is really bulky and it was confusing at first it seemed backwards.</li>
            <li> Thought maybe I was getting pinkeye but no pink or itching.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my lashes looked after using it, it gave volume and made me feel like I have false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I lost SO many eyelashes trying to get this stiff black cement off my lashes.</li>
            <li> But other than the difficulty in getting it off, it really does work well.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this off with vaseline and no smudges or streaks left behind.</li>
            <li> And it does not dry quicly either.</li>
            <li> A possible solution could be to use less of the first mascara so that lashes are not completely dried by the time the second type is added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal was quite simple.</li>
            <li> Use side one for a simple look and side two for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> But overall, it makes my lashes look a lot more dramatic.</li>
            <li> The tube itself is so big I could barely handle it well enough to apply the mascara.</li>
            <li> Okay, I agree with one thing, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get off, hahaha.  </li>
            <li> I found it typically didn&#x27;t clump as much if you only used that side instead of using both sides.  </li>
            <li> the mascara started clumping a little, but that was probably cause I wasn&#x27;t fast enough when applying the second coat.</li>
            <li> One side is for length, the second for volume, I combine the two for the dramatic Bombshell lashes they advertise when I want to look extra special for date night, yet for work I can just do length or volume depending on how I did the rest of my makeup for work.</li>
            <li> This mascara works well, but I am usually in a hurry so the two step process is a little much for me on a normal day to day basis.  </li>
            <li> As many said, the tube is thick and the brushes are short, so it&#x27;s really hard to put it on your lashes.</li>
            <li> have blonde, skinny lashes that are long, but invisible because of their coloring.  </li>
            <li> and if long lasting is what your looking or</li>
            <li> but it just falls so flat.</li>
            <li> This mascara is extremely difficult to wash off, even with strong makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I tried my usual Almay eye makeup remover (which is gentle but thorough on all other mascaras I have tried!), baby oil, Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream, Cethaphil with warm soap and water.</li>
            <li> The next day, the same thing would happen on the other eye.</li>
            <li> I recently spent $30 on the Younique 3D Fiber Lashes and I did a side by side shot using my current mascara (Covergirl Bombshell)</li>
            <li> feel- in fact, waterproof mascaras are actually stickier and harder to remove.</li>
            <li> Its way easier to remove and makes my eyelashes look naturally long and voluminous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof which is a minus especially during summer.</li>
            <li> The second step (intensify) did not really work.</li>
            <li> One that makes my eyelashes long and noticeable, making my eyes stand out.  </li>
            <li> First time writing a negative review but had to warn the people DO NOT BUY THIS!  </li>
            <li> I apply the number 1, then the number 2, and let them dry for about fifteen minutes, then curl them with an eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to layer and layer to get a really thick and lush last.</li>
            <li> noticed that at the end of the day, it would feel like I had an eyelash loose.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve worn it all week and really like how dark and thick my lashes look.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I am no longer using this mascara, and am doing what I can to make my eyes look halfway normal with eyeliner and my old brand of mascara.</li>
            <li> I am not a high end makeup person,  with a few exceptions,  (can&#x27;t afford it and think it&#x27;s a waste of money when trying new products)  </li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s definitely REALLY hard to get all off and does leave my lashes a little clumped with mascara if I put too much on.</li>
            <li> The second step got a little trickier.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really had a hard time with is How hard it is to remove.</li>
            <li> Really big with short brushes so hard to apply at times.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t my favorite mascara every, but it wasn&#x27;t as bad as everyone was saying.</li>
            <li> I usually buy drugstore/ box store brand items because generally the quality is comparable.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few mascaras I&#x27;ve purchased multiple times.  </li>
            <li> I wet the dab and massage over my eyes.</li>
            <li> Got that removed while mascara still wet the reapplied.  </li>
            <li> and it took like 5 tries to get it off.</li>
            <li> I have tried every mascara out there - and there are TWO high-end, expensive mascaras in my beauty bag right now, and none have ever done all the things a mascara should do, until this one!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> made my lashes long and black.</li>
            <li> I am going to throw out my other mascaras.</li>
            <li> it is pretty difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> , I for one don&#x27;t mind the extra few minutes to remove the makeup, I wore this while swimming, and not once did it run!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clean brush on one side, thickening brush on the other.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes voluminous and all, but I use other mascaras that do it all in one step (and they&#x27;re cheaper).</li>
            <li> I have had other mascaras that laid it on thicker.</li>
            <li> Step two is the other end of the tube another coat..</li>
            <li> Makes me think I should keep trying other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> So, other reviewers have countered with the thoughts that the person applying either didn&#x27;t know how to apply it</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have an oil based makeup remover, I suggest using a makeup remover wipe, wash your face as usual and if any left, use some eye makeup remover on a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> It is very clumpy and difficult to use, the second step is pointless.</li>
            <li> At night, it is a little harder to get off</li>
            <li> However, the tube is so large that it was very difficult to get my inner and outer lashes.</li>
            <li> I hardly have any lashes left on the insides of my eyes.</li>
            <li> The delivery: the wands are so short and stumpy that it makes it hard to apply if you have any cheekbones at all.</li>
            <li> Even though it is a bit hard to remove and sometimes smudges overall</li>
            <li> The only negative (and it&#x27;s not mega) is that it&#x27;s hard to get it back off at night</li>
            <li> …really i was not satisfied…the cost was not worth it, please take my word for it…</li>
            <li> : The container itself is really bulky and can be weird to hold</li>
            <li> First it goes on very thin and uneven as it clumps and spikes your lashes together giving the impression that you only have one thick triangle-like lash protruding from your eye.</li>
            <li> Wears a little heavy, but that&#x27;s what I expected from it.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised when I saw all the reviews from people who had the same experience as I did with this product-and very disappointed in Cover Girl as they usually have fairly decent products!</li>
            <li> You may need a lash brush to do a little separation as it may clump a lash or two.</li>
            <li> however with a little patience, and some cottonballs soaked in makeup remover</li>
            <li> But then I&#x27;d look at the wipe, and see a little cluster of six lashes had fallen out.</li>
            <li> Some of the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; patches are the width of my little finger.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s where everything goes down hill!  </li>
            <li> You just have to be careful in getting it off, otherwise you might lose eyelashes if you rub too hard.</li>
            <li> I received this no charge from Influenster, I don&#x27;t love it because it smudged all over the place and my lashes really awkwardly clumped together making it difficult to fix.</li>
            <li> I dried my face and went hunting for the mascara packaging to see if I had bought &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; mascara by mistake.</li>
            <li> You will need to use waterproof eye make up remover to get this off, that is why I wouldn&#x27;t say this is something you&#x27;d want to wear everyday, since it doesn&#x27;t come off with just soap and water.</li>
            <li> However, I had trouble applying it without my eyelashes sticking together.</li>
            <li> for me it is not an everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ended up loosing a few lashes each time I used it just trying to take it off.  </li>
            <li> I recall their makeup remover being too harsh for my eyes.</li>
            <li> It clumped my eyelashes together and made them feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> I did have to swipe it a few times to get it off</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t lose lashes and it came of in a few strokes of cleaner.  </li>
            <li> As others have said it goes on clumpy and stiff.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, it seemed my eyelashes were sticking together pretty badly.</li>
            <li> A total and complete disappointment!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why all of the other reviewers are complaining about it clumping or being hard to wash off...</li>
            <li> I have had issues in the past with other brands taking off eye lashes because it was hard to come off but not in this case.</li>
            <li> Really, my only complaint is that the applicator itself is clunky and awkward to use because of how big the tube itself is.</li>
            <li> The tube takes a little getting used to if you have never used a double sided mascara before, but nothing complicated.  </li>
            <li> I had to stop wiping my eyes because my skin it getting raw.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I had to weigh in on this product to save a potential buyer the headache of purchasing what might be the worlds worst mascara.  </li>
            <li> and I find it hard to get into the corners or do the lower lashes without making a bit of a mess.  </li>
            <li> It lasted 100% after a long night on the town and a little drunk crying!</li>
            <li> Wish I could tell you what makes the difference, but I&#x27;m not sure I can.</li>
            <li> By the time I add the second step its almost useless.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday now!</li>
            <li> Let me echo the statements of so many others and say this is the worst mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> And, yes, while it is terrible to remove, it sure did get all over my undereye area.  </li>
            <li> this mascara was hard to apply, and hard to take off….u</li>
            <li> hard to take off&lt;br</li>
            <li> handle is hard to maneuver in</li>
            <li> the mascara is hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> My eye makeup remover hardly works on it.</li>
            <li> it was hard to handle the brush since the tube is thick.</li>
            <li> and I chuckled at all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> (minus the absolute horrible packaging.)  </li>
            <li> I used the product off and on for about two weeks, and I&#x27;d say that I lost 40% of my eyelashes, at least.</li>
            <li> , i dont know if this is a complaint or not</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of negative reviews on the product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s coming off veerrry slowly.</li>
            <li> The mascara was thick and clumped.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll need a make-up remover product to really get this crap off.</li>
            <li> You have to take you time and slowly scrub it.</li>
            <li> It is horrible to clean even with make up remover.</li>
            <li> It was a lot less expensive there, and I could use a coupon.  </li>
            <li> The mascara was very &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; making my lashes clump together and even with a lash brush was difficult and somewhat painful to separate the lashes.</li>
            <li> It does give me very dramatic lashes, but they&#x27;re very stiff and look slightly unnatural.</li>
            <li> so not good</li>
            <li> It is NOT a good product.</li>
            <li> I was honestly shocked how low of a score it got.</li>
            <li> It is chunky and awkward to apply just as other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> /&gt;VERY VERY hard to wash</li>
            <li> One side of the brush is very hard and it clumps when applying.</li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> I have read other review saying it was impossible to get off and they lost lashes.</li>
            <li> It is the absolute worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured out the secret to using it yet?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thoroughly annoyed.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the easiest to wash off, which is frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Step two just made things worse.  </li>
            <li> : 1) the product is two sided: Side one tolerable thinish mascara could maybe be usable but not great.</li>
            <li> False advertising.</li>
            <li> either cut off lashes with scissors( then throw scissors away) or just pluck them out.&lt;br /&gt;Consider purchasing false eyelashes with this item.</li>
            <li> My lashes (especially my thin bottom lashes) look long and thick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I have to go with several of the other reviewers and say this is one of the worst mascaras I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My lashes end up clumping together and just does not look dramatic the way I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The terrible design of the tubes makes application difficult, the product itself caused my lashes to stick together in straight spikes, and then, even though the product is not labeled as waterproof...</li>
            <li> I once had thick long eyelashes- not anymore because of this terrible product.</li>
            <li> I might go so far as to say this is the worst product I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I honestly do not understand the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to remove though.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara at the store randomly.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s NOT awesome?</li>
            <li> u will be sorry thanks…..</li>
            <li> Also, it is extremely difficult to remove, even with makeup remover and/or soap.</li>
            <li> Sorry Covergirl you blew it this one.</li>
            <li> This was was a fail.</li>
            <li> (I actually fished the packaging out of the trash can thinking maybe I&#x27;d bought some horrible version of waterproof mascara by mistake,</li>
            <li> It is expensive, so I guess if you don&#x27;t want to take the risk, don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go crazy trying to remove it</li>
            <li> The design of the tube is awkward to hold, and the paint was peeling off the labeling before I even opened the packaging -</li>
            <li> CRAZY</li>
            <li> and, unfortunately, that stickiness does not go away over the day!</li>
            <li> It was so expensive too!</li>
            <li> My eyes were burning from rubbing so hard to get this crap off!</li>
            <li> it does give you the volumle you want but its very difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> Side two: horrible, sticky, thick clumpy formula.</li>
            <li> It is also very difficult to remove, even with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer noted, the mascara is not listed as waterproof, but it is nearly impossible to remove.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> It is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to remove.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look so bad.</li>
            <li> one isn&#x27;t so bad.  </li>
            <li> This is asphalt&#x27;s ugly cousin</li>
            <li> :( DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE COVER GIRL EYE MAKEUP REMOVER WILL WORK TO GET THIS OFF?</li>
            <li> As a contact wearer I hate having to use a bunch of stuff on my eyes cuz it always bothers my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> Step one is your base coat.</li>
            <li> It was also impossible to get it off!</li>
            <li> Really bad product, horrible delivery.</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed with Bombshell.</li>
            <li> Horrible horrible horrible  </li>
            <li> But the worst parts were as the day progressed</li>
            <li> Horrible</li>
            <li> This is the WORST mascara ever!</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve been trying to get this terrible mascara off my lashes for 2 days!  </li>
            <li> I have lost a dozen lashes just trying to get this crap off!  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t one of my favorites but not one of the worst that I&#x27;ve tried either.  </li>
            <li> Worst mascara ever!</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> Its horrible this product.</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s where it all goes horribly</li>
            <li> two is horrible.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> Removal is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this mascara it&#x27;s the only one I use and it&#x27;s cheaper on here!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, lasts all day, gives length and fullness WITHOUT any clumping at all. So easy to apply and you don&#x27;t have to layer and layer to get a really thick and lush last. It is difficult to remove though. I use makeup remover wipes and then also a magic makeup remover cloth and that does the trick. Totally worth the trouble though because it is the best stuff ever. Will not smear at all and does not flake. I consider it the perfect mascara. Also, I have sensitive eyes and contacts and no problems with this mascara whatsoever.  It costs a bit more than your average drug store makeup, but is better than any $30 mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few mascaras I&#x27;ve purchased multiple times.  I recently spent $30 on the Younique 3D Fiber Lashes and I did a side by side shot using my current mascara (Covergirl Bombshell) and the 3D lashes didn&#x27;t come close to making my eyes pop like the Bombshell Volume did.  It goes on and will last all day.  At night, it is a little harder to get off but I use a good eye make up remover and it works fine.  I don&#x27;t go crazy trying to remove it, if some of it stays on all night it&#x27;s just on my lashes.  I love this stuff and will use it for a VERY LONG TIME!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible horrible horrible  I would never purchase again</li>
            <li> First time writing a negative review but had to warn the people DO NOT BUY THIS!  As others have said it goes on clumpy and stiff.  But the worst parts were as the day progressed I noticed some yellow gunk in the corner of my right eye.  Thought maybe I was getting pinkeye but no pink or itching.  I felt this urge all day to scrub my eyes.  Finally when I did both eyes filled with yellow goop like pus!  I was in shock.  To top it off I couldn&#x27;t remove it!  Took me 20 minutes and still there was some left.  It was not waterproof either.  I checked.  My eyes feel much better today and all I can say is they need to take this off the shelves!!!  Horrible</li>
            <li> While I agree that the tub is big, and it does take a bit longer to put on and get off, I still love this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde, skinny lashes that are long, but invisible because of their coloring.  This really does plump them up and colors them, and the color stays on very well.  It doesn&#x27;t say it is waterproof, but it acts that way on me.  I am a BIG waterproof mascara fan though.  When you have very light blonde lashes, you don&#x27;t want that color coming off the ends of your lashes, at least I know I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing this for about 3 weeks now and it&#x27;s not harmed my lashes.  I wear it daily and I appreciate that I can wear it all day through naps and working out, even in the sauna and with a short swim and shower, and still have it on when I get home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got staying power.  It works.&lt;br /&gt;It just takes a bit of extra work putting on and getting off.  I got this product at a drugstore on sale.  It was a lot less expensive there, and I could use a coupon.  Check Amazon though - they frequently do have CoverGirl coupons.  You can search for Amazon Coupons to find the page with the coupons on it in a search engine.  That&#x27;s what I do.</li>
            <li> I love love love mascara. I always purchase the newest eyelash products from Covergirl. I was VERY disappointed with Bombshell. The tube itself is so big I could barely handle it well enough to apply the mascara. Then, the actual product made my eyelashes stick together when I blinked. When I tried to take it off I had to double-check the packaging to make sure I didn&#x27;t grab waterproof! It is the absolute worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I hardly have any lashes left on the insides of my eyes. DO NOT waste your time and buy this.</li>
            <li> This is the WORST mascara ever! I will never buy another Cover girl product after this. I lost SO many eyelashes trying to get this stiff black cement off my lashes. It Will NOT come off. First it goes on very thin and uneven as it clumps and spikes your lashes together giving the impression that you only have one thick triangle-like lash protruding from your eye. Then it hardens - you can separate your lashes out. It seems to form a permanent bond to your lashes. For days I could get this junk off my eyes. I had hard clumped eyelashes for days and every time I tried to get it off, more of my lashes would fall out. I once had thick long eyelashes- not anymore because of this terrible product. No stars.</li>
            <li> I have tried practically every mascara on the market, from the cheapest to most expensive. This product really works for me! My lashes (especially my thin bottom lashes) look long and thick! As for removing... I use a tiny dab of my Philosophy 3-in-1 (shampoo, shower-gel, bubble bath). I wet the dab and massage over my eyes. Voila! The mascara comes right off and my lashes remain silky soft for the next application. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about both products!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I honestly do not understand the bad reviews. Layers on full, beautiful volume and length, and the second step seals it in so it doesn&#x27;t flake off or smudge into your eyes, and it lasts until you take it off. Though I bought the CoverGirl eye makeup remover as the package instructs, I wash my face with cleanser and this comes right off. I have tried every mascara out there - and there are TWO high-end, expensive mascaras in my beauty bag right now, and none have ever done all the things a mascara should do, until this one!&lt;br /&gt;As to the &amp;#34;super glue, spidery lashes, hard to remove comments:&amp;#34; first of all, ANY mascara is capable of making your lashes spidery if you don&#x27;t put it on correctly, so don&#x27;t blame the product- learn to put mascara on! Also, I experienced no &amp;#34;super glue&amp;#34; feel- in fact, waterproof mascaras are actually stickier and harder to remove. This one functions like a water proof without actually being one! Except there are No little specks of mascara flaking off into my makeup during the day (you know what I&#x27;m talking about girls!), and I can wear it through a workout, run, or even sleep without it budging. My lashes are full and curly and so long they almost touch my eyebrows. Beautiful!!!! And I reapeat: it WILL come off!&lt;br /&gt;Love this!!! I am going to throw out my other mascaras. Give it a try and you might, too. :)</li>
            <li> Love the style. Ain&#x27;t messy like the others and very easy to put on. No clumbs I&#x27;m telling every one.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara free in my #SurfsUpVoxBox from Influenster. I always use Covergirl mascara, so I was really excited to see this in my box. When I finally got around to using it, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed as I hoped. It does give me very dramatic lashes, but they&#x27;re very stiff and look slightly unnatural. I do like that it has staying power for when I go out. Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured out the secret to using it yet? It was nice to try out, but I don&#x27;t know if I will be purchasing it again. I will use it a few more times before making a decision on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara at the store randomly. I tried it out and I loved how it made my lashed look! Throughout the day I loved how it didn&#x27;t flake and the lashes stayed looking great! At the end of the day I washed my face. I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that my mascara didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soften&amp;#34; and wash off. I dried my face and went hunting for the mascara packaging to see if I had bought &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; mascara by mistake. I couldn&#x27;t find ANYWHERE on the package where it said it was waterproof. It DOES say to use makeup remover to remove the product. So I did, except it didn&#x27;t come off. I tried baby oil and it&#x27;s coming off veerrry slowly. I had to stop wiping my eyes because my skin it getting raw. My take on it: it is awesome mascara if you are used to waterproof. What&#x27;s NOT awesome? Being someone who never buys waterproof mascara and feeling like I just got tricked Into wasting my money. I&#x27;m thoroughly annoyed. False advertising.</li>
            <li> Put this on and tried to curl lashes... What a disaster!  It clumped up in a line on my lashes.  Got that removed while mascara still wet the reapplied.  By the end of the day it got sticky and every time I blinked it would stick top and bottom lashes together.  Now, I&#x27;ve been trying to get this terrible mascara off my lashes for 2 days!  CG eye makeup remover, hot showers, warm compresses, baby shampoo, everything I can think of and there is still residue on my lashes.  I have lost a dozen lashes just trying to get this crap off!  DO NOT TRY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I have to go with several of the other reviewers and say this is one of the worst mascaras I have ever used. As many said, the tube is thick and the brushes are short, so it&#x27;s really hard to put it on your lashes. When you do get it on- don&#x27;t blink! Your eyelashes will stick together! and, unfortunately, that stickiness does not go away over the day! I was surprised when I saw all the reviews from people who had the same experience as I did with this product-and very disappointed in Cover Girl as they usually have fairly decent products! I see there are some folks for whom this mascara worked really well and maybe you will be one of them Wish I could tell you what makes the difference, but I&#x27;m not sure I can.</li>
            <li> this mascara was hard to apply, and hard to take off….u truly need makeup remover…also it makes the lashes clumpy and the lashes stick together and it feels sticky and packy..so not good don&#x27;t waist u r money …really i was not satisfied…the cost was not worth it, please take my word for it….or u will be sorry thanks…..thats my review  believe it or not...</li>
            <li> I received this no charge from Influenster, I don&#x27;t love it because it smudged all over the place and my lashes really awkwardly clumped together making it difficult to fix. -Brittany</li>
            <li> There was not a noticeable difference in my lashes after I applied the mascara. I only gave this product 2 stars because it did not clump when I applied it. However, the tube is so large that it was very difficult to get my inner and outer lashes. It was also impossible to get it off! I use makeup wipes that take off all of my makeup, waterproof or not, and I could NOT get this mascara off! I will not be using this mascara again, and will more than likely throw it away.</li>
            <li> I received this product free from Influenster to try and I thought I loved it at first. For me it went on easy and my lashed were long and dark and there was no clumping at all (for me). Then I tried to get it off. I was informed that I would need an oil based eye make-up remover for this mascara, but even using one it took forever to get this stuff off. As a contact wearer I hate having to use a bunch of stuff on my eyes cuz it always bothers my contact lenses. Overall, I would use this for a very special all day event where I really, really don&#x27;t want my mascara to come off, but other than that I think it will sit in my makeup drawer.</li>
            <li> This mascara has staying power. It would be a great mascara for the evening, for clubbing, maybe even a marathon; something where you don&#x27;t want to worry about getting raccoon eyes. You may need a lash brush to do a little separation as it may clump a lash or two. I was able to get this off with vaseline and no smudges or streaks left behind. I don&#x27;t wear make up daily so, this is a nice product to have in my bag for those special occasions when I want to look my best and I need my eyes to last! {i received a complimentary product for testing purposes}</li>
            <li> I received this, courtesy of Influenster in the #SurfsUpVoxBox and I love it! I love how it looks once applied.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free from Influenster for testing purposes. As far as the mascara part, it&#x27;s great. It makes my long eyelashes look very full, and the two wands/formulas is a really neat idea. You just have to be careful in getting it off, otherwise you might lose eyelashes if you rub too hard. But other than the difficulty in getting it off, it really does work well.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from Influenster as a test product as part of the Surfs Up VoxBox.  I love the look of the mascara after the first step of the application; it makes my eyes look huge and my lashes very long.  By the time I add the second step its almost useless.  It is a pain in the butt to get off though, even with waterproof eye makeup remover.  I found its best to just wash my face with my regular soap and then pat the rest off with a towel.</li>
            <li> I received the Bombshell LashBlast mascara for testing purposes via Influenster in my Surfs Up VoxBox and I&#x27;m not in love with it. It will be nice to use either side for day or night looks, but I&#x27;ve never been a fan of piling on two mascaras. It just feels drying; the entire process. If I want both effects, I&#x27;d just reach for the traditional LashBlast for quicker application. I saw no difference. The huge packaging is kind of unique though and the color IS dark, but it also seems like less product for your buck. Win/Lose for me. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This was okay.  It isn&#x27;t one of my favorites but not one of the worst that I&#x27;ve tried either.  It wasn&#x27;t the easiest to wash off, which is frustrating.  I like the look on my eyes but prefer mascara that can be washed off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> This is a really great mascara.  I have blonde hair and thus fine blonde eyelashes -- I normally have to use &amp;#34;underwear for eyelashes&amp;#34; before putting on my mascara to get volume.  With this mascara, I did not need to do this.  I would definitely give this a try!!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. Really brings out my eyes by fluffing my lashes up! Very cool product; I would recommend this to others looking to highlight their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Bery nice mascara, I love using it. One of my top favorites. I highly recommend this to every woman or man;)</li>
            <li> Worst mascara ever! Ruined my eyelashes and my eyelids/undereye. I recommend Loreal butterfly effect. Its way easier to remove and makes my eyelashes look naturally long and voluminous.</li>
            <li> I received this product for testing purposes from Influenster. It is NOT a good product. The design of the tube is awkward to hold, and the paint was peeling off the labeling before I even opened the packaging - can&#x27;t imagine that will last the life of the mascara. Additionally, when I went to apply the second step, it got ALL over my eyelid and wouldn&#x27;t wipe off. Just splashed up there like I had painted on my eyelid. Thank goodness I hadn&#x27;t used eyeshadow, because I would&#x27;ve had to start over. The mascara would just NOT come off of my eyelid and I had to take eye makeup remover to it with a q-tip. After finishing the step, my eyelashes had formed spikes, so I had to take a clean mascara applicator to my eyelashes to separate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finished product, after I separated my eyelashes, was actually not bad. It hasn&#x27;t feathered after all day wear, which is a plus. However, I am NOT looking forward to taking it off, after the difficulty I had simply removing it from my eyelid. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got this from  Influenster for testing purposes, and glad I did I typically stick to the same brands and don&#x27;t change it up much. When I got this and I love it, the mascara goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> Influenster sent me this for free to test out and I love it! It lasted 100% after a long night on the town and a little drunk crying! It lasted after a shower as well. You really do need to use an oils based remover to get it off. This would be perfect for going to a beach or water park or even a pool party. It will NOT come off without remover. Awesome product! Do NOT pick at your eyelashes to scrape it off because your lashes will come out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this mascara! I received a free sample in a #surfsUpVoxBox from @Influenster...it&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used...it doesn&#x27;t clump up, it gives me lift, and volume, and basically water proof....definitely will be buying in the future!</li>
            <li> This mascara is perfect if you are looking for something great to wear on your lashes for a night out or even just a pick me up after a long night. First you apply the first coat that helps thicken and curl your lashes and then the second coats adds some color and seals the color in. You will need to use waterproof eye make up remover to get this off, that is why I wouldn&#x27;t say this is something you&#x27;d want to wear everyday, since it doesn&#x27;t come off with just soap and water. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this on my lashes for nights out with my husband or my girlfriends! :)</li>
            <li> this is the best mascara ive ever used it pow and wow amazing</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. While the tube itself is a little big and awkward to use, the application process is quite smooth and gives a good, thick look without very many coats. I&#x27;m not sure why all of the other reviewers are complaining about it clumping or being hard to wash off... it acts like waterproof mascara, use an oil-based eye makeup remover. I actually did not use anything and mine just came off after a shower or two. I can see how it would clump up if you don&#x27;t wait long enough in between coats, or if you glob it on, but if you have a little patience and don&#x27;t cake it on, it does not clump and works great. Really, my only complaint is that the applicator itself is clunky and awkward to use because of how big the tube itself is.</li>
            <li> I have used the same mascara for years, i recieved this product complimentary from influenster and i must say im a huge fan!! I always go big and bold qith my eye makeup and this mascara was the icing on the cake! Bombshell indeed! Way to go covergirl,way to go.</li>
            <li> Pros: The first wand is nice and made my eyelashes look really dramatic&lt;br /&gt;The mascara dried quickly, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it smudging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The container itself is really bulky and can be weird to hold&lt;br /&gt;Very hard to take off&lt;br /&gt;The second wand tends to make my eyelashes clump together and can prove troublesome to fix&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> this mascara didn&#x27;t work at all and i don&#x27;t like ho annoyingly big it is. in my opinion this mascara is priced to high for the quality. i see many commercials about it on t.v and what not but it dosent work very well. the only goodish thing about is it the applicator there are two one at the top and one at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from #Ifluenster for testing purposes. This mascara is good for day and night. Use side one for a simple look and side two for a more dramatic look. It does make your lashes longer and curl. I don&#x27;t like the two sides though. It makes it more time consuming. My lashes look like there sticking together. It&#x27;s not waterproof which is a minus especially during summer.</li>
            <li> this mascara gives great volume and length! and if long lasting is what your looking or this is the product or you! that&#x27;s the reason why I didn&#x27;t give this product the 5th star... it is pretty difficult to remove. however with a little patience, and some cottonballs soaked in makeup remover I found that soaking your lashes for a minute or two brings it right off with no loss of lashes like the other reviews. I think this product is great or summer honestly, I for one don&#x27;t mind the extra few minutes to remove the makeup, I wore this while swimming, and not once did it run! I was very impressed! time is beauty ladies, if you have the patience to take it off I would definitely consider buying this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve earned bombshell in my influenster #surfsupvoxbox and it&#x27;s so amazing I use it everyday now! :) I cannot get enough</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, for a drugstore mascara it totally lives up to its name.  I do have to say it does not state that it is waterproof, but it seems it. I love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received this item complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the best nor the worst. I tend to have difficulty finding good mascara for my eyelashes (black, short, not thick) - this product worked okay, but I most likely would not purchase it myself. The first step (add volume and curl) worked decently. I liked how the brush was curved; it made it easier to get the sides. The second step (intensify) did not really work. It made my lashes clumpier instead. A possible solution could be to use less of the first mascara so that lashes are not completely dried by the time the second type is added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal was quite simple. One thing that I really appreciated about this mascara was that it was NOT waterproof. I made taking it off much easier. I did not have a problem with the mascara smearing/running either (tested in 90 degree weather!).</li>
            <li> I really liked it! Wasn&#x27;t sure how the curl would hold but it holds wonderfully! Awesome pick for a drug store mascara!</li>
            <li> The design of the bottle is bnto great. Really big with short brushes so hard to apply at times. Did make my lashes look thicker and longer but a pain in the rear to take off. I wouldnt buy product again but might recommend it for a friend who has problems with needing thicker lashes</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the way the mascara made my eyelashes look. However, I had trouble applying it without my eyelashes sticking together. Also, it is extremely difficult to remove, even with makeup remover and/or soap.</li>
            <li> I received this COVERGIRL&#x27;s Bombshell Curvaceous by LashBlast Mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I liked the way it made my eyelashes look. It didn&#x27;t Clump, the brushes didn&#x27;t rip out my lashes like some of the new ones I have tried has. The only thing I really had a hard time with is How hard it is to remove. I love that it is waterproof but I had to scrub it off to the point both my eyes were red and Irrated. for me it is not an everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> I received this for testing purposes in the SurfsUpVoxBox from Influenster. I applied it and loved the volumizer. It is chunky and awkward to apply just as other reviewers said. If you wipe off most of what comes out of the tube and then apply you have a much better chance of not losing your eyelashes when removing it. You MUST use a high quality make up remover to get it off or the CoverGirl remover as suggested on package</li>
            <li> I was really excited about the lengthening aspect because i have short, thick lashes, however, I was less than impressed with some of the other attributes of the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Clean brush on one side, thickening brush on the other. Both do their job very well&lt;br /&gt;spaces lashes out and doesn&#x27;t clump them together.&lt;br /&gt;You can get up to close to the eye with the short handle&lt;br /&gt;Great mascara for beach or pool because it doesn&#x27;t come off easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;chunky handle is hard to maneuver in some spaces.&lt;br /&gt;Second side can get clumpy very quickly&lt;br /&gt;VERY VERY hard to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for testing purposes from Influenster</li>
            <li> I got this from Influenster to test it out, I found that is clumps to much. So I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase it myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and I&#x27;m really happy with receiving it for free via Influenster to test it, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it on my own. It makes my eyelashes voluminous and all, but I use other mascaras that do it all in one step (and they&#x27;re cheaper). Overall, it&#x27;s a good product that I like, but I most likely wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself. However, I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Covergirl mascaras in general, and tend to purchase their mascara products, which all have been really great at making my eyelashes look full and pretty!</li>
            <li> This mascara gives nice volume and great length but the product felt sticky got it in corner of eyes. The wand and applicator are a bit unwieldy</li>
            <li> Ehh. I&#x27;ve never seemed to have much luck with 2-step mascaras. Too clumpy and just not nice enough results for the primer to be worth it.</li>
            <li> I have blonde lashes....without mascara, they are transparent.  I also have sensitive eyes, so not easy to find the right product.  The Bombshell Volume with its two parts, allows me to wear just one daily....and put both on when I dress up.  The only negative (and it&#x27;s not mega) is that it&#x27;s hard to get it back off at night when I cleanse my face...I had Lasik surgery and the doctor said all makeup must come off at the end of the day.  Otherwise, excellent product.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I think the way the mascara looks is pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;First I applied the first coat which gave volume and separated the lashes, once I got to the second coat the mascara started clumping a little, but that was probably cause I wasn&#x27;t fast enough when applying the second coat. I love the way my lashes looked after using it, it gave volume and made me feel like I have false eyelashes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this mascara is pretty good, it gives you the volume and the bombshell look you&#x27;re wanting to achieve.</li>
            <li> This mascara did not really lengthen my lashes or give them more volume.  I did like the #1 side of lengthening mascara because of the brush.  I found it typically didn&#x27;t clump as much if you only used that side instead of using both sides.  It does an okay job and does get the job done but I was really hoping for more results.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the barrel.  It is too bulky.  Also, wish that the wand was longer.  But once you get passed the ackward phase of trying to handle it and apply it to your eyelashes.  It doesn&#x27;t look so bad.</li>
            <li> The look is great! The feel is so sticky. My lashes stick together all morning when I wear this.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I had to weigh in on this product to save a potential buyer the headache of purchasing what might be the worlds worst mascara.  The terrible design of the tubes makes application difficult, the product itself caused my lashes to stick together in straight spikes, and then, even though the product is not labeled as waterproof...it will not wash off with soap, or even wipe off with makeup remover!  I lost several eyelashes just trying to get the gunk off my lashes!  A total and complete disappointment!  I know it is tempting to try this product out based on the claims made on the package, but they are just that...claims that in no way represent actual results you will be able to receive from using this product.</li>
            <li> Adds great volume and thickness.  The tube takes a little getting used to if you have never used a double sided mascara before, but nothing complicated.  I do not have a problem with my lashes sticking together or with it washing off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this mascara. I received a free sample from Influenster. It is by far the best mascara. No clumping!! And makes my lashes look great!!!</li>
            <li> i received this product free from Influenster to test and its ok. it does give you the volumle you want but its very difficult to take off. the good thing about the masara is that it gave me volume and also got my smaller lashes,</li>
            <li> This mascara really does thicken and lengthen.  The only downside is the brush. It is very thick and I find it hard to get into the corners or do the lower lashes without making a bit of a mess.  But overall, it makes my lashes look a lot more dramatic.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this mascara! It is horrible to clean even with make up remover. Leaves your eyes all stained and your eyelashes all clump together. It does not create that voluminous eyelash as they advertise.</li>
            <li> So I got this product in my Surf&#x27;s Up Influenster Vox Box. Originally, I was pretty excited. Everyone loves free beauty supplies. I got it out and I loved the first step of the process. I already have decently long eyelashes, but this really made it pop. The second step got a little trickier. The mascara was thick and clumped. It almost seemed as though it needed to be thinned out a bit with saline or something. If you buy the product, a different wand may be a good idea, or perhaps use step one and add a different mascara.</li>
            <li> Awful! Can&#x27;t wash it off, and no it&#x27;s not waterproof. Tried getting it off with makeup remover, and it still won&#x27;t come off completely. My eyes were burning from rubbing so hard to get this crap off! Save your money.</li>
            <li> Garbage! Brittle clumpy eyelashes</li>
            <li> Let me echo the statements of so many others and say this is the worst mascara I have ever used. I might go so far as to say this is the worst product I have ever bought. Almost impossible to remove. Washed until my eyelids were bright red. And yes I tried eye makeup remover and that didn&#x27;t work, either.</li>
            <li> I love mascara, it is my one staple for makeup every day, so I need a good one.  One that makes my eyelashes long and noticeable, making my eyes stand out.  That&#x27;s what mascara is supposed to do.  I had been wearing &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; by Elizabeth Mott and found that it was taking more and more to get them to look good, and for a $20 mascara, that did not make me happy.  I then tried &amp;#34;Extend Your Lashes Naturally-Prolash+Mascara&amp;#34; and that was $25.  It made my eyelashes look good, but a little clumpy.  I saw this at Walmart last night, and decided to give it a try.  I washed the other mascara off of one of my eyes and applied this to one eye, and it looked BETTER than the $25 mascara.  I purchased the brown-black, which looks really good.  It came off easily with some warm water and a little help from makeup remover to get the excess.  This morning, I put this on again and it looks ever better!  I apply the number 1, then the number 2, and let them dry for about fifteen minutes, then curl them with an eyelash curler.  They look awesome!</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t know how anyone is giving this a good review. It took 3 showers and 6 times using makeup remover to get this tar off my lashes. Lost some lashes too in the process. Got on my skin as I was applying and it took like 5 tries to get it off. CRAZY</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Product design is too bulky and wand ends are too short to apply mascara with ease. Step one is your base coat. I have had other mascaras that laid it on thicker. Step two is the other end of the tube another coat..here&#x27;s where everything goes down hill!  It is a sticky stain like material. Don&#x27;t get it on your skin because it won&#x27;t just wipe off with a Q-tip like most products.And it does not dry quicly either. Also after wearing it awhile your lashes goop together. Not the volume glamour shot you see in the advertisements-but what ever is. This stuff doesn&#x27;t wash off well either even though it&#x27;s not supposed to be waterproof..you&#x27;ll need a make-up remover product to really get this crap off. Sorry Covergirl you blew it this one.</li>
            <li> This mascara is extremely difficult to wash off, even with strong makeup remover. In fact, when I did finally remove it, several of my eyelashes came off along with it. My lashes end up clumping together and just does not look dramatic the way I had hoped. If you want a mascara that DOES NOT come off, then this mascara is the one for you. However, I like to be able to more easily remove my makeup at the end of the day. I would not recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara was very &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; making my lashes clump together and even with a lash brush was difficult and somewhat painful to separate the lashes. Removal wasn&#x27;t easy either. Its horrible this product.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara as a sample to try. I still haven&#x27;t found a mascara I like.  I tried this and I really liked it!  Okay, I agree with one thing, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get off, hahaha.  But I use a two step process with a make up cleansing towel and a oil cleanser, which seems to work the trick (oil cleanser is great).  Anyway, I&#x27;ve worn it all week and really like how dark and thick my lashes look.  I&#x27;m still learning to apply it more evenly.  But I plan to use the whole sample and possibly order again....  I do have to laugh, I came directly here to give a positive review and I chuckled at all the negative reviews.  Makes me think I should keep trying other mascaras.  But for now I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I actually did not buy this from Amazon but I felt compelled to review the product anyway. First of all, there was not a difference in my lashes. Secondly, washing it off was a process. I had to put coconut oil on my lashes, let it sit for a minute, then wipe off. I had to repeat this process 3 times before I wash the rest off. Third, it is clumpy and sticks together. Finally, it made my lashes fall out. My once long beautiful lashes are gone! WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> This mascara was great! made my eyelashes longer &amp; fuller! definitely gives the sexy mysterious look  love it! looking forward to more products like it!</li>
            <li> This COULD be a great mascara.  I received this in my Influenster box for testing and was honestly kind of excited to try it.  I love my current mascara but it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side.  I would have loved to have found a more economical substitute for everyday use.  There are some great attributes: waterproof, volumizing and curling.  However, that&#x27;s where it all goes horribly wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one isn&#x27;t so bad.  In fact, it&#x27;s pretty great (minus the absolute horrible packaging.)  The wands are too fat and short to make application easy.  But, step one does exactly what it says: it made my lashes appear much thicker, well defined and put a lovely curl on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step two is horrible.  The formula is sticky and clumpy.  Once you have fought the packaging to get it on, you have to hurry and find a clean mascara brush to separate all of the lashes that have gone from being full and beautiful to spiky tarantula legs protruding from your eyes.  And if you don&#x27;t work fast...let&#x27;s just say, I had to start over from scratch.  Not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, as for it being waterproof, it is. But what I didn&#x27;t understand was how it managed to raccoon under my eyes by dinner but took super duper makeup remover to actually remove it at the end of the day.  So....waterproof, yes.  Smudge-proof, no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has potential to be a great mascara....but it just falls so flat.</li>
            <li> it was hard to handle the brush since the tube is thick. it takes awhile to do the two steps. made my lashes long and black. the mascara is hard to wash off. kinda sticky feeling</li>
            <li> Love this product. It really works!!! Really gives volume to my lashes.</li>
            <li> The last mascara I used ended up breaking my lashes so I was happy to start trying a new one. I received the Covergirl Bombshell Volume Mascara free from Inlfuenster for testing purposes. The tube is pretty big but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I liked the way it went on and didn&#x27;t clump with the first coat. I would say it isn&#x27;t very good for layering though. It will get clumpy. I liked it okay to use for an everyday mascara. It lasted all day and did not smudge but at the end of the day it is a pain to take off. My eye makeup remover hardly works on it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have to agree with most of the reviews on here.  Step one is ok.  Step two just made things worse.  Definitely not the bombshell look I was hopeful for.  And, yes, while it is terrible to remove, it sure did get all over my undereye area.  I was constantly wiping my raccoon eyes all day, in the process rubbing off my undereye concealer.  Not a fan. I do love other Covergirl mascaras though!  This was was a fail.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever bought.  Paid almost $10 for it and went straight to the trash after two applications.  It is not labeled waterproof but it took several days to take off.  I tried make up remover, soap/water, olive oil, lotion...nothing would work!  I ended up loosing a few lashes each time I used it just trying to take it off.  One side of the brush is very hard and it clumps when applying. My lasshes would stick together and had a difficulty time getting them to separate.</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to write this because as a person who enjoys trying new makeup I was interested in this when I read positive articles online (promoted much maybe?) I very, very, rarely give one star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The marketing was good (let&#x27;s face it Sophia Vergara is beautiful and can really sell products) and it looked like an interesting new concept. Nope. Really bad product, horrible delivery. I am not a high end makeup person,  with a few exceptions,  (can&#x27;t afford it and think it&#x27;s a waste of money when trying new products)  I usually buy drugstore/ box store brand items because generally the quality is comparable. I have had great success many covergirl products and they are usually especially good with mascara.&lt;br /&gt; Ugh. and so I feel compelled to warn you: 1) the product is two sided: Side one tolerable thinish mascara could maybe be usable but not great. Bristles are wider spiral like more old school mascara wands. Side two: horrible, sticky, thick clumpy formula. (I actually fished the packaging out of the trash can thinking maybe I&#x27;d bought some horrible version of waterproof mascara by mistake, nope) My lashes were literally sticking together at the ends of my eyelids ( and I didn&#x27;t even  apply it to the lower lashes) Brush has more dense fluffy bristles. 2) The delivery: the wands are so short and stumpy that it makes it hard to apply if you have any cheekbones at all. The wands are super think and clunky. (maybe ok for people with hand difficulties/ limited dexterity?)  Removal is horrible. Also, looked like Mimi from the Drew Carey show- google it (with much fear- makeup users)&lt;br /&gt; So, other reviewers have countered with the thoughts that the person applying either didn&#x27;t know how to apply it (hey, it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s you!) or that the person did not purchase the correct make up remover. Ok. fair enough, but if this required special specific remover it should be written in large print so a reasonable person could purchase it at thesame time.  Cover girl, shame on you, I know you can do better, I&#x27;ve seen you do much better. (Clump crusher by lashblast/ covergirl is amazing) This product is a bomb. Save your money. I want my $10.00 back.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have always been full, but I would like them to be longer. I had a coupon for this mascara, so I decided to give it a try. At first, I noticed that it definitely made my eyelashes look longer, but it smeared very easily- I would immediately have tiny spots of mascara above my upper eyelid from blinking, but after I fixed that, it seemed ok. After a few days, it seemed my eyelashes were sticking together pretty badly. It is definitely not a clump-less mascara; it makes your lashes appear longer, but then you have six or seven &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; of lashes. As another reviewer noted, the mascara is not listed as waterproof, but it is nearly impossible to remove.&lt;br /&gt;And then things got bad.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that at the end of the day, it would feel like I had an eyelash loose. Rather than picking at it, because my eyelashes were so stuck together by this product, I would get an eye makeup remover wipe and gently go over my eyelash line to try to loosen the clump and catch the eyelash if it had fallen out. But then I&#x27;d look at the wipe, and see a little cluster of six lashes had fallen out. The next day, the same thing would happen on the other eye. All in all I used the product off and on for about two weeks, and I&#x27;d say that I lost 40% of my eyelashes, at least.Now, instead of having full eyelashes that aren&#x27;t quite as long as I&#x27;d like, I flat out have NO eyelashes in huge patches along the line of my eyelids. Some of the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; patches are the width of my little finger. I&#x27;m pretty hacked, and was very upset for the first few days after it happened. Needless to say I am no longer using this mascara, and am doing what I can to make my eyes look halfway normal with eyeliner and my old brand of mascara.</li>
            <li> I received the product from influenster to try out. I would not recommend this mascara. It is very clumpy and difficult to use, the second step is pointless. The product would be a lot simpler to use if it was one step. It is also very difficult to remove, even with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I got this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and i had to try it every mascara i have seen has that white number 1 where ugh it drives me crazy!!! gets all over and dont let me complain about clumps so when i got this i was ready to try it now as it might not be for everyone it was perfect for me, i dont know if this is a complaint or not but i would love to see this in water proof, and maybe a brush that clumps less? it wasnt a huge issue with me it makes me wonder should i use it on my bottom lashes now, thanks covergirl!</li>
            <li> Okay I have been wearing all kinds of mascara for the past 35 years or so. This looks great on for about two hours, then it clumps and sticks making you look like a crazy person. It is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to remove. I tried my usual Almay eye makeup remover (which is gentle but thorough on all other mascaras I have tried!), baby oil, Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream, Cethaphil with warm soap and water. It was so expensive too! I am going to try and return it. Has anyone tried the Covergirl Makeup remover with this yet?? I recall their makeup remover being too harsh for my eyes. Ugh:( DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE COVER GIRL EYE MAKEUP REMOVER WILL WORK TO GET THIS OFF? DON&#x27;T WANT TO WASTE MORE MONEY IF NOT! THANKS!</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of negative reviews on the product. It wasn&#x27;t my favorite mascara every, but it wasn&#x27;t as bad as everyone was saying. I was honestly shocked how low of a score it got. It is expensive, so I guess if you don&#x27;t want to take the risk, don&#x27;t get it. Just saying, I&#x27;m very picky about my mascara and I actually thought it did an excellent job, its just on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> This mascara has great features, it adds length and intensity. It leaves my lashes looking long and full. Its brushes work perfectly to add volume and separate lashes. Even though it is a bit hard to remove and sometimes smudges overall I am happy with the look of my lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof, that is no lie, it is also soap and makeup remover proof.....In fact NOTHING can remove it. This is asphalt&#x27;s ugly cousin and I think the scientists who came up with this stuff ought to pursue careers in the road repair industry. Suggestions for removal....either cut off lashes with scissors( then throw scissors away) or just pluck them out.&lt;br /&gt;Consider purchasing false eyelashes with this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of mascaras. This is by far my least favorite. It clumped my eyelashes together and made them feel heavy. After applying, my lashes were wet and heavy for a good 20 minutes, and don&#x27;t even get me started about removing it. I lost too many eyelashes after the first time wearing this to every try it again. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> **I received this mascara through Influenster to try out.**  The reason I gave it four stars is this. 1. The packaging is really bulky and it was confusing at first it seemed backwards. 2. I really liked the application of side one but side two made my lashes stick together a bit and were a bit sticky they felt like I had walked through a spider web. I have read other review saying it was impossible to get off and they lost lashes. Well if you read the packaging it says to use with Covergirl eye make up remover or any OIL BASED make up remover. I have had issues in the past with other brands taking off eye lashes because it was hard to come off but not in this case. It came off easily. I did have to swipe it a few times to get it off but I didn&#x27;t lose lashes and it came of in a few strokes of cleaner.  I would definetly use this mascara again when I go out on a date or a night out with the girls.</li>
            <li> Loved this mascara. If you need a mascara that stays on ALL day this is it! The waterproof is amazing. Not to mention how it makes my eyelashes look... Gorgeous! Gives them lots of volume and length. Does not smudge.</li>
            <li> I received the COVERGIRL Bombshell Volume by Lashblast Mascara last week from Influenster free for test purposes, but already plan to buy it in the future! One side is for length, the second for volume, I combine the two for the dramatic Bombshell lashes they advertise when I want to look extra special for date night, yet for work I can just do length or volume depending on how I did the rest of my makeup for work. I love that it gives the option of creating three different looks, and being it&#x27;s attached, I don&#x27;t need a variety of mascaras in my makeup kit!&lt;br /&gt;If you read the info on the package, it does say that the formula works like waterproof mascara and to be sure to use an oil based makeup remover.  It does just what it says! I was at a comedy show last night, laughing until tears and the mascara made it through the whole night!&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have an oil based makeup remover, I suggest using a makeup remover wipe, wash your face as usual and if any left, use some eye makeup remover on a cotton ball.  No extra lashes lost, and no raccoon eyes in the morning!</li>
            <li> Cover girl Bombshell mascara looked great when it was on! I had thicker fuller lashes!! It stayed in place and didn&#x27;t flake or wear off! I loved the way it looked! When taking the product off you have to really work. I believe it took me 10 minutes to remove the mascara..... Using a remover meant for waterproof mascara. You have to take you time and slowly scrub it. Don&#x27;t pull in your lashes trying to remove the product, you will just too you eyelashes out!</li>
            <li> Horrible!!! I have used MANY products in my day but I literally had to remove about 2 layers of skin from my eye lids just to get this stuff off!! It must be water proof AND eye make up remover proof!!!</li>
            <li> I actually got this in a voxbox to try complimentary....This mascara works well, but I am usually in a hurry so the two step process is a little much for me on a normal day to day basis.  For a special occasion or if I am doing more dramatic make up this would be more ideal.</li>
            <li> I like it for the volume it gives however it&#x27;s definitely REALLY hard to get all off and does leave my lashes a little clumped with mascara if I put too much on. But overall, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to so I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> Beauty blogger Kandee Johnson&#x27;s positive review of this mascara on YouTube sold me on giving it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!  It&#x27;s not my &#x27;everyday&#x27; mascara, but definitely a staple for when I want a more glam look.  It goes on clean for me without clumping, and I like the brushes.  Wears a little heavy, but that&#x27;s what I expected from it.  I haven&#x27;t experienced the problems removing it that others have.  I&#x27;m not doing anything special that they&#x27;re not, I&#x27;m sure, it just hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  Will definitely continue to keep it on hand.</li>
