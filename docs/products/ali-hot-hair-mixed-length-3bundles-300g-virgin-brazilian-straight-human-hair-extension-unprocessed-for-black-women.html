    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t write reviews but I thought this would be beneficial to others. This hair is awesome!! Quick shipping,  no tangles,  and it curls and blends perfectly with my hair.  I have had it installed for a week so far and still looks and feels the same. I would recommend this hair.</li>
            <li> The bundles were a ok size. Ends were in great condition but the hair is pretty dull and life less. I&#x27;ve only had it in three days and I&#x27;m already ready to take it out honestly. It&#x27;s just not silky and shiny like I would have wished.</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage, stringy and rough. Not even close to the same hair i received from this company before. Returning immediately!!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. I love my hair.its the best</li>
            <li> Bought weave for prom.Came very fast in less than a week. Good hair thin at the bottom though. So far no shedding.</li>
            <li> I just got my hair in 2 days, so it was a super fast delivery.....I was silky and smooth and true to lenghth...I got the 18,20,22..3 bundles and it did my whole head....The shedding is very little and it does not tangle.....I love it ....</li>
            <li> I love it for now I havent had in my head for only a week</li>
            <li> When first received, it was okay. After first day of installment it was extremely kinky. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Hair is really soft and took to color really well, will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Great price! Second time buying this hair!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, the hair was one big split end. Soft when removed from the package but after I installed the hair it didn&#x27;t cooperate. Extremely frizzy (without product) and after light product was applied it frizzed up an hour later. It&#x27;s sad because I read the reviews and wish I would have received the hair people are raving about.</li>
            <li> Soft, silky hair!! Just Beautiful!! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> loving this hair !! came the very next day . very soft &amp; silky with no shedding thus far .</li>
            <li> Great hair really silly straightand blends well will order again!</li>
            <li> Omg....this hair is so soft but bundles are a bit small  but love it still</li>
            <li> This hair is wonderful. It&#x27;s soft and I haven&#x27;t had any tangling or shedding. I recently recieved my hair and I plan on dying it. I will do an update on how it goes. I highly recommend this hair. It&#x27;s low in price but high in quality.</li>
            <li> It came in and looked beautiful; it was the lenght I wanted and came in at a timely matter but it sheds like crazy.  I don&#x27;t forsee myself buying this again.</li>
            <li> Bundles were full enough for a full sew in, hair was of OK quality I like how it looks straight and how it curls up after u wash it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it did start tangling the day after it was put in so u must keep a brush handy. So overall for what u spend its not bad.</li>
            <li> was skeptical to buy this hair, but it was on of my best buys. I recommend everybody, to get this. Long think bundles, true to length, no smell, so soft to touch and it looks so pretty. My hairdresser was even saying how much she loved it.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again and am debating sending the hair back. I put them in with micro beads, the more expensive brands only need 2 tracks, double wefted.. I had to fit as many as I could on my head so that it would slightly blend. The ends are thin on this hair just like other reviews have also stated. I am wondering if the good reviewers received better quality hair, or if they have just never used good hair before. I will never be able to wear these straight, I will always have to curl it so that the visible line of where my hair stops and the extensions continue is not noticeable. I have longer hair so it&#x27;s pretty easy for extensions to blend with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am leaving them in for a few days to make a decision on returning them.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the hair does look nice in the package. But once you open it and unravel the hair you can tell the ends are thin. There was also a section on one of the wefts where the stitching was messed up, the hair was coming out in that spot, which I have posted a picture of.</li>
            <li> i love this hair its a reasonable price and it last a very long time im very satisfied it doesnt shed i washed it and it still looks the same as if i first bought definitly recomened this hair to anyone</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail and its beautiful soft, no shedding/tangling. But I have yet to install it an am weary of being to optimistic. I will update after install. But for right now im in love with the hair. Word of caution however. I purchased longer lenghts 18,20,22 and am considering ordering 1 additional bundle for a fuller look. something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that hair look genuine !</li>
            <li> The hair is great for the price mine sheds alpt more than i would like. Thats all though everyone might not feel like they get the same type of hair but it is great</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Amazing hair! Some of the reviews made me nervous but I love this hair! Absolutely great hair. I have suggested this brand to all of my friends. The hair is amazing, no smell. Soft and shiney. It moves great and looks fanatic!</li>
            <li> I revived my hair on time, it feels nice and soft I will order from this seller again , good prices, I told a lot of people about my hair , I only had to in for 2 days but I&#x27;m having little to no shedding so far I love it ...18&#x27;20&#x27;22</li>
            <li> These bundles we&#x27;re soooooooo small. I wish I had enough time to send these back.</li>
            <li> The hair is ok for the price but I did not like the color  at all. The bundles are thick which is allways a plus. As far as the color it&#x27;s nothing some dye and conditioner can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> Oh lord, i don&#x27;t know what happened this time but i got something totally different. The hair was horrible. It sheds really bad, doesn&#x27;t accept dye and it&#x27;s like synthetic,  much like a blend</li>
    </ol>
