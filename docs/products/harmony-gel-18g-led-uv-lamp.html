            <li>This lamp is amazing.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before purchasing a nail light, and it has lived up to its great reviews.</li>
            <li>This is a great light.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It is just amazing.</li>
            <li>If you into DIY gel polish, this lamp is amazing.</li>
            <li>I started getting Gel manicures before my wedding, as I wanted nice nails without having to use acrylic.  </li>
            <li>After the wedding, I had gotten so used to having nice nails</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to do my own gels at home....</li>
            <li>doing my own gel nails now....</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cure time is set with 10, 20, and 30 secs and you can either use the motion sensor or turn it off and manually press the time buttons on your own.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the fast cure time.</li>
            <li>its kind of like a microwave.  </li>
            <li>Nice size with plenty of room for hand &amp; foot.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gel nails for 2 years.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments on my nails and have friends ask about doing their own at home.</li>
            <li>The shield that lowers and raises is a nice feature as well.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a good light, very clean and looks great, however, it will NOT cure 99% of UV Gel or Gel Polish out there.  </li>
            <li>highly functional, impressed!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this light!!</li>
            <li>Best one I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Great product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but it would be nice to be able to just switch the power off.  </li>
            <li>but it would be nice to be able to just switch the power off.  </li>

            <li>Thank you for item is working ok</li>
            <li>I would be able to give this a 5 star review except that after 10 months of use, the automatic on/off</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once when I was trying to fit the bottom piece on correctly, my hand slipped and the edge sliced the side of my hand where my pinky attaches to my palm almost to the bone!</li>
            <li>Just put some remover on a cotton ball and wrap the top of the finger in a piece of foil for about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I love their polish.</li>
            <li>To the amazement of many I always have my nails and toenails</li>
            <li>Awesome, fast powerful</li>
            <li>30 seconds on the color polish, and 20 seconds on the top coat.</li>
            <li>I love that it takes lest time than UV.</li>
            <li>Make sure you splay your fingers out during curing or else</li>
            <li>I love this light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size of the light is good and can fit any hand size.</li>
            <li>I love that it turns on automatically when you put your hand on</li>
            <li>There is also a rubber like pad on top that is supposed to be a rest for your clients.</li>
            <li>Many features.</li>
            <li>Save time and money, what more can you ask for.</li>

            <li>I absolutely LOVE this.</li>
            <li>a salon who also gave me one of the best, longest lasting gel manicure&#x27;s I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>, they love it then they bought some.</li>
            <li>do my own nails as a cost saving measure &amp; although this light isn&#x27;t cheep</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I use this recreationally and have had mine for over a year and just love it.</li>
            <li>and they said they love it.</li>
            <li>It’s so nice just being able to stick my hand or foot in and have the light turn on automatically.</li>
            <li>I am so adventurous now with my nail</li>
            <li>This messed me up more times than I can count.</li>
            <li>and this light is still amazing.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing to find a product that does exactly what it says it is going to do!  </li>
            <li>This is a great fast, easy curing machine.</li>
            <li>Gets a little warm while drying but its awesome.</li>
            <li>The packaging was great and the lamp was brand new with no signs of wear as others have reported.</li>
            <li>Works fast and the light shield is A great feature.</li>
            <li>, it is definitely a great light, though I still feel the price is too high considering</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great LED light, I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I love this light.</li>
            <li>Fabulous light!</li>
            <li>What I have discovered is that it doesn&#x27;t fully cure all products, and I still use the 36 Watt light to cure many of my products.</li>
            <li>Enjoy :)</li>
            <li>Love this LED light.  </li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this light.  </li>
            <li>I love my Gelish 18G LED light.  </li>
            <li>This light also easily accommodates your pedis - love it.</li>
            <li>i love love love love my new lamp. :)</li>
            <li>Hopefully within a year or two, LED Gel will be more accessible.  </li>
            <li>This was the perfect alternative to getting them done every other week.</li>
            <li>The nail polish removes easily with acetone nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pick up and carry and put up on the shelf when I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight so that you can easily transport it if you need to.</li>
            <li>If you get a product on there, it&#x27;s easy to wipe off and does not stain.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to do toes too.</li>
            <li>It has easily paid for itself already.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy to do if you&#x27;ve gotten your nails done in the salon</li>
            <li>Love the auto sensor that turns the light off and on when you put your nails under the light.</li>
            <li>It work very well, nice shape, my wife love it, tell co-work about it</li>
            <li>It’s also easy to wipe a design off that I don’t like that hasn&#x27;t been cured because the paint under it is set.</li>
            <li>it also has a hood that lifts for easy hand insert and removal.</li>
            <li>She said it is as good as any she has used at a high end salon.</li>
            <li>i love love love love my new lamp.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this light, its so fast and its nice to do all 5 fingers at once...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend if you don&#x27;t mind doing your own nails and if, like me, going to the salon is more of a hassle because you feel that you don&#x27;t ever have the time.</li>
            <li>If you want to use the light for a pedicure you can remove the bottom plate so a foot can easily slide in.</li>
            <li>I just Love how quick it works.</li>
            <li>I finish the job more quickly with this lamp than a UV lamp.</li>
            <li>Now since it’s so quick I love doing one hand at a time.</li>
            <li>It dries my nails quickly and I love how the light turns on by it</li>
            <li>The ability to use nail polish to fix errors after you have cured the lower layers of polish is the best thing ever and the fact that after the polish has been set with the light you can&#x27;t mess it up...</li>
            <li>I did a little research and found this is supposed to be one of the best led lights.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light is easy to set up and clean.</li>
            <li>Huge bonus:</li>
            <li>It used to be a huge chore</li>
            <li>They have used them extensively in the last 2 weeks and were thrilled at the wonderful job they did.</li>
            <li>Helps speed up my self manicures, was using a uv light.</li>
            <li>The way the light comes on, activated immediately when you put your fingers inside is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice looking, durable lamp that comes with a very well written manual.  </li>
            <li>Obviously the product works great with the Gelish line of gel polishes.</li>
            <li>I really debated buying this seeing as it is just for my own home use</li>
            <li>I just received my LED light today</li>
            <li>I purchased my light 9 months ago for $292.</li>
            <li>My light no longer works.</li>
            <li>They will not exchange, repair, or return my light.</li>
            <li>I got rid of my 36 Watt UV light</li>
            <li>Like I have read this light is the mother of all LED lights.</li>
            <li>Not to mention not exposing skin to UV light has to be a plus.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I wish this machine had an on/off switch, but otherwise great product.</li>
            <li>I went for a pedicure and noticed the salon uses this light</li>
            <li>I am not going to deduct a star for this because I haven’t had a problem with my light (and hopefully won’t), but if I have problems with the unit and can’t get any help</li>
            <li>get this light.</li>
            <li>It works good so far.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy,</li>
            <li>Again, because it’s so quick it’s so easy just to fix one nail.</li>
            <li>It is not uncomfortable, and I feel like I am getting a better cure on my gel polish than with the Pro-45.  </li>
            <li>I am excited about the amount of money I am going to save</li>
            <li>Had to try it one it got here, not disappointed what so ever.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this lamp</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>it came in original packaging and did come with some instructional papers.  </li>
            <li>You can easily pull it off to clean the bottom piece or you can remove it and place it on top of the foot for a pedi.  very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I have saved a massive amount of money doing my own (and I&#x27;ve rewatched all the Friends episodes on Netflix during my nail time!)</li>
            <li>I have saved a massive amount of money doing my own (and I&#x27;ve rewatched all the Friends episodes on Netflix during my nail time!)</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>However, it also works great with other product lines that can cure in an LED light vs a UV light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than my UV light, saves so much time.</li>
            <li>You will need to research how to apply gel nails as you do have to start with a chalky clean  nail bed.</li>
            <li>The lamp was shipped in a secure package, and came rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>OMG, I love this little LED light!!!  </li>
            <li>Anytime I have a special event I just pop this out and do my nails.</li>
            <li>I have to angle it a certain way and make sure that the cord isn&#x27;t touched as it will turn it on and off.</li>
            <li>Very happy with lamp, glad I spent the extra $.  </li>
            <li>i love it so much i would suggest it to anyone who goes LED gels.</li>
            <li>I try to restrain myself from buying too many colors and really use up what I have.</li>
            <li>and they are the true experts</li>
            <li>The thought of curing each coat for 2 minutes and then having to cure the designs for more time was just too much.</li>
            <li>Love my new light.</li>
            <li>I love that it is super fast</li>
            <li>this is the best gel machine ever, my clients really love the fact that there nails are dry in 30 seconds and they dont have to wait all day for there nails to dry</li>
            <li>so I did not need instructions but what I seen was pretty easy to understand....</li>
            <li>Saving big time doing own nails in home, and quick!  </li>
            <li>Works quick.</li>
            <li>The LED is really quick.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The UV lamps required longer curing times, where the LED is super</li>
            <li>the device is made more for a salon, bc the top part is padded for the client to rest their hand and the timer is on the back of it.  </li>
            <li>Quick dryer, I can paint the shellac</li>
            <li>I have had no issues with the lamp and can honestly say that I have no regrets!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used other lamps and this is by far the best one for your gel polish nails.</li>
            <li>This is the exact light my nail tech uses in FL.  </li>
            <li>It is pearlized and has a great door that slides down so the light does not blind your client.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to gel nails, and love using this led.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback, the quick time it now takes makes me to do a gel manicure makes me do them more than the every 2 weeks it beautifuly, easily lasts.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what she wanted!</li>
            <li>The plate is easy to clean and clips back on easily with magnets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nails look amazing, I will probablly never have to go back to the salon again unless I need my cuticles trimmed.  </li>
            <li>It is SO DARN FAST and fantastic.  </li>
            <li>So I bought the Thermal Spa UV light for around $50, I wasn&#x27;t ready to go all out and spend $200 for this.</li>
            <li>So worth the price.</li>
            <li>This was WELL worth the investment.</li>
            <li>worth the price...</li>
            <li>but I LOVE it so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but so worth it.</li>
            <li>it is worth it..  </li>
            <li>it is worth it..  </li>
            <li>Overall.... I would recommend this machine to anyone who is considering doing there own nails from home.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny in the time I save.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.  </li>
            <li>It is 100% worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It is 100% worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Super-fast, safer, and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment for me.</li>
            <li>It is great, everything I wanted, and thinking it should last forever and save me money once I figure out how to properly get the gel nails to look perfect and last as long as they should...</li>
            <li>The higher wattage (light output at 18 W) worked much quicker than other lower wattage devices they have used and although they noted it was warm inside the light when they had their hands inside it</li>
            <li>: I am so excited with how fast I can do my nails now.</li>
            <li>It comes right</li>
            <li>It does not come with a manual but The directions of use are right on the box.</li>
            <li>My nail tech told me these usually run around $350-400, but that they are by far the best gel lamp (and the fastest) you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>If your in the market for a new LED light, I highly recommend this one!!!  </li>
            <li>Love the auto on and count down function  :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this light.</li>
            <li>After my first use I knew it was absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my new light.</li>
            <li>At first, the sensor worked right a way.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great to have such a short curing time!  </li>
            <li>Dries all five fingers at once, saves me time, and dries super fast and evenly.</li>
            <li>As for the lamp itself, it works wonderfully at curing my shellac/gelish polish, but for the near $300 price tag, I would at least expect a user&#x27;s manual.  </li>
            <li>This thing is super fast.</li>
            <li>This does all five nails in super fast times.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price...</li>
            <li>Make sure to cap the end (put a little nail polish on the end of your nail) and clean up your skin and cuticles of any mistakes before curing!</li>
            <li>Make sure to cap the end (put a little nail polish on the end of your nail) and clean up your skin and cuticles of any mistakes before curing!</li>
            <li>was never uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>There were some complaints about it being too hot.  </li>
            <li>When I looked at my hand, I realized that the hot spot was where I accidentally got nail polish on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Finally decided that I should invest in a better quality lamp.</li>
            <li>Also, this LED light fixed a problem that I was having when taking off the tacky layer.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>First off I want to say that I am a licensed nail tech</li>
            <li>and I love that it has the different timer settings.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gel manicures for 2 years now and I am so glad finally spent the extra money for this product.</li>
            <li>Thirty seconds for each coat and the same for the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I use many different types of color gels and Gel Builder products.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it will cure the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit is pretty compact.  </li>
            <li>My manicures have never been so fast!</li>
            <li>My first experience with this LED curing device was @</li>
            <li>Only thing is make sure you hear the 3 beeping instead one one beep, because sometime customer move their hand and the sensor reset the timer.</li>
            <li>I have to change the time on the back from 5 seconds to 30 seconds, but after that I’m done touching anything.</li>
            <li>I actually find it pretty easy to do french manicures which I love at home.  </li>
            <li>I got this product a few days ago so far it works great.</li>
            <li>I can barely squeeze both hands in together (interlaced, one on top of the other), but that is ok, because I like that</li>
            <li>I am NOT a professional and do this at home to save money and change up colors more than what my budget allows at a salon.</li>
            <li>I learned to only put one coat on so that they don&#x27;t peel off easily for her.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made  product and I can feel the heat when curing.  </li>
            <li>Makes my job much easier and faster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an at home gelish user for 3.5 years and started with a standard uv light.</li>
            <li>The auto-on works really well, and the size and bulb placement allows for a whole-hand/foot cure.</li>
            <li>there isn&#x27;t much product that will work with it.</li>
            <li>You can only do 1 hand or foot at a time comfortably.  </li>
            <li>So much faster than the UV lamp.  </li>
            <li>Much faster than the UV lights.</li>
            <li>Fast reliable shipping.</li>
            <li>I finally took the plunge and purchased this LED light so that I could do my nails at home.  </li>
            <li>Also I noticed if I put to much gel polish on a nail then</li>
            <li>and this one is so fast</li>
            <li>Fast as the one Nail Salons use.  </li>
            <li>but I really like how it works.</li>
            <li>I am glad I spent the extra money on the LED light.</li>
            <li>This light only cures Gelish Polish which Gelish sells.  </li>
            <li>lightening fast</li>
            <li>but I really wanted a reliable led lamp.  </li>
            <li>it doesnt bother me much bc since its motion activated</li>
            <li>lightening fast.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortabel.</li>
            <li>Fast, even, reliable 5 finger cure.</li>
            <li>Which means when you&#x27;re drying the left hand the light will not turn on automatically.</li>
            <li>Now I absolutely don’t mind doing stripes, polka dots, hearts or flowers.</li>
            <li>My dominant hand, pointer finger can start lifting before I’m ready to redo my nails.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to spend this much.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t matter as the curing time is so fast and unlike the 1-3 minutes in the UV that it is not a problem at all.</li>
            <li>I use to do nails years ago, but now just do my own &amp; few others.</li>
            <li>I would get all set up with a good TV show and do the tedious task of curing each coat for 2 minutes under the UV light.</li>
            <li>I cant believe it took me so long to get it if i knew how easy it was and how fast I would of bought it sooner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, but it is so worth it!!!  </li>
            <li>Instead of being an hour long ordeal, I can get my stuff out quickly and do my fingers or toes right before bed in about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-Sensor:</li>
            <li>Best thing ever no more making appointments , do my nails at ease anytime of the day at little cost to me.</li>
            <li>The cord on it is very long which makes for an easy set up.</li>
            <li>Professional look at home ;)</li>
            <li>If I’m doing a design where I have to be careful about two colors touching and bleeding into each other, it’s easy to cure one part quickly and then do the next part.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of gel manicures and really love that the led sets each layer in 30 seconds or less.</li>
            <li>&gt;* Be sure to soak your nails for several minutes prior to applying the polish.  </li>
            <li>actual unit is very pretty to look at.</li>
            <li>After using an old lamp this is like heaven and is worth the extra money, your whole hand fits and is done in lightning fast speed</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to any one.</li>
            <li>She loves all Gelish products and highly recommended this one.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would rather pay a little more to get the brand name lamp that is reliable.  </li>
            <li>I would rather pay a little more to get the brand name lamp that is reliable.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t doubt your decision, just save a little more up and get this.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t doubt your decision, just save a little more up and get this.</li>
            <li>But very easy to use as the 30 sec timer resets itself when I remove my hand and put it right back in, though it would be much easier if it came with longer timers than 30 seconds, as 30 seconds is not long enough to do anything it claims,</li>
            <li>I forewarn that you need to know how the other product lines cure if you plan on using it with this light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-One hand at a time: I bought the other nail light because I wanted to do two hands at once.</li>
            <li>Even better NO HARMFUL UV to keep my hands skin looking young as long as possible.</li>
            <li>and I am always adding new lights to my additions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same model used at the nail salon</li>
            <li>it is so simple to use and so fast!  </li>
            <li>I am not a nail professional and getting it at a DEEP discount on Amazon made for a fantastic Christmas present to myself.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery than expected the unit did not look new</li>
            <li>Small light that cures fast.  </li>
            <li>, the most time is with dark colors 30 seconds, my other one is about 5 minutes and believe me in theory 5 minutes is not that much</li>
            <li>It does get a little hot under these lights, so be aware of that.  </li>
            <li>I would always have dull matte spots here and there on my top coat.</li>
            <li>This product is a great product, but I would not buy from this seller again or buy something this expensive from a third party.  </li>
            <li>I feel that it really cures my manicures every time vs my old 9w LED lamp which sometimes left my mani&#x27;s still gooey.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use it in a professional salon (just at home),</li>
            <li>My old unit would stay on until the set time ran out.</li>
            <li>Professional model.  </li>
            <li>I will save money in the long run ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional nail tech</li>
            <li>I am a professional nail technician.</li>
            <li>Now I can really focus on the hand I’m working on and use the opposite hand to rub pain off the skin or pull off a stray piece of lint.</li>
            <li>You can also gently lift your hand inside the unit to reset the time for a second curing.</li>
            <li>After a few months of using this LED light (gelish product)</li>
            <li>It cures my gels very quickly, although I still double cure with dark colors.  </li>
            <li>Well i did my research on this gelish 18g lamp prior to buying and the main issues i read about it</li>
            <li>i was a little scared to purchase at first because of the high price and</li>
            <li>Iencourage them to spend the little extra up front to get this light.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and cuts down each manicure by 15 minutes!  </li>
            <li>It is big enough to do a whole hand.</li>
            <li>but it is still big enough for your whole hand or foot.  </li>
            <li>The reason I say be careful is this: the bottom is magnetic, so it comes off easily, and the unit is made of metal, some of the edges are very sharp.</li>
            <li>I have only used the lamp once so far</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only tried using it with gelish polish.</li>
            <li>A lot smaller than my old UV lamp</li>
            <li>The LED Gel is the only product that will cure under this light, and my wife found out the hard way.  </li>
            <li>done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer buttons on the back to adjust depending on which gel product your using are clear and simple to use.  </li>
            <li>It makes Gel Manicures much quicker and dries them harder than standard UV.</li>
            <li>Although they said I could return it or find a replacement cord for a partial refund, I wish this was built correctly considering the high price tag.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it if you are going to use it a lot, for a long time, or professional use.</li>
            <li>I have rather larger hands and really can only do one hand at a time although other reviews have stated that they can get both hands in.</li>
            <li>In short, there is not a single think I can think of to improve this.</li>
            <li>she use to have to old ones that dry nails in 2-3mins</li>
            <li>the cord is long enough that i dont need to use an extension like i did with my old uv lamp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times, and only had problems due to a few inferior gel polish brands I&#x27;ve tried, the light has worked well every time, every manicure has been fully cured.</li>
            <li>I have a 1 year old and have a limited time for my nails.</li>
            <li>As long as I am sure not be be sloppy, all is well.&lt;br /</li>

            <li> but it was worth it for this awesome dryer.</li>
            <li> This was a VERY worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> Good price and really nice..</li>
            <li> This is the best lamp on the market right now.</li>
            <li> My nails are strong and beautiful for a fraction of the salon price.</li>
            <li> With some people it is very warm but most like that they can get the gel polish done in seconds and not minutes .</li>
            <li> Great investment and worth EVERY penny!!</li>
            <li> glad I went for it anyway!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the timer and auto on and off!</li>
            <li> but I am soo glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> In love with this machine!</li>
            <li> Works fantastic!!</li>
            <li> and I am in LOVE with it!</li>
            <li> I was able to do 2 gel manicures and a gel pedicure in one hour with this!</li>
            <li> It operates exactly as described and delivers excellent results.</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> This lamp is amazing.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing a nail light, and it has lived up to its great reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a great light.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It is just amazing.</li>
            <li> If you into DIY gel polish, this lamp is amazing.</li>
            <li> I started getting Gel manicures before my wedding, as I wanted nice nails without having to use acrylic.  </li>
            <li> After the wedding, I had gotten so used to having nice nails</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to do my own gels at home....</li>
            <li> doing my own gel nails now....</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cure time is set with 10, 20, and 30 secs and you can either use the motion sensor or turn it off and manually press the time buttons on your own.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the fast cure time.</li>
            <li> its kind of like a microwave.  </li>
            <li> Nice size with plenty of room for hand &amp; foot.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel nails for 2 years.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my nails and have friends ask about doing their own at home.</li>
            <li> The shield that lowers and raises is a nice feature as well.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a good light, very clean and looks great, however, it will NOT cure 99% of UV Gel or Gel Polish out there.  </li>
            <li> highly functional, impressed!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this light!!</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Great product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> but it would be nice to be able to just switch the power off.  </li>
            <li> but it would be nice to be able to just switch the power off.  </li>

            <li> I have been using the light for about 8 months, and I absolutely love it!  </li>

            <li> Thank you for item is working ok</li>
            <li> I would be able to give this a 5 star review except that after 10 months of use, the automatic on/off</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once when I was trying to fit the bottom piece on correctly, my hand slipped and the edge sliced the side of my hand where my pinky attaches to my palm almost to the bone!</li>
            <li> Just put some remover on a cotton ball and wrap the top of the finger in a piece of foil for about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I love their polish.</li>
            <li> To the amazement of many I always have my nails and toenails</li>
            <li> Awesome, fast powerful</li>
            <li> 30 seconds on the color polish, and 20 seconds on the top coat.</li>
            <li> I love that it takes lest time than UV.</li>
            <li> Make sure you splay your fingers out during curing or else</li>
            <li> I love this light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The size of the light is good and can fit any hand size.</li>
            <li> I love that it turns on automatically when you put your hand on</li>
            <li> There is also a rubber like pad on top that is supposed to be a rest for your clients.</li>
            <li> Many features.</li>
            <li> Save time and money, what more can you ask for.</li>

            <li> That was all the convincing I needed.</li>
            <li> Love the present times are perfect for gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this.</li>
            <li> a salon who also gave me one of the best, longest lasting gel manicure&#x27;s I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> , they love it then they bought some.</li>
            <li> do my own nails as a cost saving measure &amp; although this light isn&#x27;t cheep</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I use this recreationally and have had mine for over a year and just love it.</li>
            <li> and they said they love it.</li>
            <li> It’s so nice just being able to stick my hand or foot in and have the light turn on automatically.</li>
            <li> I am so adventurous now with my nail</li>
            <li> This messed me up more times than I can count.</li>
            <li> and this light is still amazing.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing to find a product that does exactly what it says it is going to do!  </li>
            <li> This is a great fast, easy curing machine.</li>
            <li> Gets a little warm while drying but its awesome.</li>
            <li> The packaging was great and the lamp was brand new with no signs of wear as others have reported.</li>
            <li> Works fast and the light shield is A great feature.</li>
            <li> , it is definitely a great light, though I still feel the price is too high considering</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great LED light, I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I love this light.</li>
            <li> Fabulous light!</li>
            <li> What I have discovered is that it doesn&#x27;t fully cure all products, and I still use the 36 Watt light to cure many of my products.</li>
            <li> Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> Love this LED light.  </li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this light.  </li>
            <li> I love my Gelish 18G LED light.  </li>
            <li> This light also easily accommodates your pedis - love it.</li>
            <li> i love love love love my new lamp. :)</li>
            <li> Hopefully within a year or two, LED Gel will be more accessible.  </li>
            <li> This was the perfect alternative to getting them done every other week.</li>
            <li> The nail polish removes easily with acetone nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to pick up and carry and put up on the shelf when I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight so that you can easily transport it if you need to.</li>
            <li> If you get a product on there, it&#x27;s easy to wipe off and does not stain.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to do toes too.</li>
            <li> It has easily paid for itself already.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy to do if you&#x27;ve gotten your nails done in the salon</li>
            <li> Love the auto sensor that turns the light off and on when you put your nails under the light.</li>
            <li> It work very well, nice shape, my wife love it, tell co-work about it</li>
            <li> It’s also easy to wipe a design off that I don’t like that hasn&#x27;t been cured because the paint under it is set.</li>
            <li> it also has a hood that lifts for easy hand insert and removal.</li>
            <li> She said it is as good as any she has used at a high end salon.</li>
            <li> i love love love love my new lamp.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this light, its so fast and its nice to do all 5 fingers at once...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend if you don&#x27;t mind doing your own nails and if, like me, going to the salon is more of a hassle because you feel that you don&#x27;t ever have the time.</li>
            <li> If you want to use the light for a pedicure you can remove the bottom plate so a foot can easily slide in.</li>
            <li> I just Love how quick it works.</li>
            <li> I finish the job more quickly with this lamp than a UV lamp.</li>
            <li> Now since it’s so quick I love doing one hand at a time.</li>
            <li> It dries my nails quickly and I love how the light turns on by it</li>
            <li> The ability to use nail polish to fix errors after you have cured the lower layers of polish is the best thing ever and the fact that after the polish has been set with the light you can&#x27;t mess it up...</li>
            <li> I did a little research and found this is supposed to be one of the best led lights.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light is easy to set up and clean.</li>
            <li> Huge bonus:</li>
            <li> It used to be a huge chore</li>
            <li> They have used them extensively in the last 2 weeks and were thrilled at the wonderful job they did.</li>
            <li> Helps speed up my self manicures, was using a uv light.</li>
            <li> The way the light comes on, activated immediately when you put your fingers inside is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice looking, durable lamp that comes with a very well written manual.  </li>
            <li> Obviously the product works great with the Gelish line of gel polishes.</li>
            <li> I really debated buying this seeing as it is just for my own home use</li>
            <li> I just received my LED light today</li>
            <li> I purchased my light 9 months ago for $292.</li>
            <li> My light no longer works.</li>
            <li> They will not exchange, repair, or return my light.</li>
            <li> I got rid of my 36 Watt UV light</li>
            <li> Like I have read this light is the mother of all LED lights.</li>
            <li> Not to mention not exposing skin to UV light has to be a plus.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I wish this machine had an on/off switch, but otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> I went for a pedicure and noticed the salon uses this light</li>
            <li> I am not going to deduct a star for this because I haven’t had a problem with my light (and hopefully won’t), but if I have problems with the unit and can’t get any help</li>
            <li> get this light.</li>
            <li> It works good so far.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy,</li>
            <li> Again, because it’s so quick it’s so easy just to fix one nail.</li>
            <li> It is not uncomfortable, and I feel like I am getting a better cure on my gel polish than with the Pro-45.  </li>
            <li> I am excited about the amount of money I am going to save</li>
            <li> Had to try it one it got here, not disappointed what so ever.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this lamp</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> it came in original packaging and did come with some instructional papers.  </li>
            <li> You can easily pull it off to clean the bottom piece or you can remove it and place it on top of the foot for a pedi.  very convenient.  </li>
            <li> I have saved a massive amount of money doing my own (and I&#x27;ve rewatched all the Friends episodes on Netflix during my nail time!)</li>
            <li> I have saved a massive amount of money doing my own (and I&#x27;ve rewatched all the Friends episodes on Netflix during my nail time!)</li>
            <li> Have fun!</li>
            <li> However, it also works great with other product lines that can cure in an LED light vs a UV light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than my UV light, saves so much time.</li>
            <li> You will need to research how to apply gel nails as you do have to start with a chalky clean  nail bed.</li>
            <li> The lamp was shipped in a secure package, and came rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> OMG, I love this little LED light!!!  </li>
            <li> Anytime I have a special event I just pop this out and do my nails.</li>
            <li> I have to angle it a certain way and make sure that the cord isn&#x27;t touched as it will turn it on and off.</li>
            <li> Very happy with lamp, glad I spent the extra $.  </li>
            <li> i love it so much i would suggest it to anyone who goes LED gels.</li>
            <li> I try to restrain myself from buying too many colors and really use up what I have.</li>
            <li> and they are the true experts</li>
            <li> The thought of curing each coat for 2 minutes and then having to cure the designs for more time was just too much.</li>
            <li> Love my new light.</li>
            <li> I love that it is super fast</li>
            <li> this is the best gel machine ever, my clients really love the fact that there nails are dry in 30 seconds and they dont have to wait all day for there nails to dry</li>
            <li> so I did not need instructions but what I seen was pretty easy to understand....</li>
            <li> Saving big time doing own nails in home, and quick!  </li>
            <li> Works quick.</li>
            <li> The LED is really quick.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The UV lamps required longer curing times, where the LED is super</li>
            <li> the device is made more for a salon, bc the top part is padded for the client to rest their hand and the timer is on the back of it.  </li>
            <li> Quick dryer, I can paint the shellac</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with the lamp and can honestly say that I have no regrets!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other lamps and this is by far the best one for your gel polish nails.</li>
            <li> This is the exact light my nail tech uses in FL.  </li>
            <li> It is pearlized and has a great door that slides down so the light does not blind your client.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to gel nails, and love using this led.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback, the quick time it now takes makes me to do a gel manicure makes me do them more than the every 2 weeks it beautifuly, easily lasts.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what she wanted!</li>
            <li> The plate is easy to clean and clips back on easily with magnets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails look amazing, I will probablly never have to go back to the salon again unless I need my cuticles trimmed.  </li>
            <li> It is SO DARN FAST and fantastic.  </li>
            <li> So I bought the Thermal Spa UV light for around $50, I wasn&#x27;t ready to go all out and spend $200 for this.</li>
            <li> So worth the price.</li>
            <li> This was WELL worth the investment.</li>
            <li> worth the price...</li>
            <li> but I LOVE it so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but so worth it.</li>
            <li> it is worth it..  </li>
            <li> it is worth it..  </li>
            <li> Overall.... I would recommend this machine to anyone who is considering doing there own nails from home.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every penny in the time I save.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.  </li>
            <li> It is 100% worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It is 100% worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Super-fast, safer, and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment for me.</li>
            <li> It is great, everything I wanted, and thinking it should last forever and save me money once I figure out how to properly get the gel nails to look perfect and last as long as they should...</li>
            <li> The higher wattage (light output at 18 W) worked much quicker than other lower wattage devices they have used and although they noted it was warm inside the light when they had their hands inside it</li>
            <li> : I am so excited with how fast I can do my nails now.</li>
            <li> It comes right</li>
            <li> It does not come with a manual but The directions of use are right on the box.</li>
            <li> My nail tech told me these usually run around $350-400, but that they are by far the best gel lamp (and the fastest) you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> If your in the market for a new LED light, I highly recommend this one!!!  </li>
            <li> Love the auto on and count down function  :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this light.</li>
            <li> After my first use I knew it was absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my new light.</li>
            <li> At first, the sensor worked right a way.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great to have such a short curing time!  </li>
            <li> Dries all five fingers at once, saves me time, and dries super fast and evenly.</li>
            <li> As for the lamp itself, it works wonderfully at curing my shellac/gelish polish, but for the near $300 price tag, I would at least expect a user&#x27;s manual.  </li>
            <li> This thing is super fast.</li>
            <li> This does all five nails in super fast times.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price...</li>
            <li> Make sure to cap the end (put a little nail polish on the end of your nail) and clean up your skin and cuticles of any mistakes before curing!</li>
            <li> Make sure to cap the end (put a little nail polish on the end of your nail) and clean up your skin and cuticles of any mistakes before curing!</li>
            <li> was never uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> There were some complaints about it being too hot.  </li>
            <li> When I looked at my hand, I realized that the hot spot was where I accidentally got nail polish on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Finally decided that I should invest in a better quality lamp.</li>
            <li> Also, this LED light fixed a problem that I was having when taking off the tacky layer.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that I am a licensed nail tech</li>
            <li> and I love that it has the different timer settings.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel manicures for 2 years now and I am so glad finally spent the extra money for this product.</li>
            <li> Thirty seconds for each coat and the same for the top coat.  </li>
            <li> I use many different types of color gels and Gel Builder products.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it will cure the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is pretty compact.  </li>
            <li> My manicures have never been so fast!</li>
            <li> My first experience with this LED curing device was @</li>
            <li> Only thing is make sure you hear the 3 beeping instead one one beep, because sometime customer move their hand and the sensor reset the timer.</li>
            <li> I have to change the time on the back from 5 seconds to 30 seconds, but after that I’m done touching anything.</li>
            <li> I actually find it pretty easy to do french manicures which I love at home.  </li>
            <li> I got this product a few days ago so far it works great.</li>
            <li> I can barely squeeze both hands in together (interlaced, one on top of the other), but that is ok, because I like that</li>
            <li> I am NOT a professional and do this at home to save money and change up colors more than what my budget allows at a salon.</li>
            <li> I learned to only put one coat on so that they don&#x27;t peel off easily for her.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made  product and I can feel the heat when curing.  </li>
            <li> Makes my job much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an at home gelish user for 3.5 years and started with a standard uv light.</li>
            <li> The auto-on works really well, and the size and bulb placement allows for a whole-hand/foot cure.</li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t much product that will work with it.</li>
            <li> You can only do 1 hand or foot at a time comfortably.  </li>
            <li> So much faster than the UV lamp.  </li>
            <li> Much faster than the UV lights.</li>
            <li> Fast reliable shipping.</li>
            <li> I finally took the plunge and purchased this LED light so that I could do my nails at home.  </li>
            <li> Also I noticed if I put to much gel polish on a nail then</li>
            <li> and this one is so fast</li>
            <li> Fast as the one Nail Salons use.  </li>
            <li> but I really like how it works.</li>
            <li> I am glad I spent the extra money on the LED light.</li>
            <li> This light only cures Gelish Polish which Gelish sells.  </li>
            <li> lightening fast</li>
            <li> but I really wanted a reliable led lamp.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt bother me much bc since its motion activated</li>
            <li> lightening fast.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortabel.</li>
            <li> Fast, even, reliable 5 finger cure.</li>
            <li> Which means when you&#x27;re drying the left hand the light will not turn on automatically.</li>
            <li> Now I absolutely don’t mind doing stripes, polka dots, hearts or flowers.</li>
            <li> My dominant hand, pointer finger can start lifting before I’m ready to redo my nails.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to spend this much.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t matter as the curing time is so fast and unlike the 1-3 minutes in the UV that it is not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> I use to do nails years ago, but now just do my own &amp; few others.</li>
            <li> I would get all set up with a good TV show and do the tedious task of curing each coat for 2 minutes under the UV light.</li>
            <li> I cant believe it took me so long to get it if i knew how easy it was and how fast I would of bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but it is so worth it!!!  </li>
            <li> Instead of being an hour long ordeal, I can get my stuff out quickly and do my fingers or toes right before bed in about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-Sensor:</li>
            <li> Best thing ever no more making appointments , do my nails at ease anytime of the day at little cost to me.</li>
            <li> The cord on it is very long which makes for an easy set up.</li>
            <li> Professional look at home ;)</li>
            <li> If I’m doing a design where I have to be careful about two colors touching and bleeding into each other, it’s easy to cure one part quickly and then do the next part.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of gel manicures and really love that the led sets each layer in 30 seconds or less.</li>
            <li> &gt;* Be sure to soak your nails for several minutes prior to applying the polish.  </li>
            <li> actual unit is very pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> After using an old lamp this is like heaven and is worth the extra money, your whole hand fits and is done in lightning fast speed</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to any one.</li>
            <li> She loves all Gelish products and highly recommended this one.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would rather pay a little more to get the brand name lamp that is reliable.  </li>
            <li> I would rather pay a little more to get the brand name lamp that is reliable.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t doubt your decision, just save a little more up and get this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t doubt your decision, just save a little more up and get this.</li>
            <li> But very easy to use as the 30 sec timer resets itself when I remove my hand and put it right back in, though it would be much easier if it came with longer timers than 30 seconds, as 30 seconds is not long enough to do anything it claims,</li>
            <li> I forewarn that you need to know how the other product lines cure if you plan on using it with this light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-One hand at a time: I bought the other nail light because I wanted to do two hands at once.</li>
            <li> Even better NO HARMFUL UV to keep my hands skin looking young as long as possible.</li>
            <li> and I am always adding new lights to my additions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the same model used at the nail salon</li>
            <li> it is so simple to use and so fast!  </li>
            <li> I am not a nail professional and getting it at a DEEP discount on Amazon made for a fantastic Christmas present to myself.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery than expected the unit did not look new</li>
            <li> Small light that cures fast.  </li>
            <li> , the most time is with dark colors 30 seconds, my other one is about 5 minutes and believe me in theory 5 minutes is not that much</li>
            <li> It does get a little hot under these lights, so be aware of that.  </li>
            <li> I would always have dull matte spots here and there on my top coat.</li>
            <li> This product is a great product, but I would not buy from this seller again or buy something this expensive from a third party.  </li>
            <li> I feel that it really cures my manicures every time vs my old 9w LED lamp which sometimes left my mani&#x27;s still gooey.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use it in a professional salon (just at home),</li>
            <li> My old unit would stay on until the set time ran out.</li>
            <li> Professional model.  </li>
            <li> I will save money in the long run ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional nail tech</li>
            <li> I am a professional nail technician.</li>
            <li> Now I can really focus on the hand I’m working on and use the opposite hand to rub pain off the skin or pull off a stray piece of lint.</li>
            <li> You can also gently lift your hand inside the unit to reset the time for a second curing.</li>
            <li> After a few months of using this LED light (gelish product)</li>
            <li> It cures my gels very quickly, although I still double cure with dark colors.  </li>
            <li> Well i did my research on this gelish 18g lamp prior to buying and the main issues i read about it</li>
            <li> i was a little scared to purchase at first because of the high price and</li>
            <li> Iencourage them to spend the little extra up front to get this light.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and cuts down each manicure by 15 minutes!  </li>
            <li> It is big enough to do a whole hand.</li>
            <li> but it is still big enough for your whole hand or foot.  </li>
            <li> The reason I say be careful is this: the bottom is magnetic, so it comes off easily, and the unit is made of metal, some of the edges are very sharp.</li>
            <li> I have only used the lamp once so far</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tried using it with gelish polish.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than my old UV lamp</li>
            <li> The LED Gel is the only product that will cure under this light, and my wife found out the hard way.  </li>
            <li> done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer buttons on the back to adjust depending on which gel product your using are clear and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> It makes Gel Manicures much quicker and dries them harder than standard UV.</li>
            <li> Although they said I could return it or find a replacement cord for a partial refund, I wish this was built correctly considering the high price tag.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it if you are going to use it a lot, for a long time, or professional use.</li>
            <li> I have rather larger hands and really can only do one hand at a time although other reviews have stated that they can get both hands in.</li>
            <li> In short, there is not a single think I can think of to improve this.</li>
            <li> she use to have to old ones that dry nails in 2-3mins</li>
            <li> the cord is long enough that i dont need to use an extension like i did with my old uv lamp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times, and only had problems due to a few inferior gel polish brands I&#x27;ve tried, the light has worked well every time, every manicure has been fully cured.</li>
            <li> I have a 1 year old and have a limited time for my nails.</li>
            <li> As long as I am sure not be be sloppy, all is well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> i waste my money in few machines before i decide this is my next one, Is expensive but is worth it , i do my own nails</li>
            <li> and I have really cut down on the long manicure times when I used an LED for my gel polishes.</li>
            <li> I like the timed settings for the different layers used in producing gel nails, and even though one&#x27;s nails feel hot when under the lamp, it only lasts a very short time and certainly isn&#x27;t too uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing was the delivery time, when I first put in my order it gave me a 2 day shipping time, it jumped to a week the next day.</li>
            <li> Now I can do my nails very fast, I cure the base for 5 seconds and each color and top coat for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Hope they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Just hope it last as long as they say.</li>
            <li> Plus the gel dries in 30 seconds flat!</li>
            <li> It dries your nails within 30 seconds and there is no second guessing if they are really dry.  </li>
            <li> and hopefully the problem only with the cord is limited and not a product defect.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact everything takes about 3 times as long as the instructions claim.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I went so long without it.</li>
            <li> I finally took the leap and spent the money to get this lamp</li>
            <li> I do my nails along with nails of friends and family on a regular basis and have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> It was a long running battle on whether I should spend the money.  </li>
            <li> I read that it can be caused when polish is applied too thick or if your nails are very damaged.  </li>
            <li> I found this one for what I thought was a crazy price here on amazon, but at a national beauty supply chain, they charge the same amount for an &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; machine, so I figured I may as well get the same one my manicurist uses, so I am familiar with it, and know that it works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should have bit the bullet and purchased it long ago!</li>
            <li> My daughter never had patience to wait for paint to dry</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with a broken product that burns me and a whole in my wallet.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this with the fact that I am not amazing at doing nails (especially trying to paint my dominant hand) but using this with the gelish nail polishes makes for a professional looking manicure.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned purchasing this with the negative reviews and the high price tag..</li>
            <li> Cuts manicure time down to a fraction of what it was, this is my personal machine I do not use it in a salon.</li>
            <li> I had to drive down to the post office to pick it up the next.</li>
            <li> yes it will burn especially if it drips down to the skin.</li>
            <li> the lamp inside is motion activiated and will turn off automatically after the set time, but the count down screen on the back of it stays on until its unplugged.  </li>
            <li> the lamp inside is motion activiated and will turn off automatically after the set time, but the count down screen on the back of it stays on until its unplugged.  </li>
            <li> I previously had the smaller Gelish Pro-45 and upgraded to this.  </li>
            <li> the cover moves up and down so that the light doesnt blind your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed that the edge on which my hand was sliced is only sharp on that side, so, the other side isn&#x27;t sharp.</li>
            <li> painted but little do they know both get done in under an hour and last for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> There is also a 30 second opinion which I use for dark colors since they typically need a little extra dry time.</li>
            <li> : Do not cheap out on your gel polish, get the expensive stuff and the proper prep coat, top coat, and sealant, a little investment up front saves you a ton of money down the line!</li>
            <li> As a professional nail tech this was a very unsatisfactory experience with both of these parties that ended in an unresolved issue and a unhappy client.</li>
            <li> The middle joining point is very finicky and turns on and off randomly.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that this has 18 LED&#x27;s inside, it is not nearly as fast as the instructions claim.  </li>
            <li> It cures gel polish in 30 seconds and have 3 pre-set timers (5 sec, 20 seconds and 30 seconds).  </li>
            <li> a+  expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> I also purchased the basic kit along with a few colors.  </li>
            <li> We are from Canada, and it is even harder to find LED Gel there.  </li>
            <li> have the absolute worse customer service I have ever seen in my life.</li>
            <li> i always cure 30 sec anyways</li>
            <li> I don’t mind just taking the paint off that one and redoing it since it only takes me a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less worry about long exposure to UV rays.</li>
            <li> I was using a non brand name UV lamp previously and it worked, but was taking way too long to cure.  </li>
            <li> With gelish but also other products.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you how it works with other brands, but with gelish polish</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews I have to comment on them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had uv lamps and other led lamps and none work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this machince due to the price, however this machine works just like in the salon.  </li>
            <li> Also it does feel warmer than other lights, not hot or heat spikes but</li>
            <li> gel polish says that don&#x27;t care in other lights.</li>
            <li> with that in mind..be sure to not have any bubbles in your gel because this bad boy cures in seconds and will leave you with sharp little popped bubbles</li>
            <li> it is your fault for why it is broken and they will NOT send you a new one.</li>
            <li> I use it every week and a half roughly</li>
            <li> and I found out the hard way that nail harmony does not honor the warranty from third party vendors.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the power cord comes in two portions.</li>
            <li> I have noticed when I do the base I feel heat spikes on my nails, but I don&#x27;t when I get to the polish and top coat.</li>
            <li> Dont forget to buy your top and base coats (like I did).  </li>
            <li> and i dont need to see it count down each.  </li>
            <li> After a few months of using this LED light (gelish product) it started burning my fingers really bad to the point where I did NOT want to use it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you can afford the initial purchase, buy it!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s one hour and a half shaved off her day.  </li>
            <li> Cut my shellac time in half from using uv bulb.  </li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s been a year and a half</li>
            <li> far less the 10 second timer which is useless!  </li>
            <li> From start to finish doing my nails with pampering myself a little on the way, my nails are done in 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricy</li>
            <li> not very many reviews</li>
            <li> Had a little trouble getting started, but figured it out.</li>
            <li> It will turn on, but it takes a few times putting the hand in and out.</li>
            <li> but with each gel manicure running $25-50 depending on where you get it done this will pay for itself in a few months.</li>
            <li> Because I use a lot everyday.</li>
            <li> I just got mine about a few weeks ago from beautyland4u.  </li>
            <li> I have a few friends at work who get gel manicures every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have a few friends at work who get gel manicures every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It pays for its self in just a few times.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Nails done in less than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> and if I do mess up a nail, it takes 5 minutes to fix at home!  </li>
            <li> It automatically turns on when you insert your hand, and cures dark colors in THIRTY seconds, lighter 20 and basecoat FIVE seconds!!</li>
            <li> Once I sent it, they tested it out, and if they can not find anything wrong with it, they will send you your old broken product back, which is still broken and burning your fingers.</li>
            <li> (toes usually closer to 4 weeks).</li>
            <li> Usually don&#x27;t do reviews</li>
            <li> I dont usually write reviews, but I had to pass my experience on.</li>
            <li> but hey no more $100.00 pedi and Mani gel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but all fingers is covered still.</li>
            <li> But I am past that Amazon return date.</li>
            <li> No more trips &amp; time wasted at the salon!</li>
            <li> Anyone who has small kids should buy one of these.</li>
            <li> Having issues with the process of gel nails despite being very clear on how to do it, suspect maybe it is an issue with the Gelish base coat bought from a 3rd party seller, can&#x27;t spread it thin for the life of me and it almost has clumps...</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes that is would speed up my hard gel and gel polish services for my clients.</li>
            <li> Of course it was too late to return it through the Amazon seller, and when I contacted Gelish, they would not honor the warranty for a product bought through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> use it at least once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I think it’s ridiculous that they wouldn&#x27;t honor it.</li>
            <li> I’m so mad that I waited so long to buy it.</li>
            <li> I am so mad at myself that I waited so long to buy it!</li>
            <li> I have not had this for very long and I am very disappointed it is not working properly.</li>
            <li> searching Amazon, I was shocked to find it for only $200!</li>
            <li> Well im always careful not to apply the polish thick anyways because it makes it look bad and my nails arent damaged, so i figured id give it a try.  </li>
            <li> My nails were really weak from pregnancy and they kept breaking off.</li>
            <li> Dried in the time promised, no complaints!!!</li>
            <li> So try to put thin layers on and cure them.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> i wouldnt worry about it if you paint on thin applications.  </li>
            <li> If you apply thin layers, 20 to 30 seconds is all you need (use 30 seconds for darker shades).</li>
            <li> As stated by the previous reviewer, mine also came with no manual, which greatly disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I could tell it was brand-new a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I literally THANK GOD that the cut is where it is because I have nerve damage from this severe cut, and had it been somewhere else, I could be damaged so badly that I would be unable to do nails any longer.</li>
            <li> SO EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> and it is very expensive</li>
            <li> They said that even though it is still under warranty, I had to pay for shipping to send it to them, that&#x27;s bad customer service.  </li>

            <li> I started getting Gel manicures before my wedding, as I wanted nice nails without having to use acrylic.  After the wedding, I had gotten so used to having nice nails, I wanted my own light.  I found this one for what I thought was a crazy price here on amazon, but at a national beauty supply chain, they charge the same amount for an &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; machine, so I figured I may as well get the same one my manicurist uses, so I am familiar with it, and know that it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times, and only had problems due to a few inferior gel polish brands I&#x27;ve tried, the light has worked well every time, every manicure has been fully cured.</li>
            <li> The power cord is not working. I always have to move it to make it work, and it takes forever sometimes! SO EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> Very Happy, Works perfectly! With gelish but also other products.</li>
            <li> Saving big time doing own nails in home, and quick!  LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Avoid messing up nails as with regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this!  Speeds up the manicure quite a bit. Works great!</li>
            <li> Bought four of these for my 4 daughters. They have used them extensively in the last 2 weeks and were thrilled at the wonderful job they did. The higher wattage (light output at 18 W) worked much quicker than other lower wattage devices they have used and although they noted it was warm inside the light when they had their hands inside it was never uncomfortable. Hope they last a long time.</li>
            <li> After using an old lamp this is like heaven and is worth the extra money, your whole hand fits and is done in lightning fast speed</li>
            <li> perfect product, great delivery time,</li>
            <li> I love this light. I saw it in my local salon and I decided to buy one for myself. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Item as promised! Thank yoU!</li>
            <li> As stated by the previous reviewer, mine also came with no manual, which greatly disappointed me. I have only used the lamp once so far and it worked well -- it&#x27;s great to have such a short curing time!  But $300 is a lot of money and I would like the manual :-(</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter. She said it is as good as any she has used at a high end salon.</li>
            <li> Fabulous light! Works quick.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter and she loves it!  It was exactly what she wanted!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. It&#x27;s exactly the same model used at the nail salon she USED to go to, this saves her quite a bit of money each month. Protip: Do not cheap out on your gel polish, get the expensive stuff and the proper prep coat, top coat, and sealant, a little investment up front saves you a ton of money down the line!</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that this has 18 LED&#x27;s inside, it is not nearly as fast as the instructions claim.  As a matter of fact everything takes about 3 times as long as the instructions claim.  If it says 1 minute - THAT ACTUALLY MEANS 3 MINUTES!!!!  10 seconds means 30 seconds!  But very easy to use as the 30 sec timer resets itself when I remove my hand and put it right back in, though it would be much easier if it came with longer timers than 30 seconds, as 30 seconds is not long enough to do anything it claims, far less the 10 second timer which is useless!  But once I got the times correct, it works great and I never have to go back to a nail salon that reeks of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Works amazing and great quality!!</li>
            <li> Best LED light we&#x27;ve used! So worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price...great product</li>
            <li> this is the best gel machine ever, my clients really love the fact that there nails are dry in 30 seconds and they dont have to wait all day for there nails to dry</li>
            <li> Thank you for item is working ok</li>
            <li> I would be able to give this a 5 star review except that after 10 months of use, the automatic on/off quit working. Of course it was too late to return it through the Amazon seller, and when I contacted Gelish, they would not honor the warranty for a product bought through Amazon.  It is time to buy another, and I definitely would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is just awesome its cheaper then every where else and works amazing! I would highly recommend it to any one.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this light!  I previously had the smaller Gelish Pro-45 and upgraded to this.  This is a very well made  product and I can feel the heat when curing.  It is not uncomfortable, and I feel like I am getting a better cure on my gel polish than with the Pro-45.  It cures my gels very quickly, although I still double cure with dark colors.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Dries all five fingers at once, saves me time, and dries super fast and evenly. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other lamps and this is by far the best one for your gel polish nails.</li>
            <li> It does just what it says it will do. It&#x27;s so much better than my UV light, saves so much time.</li>
            <li> The LED lamp is great in theory.  It cures gel polish in 30 seconds and have 3 pre-set timers (5 sec, 20 seconds and 30 seconds).  However, when I received my shipment, my lamp did not have a manual.  I used it once and stored it in the box until the next usage.  My pre-set timers have since adjusted to 60 seconds, 120 seconds and 180 seconds and I am unsure as to how to reset the lamp to its factory settings.  As for the lamp itself, it works wonderfully at curing my shellac/gelish polish, but for the near $300 price tag, I would at least expect a user&#x27;s manual.  Disappointing!</li>
            <li> a+  expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes that is would speed up my hard gel and gel polish services for my clients. What I have discovered is that it doesn&#x27;t fully cure all products, and I still use the 36 Watt light to cure many of my products. It is helpful, but not what I had hoped for.  The reason I say be careful is this: the bottom is magnetic, so it comes off easily, and the unit is made of metal, some of the edges are very sharp. Once when I was trying to fit the bottom piece on correctly, my hand slipped and the edge sliced the side of my hand where my pinky attaches to my palm almost to the bone! I literally THANK GOD that the cut is where it is because I have nerve damage from this severe cut, and had it been somewhere else, I could be damaged so badly that I would be unable to do nails any longer. I noticed that the edge on which my hand was sliced is only sharp on that side, so, the other side isn&#x27;t sharp. Obviously is is a manufacturer defect. I just don&#x27;t know how may units are defected like this, so I just want to warn my fellow nail techs out there.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to do my own gels at home....it is so simple to use and so fast!  I also purchased the basic kit along with a few colors.  I am excited about the amount of money I am going to save and if I do mess up a nail, it takes 5 minutes to fix at home!  I would highly recommend if you don&#x27;t mind doing your own nails and if, like me, going to the salon is more of a hassle because you feel that you don&#x27;t ever have the time.</li>
            <li> I have been using the light for about 8 months, and I absolutely love it!  I use 30 seconds between coats, and it works fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Tips for success:&lt;br /&gt;* Be sure to soak your nails for several minutes prior to applying the polish.  A couple of times, I did not soak my nails and the polish pealed off within a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;* There were some complaints about it being too hot.  This did happen to me once.  When I looked at my hand, I realized that the hot spot was where I accidentally got nail polish on the skin.  As long as I am sure not be be sloppy, all is well.&lt;br /&gt;* The nail polish removes easily with acetone nail polish remover.  Just put some remover on a cotton ball and wrap the top of the finger in a piece of foil for about 10 minutes.  It comes right off!&lt;br /&gt;* I purchased alcohol prep pads from Walgreens.  I use one of the pads to wipe off my nails after the final coat.  It works great at a much better cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.  Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> This lamp is amazing. The LED is really quick. 5 seconds for the base coat and 20 for the rest. There is also a 30 second opinion which I use for dark colors since they typically need a little extra dry time. This is the best lamp on the market right now. It retails for $500 at some cosmetology stores. Amazon&#x27;s price was $219. You can&#x27;t beat that! The lamp can be used with any gel polish that used LED to cure. I have been been using Harmony Gelish polish and have not had and lifting or chipping at all. I love their polish. I do know that Essie just came out with a gel polish that uses LED to cure and I will be trying it next.</li>
            <li> I had been using a cheaper 18watt model. Finally decided that I should invest in a better quality lamp. I&#x27;ve been using this one for some time now with no issues at all. I do a lot of gel manicures and really love that the led sets each layer in 30 seconds or less. Makes my job much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an at home gelish user for 3.5 years and started with a standard uv light. Since having 2 kids in that time I needed efficiency. This was WELL worth the investment. To the amazement of many I always have my nails and toenails painted but little do they know both get done in under an hour and last for 2 weeks (toes usually closer to 4 weeks). I should&#x27;ve bought this sooner!</li>
            <li> doing my own gel nails now....OMG, I love this little LED light!!!  worth the price... I believe I&#x27;ll recoup my investment in about 4 gel manicures.</li>
            <li> Usually don&#x27;t do reviews but, figured I should..... I was concerned purchasing this with the negative reviews and the high price tag.. glad I went for it anyway! Package arrived in no time! Had to try it one it got here, not disappointed what so ever. Dried in the time promised, no complaints!!!</li>
            <li> I am most happy with this item. It works great.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at least once every two weeks. My nails are strong and beautiful for a fraction of the salon price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now.  At first, the sensor worked right a way.  Now, it is spotty.  It will turn on, but it takes a few times putting the hand in and out.</li>
            <li> This is oe of the best investments I have ever made, I bought this because i want to inlcude gelish Nails on my makeup services, so long so good. I just Love how quick it works.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough about this product. I did a lot of research before purchasing a nail light, and it has lived up to its great reviews. The auto-on works really well, and the size and bulb placement allows for a whole-hand/foot cure. I&#x27;ve only had it since May and I don&#x27;t use it in a professional salon (just at home), but I LOVE it so far.</li>
            <li> Awesome, fast powerful and I love it!</li>
            <li> If you get your nails done with gel at any salon, you will not be disappointed with this product. It is EASIER than painting your nails with regular polish! And since you get them done at the salon you already know the process. Seriously, if you can afford the initial purchase, buy it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this, it&#x27;s awesome and works great!!! It&#x27;s pricey but so worth it. Never paying a nail salon again.</li>
            <li> Helps speed up my self manicures, was using a uv light. Yes, if nails are thin you do feel a &amp;#34;twinge&amp;#34; under the light.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my cosmetologist daughter.  She loves it.  It dries quickly and cuts down each manicure by 15 minutes!  Multiply that by 6 a day and that&#x27;s one hour and a half shaved off her day.  Came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> The way the light comes on, activated immediately when you put your fingers inside is just fantastic.  I can barely squeeze both hands in together (interlaced, one on top of the other), but that is ok, because I like that it is so compact.  It&#x27;s easy to pick up and carry and put up on the shelf when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer buttons on the back to adjust depending on which gel product your using are clear and simple to use.  In short, there is not a single think I can think of to improve this.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! This LED light is incredible!!! I love that it is super fast and you don&#x27;t have to press any buttons. Just put your hand in and it starts. This also helps when doing a &amp;#34;flash dry&amp;#34; because as soon as you pull your hand out, it turns off. My old unit would stay on until the set time ran out. Also, this LED light fixed a problem that I was having when taking off the tacky layer. I would always have dull matte spots here and there on my top coat. But not anymore!!! This baby makes my nails super shiny all over!!!  If your in the market for a new LED light, I highly recommend this one!!!  It&#x27;s not cheap, but it is so worth it!!!  ;)</li>
            <li> I heard about this from a girlfriend that does nails. She loves all Gelish products and highly recommended this one. I use to do nails years ago, but now just do my own &amp; few others. This is a great fast, easy curing machine. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a good light, very clean and looks great, however, it will NOT cure 99% of UV Gel or Gel Polish out there.  The LED Gel is the only product that will cure under this light, and my wife found out the hard way.  We are from Canada, and it is even harder to find LED Gel there.  Hopefully within a year or two, LED Gel will be more accessible.  Other than that, it is definitely a great light, though I still feel the price is too high considering there isn&#x27;t much product that will work with it.</li>
            <li> I did not have any problems with this item. It works perfectly as described and is a very stylish piece. Been using it for 2+ months now and haven&#x27;t had any issues whatsoever with my model. Cures in seconds! Cuts manicure time down to a fraction of what it was, this is my personal machine I do not use it in a salon.</li>
            <li> Very happy it arrived in 7 to 10 working days it is a star buy if you do gelish nails then you need this lamp</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! Love the timer and auto on and off!</li>
            <li> Th is product is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to gel nails, and love using this led. So far I&#x27;ve only tried using it with gelish polish. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how it works with other brands, but with gelish polish I do 5 seconds on the base, 30 seconds on the color polish, and 20 seconds on the top coat. Works perfectly. You can only do 1 hand or foot at a time comfortably.  I did a little research and found this is supposed to be one of the best led lights. I love that it takes lest time than UV. I have noticed when I do the base I feel heat spikes on my nails, but I don&#x27;t when I get to the polish and top coat.</li>
            <li> This is a well-made, excellent quality LED nail lamp.  I like the timed settings for the different layers used in producing gel nails, and even though one&#x27;s nails feel hot when under the lamp, it only lasts a very short time and certainly isn&#x27;t too uncomfortable.  This is a nice looking, durable lamp that comes with a very well written manual.  I am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> very good A++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> I use this at home.  So much faster than the UV lamp.  I do cure 60 seconds instead of 30.  I don&#x27;t seem to get the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; I would occasionally get with the UV lamp.  Looking forward to NOT having to change bulbs every 4 months or so.  Make sure you splay your fingers out during curing or else reflectors don&#x27;t cure the edges well.  Very happy with lamp, glad I spent the extra $.  Great time saver.  It takes longer to paint the nail than cure it!</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that I am a licensed nail tech and I am always adding new lights to my additions. I purchased this one here because of the pricing. After reading the reviews I was unsure but went ahead with the purchase of it. I love this light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is easy to set up and clean. The cord on it is very long which makes for an easy set up. Especially if you need to have some length between the outlet and your nail table. It&#x27;s lightweight so that you can easily transport it if you need to. The size of the light is good and can fit any hand size. If you want to use the light for a pedicure you can remove the bottom plate so a foot can easily slide in. The plate is easy to clean and clips back on easily with magnets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cure time is set with 10, 20, and 30 secs and you can either use the motion sensor or turn it off and manually press the time buttons on your own. Obviously the product works great with the Gelish line of gel polishes. However, it also works great with other product lines that can cure in an LED light vs a UV light. I forewarn that you need to know how the other product lines cure if you plan on using it with this light. There are a total of of 18 lights in there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual unit is very pretty to look at. It is pearlized and has a great door that slides down so the light does not blind your client. If you get a product on there, it&#x27;s easy to wipe off and does not stain. If you&#x27;re looking for a great LED light, I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this light!! I really debated buying this seeing as it is just for my own home use and it is very expensive but I am soo glad I bought it! I love that it turns on automatically when you put your hand on and I love that it has the different timer settings. The eye guard is great too. It is big enough to do a whole hand. There is also a rubber like pad on top that is supposed to be a rest for your clients. I could go without it but its there if you like that.</li>
            <li> This is the exact light my nail tech uses in FL.  I know it will last me a lifetime and it&#x27;s so easy to do toes too.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery than expected the unit did not look new and I say this because the packaging was all opened and bent and the electric cords not tied together with anything. It just Like somebody bought it took it out and put it back. The last one I ordered was not like this I could tell it was brand-new a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Much faster than the UV lights.</li>
            <li> In love with this machine!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I went so long without it. Great product. Many features.Excellent price. Fast reliable shipping.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever no more making appointments , do my nails at ease anytime of the day at little cost to me. Save time and money, what more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> Works fast and the light shield is A great feature.</li>
            <li> Good price and really nice..</li>
            <li> Love my new light. Works fantastic!! I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my new light. I have been doing my own gel manicures for 2 years now and I am so glad finally spent the extra money for this product. It dries my nails quickly and I love how the light turns on by it self when I slide my hand into the dryer. Very light weight and portable. The only negative thing was the delivery time, when I first put in my order it gave me a 2 day shipping time, it jumped to a week the next day. Then it gave me a 2 week time frame. Then after about 5 days I had a notice on my door something had attempted to be delivered. I had to drive down to the post office to pick it up the next. Not to happy about that but it was worth it for this awesome dryer.</li>
            <li> This thing saves me money, I cannot complain...at home gorgeous gel manicures with a PERFECT machine, I am happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great light. With some people it is very warm but most like that they can get the gel polish done in seconds and not minutes .</li>
            <li> I finally took the plunge and purchased this LED light so that I could do my nails at home.  It has easily paid for itself already.  Let me preface this with the fact that I am not amazing at doing nails (especially trying to paint my dominant hand) but using this with the gelish nail polishes makes for a professional looking manicure.  I actually find it pretty easy to do french manicures which I love at home.  The ability to use nail polish to fix errors after you have cured the lower layers of polish is the best thing ever and the fact that after the polish has been set with the light you can&#x27;t mess it up... awesome!  I know it is an investment but with each gel manicure running $25-50 depending on where you get it done this will pay for itself in a few months.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Best one I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I love this lamp. It&#x27;s the perfect size and design. Reading the other reviews I have to comment on them. It does not come with a manual but The directions of use are right on the box. It tells you all the cure times etc. it&#x27;s so easy to do if you&#x27;ve gotten your nails done in the salon you should already know how to use the lamp. Also I noticed if I put to much gel polish on a nail then yes it will burn especially if it drips down to the skin. So try to put thin layers on and cure them.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the lamp is super fast and just excellent.</li>
            <li> i waste my money in few machines before i decide this is my next one, Is expensive but is worth it , i do my own nails so i safe doing it at home and this one is so fast , the most time is with dark colors 30 seconds, my other one is about 5 minutes and believe me in theory 5 minutes is not that much but when you have your hands tide for 5 minutes it seems an eternity</li>
            <li> Professional model.  Fast as the one Nail Salons use.  I luv it.</li>
            <li> I just received my LED light today and I am in LOVE with it! I dont usually write reviews, but I had to pass my experience on. I&#x27;ve been a lic. manicurist for 16 years and have never seen anything as remarkable and FAST! with that in mind..be sure to not have any bubbles in your gel because this bad boy cures in seconds and will leave you with sharp little popped bubbles</li>
            <li> It works perfect with the Gelish brand. Haven&#x27;t try with others but I really like how it works.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. I am glad I spent the extra money on the LED light. I was able to do 2 gel manicures and a gel pedicure in one hour with this!</li>
            <li> I purchased my light 9 months ago for $292. My light no longer works. Hand &amp; nails harmony makes gelish products.&lt;br /&gt;They have the absolute worse customer service I have ever seen in my life. They will not exchange, repair, or return my light. That&#x27;s why I always use amazon, they have the best customer service ever!</li>
            <li> Cures all 5 fingers at one time in only 30 secs! Love the auto on and count down function  :)</li>
            <li> Very refreshing to find a product that does exactly what it says it is going to do!  Quick, easy, highly functional, impressed!</li>
            <li> I love love love this machine! I got rid of my 36 Watt UV light and I haven’t looked back. This thing is super fast. I also had instructions in my box</li>
            <li> Love this light weight lamp! And finally, no curing for 2-4 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The wait is over girls....literally! Thirty seconds to cure each coat and your job is done!&lt;br /&gt;If you have been holding off on attempting to do your own manicure, you have great timing!!&lt;br /&gt;The UV lamps required longer curing times, where the LED is super fast.&lt;br /&gt;Wait no longer - this lamp will pay for itself in no time -- consider all those $40 manicures!!</li>
            <li> Bought this system after a dermatologist told my friend that people are getting cancer on their nails using the UV lamps.  LED is the way to go.  This system is wonderful.  Five seconds for base coat.  Thirty seconds for each coat and the same for the top coat.  And there you have it.  Would not go back to the UV lamp ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing is...you do all five fingers at once.  Love love love this machine.</li>
            <li> my wife absolutely loves this product and it works great in drying her nails. she use to have to old ones that dry nails in 2-3mins and i know now that sounds like for ever till i got her this for mothers day gift and she loves it. this dries her nails in 10-20secs. recommend.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use.  Will do both hands at once. Thumbs separately. Less worry about long exposure to UV rays.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware!!!!  This light only cures Gelish Polish which Gelish sells.  The seller does not state this in the description and will not return my money.  I use many different types of color gels and Gel Builder products. There is nothing in their description to state this, and now this company will not return my money.  They say its for sanitary reasons, however their description says it can be fully sanitised.  Don&#x27;t Buy It, unless you only use Gelish, and you dont care about a return policy if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love this LED light.  Nails look just like I came from a salon!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this lamp and I was not disappointed. It operates exactly as described and delivers excellent results.</li>
            <li> I lovvveeee this lamp. It is the same one that one of my local nail salons uses for Gel Manicures.</li>
            <li> How many years for warranty?  Because I use a lot everyday. I&#x27;m nail tech.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  It dries your nails within 30 seconds and there is no second guessing if they are really dry.  From start to finish doing my nails with pampering myself a little on the way, my nails are done in 45 minutes.  The entire process reminds me of going to the salon but saving money to boot.  My plan is to pay myself every time I do my nails the same price I would be paying at the salon $40.00.. which will allow me to pay myself back within several months and at the end will allow me to save money.</li>
            <li> I got this product a few days ago so far it works great. However, the lift to protect the eyes had polish that ran underneath the lid, so this dryer had been used &amp; returned for whatever reason. It works good so far. Just hope it last as long as they say.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. Very happy with the fast cure time. I used hellish product, at the shop I used to get my nails done they use opi so I&#x27;m sure it will cure the same. Professional look at home ;) Hint I do have a Cosmetology license so I did not need instructions but what I seen was pretty easy to understand.... You will need to research how to apply gel nails as you do have to start with a chalky clean  nail bed. It is a little pricy but hey no more $100.00 pedi and Mani gel nails....I will save money in the long run ;)</li>
            <li> I finally took the leap and spent the money to get this lamp and I&#x27;m not disappointed. I&#x27;ve had uv lamps and other led lamps and none work as well as this one. If you are worried about the money, don&#x27;t be! It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Awesome lamp, cures your gel nails lightening fast and I am all about saving time. Having issues with the process of gel nails despite being very clear on how to do it, suspect maybe it is an issue with the Gelish base coat bought from a 3rd party seller, can&#x27;t spread it thin for the life of me and it almost has clumps...but I totally cannot complain about this lamp. It is great, everything I wanted, and thinking it should last forever and save me money once I figure out how to properly get the gel nails to look perfect and last as long as they should...</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it. Great product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> After a few months of using this LED light (gelish product) it started burning my fingers really bad to the point where I did NOT want to use it. Worst customer service ever. They said that even though it is still under warranty, I had to pay for shipping to send it to them, that&#x27;s bad customer service.  Once I sent it, they tested it out, and if they can not find anything wrong with it, they will send you your old broken product back, which is still broken and burning your fingers. I called them before I bought their products, they LIED to me, they said \\&quot;if you buy from an authorized dealer, we will take care of you at no cost to you.\\&quot; NOPE they LIED they did NOT help me out and I&#x27;m left with a broken product that burns me and a whole in my wallet.</li>
            <li> Love this lamp.  I just got mine about a few weeks ago from beautyland4u.  it came in original packaging and did come with some instructional papers.  i was a little scared to purchase at first because of the high price and not very many reviews but I really wanted a reliable led lamp.  I was using a non brand name UV lamp previously and it worked, but was taking way too long to cure.  Well i did my research on this gelish 18g lamp prior to buying and the main issues i read about it were that some people felt heat spikes when curing.  I read that it can be caused when polish is applied too thick or if your nails are very damaged.  Well im always careful not to apply the polish thick anyways because it makes it look bad and my nails arent damaged, so i figured id give it a try.  Well ive used this lamp on myself and my 2 nieces already and none of us have had any issues with heat spikes, so i wouldnt worry about it if you paint on thin applications.  Ive also done rockstar nails with the martha stewart glitter sandwiched between the gelish and its worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is pretty compact.  A lot smaller than my old UV lamp but it is still big enough for your whole hand or foot.  Love the size, its perfect.  The bottom piece is magnetic.  You can easily pull it off to clean the bottom piece or you can remove it and place it on top of the foot for a pedi.  very convenient.  the device is made more for a salon, bc the top part is padded for the client to rest their hand and the timer is on the back of it.  it doesnt bother me much bc since its motion activated i just stick my hand in and it turns off automatically when the time is up.  i always cure 30 sec anyways so i just set it to 30 when i begin and i dont need to see it count down each.  it beeps each time it begins and it ends.  its kind of like a microwave.  the cord is long enough that i dont need to use an extension like i did with my old uv lamp.  the cover moves up and down so that the light doesnt blind your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall i love this lamp and i am very happy with my purchase.  it is worth it..  the only thing i would like to change about this device is I wish it had an on and off switch.  you have to unplug it each time to turn it totally off.  the lamp inside is motion activiated and will turn off automatically after the set time, but the count down screen on the back of it stays on until its unplugged.  Not a big issue but it would be nice to be able to just switch the power off.  If you are thinking about getting this lamp, id go for it.  Ive read about people who bought led lamps from china for still over a hundred just to have them break after a month.  I would rather pay a little more to get the brand name lamp that is reliable.  i love love love love my new lamp. :)esnt blind your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall i love this lamp and i am very happy with my purchase.  it is worth it..  the only thing i would like to change about this device is I wish it had an on and off switch.  you have to unplug it each time to turn it totally off.  the lamp inside is motion activiated and will turn off automatically after the set time, but the count down screen on the back of it stays on until its unplugged.

            <li> I was hesitant to buy this machince due to the price, however this machine works just like in the salon.  Its compact and quiet.  The machince comes on automatically when you stick your hand in and shuts off when you remove your hand.  Dont forget to buy your top and base coats (like I did).  It still works without them but for a salon finish you should buy them.  My nails look amazing, I will probablly never have to go back to the salon again unless I need my cuticles trimmed.  It works buy it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after spending almost $200 dollars on my nails at Xmas time!! My nail tech told me these usually run around $350-400, but that they are by far the best gel lamp (and the fastest) you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;Upon searching Amazon, I was shocked to find it for only $200! That was all the convincing I needed. I bought it and have been using it now for a month and I absolutely LOVE it!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my decision to invest in a machine that will save me thousands of dollars over the next ten years&#x27;!! The best part is, (in addition to saving $1,200 a year on nail salons), I will never have to replace the bulbs since they are lifetime warranty!!&lt;br /&gt; Plus the gel dries in 30 seconds flat! Overall.... I would recommend this machine to anyone who is considering doing there own nails from home. Great investment and worth EVERY penny!!</li>
            <li> Love the auto sensor that turns the light off and on when you put your nails under the light. Love the present times are perfect for gelish polishes. Nice size with plenty of room for hand &amp; foot. Highly recommend this light. So glad I purchased this light.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and does an excellent job of curing in 5-30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this light, its so fast and its nice to do all 5 fingers at once... Also it does feel warmer than other lights, not hot or heat spikes but just warmer. i love it so much i would suggest it to anyone who goes LED gels. Its compact and fits where i store my polishes too!</li>
            <li> Great best lamp ever!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this. I am not a nail professional and getting it at a DEEP discount on Amazon made for a fantastic Christmas present to myself. I do my nails along with nails of friends and family on a regular basis and have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! My manicures have never been so fast! Plus the box it comes in has a handle on it so its perfect for when I pack my stuff up to travel to friends houses to do their nails.</li>
            <li> My first experience with this LED curing device was @ a salon who also gave me one of the best, longest lasting gel manicure&#x27;s I&#x27;ve gotten. Huge bonus: lightening fast. It is the fastest machine out there and best most thought out designed IMHO too. It automatically turns on when you insert your hand, and cures dark colors in THIRTY seconds, lighter 20 and basecoat FIVE seconds!! Even better NO HARMFUL UV to keep my hands skin looking young as long as possible. A big bonus to me having protected my skin from the sun&#x27;s premature aging rays since my teens. The only drawback, the quick time it now takes makes me to do a gel manicure makes me do them more than the every 2 weeks it beautifuly, easily lasts. I DON&#x27;T ever want to go to a salon when I&#x27;m \\&quot;treating\\&quot; myself that doesn&#x27;t use one of these now!</li>
            <li> This product is a great product, but I would not buy from this seller again or buy something this expensive from a third party.  I&#x27;m a professional nail tech and I found out the hard way that nail harmony does not honor the warranty from third party vendors.  My lamp was having sensor issues just as it was approaching the one year mark from date of purchase.  Beauty Land 4 U was contacted immediately.  They were prompt with their responses but had no solution, they wanted me to send them my lamp for them to look  at without sending me any replacement in the interm.  When I contacted Nail Harmony they were unwilling to work with me and unapologetic about there policies and offered no assistance.  As a professional nail tech this was a very unsatisfactory experience with both of these parties that ended in an unresolved issue and a unhappy client.</li>
            <li> This machine is great. It work very well, nice shape, my wife love it, tell co-work about it, they love it then they bought some.</li>
            <li> Like I have read this light is the mother of all LED lights. I would recommend it if you are going to use it a lot, for a long time, or professional use. I just got it in the mail yesterday and I love it!!</li>
            <li> It is just amazing. I finish the job more quickly with this lamp than a UV lamp. It&#x27;s small but all fingers is covered still. It is very comfortabel.</li>
            <li> Love it !!!! The speed in which nails are cured is awesome .&lt;br /&gt;I do my own nails as a cost saving measure &amp; although this light isn&#x27;t cheep it&#x27;s worth every penny in the time I save. Not to mention not exposing skin to UV light has to be a plus.</li>
            <li> Great machine!! Cut my shellac time in half from using uv bulb.  Only thing is make sure you hear the 3 beeping instead one one beep, because sometime customer move their hand and the sensor reset the timer.</li>
            <li> I got this lamp last christmas. Fast, even, reliable 5 finger cure. No thumb acrobatics as the LEDs are mounted on the sides also. If you apply thin layers, 20 to 30 seconds is all you need (use 30 seconds for darker shades). It self activates as soon as you stick your fingers in. This light also easily accommodates your pedis - love it.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and absolutely loved it and it worked perfectly. It even cared gel polish says that don&#x27;t care in other lights. I am a professional nail technician. But today at the end of February one of the sensors is not working. Which means when you&#x27;re drying the left hand the light will not turn on automatically. I have not had this for very long and I am very disappointed it is not working properly. But I am past that Amazon return date.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.  only used it once.  Fast and easy.  Had a little trouble getting started, but figured it out.</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
            <li> It makes Gel Manicures much quicker and dries them harder than standard UV. Gets a little warm while drying but its awesome.</li>
            <li> No more trips &amp; time wasted at the salon! This was a VERY worthwhile investment. Should have bit the bullet and purchased it long ago!</li>
            <li> Short in cord, have to play with it to get it to work! Cant afford to take the tme to send back!</li>
            <li> I got my LED lamp about two weeks ago. I cant believe it took me so long to get it if i knew how easy it was and how fast I would of bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> I finally bit the bullet and purchased this lamp.  It was a long running battle on whether I should spend the money.  I love it.  It is SO DARN FAST and fantastic.  It does a great job.  The lamp was shipped in a secure package, and came rather quickly.  I have had no issues with the lamp and can honestly say that I have no regrets!  What are you waiting for?? If you are battling with yourself, just do it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was so sick of spending money at nail salons. I have to admit this was the best purchase I have ever made for myself. I use this recreationally and have had mine for over a year and just love it. I have done friends nails as well as my children. Anyone who has small kids should buy one of these. My daughter never had patience to wait for paint to dry but with this we dont have to wait after they are done she can touch them. I learned to only put one coat on so that they don&#x27;t peel off easily for her. Anytime I have a special event I just pop this out and do my nails. I try to restrain myself from buying too many colors and really use up what I have. The only thing is I wish this machine had an on/off switch, but otherwise great product. Nails done in less than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel nails for 2 years. I originally wasn&#x27;t sure if I would enjoy doing my own or get good at it. So I bought the Thermal Spa UV light for around $50, I wasn&#x27;t ready to go all out and spend $200 for this. I went for a pedicure and noticed the salon uses this light and they said they love it. I figured if they like it and they are the true experts, I should probably get it. I am so mad at myself that I waited so long to buy it! After my first use I knew it was absolutely worth the money. Here’s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Fast: I am so excited with how fast I can do my nails now. It used to be a huge chore and I dreaded doing it. I would get all set up with a good TV show and do the tedious task of curing each coat for 2 minutes under the UV light. Now I can do my nails very fast, I cure the base for 5 seconds and each color and top coat for 30 seconds. Even though I am only doing one hand at a time versus both hands I’m still saving time. Instead of being an hour long ordeal, I can get my stuff out quickly and do my fingers or toes right before bed in about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-Sensor: It’s so nice just being able to stick my hand or foot in and have the light turn on automatically. I have to change the time on the back from 5 seconds to 30 seconds, but after that I’m done touching anything. This is a bonus that the cheaper models I was looking at don’t have.&lt;br /&gt;-Nail art: I never, ever did nail designs before. The thought of curing each coat for 2 minutes and then having to cure the designs for more time was just too much. I have a 1 year old and have a limited time for my nails. Now I absolutely don’t mind doing stripes, polka dots, hearts or flowers. If I’m doing a design where I have to be careful about two colors touching and bleeding into each other, it’s easy to cure one part quickly and then do the next part. It’s also easy to wipe a design off that I don’t like that hasn&#x27;t been cured because the paint under it is set. I am so adventurous now with my nail designs!&lt;br /&gt;-One hand at a time: I bought the other nail light because I wanted to do two hands at once. This messed me up more times than I can count. I wasn’t going to double the time it took me to do a manicure though by doing one hand at a time. Now since it’s so quick I love doing one hand at a time. Now I can really focus on the hand I’m working on and use the opposite hand to rub pain off the skin or pull off a stray piece of lint. I do all 5 fingers at once and they cure perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;-Fixing a nail: Again, because it’s so quick it’s so easy just to fix one nail. My dominant hand, pointer finger can start lifting before I’m ready to redo my nails. I don’t mind just taking the paint off that one and redoing it since it only takes me a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it’s a big price investment. I was very hesitant to spend this much. I finally told my husband it was going to be my birthday present to myself and he was off the hook. I’m so mad that I waited so long to buy it. My only issue is I’m nervous seeing that some reviewers had problems with the warranty. I think it’s ridiculous that they wouldn&#x27;t honor it. How is a consumer to know if Amazon is an authorized dealer or not? I would have no idea who I should or shouldn&#x27;t be buying the product through. It’s still their product no matter where you buy it! I am not going to deduct a star for this because I haven’t had a problem with my light (and hopefully won’t), but if I have problems with the unit and can’t get any help I will definitely come on here and update my review and rating. I&#x27;ve used this with Gelish, Gelaze, Orly, FingerPaints and Red Carpet and haven&#x27;t had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Dec 2016 - Well, it&#x27;s been a year and a half and this light is still amazing. I use it every week and a half roughly and it is working just as good as day 1. I always get compliments on my nails and have friends ask about doing their own at home. Iencourage them to spend the little extra up front to get this light. It is 100% worth the investment. I have a few friends at work who get gel manicures every 2 weeks. If they paid $30 each time it would be $780 a year! I have saved a massive amount of money doing my own (and I&#x27;ve rewatched all the Friends episodes on Netflix during my nail time!) Don&#x27;t doubt your decision, just save a little more up and get this. But... My best advice is to be patient with the process of doing your nails. Make sure to cap the end (put a little nail polish on the end of your nail) and clean up your skin and cuticles of any mistakes before curing! Have fun!to get this light.

            <li> This does all five nails in super fast times. (Between 5 and 30 seconds depending on the coat).  I haven&#x27;t had any problems as of yet and I have really cut down on the long manicure times when I used an LED for my gel polishes.</li>
            <li> My mom and I adore this. Super-fast, safer, and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This light is awesome. I am NOT a professional and do this at home to save money and change up colors more than what my budget allows at a salon. The packaging was great and the lamp was brand new with no signs of wear as others have reported. The best feature is the ability to put your hand in and have it automatically turn on. The shield that lowers and raises is a nice feature as well. I have rather larger hands and really can only do one hand at a time although other reviews have stated that they can get both hands in. It really doesn&#x27;t matter as the curing time is so fast and unlike the 1-3 minutes in the UV that it is not a problem at all. My only complaint was that the power cord comes in two portions. One plugs into the unit itself while the second attaches to the wall and they join in the middle by a three prong insert. The middle joining point is very finicky and turns on and off randomly. I have to angle it a certain way and make sure that the cord isn&#x27;t touched as it will turn it on and off. I&#x27;ve reached out to CC and they can only return the unit as it is from a private seller. Although they said I could return it or find a replacement cord for a partial refund, I wish this was built correctly considering the high price tag. All in all a great lamp and hopefully the problem only with the cord is limited and not a product defect.</li>
            <li> I love my Gelish 18G LED light.  I feel that it really cures my manicures every time vs my old 9w LED lamp which sometimes left my mani&#x27;s still gooey.  It does get a little hot under these lights, so be aware of that.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> If you into DIY gel polish, this lamp is amazing. Polish cures in 30 seconds!</li>
            <li> My nails were really weak from pregnancy and they kept breaking off. This was the perfect alternative to getting them done every other week. In 20 minutes I can have flawless nails that are stronger, and lasts until I peel them off. It pays for its self in just a few times.</li>
            <li> this is an awesome light for curing my CND polish is has a 5s 10s and a 30s button.  it also has a hood that lifts for easy hand insert and removal. You can also gently lift your hand inside the unit to reset the time for a second curing.</li>
            <li> After a few months of using this LED light (gelish product) this items electrical components stopped working and I could no longer use it. Worst customer service ever. They said that even though it is still under warranty, I had to pay for shipping to send it to them, that&#x27;s bad customer service.  Then they blame it on you for their defective product. They state it is your fault for why it is broken and they will NOT send you a new one. Do NOT buy waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Love! Small light that cures fast.  Worth the investment for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent ! Happy to have this for my own oersonal use !</li>
            <li> Pay for what you want to get everyone.&lt;br /&gt; I feel safer by using it. Quick dryer, I can paint the shellac 2hands done in 7&#x27; and it last for 3 weeks.</li>
