            <li> It arrived with the hairpin part half broken off.</li>
            <li> The item came which wasn&#x27;t broken or missing rhinestone.</li>
            <li> so I hope it&#x27;s durable for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Also the pin part does not hold, it&#x27;s too weak for the weight of the pin, it needs to be welded to something stronger.</li>
