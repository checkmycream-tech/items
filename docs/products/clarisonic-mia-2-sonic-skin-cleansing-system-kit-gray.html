            <li>this is great - they are for men (me) and women.  </li>
            <li>The mia works great...</li>
            <li>Good shaving equipment, fine creams and gels, dewrinkle stuff, a good nail trimmer, an excellent nose hair trimmer that doesn&#x27;t hurt etc etc.</li>

            <li>my skin, I am in love with it and it looks sooo good!</li>
            <li>Before applying the cleanser and using the Mia, wash your face with warm water.</li>
            <li>Run the Mia&#x27;s brush under warm water and then use it on your cleanser-covered face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Squirt the soap onto the brush head and work the soap into the bristols in circular motions before cleaning it under warm water.</li>
            <li>You can use your own products with it</li>
            <li>moisturize/cleanse with Thayers Alchohol-Free Toner Rose Petal Witch Hazel (just to get any dirt that I missed)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I kind of always wanted one...</li>
            <li>Makes washing my face fun!!!</li>
            <li>Now I use it lightly and it works amazingly!</li>
            <li>Make fun of me all you want, but my face feels great using moisturizer and way better with the clarisonic!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe what a great job it does, both with the Clairsonic gel cleanser, and more budget friendly cream cleansers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest: I didn&#x27;t see an overnight transformation, and was tempted to return the Mia 2 on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li>but I pounced on that real quick with some good ol&#x27; fashioned drugstore Clean n&#x27; Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve found I get better results when working the cleanser into my face rather than having the brush apply it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>But as others have said, it&#x27;s more than just a brush.</li>
            <li>My skin absorbs products much better.</li>

            <li>The packaging insists that this works better than if it rotated, but I&#x27;m inclined not to believe it.</li>
            <li>Plus its better than what</li>

            <li>Great product can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>St. Ives Even &amp; Bright which I use to gently exfoliate once a day in the morning.</li>
            <li>St. Ives Even &amp; Bright which I use to gently exfoliate once a day in the morning.</li>
            <li>Its not too much stuff or \\&quot;out of control\\&quot;, just really good stuff for the basics: shaving, trimming, cleaning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use in the shower and is easy to recharge.  </li>
            <li>dermatologist recommended this product and thinks it is a mighty wonder.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s debatable as to how effective this really is, since the comparisons they do compare the clarisonic to washing with your hands and no wash</li>
            <li>Traveling is simple, the battery life is great.</li>
            <li>My skin has never, in the history of me being alive, looked this good.</li>
            <li>Our whole family is using it and the best is it doesn&#x27;t take long to use each time</li>
            <li>Love this system so much!</li>
            <li>I was excited when I got it &amp; soon when on to the clarisonic website to register it &amp;</li>
            <li>The end result is a clean, glowing face.</li>
            <li>Once a week, gently clean the brush head with hand soap.</li>
            <li>It makes facial cleansing task easier, faster, more effective and</li>
            <li>Can be used with your own favorite facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if I can do the clarisonic my face is actually clean.</li>
            <li>I am glad I was able to get it from here because the website is completely sold out.</li>
            <li>I use; any sort of face cleaner works though it doesn&#x27;t have to be special.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going use that thing right now!</li>
            <li>makes your skin feel amazing and helps keep it clear.  </li>
            <li>I used my try and true</li>
            <li>I used my try and true</li>
            <li>I use it with a philosophy cleanser or something super mild.</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it for any man out there to cleanse his face.  </li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a long time.  </li>
            <li>really like being comfortable and clean</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I first got it and tried it</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I first got it and tried it</li>
            <li>It feels good and lets creams work: my face feels pretty clean after, but it can dry my face out depending on what face cleaner</li>
            <li>Having spent nearly 90 days with my Mia 2, I feel like I made a very wise decision by purchasing</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes on the Mia should be changed every couple months, but it isn&#x27;t a huge investment and can be purchased reasonably through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Overall, my face looks bright and youthful, even after nights I don&#x27;t get much</li>
            <li>Great price, use it everyday.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so much more clear and radiant.</li>
            <li>is that it really does get all my makeup off and it makes me spend more time washing my face and forces me to really take my time.</li>
            <li>I really feel like my face is clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad or anything, I like it, but I might save a large amount of money and get something comparable but cheaper.</li>
            <li>They used to be very large.</li>
            <li>Feels so soft and is so easy.</li>
            <li>Mia 2 is a smaller version of the original Mia and is easier to hold comfortably for both men and women.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much cleaner!</li>
            <li>overall am pleased.</li>
            <li>I did some research before making this purchase because there are so many similar products on the market.</li>
            <li>My pores are much smaller and my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>I broke my first one after repeated drops on the shower floor</li>
            <li>Now, thats assuming its used every day; I use it probably every other day at most, so I can go 6 months (6 months!)</li>
            <li>just kidding can&#x27;t use it while taking a dump because you need to add water for each face section, but it was too funny to delete).</li>
            <li>my girlfriend comment on it the first day.</li>
            <li>Okay, I bought this for my mother for Christmas, actually – my sister bought it and we split it</li>
            <li>sure enough when I was searching for the lot number there wasn&#x27;t one on the device or the box.</li>
            <li>I mean, if you’re going to make an effort to take care of your skin you better make sure the juice is worth the squeeze,</li>
            <li>(there was so many, I&#x27;m not joking, like easily extract 20 a day from my forehead and chin) and deal with bumps, redness, and uneven texture.  </li>
            <li>(there was so many, I&#x27;m not joking, like easily extract 20 a day from my forehead and chin) and deal with bumps, redness, and uneven texture.  </li>
            <li>For the first week I realized that I was applying too much pressure and damaging my skin.</li>
            <li>First off, its showerproof, as in REALLY showerproof.</li>
            <li>As a 32-year-old male living in the Midest, this was a product I never expected to review, let alone own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now exactly 6 months to the day since I got it, and last night the unit began making a buzzing sound by itself in the shower.  </li>
            <li>but I finally broke down and ordered one after my friend told me how great it was.</li>
            <li>I had large clogged blackhead like nothing I have ever seen all over my forehead and my chin.</li>
            <li>I had large clogged blackhead like nothing I have ever seen all over my forehead and my chin.</li>
            <li>I use my sonic right before bed, with a mild facial soap.</li>
            <li>has been using this for about four months now and it has made a huge improvement overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as satisfied as I thought I would be, having spent so much money on this product but it has made my skin smoother.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While my skin isn&#x27;t Hollywood level, after using the Mia 2 for nearly three months my face is smooth, soft and my skin color is very even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments about my complexion (a real confidence booster to hear my say my skin &amp;#34;almost glows&amp;#34; and</li>
            <li>My mother keeps hinting she wants one</li>
            <li>I really do believe in this thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I spent $150 for a vibrator for my face...</li>
            <li>I bought this one for my boyfriend and he really likes it would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>No tearing or nicks and the shave is soooo much nicer.</li>
            <li>If you put any sort of moisturizer or anything on, you can really feel it soak in.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference in how you look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scrubs aren&#x27;t the same and in the long run this is more economical.  </li>
            <li>Once my Purity ran out, I used other cleansers to see if it would get better.</li>
            <li>Any guy who is interacts with many people either at work or socially should try this product; my guess is that our stories will be similar.</li>
            <li>It took nearly two months of using the device before I really started to notice a positive difference of using the device on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also owned a traditional full sized Mia for about five years.</li>
            <li>Unlike most grooming devices which break or need to have expensive refills, the clarisonic is sealed, backed by a good warranty, and only needs a head replacement every 3 months.</li>
            <li>This is typically sold for close to $200 in stores, so I love this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My skin heals very quickly if I cut myself shaving, and razor burn is pretty much a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>I was using the deep pore scrub and then when my face started to break out more, I switched to the regular, than to the sensitive scrub.</li>
            <li>think pretty much every guy could use one, but I will get into that later.</li>
            <li>After returning home from the holidays I decided I had to get one for myself for a few reasons, it was the easiest way to clean my face, it takes no time at all (literally 2 mins), and nothing I had used previously had worked as effective.</li>
            <li>, the skin on my face was good, but not great.</li>
            <li>Hardly a scientific test, but I think the Mia removed a lot of dead skin and sort of let the cream attack the blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;Since then his skin is looking very good.</li>
            <li>This device has taken my skin to a new level.</li>
            <li>The clarisonic took it a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s fabulous and it&#x27;s making my skin look years younger.</li>
            <li>only real negatives with the Mia 2 are that it takes about 12 hours to fully recharge, $150 is not a drop in the bucket, and results don&#x27;t appear immediately — which can be discouraging to new users.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin has never been this clear before in my.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, try to get a moisturizer that is fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I immediately saw a difference in how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li>You really must use a light hand when washing, my face got a little sore when I first started using this because I was so used to scrubbing with a heavy hand.</li>
            <li>Its a much better value than anything are by Gillette or any of those other companies, which is why I left them so long ago...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen too many &amp;#34;how-to&amp;#34; guides for men using a Mia — especially for those needing the basics — so here&#x27;s a few personal observations that may help if you&#x27;re a guy who is new to facial skin care and Clarisonic (like I</li>
            <li>Gently pat the brush dry on a towel after use.</li>
            <li>Initially he developed some red lumps while using this, but they disappeared after about a week.</li>
            <li>and I was frequently getting deep pimples for about two weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the sonic action that deep cleans your pores.</li>
            <li>my old one finally broke</li>
            <li>I night I wash my face with Ivory soap and I take a wet wash cloth and go over my face gently to get any remaining dirt or makeup</li>
            <li>I night I wash my face with Ivory soap and I take a wet wash cloth and go over my face gently to get any remaining dirt or makeup</li>
            <li>Second, if the battery dies, it has to charge completely before it can be used again.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why I got sucked into this marketing mess in the first place.</li>
            <li>I used to put a hot towel on my face for a few minutes before shaving..</li>

            <li> Can be used with your own favorite facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if I can do the clarisonic my face is actually clean.</li>
            <li> I am glad I was able to get it from here because the website is completely sold out.</li>
            <li> I use; any sort of face cleaner works though it doesn&#x27;t have to be special.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going use that thing right now!</li>
            <li> makes your skin feel amazing and helps keep it clear.  </li>
            <li> I used my try and true</li>
            <li> I used my try and true</li>
            <li> I use it with a philosophy cleanser or something super mild.</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend it for any man out there to cleanse his face.  </li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a long time.  </li>
            <li> really like being comfortable and clean</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I first got it and tried it</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I first got it and tried it</li>
            <li> It feels good and lets creams work: my face feels pretty clean after, but it can dry my face out depending on what face cleaner</li>
            <li> Having spent nearly 90 days with my Mia 2, I feel like I made a very wise decision by purchasing</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes on the Mia should be changed every couple months, but it isn&#x27;t a huge investment and can be purchased reasonably through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Overall, my face looks bright and youthful, even after nights I don&#x27;t get much</li>
            <li> Great price, use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so much more clear and radiant.</li>
            <li> is that it really does get all my makeup off and it makes me spend more time washing my face and forces me to really take my time.</li>
            <li> I really feel like my face is clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad or anything, I like it, but I might save a large amount of money and get something comparable but cheaper.</li>
            <li> They used to be very large.</li>
            <li> Feels so soft and is so easy.</li>
            <li> Mia 2 is a smaller version of the original Mia and is easier to hold comfortably for both men and women.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> overall am pleased.</li>
            <li> I did some research before making this purchase because there are so many similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> My pores are much smaller and my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> I broke my first one after repeated drops on the shower floor</li>
            <li> Now, thats assuming its used every day; I use it probably every other day at most, so I can go 6 months (6 months!)</li>
            <li> just kidding can&#x27;t use it while taking a dump because you need to add water for each face section, but it was too funny to delete).</li>
            <li> my girlfriend comment on it the first day.</li>
            <li> Okay, I bought this for my mother for Christmas, actually – my sister bought it and we split it</li>
            <li> sure enough when I was searching for the lot number there wasn&#x27;t one on the device or the box.</li>
            <li> I mean, if you’re going to make an effort to take care of your skin you better make sure the juice is worth the squeeze,</li>
            <li> (there was so many, I&#x27;m not joking, like easily extract 20 a day from my forehead and chin) and deal with bumps, redness, and uneven texture.  </li>
            <li> (there was so many, I&#x27;m not joking, like easily extract 20 a day from my forehead and chin) and deal with bumps, redness, and uneven texture.  </li>
            <li> For the first week I realized that I was applying too much pressure and damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> First off, its showerproof, as in REALLY showerproof.</li>
            <li> As a 32-year-old male living in the Midest, this was a product I never expected to review, let alone own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now exactly 6 months to the day since I got it, and last night the unit began making a buzzing sound by itself in the shower.  </li>
            <li> but I finally broke down and ordered one after my friend told me how great it was.</li>
            <li> I had large clogged blackhead like nothing I have ever seen all over my forehead and my chin.</li>
            <li> I had large clogged blackhead like nothing I have ever seen all over my forehead and my chin.</li>
            <li> I use my sonic right before bed, with a mild facial soap.</li>
            <li> has been using this for about four months now and it has made a huge improvement overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as satisfied as I thought I would be, having spent so much money on this product but it has made my skin smoother.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While my skin isn&#x27;t Hollywood level, after using the Mia 2 for nearly three months my face is smooth, soft and my skin color is very even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments about my complexion (a real confidence booster to hear my say my skin &amp;#34;almost glows&amp;#34; and</li>
            <li> My mother keeps hinting she wants one</li>
            <li> I really do believe in this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I spent $150 for a vibrator for my face...</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my boyfriend and he really likes it would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> No tearing or nicks and the shave is soooo much nicer.</li>
            <li> If you put any sort of moisturizer or anything on, you can really feel it soak in.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference in how you look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scrubs aren&#x27;t the same and in the long run this is more economical.  </li>
            <li> Once my Purity ran out, I used other cleansers to see if it would get better.</li>
            <li> Any guy who is interacts with many people either at work or socially should try this product; my guess is that our stories will be similar.</li>
            <li> It took nearly two months of using the device before I really started to notice a positive difference of using the device on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also owned a traditional full sized Mia for about five years.</li>
            <li> Unlike most grooming devices which break or need to have expensive refills, the clarisonic is sealed, backed by a good warranty, and only needs a head replacement every 3 months.</li>
            <li> This is typically sold for close to $200 in stores, so I love this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My skin heals very quickly if I cut myself shaving, and razor burn is pretty much a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I was using the deep pore scrub and then when my face started to break out more, I switched to the regular, than to the sensitive scrub.</li>
            <li> think pretty much every guy could use one, but I will get into that later.</li>
            <li> After returning home from the holidays I decided I had to get one for myself for a few reasons, it was the easiest way to clean my face, it takes no time at all (literally 2 mins), and nothing I had used previously had worked as effective.</li>
            <li> , the skin on my face was good, but not great.</li>
            <li> Hardly a scientific test, but I think the Mia removed a lot of dead skin and sort of let the cream attack the blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;Since then his skin is looking very good.</li>
            <li> This device has taken my skin to a new level.</li>
            <li> The clarisonic took it a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s fabulous and it&#x27;s making my skin look years younger.</li>
            <li> only real negatives with the Mia 2 are that it takes about 12 hours to fully recharge, $150 is not a drop in the bucket, and results don&#x27;t appear immediately — which can be discouraging to new users.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin has never been this clear before in my.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, try to get a moisturizer that is fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I immediately saw a difference in how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li> You really must use a light hand when washing, my face got a little sore when I first started using this because I was so used to scrubbing with a heavy hand.</li>
            <li> Its a much better value than anything are by Gillette or any of those other companies, which is why I left them so long ago...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen too many &amp;#34;how-to&amp;#34; guides for men using a Mia — especially for those needing the basics — so here&#x27;s a few personal observations that may help if you&#x27;re a guy who is new to facial skin care and Clarisonic (like I</li>
            <li> Gently pat the brush dry on a towel after use.</li>
            <li> Initially he developed some red lumps while using this, but they disappeared after about a week.</li>
            <li> and I was frequently getting deep pimples for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the sonic action that deep cleans your pores.</li>
            <li> my old one finally broke</li>
            <li> I night I wash my face with Ivory soap and I take a wet wash cloth and go over my face gently to get any remaining dirt or makeup</li>
            <li> I night I wash my face with Ivory soap and I take a wet wash cloth and go over my face gently to get any remaining dirt or makeup</li>
            <li> Second, if the battery dies, it has to charge completely before it can be used again.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why I got sucked into this marketing mess in the first place.</li>
            <li> I used to put a hot towel on my face for a few minutes before shaving..</li>
            <li> One of the largest benefits of using the MIA is that due to the fact it cleans your face so well, applying other products after a cleaning are really making the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this cheaper ($99) locally, it&#x27;s the single speed model in grey.</li>
            <li> This thing works fine, it cleans your face like it&#x27;s supposed to, but it&#x27;s definitely not perfect.</li>
            <li> I like the grey color</li>
            <li> She said that the battery life is determined by how long it sits before purchased and charged.  </li>
            <li> It was often oily around my forehead and nose, and I&#x27;d have some dry areas that I&#x27;d put a lotion on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have dry skin, prone to blackheads and breakouts on my T-zone:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a gift, I don&#x27;t have time to register every single thing we get in a house with 5 people and a dog, and they told me that there was nothing they could do since it was out of warranty based on the serial number on the handle.  </li>
            <li> Definitely improves skin and gets rid of black heads.</li>
            <li> this has the same effect with less hassle, and its faster (I can use it in the shower or while taking a dump...</li>
            <li> some deep pores on my nose and cheeks and my skin color was a little splotchy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE February 9 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed the dream only lasted for a little while.</li>
            <li> I only wish they came with a couple different heads or at least one spare.</li>
            <li> If you have a thick, rapid growth like I do, this will make the growth and skin soft and supple before shaving.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced as much shrinking of pores as other people have but</li>
            <li> even when I stumble home drunk from the club.&lt;br /&gt;You can try out the cheaper versions to see how much you like it and use it and then graduate up if you would like.</li>
            <li> It helps to prepare your skin for moisturizer and other products afterwards.</li>
            <li> Curiously, the blackheads began disappearing in a few days after using his Mia 2 - 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other cleansers that Clarisonic makes!</li>
            <li> Less break outs.</li>
            <li> I use it 30 seconds on each half of my lower face, 30 seconds on my throat, and 30 on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I then ran into the problem of having to buy new heads, which are so expensive.</li>
            <li> Apply the cleanser to your face and work it in a little.</li>
            <li> I had a little bit as a teenager</li>
            <li> I had a little bit as a teenager</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re in the shower and realize that it&#x27;s dead, you can&#x27;t jump out and plug it in for a few minutes, you just don&#x27;t get to wash your face that day.</li>
            <li> Finally received my clarisonic in the mail only to discover that it was a fake!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few YouTube videos where the girl (there are very few videos made by men, so I take what I can get) applies the cleanser to the brush rather than her face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about that, but his skin does look fresher and clearer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I thought to myself &amp;#34;that&#x27;s one expensive facial cleanser&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li> I was unable to achieve these results from simply washing my face otherwise.</li>
            <li> I live in a place where even if I wear little to no makeup my face gets filthy and plus I try to work out and with those 3 things I use a wipe sometimes as a shortcut</li>
            <li> It can be a less expensive brand because the Mia is a quality device.</li>
            <li> I just have this bad boy sitting next to my sink.</li>
            <li> face continued to get worse through after I stopped using it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a Mia 2 owner. I bought this unit for my husband who has had cluster blackheads since I&#x27;ve known him. No medications, washes, or deep pore cleansers have helped this condition.&lt;br /&gt;He was highly skeptical that this was going to work. Initially he developed some red lumps while using this, but they disappeared after about a week. Curiously, the blackheads began disappearing in a few days after using his Mia 2 - 3 times a day. After cleansing, he used a medicated cream. Hardly a scientific test, but I think the Mia removed a lot of dead skin and sort of let the cream attack the blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;Since then his skin is looking very good. His pores are much smaller. They used to be very large. His skin is both softer and smoother and also looks brighter.&lt;br /&gt;He has been using this for about four months now and it has made a huge improvement overall. People comment on how he seems to be looking younger. I&#x27;m not sure about that, but his skin does look fresher and clearer.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes on the Mia should be changed every couple months, but it isn&#x27;t a huge investment and can be purchased reasonably through Amazon. As for the quality, I can only comment on mine. I have owned it for three years and have had no problems. I can get several uses before having to recharge. A total charge takes about 8 to 12 hours. My husband&#x27;s Mia has not given us any problems. I have also owned a traditional full sized Mia for about five years. No issues and it is much larger and used in the tub and shower.&lt;br /&gt;The Mia 2 is a smaller version of the original Mia and is easier to hold comfortably for both men and women. You can use a variety of cleansers which enhance its performance.&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended this product and thinks it is a mighty wonder.</li>
            <li> Bought this cheaper ($99) locally, it&#x27;s the single speed model in grey. The surprise, however, is just how well this cleans. I can&#x27;t believe what a great job it does, both with the Clairsonic gel cleanser, and more budget friendly cream cleansers. I use this twice daily, and follow it up with some vitamin c serum. The end result is a clean, glowing face.</li>
            <li> Malfunction after two month of use. Start up automatically and won&#x27;t stop until battery used up. Called Clarisonic to request a replacement device. However, Amazon is not a verified retailer, which makes replacement process extremely complicated.</li>
            <li> As a 32-year-old male living in the Midest, this was a product I never expected to review, let alone own. I purchased the Mia 2 on a whim after Christmas and was *very* skeptical about whether it would work. After lots of coaxing from my girlfriend, her playing into my vanity, and with Clarisonic&#x27;s 90 day return policy, I figured why not take a chance. Having spent nearly 90 days with my Mia 2, I feel like I made a very wise decision by purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest: I didn&#x27;t see an overnight transformation, and was tempted to return the Mia 2 on more than one occasion. About three weeks into using it twice daily and following the instructions, the skin on my face went haywire and I was frequently getting deep pimples for about two weeks. It took nearly two months of using the device before I really started to notice a positive difference of using the device on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the Mia 2, the skin on my face was good, but not great. It was often oily around my forehead and nose, and I&#x27;d have some dry areas that I&#x27;d put a lotion on. I had (and still have) some deep pores on my nose and cheeks and my skin color was a little splotchy. I would occasionally get pimples and it would take my face several days to heal a blemish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my skin isn&#x27;t Hollywood level, after using the Mia 2 for nearly three months my face is smooth, soft and my skin color is very even. The splotchiness, oiliness and dryness are gone. The pores on my nose and cheeks are still there, but much smaller. My skin heals very quickly if I cut myself shaving, and razor burn is pretty much a thing of the past. I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments about my complexion (a real confidence booster to hear my say my skin &amp;#34;almost glows&amp;#34; and my girlfriend&#x27;s friends to say I&#x27;m &amp;#34;a gorgeous man&amp;#34;). Overall, my face looks bright and youthful, even after nights I don&#x27;t get much sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real negatives with the Mia 2 are that it takes about 12 hours to fully recharge, $150 is not a drop in the bucket, and results don&#x27;t appear immediately — which can be discouraging to new users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic&#x27;s instructional videos all feature women who seem to know the basics of skin care, such as products to use and how to properly do it. I haven&#x27;t seen too many &amp;#34;how-to&amp;#34; guides for men using a Mia — especially for those needing the basics — so here&#x27;s a few personal observations that may help if you&#x27;re a guy who is new to facial skin care and Clarisonic (like I was):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Use a dedicated facial cleanser in the morning and at night. It can be a less expensive brand because the Mia is a quality device. Don&#x27;t get a cleanser that has microbeads because you&#x27;ll shred your skin when you use the Mia, and depending on your hobbies, you don&#x27;t need a cleanser that can remove makeup. I opted for a basic, foaming Olay cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;ve seen a few YouTube videos where the girl (there are very few videos made by men, so I take what I can get) applies the cleanser to the brush rather than her face. I&#x27;ve found I get better results when working the cleanser into my face rather than having the brush apply it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Before applying the cleanser and using the Mia, wash your face with warm water. Apply the cleanser to your face and work it in a little. Run the Mia&#x27;s brush under warm water and then use it on your cleanser-covered face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) After using the Mia on your face, apply a moisturizer with a SPF 15. Both Nivea and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s men&#x27;s line work well. If you have sensitive skin, try to get a moisturizer that is fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Gently pat the brush dry on a towel after use. Once a week, gently clean the brush head with hand soap. Squirt the soap onto the brush head and work the soap into the bristols in circular motions before cleaning it under warm water. Doing these things will keep the brush head in great shape and allow you to use it for longer than three months.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much cleaner! I use my sonic right before bed, with a mild facial soap. Only reason I did not give it a 5 star is that I do not like the feature where it temporarily shuts off to let you move to another part of your face then off when it thinks you should be done.  I would rather turn it off when I&#x27;m finished...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as satisfied as I thought I would be, having spent so much money on this product but it has made my skin smoother.  I have not experienced as much shrinking of pores as other people have but overall am pleased.</li>
            <li> About a month of using this thing and I can definitely notice a difference on my face. It has helped reduce the size of my pores and improved my complexion. I love it.  My mother keeps hinting she wants one so I guess I will have to buy another as a gift. I only wish they came with a couple different heads or at least one spare.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, it has revealed softer, brighter and smoother skin.  I use it every night before bed.</li>
            <li> This device has taken my skin to a new level. I did some research before making this purchase because there are so many similar products on the market. But as others have said, it&#x27;s more than just a brush. It&#x27;s the sonic action that deep cleans your pores. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now twice daily (60 seconds AM, 120 seconds PM) and my husband is astonished by the transformation in my skin. My pores are much smaller and my skin tone is more even. For the first week I realized that I was applying too much pressure and damaging my skin. Now I use it lightly and it works amazingly! My skin absorbs products much better. The device has preset amounts of time for each area of your face. I suggest modifying their suggestions to suit your needs. Overall it&#x27;s fabulous and it&#x27;s making my skin look years younger.</li>
            <li> this is great - they are for men (me) and women.  makes your skin feel amazing and helps keep it clear.  I broke my first one after repeated drops on the shower floor (my fault....it took a beating before it finally broke).  I like the grey color - makes me feel its not just for women in the unlikely event TSA searches my overnight case :-)</li>
            <li> It makes total sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It deep cleans by oscillation not circulation.&lt;br /&gt;2. It makes facial cleansing task easier, faster, more effective and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;3. One minute auto stop.&lt;br /&gt;4. Can be used with your own favorite facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended! Just need to watch out for counterfeit item.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it..got it for her for mothers day...I shouldhave bought one for her a while back...oh well she has it now</li>
            <li> Great value and awesome product. This is typically sold for close to $200 in stores, so I love this. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I got this in December as a gift.  It&#x27;s now exactly 6 months to the day since I got it, and last night the unit began making a buzzing sound by itself in the shower.  When I plugged it in this morning, it began pulsing and chirping  non-stop.  I called the company, and they said that I should have a receipt and have registered it online.  It was a gift, I don&#x27;t have time to register every single thing we get in a house with 5 people and a dog, and they told me that there was nothing they could do since it was out of warranty based on the serial number on the handle.  It states a one year warranty, hasn&#x27;t lasted six, and the company determines everything based on date of manufacture when things could sit on store shelves for a while.  She said that the battery life is determined by how long it sits before purchased and charged.  Buyer beware, I guess.  I definitely won&#x27;t be buying another, and will not encourage anyone I know to, either.</li>
            <li> Great price, use it everyday. Wish it had been around years ago</li>
            <li> Love this system so much! You really must use a light hand when washing, my face got a little sore when I first started using this because I was so used to scrubbing with a heavy hand. This makes my skin so much more clear and radiant.</li>
            <li> my old one finally broke so I replaced it. I really do believe in this thing. I live in a place where even if I wear little to no makeup my face gets filthy and plus I try to work out and with those 3 things I use a wipe sometimes as a shortcut but if I can do the clarisonic my face is actually clean. I use it with a philosophy cleanser or something super mild. my skin is probably my best feature so I think this is a good investment.</li>
            <li> I actually have the teal colored one but I could not find that specific one on here.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this from Ulta by trading in all my Ulta points which essentially meant that I got it for free.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s debatable as to how effective this really is, since the comparisons they do compare the clarisonic to washing with your hands and no wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about it is that it really does get all my makeup off and it makes me spend more time washing my face and forces me to really take my time. Now that I have this, I wash my face religiously- even when I stumble home drunk from the club.&lt;br /&gt;You can try out the cheaper versions to see how much you like it and use it and then graduate up if you would like.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a long time.  I love this product and highly recommend it for any man out there to cleanse his face.  It&#x27;s easy to use in the shower and is easy to recharge.  The charge holds for quite some time.  It helps to prepare your skin for moisturizer and other products afterwards.</li>
            <li> Found a good color to let my son use.  These things work great and wanted to give him something besides the normal girly colors.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  Our whole family is using it and the best is it doesn&#x27;t take long to use each time so we actually use it on a regular basis.  You can use your own products with it but we like the cleanser it came with.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it. On my second one. Definitely improves skin and gets rid of black heads. Less break outs. Scrubs aren&#x27;t the same and in the long run this is more economical.  Will replace this one when it goes</li>
            <li> My skin has never, in the history of me being alive, looked this good. I am glad I was able to get it from here because the website is completely sold out. Obviously I bought Purity with it and my skin...my skin, I am in love with it and it looks sooo good! Feels so soft and is so easy. Instead of having a million different face wash products in my shower, I have none. I just have this bad boy sitting next to my sink. Every morning and every night I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been breaking out more but I am getting through it, its just because this is helping bring all that crud to the surface and plus, me using an extractor on my face probably doesn&#x27;t help with that (I am trying to move the process along).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin, prone to blackheads and breakouts on my T-zone:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic + Purity&lt;br /&gt;I moisturize/cleanse with Thayers Alchohol-Free Toner Rose Petal Witch Hazel (just to get any dirt that I missed)&lt;br /&gt;I finally moisturize with Olay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see more of the benefits when I have used this for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE February 9 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed the dream only lasted for a little while. Those bumps that sprung up? Never went away. I seemed to managed to build a tolerance to the effectiveness of this product. Once my Purity ran out, I used other cleansers to see if it would get better. It got worse.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I was using the wrong combination of products while using the Clairsonic but I got frustrated. I was using the deep pore scrub and then when my face started to break out more, I switched to the regular, than to the sensitive scrub. I then ran into the problem of having to buy new heads, which are so expensive. F - that. I have no idea why I got sucked into this marketing mess in the first place. I haven&#x27;t used this thing in 8 months and now its just sits at the bottom of my sink. I&#x27;m glad that I spent $150 for a vibrator for my face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face continued to get worse through after I stopped using it and I had to go through more money to fix it. I had large clogged blackhead like nothing I have ever seen all over my forehead and my chin. For about a month a would extract the blackheads (there was so many, I&#x27;m not joking, like easily extract 20 a day from my forehead and chin) and deal with bumps, redness, and uneven texture.  I do not get bad acne. I had a little bit as a teenager but I pounced on that real quick with some good ol&#x27; fashioned drugstore Clean n&#x27; Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last two months my skin has been clearer than even when I used the Clairsonic. I used my try and true St. Ives Even &amp; Bright which I use to gently exfoliate once a day in the morning. I use Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel toner once or twice a day - depending. I night I wash my face with Ivory soap and I take a wet wash cloth and go over my face gently to get any remaining dirt or makeup (I don&#x27;t scrub with the wash cloth) and I apply Eucerin and Vaseline (at night). My skin has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a reminder not to give in to all the hype.

            <li> This thing works fine, it cleans your face like it&#x27;s supposed to, but it&#x27;s definitely not perfect. For one thing, I feel like it&#x27;s designed to look like the brush head is going to rotate, but it doesn&#x27;t, it vibrates. The packaging insists that this works better than if it rotated, but I&#x27;m inclined not to believe it. Second, if the battery dies, it has to charge completely before it can be used again. So if you&#x27;re in the shower and realize that it&#x27;s dead, you can&#x27;t jump out and plug it in for a few minutes, you just don&#x27;t get to wash your face that day. It&#x27;s not bad or anything, I like it, but I might save a large amount of money and get something comparable but cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great product can&#x27;t live without it. I bought this one for my boyfriend and he really likes it would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I saw the product all the time online and in stores and I thought to myself &amp;#34;that&#x27;s one expensive facial cleanser&amp;#34;, but I finally broke down and ordered one after my friend told me how great it was. Well this cleanser is AWESOME! I really feel like my face is clean after I use it. I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other cleansers that Clarisonic makes!</li>
            <li> Makes washing my face fun!!!</li>
            <li> There I was, returning an unwanted Christmas present to Nordstroms. What am I going to buy there? I already have enough clothes and shoes. Wait, whats this?  A Clarisonic? on sale? and it comes in gray? I kind of always wanted one...and I do like electronics...oh well nothing ventured nothing gained! Plus its better than what I returned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like being comfortable and clean, I am not going to lie. I have, in my age and vanity, acquired somewhat of a \\&quot;man spa\\&quot; in my bathroom. Good shaving equipment, fine creams and gels, dewrinkle stuff, a good nail trimmer, an excellent nose hair trimmer that doesn&#x27;t hurt etc etc. Its not too much stuff or \\&quot;out of control\\&quot;, just really good stuff for the basics: shaving, trimming, cleaning. The clarisonic took it a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think pretty much every guy could use one, but I will get into that later. First off, its showerproof, as in REALLY showerproof. There is no battery door; it charges magnetically. Unlike most grooming devices which break or need to have expensive refills, the clarisonic is sealed, backed by a good warranty, and only needs a head replacement every 3 months. Now, thats assuming its used every day; I use it probably every other day at most, so I can go 6 months (6 months!) without a brush replacement. Thats good value in my book. Its a much better value than anything are by Gillette or any of those other companies, which is why I left them so long ago...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls use this to take off their makeup, so why would a guy want one? I will enlighten you:&lt;br /&gt;1. Preshave: If you have a thick, rapid growth like I do, this will make the growth and skin soft and supple before shaving. No tearing or nicks and the shave is soooo much nicer. I used to put a hot towel on my face for a few minutes before shaving..this has the same effect with less hassle, and its faster (I can use it in the shower or while taking a dump...just kidding can&#x27;t use it while taking a dump because you need to add water for each face section, but it was too funny to delete). I use it 30 seconds on each half of my lower face, 30 seconds on my throat, and 30 on my forehead. Protip: do your forehead last or you will have soap dripping in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It feels good and lets creams work: my face feels pretty clean after, but it can dry my face out depending on what face cleaner I use; any sort of face cleaner works though it doesn&#x27;t have to be special. Just don&#x27;t be stupid and use hand soap or something like that. If you put any sort of moisturizer or anything on, you can really feel it soak in. Make fun of me all you want, but my face feels great using moisturizer and way better with the clarisonic! Before I go to bed it is the best feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. People actually notice: I have never had this happen before, but people will walk up to me at work and say my face looks healthier and \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;, especially if I use it before work. . I think I had 3 people and my girlfriend comment on it the first day. It really makes a difference in how you look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going use that thing right now!</li>
            <li> Man Review…. Okay, I bought this for my mother for Christmas, actually – my sister bought it and we split it (I had never heard of the product before) and once she started using it she loved everything about it. She prodded me to give it a test drive and I immediately saw a difference in how soft my skin was. After returning home from the holidays I decided I had to get one for myself for a few reasons, it was the easiest way to clean my face, it takes no time at all (literally 2 mins), and nothing I had used previously had worked as effective. I mean, if you’re going to make an effort to take care of your skin you better make sure the juice is worth the squeeze, and with the MIA 2 – it definitely is. Traveling is simple, the battery life is great. One of the largest benefits of using the MIA is that due to the fact it cleans your face so well, applying other products after a cleaning are really making the difference in my skin. I was unable to achieve these results from simply washing my face otherwise. I now use a toner before bed about 5 times a week and use a blackhead masks 2 times a week – I’m 28 and never had bad acne or skin issues, but my skin has never been this clear before in my. I am finding that since adding the toner/mask to target tougher problems, people notice. Any guy who is interacts with many people either at work or socially should try this product; my guess is that our stories will be similar.</li>
            <li> Finally received my clarisonic in the mail only to discover that it was a fake! I had read reviews after I ordered it that any people were receiving fake merchandise. I was excited when I got it &amp; soon when on to the clarisonic website to register it &amp; sure enough when I was searching for the lot number there wasn&#x27;t one on the device or the box. Sending it back ASAP!</li>
            <li> The mia works great...</li>
            <li> Love the compact design. Fits better in my hand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without my clarisonic. My skin feels the best it&#x27;s ever felt since adding it to my regular routine.</li>
