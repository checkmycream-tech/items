            <li>Have recommended to many.</li>

            <li>Love this oil, use it on every part of my body.</li>
            <li>I love using oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it, and from what i&#x27;ve read online</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and then I realized the oil was leaking from the top (the dispenser).</li>
            <li>It has my skin and hair so much more comfortable and better looking than the others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it feels going on and it leaves my skin smooth for many hours afterward.</li>

            <li>it is super nutritious for the skin too!</li>
            <li>thanks for the fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>I love how it quickly it is absorbed into my skin without leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li>My face is brighter and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great the next day</li>
            <li>so far i think it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>Any oil will make my hair soft and this is always a good way to recycle an oil I do not want to use on my face.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and my skin looks and feels better at once and keeps on improving.</li>
            <li>This is much more reasonable!</li>
            <li>Just started using product and so far am very pleased with results</li>
            <li>I bought this oil based on reviews of how good it was for facial dryness.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I would like, but overall, a great oil and addition to your every day skin care</li>
            <li>It did not find it to be super moisturizing</li>
            <li>I apply it to my freshly cleansed moist face.  </li>
            <li>so light, smooth and softly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right now I am still keeping it in a zip lock baggie because the container is still oily.</li>
            <li>The actual oil is very good for dry skin/acne/ etc.</li>
            <li>Makes skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>I can even use my hands better the next day.</li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant scent, but not eye irritating.</li>
            <li>so I am not sure how good of a product it may be.  </li>
            <li>Appears to be pure.</li>
            <li>Within a few minutes I suddenly realized the pain level had greatly reduced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The real deal my friends... got Moringa oil from another seller at a cut rate</li>
            <li>This product is the real thing.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this oil and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I got this oil for my face and really like it</li>
            <li>While more for less looks like a bargain...</li>
            <li>For whatever it is worth I also use the powder in my daily smoothies (is smoothies really a word?)</li>
            <li>I found another product for over $100 with Moringa as the main ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I also use this on my 3 year old daughter since it is so gentle.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and the smell is not strong and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>that was very unexpected.</li>
            <li>arrived oil smelled like old olive oil... learned my lesson.</li>
            <li>I been using this oil as a natural moisturizer for my locks after I wash my locks</li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair soft and enhances my natural curls.</li>
            <li>and I noticed any blemishes on my skin has faded and my skin felts soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, even color, wrinkles are a thing of the past, fuller &amp; longer hair,...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been very helpful for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>I use this oil in my hair and on my skin, it healed a few break out acne quickly.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to different scents/odors etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, per se, but...liked the citrus scent of another similar product I purchased previously.</li>
            <li>If you want an oil that helps you, to gain confidence in your individual beauty by enhancing your natural looks, then give this oil, an try.</li>

            <li> I am a 71 year old man with very few wrinkles and am told constantly that I look years younger.  </li>
            <li> Use a very little as directions state &amp; hair, skin, nails, feet, Wow its like having a babies body!</li>
            <li> thought that&#x27;s strange!</li>
            <li> and my hands were dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how soft and supple both my skin and hair has become, since using this oil; it gotten to the point where I taken to admiring my reflection in the mirror rather than shying away from my reflection like I usually do.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for some time as a facial moisturizer (a little goes a long way).....</li>
            <li> Bottle lasted longer than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> So the next night I tried it again and again the pain level lessened within just a few minutes of massaging my hands.</li>
            <li> Well packed and as expected.</li>
            <li> No complaints the first time, but this time the oil stinks like the oily smell you sometimes smell in a Chinese restaurant.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t want to risk it when I know other oils won&#x27;t do this at all.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed though when I got my package to find that a good amount of oil spilled out of the container (in the box).</li>
            <li> The only negative, in my opinion, is the smell.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with a few other oils in our shower wash.</li>
            <li> moisturizes my skin without leaving a heavy oily film on skin.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I apply it at night at under eye area and it seemed brightened my skin and reduced appearance of small wrinkles in a week.</li>
            <li> I thought it could be the root of small clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> Pain pills are hard on me</li>
            <li> Sooooo disappointed  Thought this would help keep my skin soft and supple in the Florida summer .  </li>
            <li> I have used it for 5 days, and I am unhappy that is so thick and does not readily absorb into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not good pump.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t use this due to the unusual and awful scent it has.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> It also has a slightly unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> I have bad arthritis pain in the joints in my hands that goes up into my fingers.</li>
            <li> but I had a bad experience with the packaging.</li>
            <li> Hate to see it out of stock,so Please keep it in Stock!!</li>
            <li> It seems to even help cuts heal as well because I had this nasty mosquito bite on my face, and I used a drop of this oil with tea tree oil, which helped to heal the mosquito bite and prevented scarring.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Has improved my complexion, I definitely recommend it, you have to try it.  Makes skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This have been one of my greatest finds in years of shopping!  This oil can be used for so many things its almost unreal but the best part about it is NO MATTER WHAT ITS USED FOR, IT WORKS!  Use a very little as directions state &amp; hair, skin, nails, feet, Wow its like having a babies body! Soft, smooth, even color, wrinkles are a thing of the past, fuller &amp; longer hair,...Awesome product!  Hate to see it out of stock,so Please keep it in Stock!!</li>
            <li> Received on time. Excellent Product. This is a must have oil.</li>
            <li> I Love, love this product!  moisturizes my skin without leaving a heavy oily film on skin.  My cheeks, lips and under eye area especially love this oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I have been using it for some time as a facial moisturizer (a little goes a long way).....I am a 71 year old man with very few wrinkles and am told constantly that I look years younger.  For whatever it is worth I also use the powder in my daily smoothies (is smoothies really a word?) which is also great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for anti-aging.  I found another product for over $100 with Moringa as the main ingredient.  This is much more reasonable!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product works. Maybe in 3 months I can attest to what I am reading about the product.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful!  It has my skin and hair so much more comfortable and better looking than the others I have tried.  It is absorbed quickly and my skin looks and feels better at once and keeps on improving.</li>
            <li> The real deal my friends... got Moringa oil from another seller at a cut rate... thought I got a deal... arrived oil smelled like old olive oil... learned my lesson. While more for less looks like a bargain...buyer beware!!!!. This product is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to different scents/odors etc. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t use this due to the unusual and awful scent it has. I thought the smell would go away after a while but it lasted for hours even after washing the product off several times.  Definitely does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I have had no reactions or problems with the product; I use it as a day-time moisturizer.  The only negative, in my opinion, is the smell.  Quite pungent and not to my liking.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the oil, because it is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Sooooo disappointed  Thought this would help keep my skin soft and supple in the Florida summer .  Both times I used it, my skin itched for hours.  Also bought the POWDER which caused severe nausea for almost the hwole day after ingested.</li>
            <li> Great for my hair. It smells like peanuts which was a surprise. I have another kind that smells sweet and light.</li>
            <li> Moringa oil for my hair . It&#x27;s been very helpful for my dry hair. I have been using it for 2 weeks and it&#x27;s a big improvement!  My hair feels softer and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> This is not greasy, yet it provides very good coverage. Bottle lasted longer than I ever expected. Appears to be pure.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I would like, but overall, a great oil and addition to your every day skin care</li>
            <li> I bought this oil based on reviews of how good it was for facial dryness.  I have used it for 5 days, and I am unhappy that is so thick and does not readily absorb into my skin.  I apply it to my freshly cleansed moist face.  I massage it in, but it still does not absorb.  If I layer next with a night time moisturizer, That takes care of some of the stickiness.  It also has a slightly unpleasant smell.  My husband&#x27;s masseuse has also tried it, and it does not have enough glide over the skin.  A waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial oil I have ever used and I have tried many. I love the way it feels going on and it leaves my skin smooth for many hours afterward. And I love the smell!</li>
            <li> This product was sent to my Daughter in college, therefore I can&#x27;t rate it. Sorry</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this oil and it really works.  After using this oil your skin will begin to look and feel so much younger.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get more bang for my buck. It has nothing in it to give it a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, per se, but...liked the citrus scent of another similar product I purchased previously.</li>
            <li> Love how my skin feels and the compliments are always being spoken.  Have recommended to many.</li>
            <li> I bought it for m hair so far i think it&#x27;s good but I&#x27;m waiting to see if it&#x27;s gonna work for what i bought for i bought for my edges t grow back</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this product. The shipping and packaging was great. But the product has exceeded my expectations in many ways. I love how it quickly it is absorbed into my skin without leaving it greasy. I can put my makeup on in just 2 or 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But something happened that was very unexpected. I have bad arthritis pain in the joints in my hands that goes up into my fingers. Pain pills are hard on me so I tend to try to endure the pain. While using the oil on my face and neck before bed I decided to just rub some on my hands so I could massage the joints to try and ease the pain and my hands were dry. Within a few minutes I suddenly realized the pain level had greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that&#x27;s strange! So the next night I tried it again and again the pain level lessened within just a few minutes of massaging my hands. I got this oil for my face and really like it but it also seems to be helping the inflammation in the joints of my hands and causing the pain to lessen enough I can sleep through the night. I can even use my hands better the next day. I&#x27;m Not saying the pain is gone!! I&#x27;m saying it is Very much better. So now I&#x27;m also going to try it on my knees too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell if this aspect of using the oil will last. If not I still love it on my face.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and great company.  very happy with our order.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my hair and on my skin, it healed a few break out acne quickly. My face is brighter and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, use it on every part of my body.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I ordered this product from this company. No complaints the first time, but this time the oil stinks like the oily smell you sometimes smell in a Chinese restaurant. Maybe I got a rancid bottle this time.</li>
            <li> Just started using product and so far am very pleased with results</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t opened it up yet. I anticipate it to be a good product. I want to apply it to my hair and rub it into my scalp. It appears to be a wonderful product. I just haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it yet.</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing skin.  I mix it with a few other oils in our shower wash.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil for cosmetic purposes. Can be applied directly on skin or mixed with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase. I use moringa oil on my face and in skincare and hair care products.The oil s not diluted and smells nutty as it is meant to. Nice product. Affordable price. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great oil for face and as massage oil</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering this product again soon.</li>
            <li> Nice light oil that soaks right into your skin</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It has a light pleasant scent, but not eye irritating. I apply it at night at under eye area and it seemed brightened my skin and reduced appearance of small wrinkles in a week. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and very economical - you need just a drop. I like the packaging too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this oil diligently since purchase so I am not sure how good of a product it may be.  I can say that even though it&#x27;s an oil, you can use it nightly on your face and not feel like it&#x27;s too greasy.</li>
            <li> I love using oil and I use several of them daily.  But I am on the fence about this oil.  It did not find it to be super moisturizing and I think it might have clogged my pores.  I tried twice and twice I thought it could be the root of small clogged pores.  I just don&#x27;t want to risk it when I know other oils won&#x27;t do this at all.  I am now using it in my hair as I always do.  Any oil will make my hair soft and this is always a good way to recycle an oil I do not want to use on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great and hydrated</li>
            <li> Well packed and as expected. Good value</li>
            <li> Loves the way it feels after its absorbs into skin.  My skin looks great the next day</li>
            <li> Great oil.  Not good pump.  Clogs.</li>
            <li> thanks for the fast shipping and great product. so light, smooth and softly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love it, and from what i&#x27;ve read online it is super nutritious for the skin too!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I ordered some for myself and for my Mother too. I use it all over - from face to feet. It absorbs quickly and the smell is not strong and goes away quickly. If I put it on before my clothes I rub the excess off so it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. I also use this on my 3 year old daughter since it is so gentle.</li>
            <li> I love it. I been using this oil as a natural moisturizer for my locks after I wash my locks and it leaves my hair soft and enhances my natural curls. I also been adding drop of the oil to my organic lotion and it has soften and brightened my complexion. I been getting compliments on my beauty and I noticed any blemishes on my skin has faded and my skin felts soft and moisturized. It seems to even help cuts heal as well because I had this nasty mosquito bite on my face, and I used a drop of this oil with tea tree oil, which helped to heal the mosquito bite and prevented scarring. I can&#x27;t get over how soft and supple both my skin and hair has become, since using this oil; it gotten to the point where I taken to admiring my reflection in the mirror rather than shying away from my reflection like I usually do. If you want an oil that helps you, to gain confidence in your individual beauty by enhancing your natural looks, then give this oil, an try.</li>
            <li> The actual oil is very good for dry skin/acne/ etc. I was very disappointed though when I got my package to find that a good amount of oil spilled out of the container (in the box). When I picked up the container I had to wipe off all the excess oil surrounding it and then I realized the oil was leaking from the top (the dispenser). Right now I am still keeping it in a zip lock baggie because the container is still oily. Overall good product but I had a bad experience with the packaging.</li>
