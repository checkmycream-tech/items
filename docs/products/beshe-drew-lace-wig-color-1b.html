            <li>Trust me it will frizz very easily.</li>
            <li>The one I bought off of Amazon was more kinkier and the texture wasn&#x27;t as nice  than the one at the store.</li>

            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>OK I just read some reviews</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with this lace front wig.</li>
            <li>If you like big hair, then this is the perfect wig for you.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this wig.</li>
            <li>Got the wig in 2 days I was very excited to wear it</li>
            <li>did you get it?&amp;#34; Its so soft, has movement, and has a beautiful curl.</li>
            <li>Loved the look the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>I wish I had time to write a more detailed review because I love this wig</li>
            <li>It looks great on and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of hair, very full.</li>
            <li>Would make for a great 70s costume but not everyday wear...</li>
            <li>but I got it so it would be easy not for me to have to find someone to cut and shape it.</li>
            <li>but it was super scratchy IMO!</li>
            <li>This wig was my favorite because it blended well with my own natural kinky, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>What I got was a huge frizzy mass in at the top with nice defined coils near the nape and framing the face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous buy.</li>
            <li>It was a fun and sassy &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look which is why I fell in love with it from the youtube reviews</li>
            <li>First and most important</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I bought this unit after so many other naturals bought it and loved it.</li>
            <li>I am natural and this week mimics my own hair texture.  </li>
            <li>so everyone thinks ta my own natural hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot longer and no way as full as the picture, and I have no idea what to do with it besides return it.</li>
            <li>This wig is Kanekalon synthetic hair, but is not plastic-y and shiny looking at all, very natural !!; not like how really cheap synthetic weave.</li>
            <li>Very nice tight curls.</li>
            <li>; I smile and say &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But by the second day it already started expanding and losing the nice curl</li>
            <li>Right out of the package</li>
            <li>The older she gets the more natural</li>
            <li>I love this wig even though after I bought it I saw it at my local hair store.</li>
            <li>I do not suggest washing her, but if you do fill the sink with HOT water and shampoo (clarifying, not conditioning) take your unit and dunk her in the water repeatedly.</li>
            <li>So, do not do this unless you have a back up unit or hairstyle, because you may not be pleased with the results</li>
            <li>If you want her to get that way the first day then</li>
            <li>first time wearing one</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re not shy about working that much hair, go for it!</li>
            <li>Do not waste the time or money on this!!!!</li>
            <li>, it was too frizzy, it did not offer a confident fit, the hooks were not reliable, it was too much wig with little security.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full and the texture is soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it was very affordable and it didn&#x27;t take long to receive the wig.</li>
            <li>I bought mine to help with my transition in growing my hair back out after my 2nd big chop (because of heat damage) and it&#x27;s working out beautifully.</li>
            <li>The picture that shows the hair on this site looks nothing like it does in person very displeased.</li>
            <li>As you can see I really like this unit.</li>
            <li>but it was way too much hair for me.</li>
            <li>Admittedly I got a LOT of compliments on the piece as a whole--</li>
            <li>curls were already out and some parts of the curly wig was straight.</li>
            <li>It just failed to keep its beautiful look and grew about twice as large without me even picking it out.  </li>
            <li>Love it thick and full.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to feel very synthetic, but I was surprised.</li>
            <li>First, the wig was extremely frizzy right out the bag.</li>
            <li>So, I will have #2 and the new one.</li>
            <li>Not stiff!</li>
            <li>Definitely wild child hair!</li>
            <li>I like this wig because it has several different curl patterns not unlike true ethnic natural hair.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural.</li>
            <li>It mimics natural hair so well.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural</li>
            <li>For all the women with natural afro-kinky hair, this is not the wig for you.  </li>
            <li>The piece arrived early and as advertised.</li>
            <li>everyone thought it was my natural hair.</li>
            <li>unless you like the wild look.</li>
            <li>Fill the sink up again with plain water and dunk until the unit is free of shampoo.</li>
            <li>Package looked new, actual product inside was obviously old.</li>
            <li>Only giving 1 star because there are no negative stars.</li>
            <li>Big hair which is a change up from the units I normally wear</li>
            <li>The new ones are thin-haired and shiny with a smaller cap.  </li>
            <li>If you like big natural looking hair, it&#x27;s the one for you.</li>
            <li>I plan to take it to a stylist to thin it out for me because it&#x27;s more hair than I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li>I am almost certain that it was a used wig or else it would have been less manipulated.</li>

            <li> I am almost certain that it was a used wig or else it would have been less manipulated.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first wig, it fits my head, light when worn, the lace front is a little shiny when cut, but its a simple fix by blending natural baby hairs, cutting the wig edges, creating baby hairs and overlapping the wig hairs.</li>
            <li> Now, when I put her back on the hair was very fuzzy and hard.</li>
            <li> I put her on a hanger with clamps and hung her outside to air dry.</li>
            <li> But be careful who you actually buy the wig from.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t take long to grow on me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wig was so dried and the back was so fizzed that looks like over used .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The lace is itchy which should be expected since it&#x27;s a cheaper unit and synthetic.</li>
            <li> I add curl pudding to give that wet look.   </li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m complaining because I don&#x27;t want anyone else to waste money on such inferior quality.</li>
            <li> but this hair did not hold up its look even with minimal wear</li>
            <li> Secondly, this was a big messy ball of hair that had some tight curls and other sections just kinky with no curls</li>
            <li> and then you have a big fro and for some that&#x27;s not cute.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty disappointed to have to pack it away after about 2 weeks-- and only about 5 short and indoor uses.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re not used to that much hair, you&#x27;re going to want to thin it out a little and don&#x27;t worry, there are youtube vids that show you how.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like it!</li>
            <li> The lace front was typical, have to know how to work it--</li>
            <li> it was a BIG FUZZY MESS!!!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear the new ones because the hair is too thin, too shiny and cap is too small.  </li>
            <li> When u get it pull it out to desired fullness because curls are really tight.  </li>
            <li> and YES it comes in tight tight curls kinda frizzy</li>
            <li> I thinkg that I am going to leave it a little longer this time.</li>
            <li> I received this wig just a few days after ordering.</li>
            <li> I actually had to thin it out some, because it is a LOT of hair.</li>
            <li> I got compliments on this wig everyday that I wore it.</li>
            <li> I could tell it was going to &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; and frizz up within a few days</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because this wig comes highly recommended on the natural hair circuit.</li>
            <li> It was tangled and uneven!  </li>
            <li> would not try again at least online.</li>
            <li> One for a casual look and the other for when I dress up.</li>
            <li> Would not even waste as a Halloween costume!!!  </li>
            <li> Color was wrong.</li>
            <li> The piece is ethnically correct in its random curl patterns which is a plus.</li>
            <li> after trimming the bangs and cutting out some of the tracks.</li>
            <li> This is awful!!!  </li>

            <li> Beautiful wig. Got so many compliments on this hair. It looks so natural. This is the best synthetic wig that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Love this wig! It looks great on and is very natural looking. I get compliments all of the time and most people cannot tell that it&#x27;s not my hair.  I am natural and this week mimics my own hair texture.  It is great for protective styling.  I received this wig just a few days after ordering. Very fast shipping &amp; a great transaction!</li>
            <li> The product I received was nothing like the one pictured.  What I got was a huge frizzy mass in at the top with nice defined coils near the nape and framing the face. I wound up throwing it away. Only giving 1 star because there are no negative stars.</li>
            <li> Great hair peice. Life saver. Great quality for money.exatly as advertised. Would purchase agin from seller and plan to do so soon.</li>
            <li> Boy was this wig a mistake.  First and most important the wig looks nothing like the photo.  Secondly, this was a big messy ball of hair that had some tight curls and other sections just kinky with no curls</li>
            <li> First, the wig was extremely frizzy right out the bag. I am almost certain that it was a used wig or else it would have been less manipulated. It is a synthetic wig so I didn&#x27;t expect it to be perfect. But I am the owner of several wigs and I know when one has been manipulated. It was inexpensive so it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to return it at this point. I am very disappointed because this wig comes highly recommended on the natural hair circuit. But be careful who you actually buy the wig from.</li>
            <li> I love this wig even though after I bought it I saw it at my local hair store. The one I bought off of Amazon was more kinkier and the texture wasn&#x27;t as nice  than the one at the store. I ended up purchasing it for about $10 more and I&#x27;m going to wear both of them. One for a casual look and the other for when I dress up.</li>
            <li> Got the wig in 2 days I was very excited to wear it&lt;br /&gt;The wig was so dried and the back was so fizzed that looks like over used .&lt;br /&gt;I try to put some condition to see of I could have the style on the picture but nothing brought the curly back.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I wasn&#x27;t luck or if the quality wasn&#x27;t like the advertiser .&lt;br /&gt;I would not try again at least online.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Drew in a 1b. If you like big natural looking hair, it&#x27;s the one for you. I love it.</li>
            <li> Color was wrong. The curls literally were gone in one day.  I want my money back!!!!!</li>
            <li> The hair was way to big, and nappy in the back. I felt like a mop head or a rag doll. The picture that shows the hair on this site looks nothing like it does in person very displeased.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first wig, it fits my head, light when worn, the lace front is a little shiny when cut, but its a simple fix by blending natural baby hairs, cutting the wig edges, creating baby hairs and overlapping the wig hairs. When I opened my wig, the curls when defined, especially in the front, and as you pass your hands thru, the hair gets bigger. The back of the wig does get frizzier/nappier than the front hairs in the lace. This wig is Kanekalon synthetic hair, but is not plastic-y and shiny looking at all, very natural !!; not like how really cheap synthetic weave.</li>
            <li> Every time i wear this i get so many compliments, it fits my face and people love it. The texture is just like my african american hair so everyone thinks ta my own natural hair. Will be ordering again soon</li>
            <li> This wig is AMAZING! It mimics natural hair so well. When I wear it people are like, &amp;#34;I love you hair!&amp;#34; I smile and say &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34;. Now buyer beware! You will have to shape this unit to your liking. I actually had to thin it out some, because it is a LOT of hair. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s still overwhelming on my fram. I thinkg that I am going to leave it a little longer this time. Oh, by the way, I have worn this wig since 1/2013 and I am on #3. It&#x27;s a fabulous buy. It&#x27;s winter, fall, summer, spring hair. It makes you look sooooo jazzy ladies. The lace is itchy which should be expected since it&#x27;s a cheaper unit and synthetic. I wear mine bobby pinned to one side and blend in my edges so that i appears to be literally growing from my scalp. The 1-B is a wonderful natural color. I do not suggest washing her, but if you do fill the sink with HOT water and shampoo (clarifying, not conditioning) take your unit and dunk her in the water repeatedly. You will see the makeup and dirt that accumulated with wear in the water. Fill the sink up again with plain water and dunk until the unit is free of shampoo. I put her on a hanger with clamps and hung her outside to air dry. Now, when I put her back on the hair was very fuzzy and hard. So, do not do this unless you have a back up unit or hairstyle, because you may not be pleased with the results and then you have a big fro and for some that&#x27;s not cute. BUT!!! I kept it and was able to work with it and I STILL wear her today. I&#x27;m going to throw her away when I get my 3rd unit. So, I will have #2 and the new one. The older she gets the more natural she looks. If you want her to get that way the first day then finger rake her and frizz it up. Trust me it will frizz very easily. As you can see I really like this unit. I will probably wear her for a while.</li>
            <li> This is awful!!!  Right out of the package it was a BIG FUZZY MESS!!!  Would not even waste as a Halloween costume!!!  It was tangled and uneven!  The lace was itchy and scratchy and the &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34; were more like a spider web!  Do not waste the time or money on this!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this wig because it so closely resembles my own hair.  Most people think it is my own.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed Drew. It looks so natural and I will probably order another one in a different color. I love the fact that it was very affordable and it didn&#x27;t take long to receive the wig. I have gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Really loved this wig.  first time wearing one and I get alot of compliments so I am happy about the product</li>
            <li> This Beshe Drew lace front wig, did not meet my expectations, it was too frizzy, it did not offer a confident fit, the hooks were not reliable, it was too much wig with little security.</li>
            <li> Love it thick and full. I cut the lace off because my hair is curly and blends with it. When u get it pull it out to desired fullness because curls are really tight.  FYI I add curl pudding to give that wet look.   OK I just read some reviews and YES it comes in tight tight curls kinda frizzy but u got to play with it and mold it to how you like it. DISCLAIMER IF YOU DO NOT LIKE SORRY LOVE BIG HAIR DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A great wig for a cheap price! I got compliments on this wig everyday that I wore it. People asking &amp;#34;is that your hair?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Wow, that&#x27;s a wig?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Where did you get it?&amp;#34; Its so soft, has movement, and has a beautiful curl. I watched YouTube for inspiration and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with this lace front wig. It&#x27;s full and the texture is soft and bouncy. I&#x27;m getting at lest 3more in different colors.</li>
            <li> For all the women with natural afro-kinky hair, this is not the wig for you.  Whoever manufactures this wig has changed the appearance.  This wig was my favorite because it blended well with my own natural kinky, curly hair.  The new ones are thin-haired and shiny with a smaller cap.  I can&#x27;t wear the new ones because the hair is too thin, too shiny and cap is too small.  Yes, I&#x27;m complaining because I don&#x27;t want anyone else to waste money on such inferior quality.</li>
            <li> I received the wig and it was a good wig that matched my hair but it was way too much hair for me. I thought that it was going to look like the picture on the model but it didn&#x27;t. If you like big hair, then this is the perfect wig for you.</li>
            <li> im about to get my second unit in a different color. absolutely love this wig. buy it, don&#x27;t hesitate at all</li>
            <li> I bought this unit after so many other naturals bought it and loved it. I loved it too... after trimming the bangs and cutting out some of the tracks. Because this wig has a LOT OF HAIR. So if you&#x27;re not used to that much hair, you&#x27;re going to want to thin it out a little and don&#x27;t worry, there are youtube vids that show you how. But if you&#x27;re not shy about working that much hair, go for it! I like this wig because it has several different curl patterns not unlike true ethnic natural hair. I also like how snug the wig cap fits. I bought mine to help with my transition in growing my hair back out after my 2nd big chop (because of heat damage) and it&#x27;s working out beautifully. I&#x27;ll probably buy a 2nd one after wearing this one out.</li>
            <li> I wish I had time to write a more detailed review because I love this wig</li>
            <li> The wig feels very nice. Not stiff! I was expecting it to feel very synthetic, but I was surprised. It&#x27;s a lot of hair, very full. I plan to take it to a stylist to thin it out for me because it&#x27;s more hair than I&#x27;m use to. Other than that, I like it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot longer and no way as full as the picture, and I have no idea what to do with it besides return it. I dont know if i&#x27;m supposed to shape it or what, but I got it so it would be easy not for me to have to find someone to cut and shape it.</li>
            <li> The piece arrived early and as advertised. Very nice tight curls. Big hair which is a change up from the units I normally wear but it didn&#x27;t take long to grow on me. Loved the look the first time I wore it. But by the second day it already started expanding and losing the nice curl pattern-- the middle looked like I had taken a brush to it with zero curl. I could tell it was going to &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; and frizz up within a few days but it looked like a completely different piece by day 3. Definitely wild child hair! It was a fun and sassy &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look which is why I fell in love with it from the youtube reviews but this hair did not hold up its look even with minimal wear so I was pretty disappointed to have to pack it away after about 2 weeks-- and only about 5 short and indoor uses. The lace front was typical, have to know how to work it-- but it was super scratchy IMO! Admittedly I got a LOT of compliments on the piece as a whole-- everyone thought it was my natural hair. The piece is ethnically correct in its random curl patterns which is a plus. It just failed to keep its beautiful look and grew about twice as large without me even picking it out.  I would recommend it for a one time dress up look. Would make for a great 70s costume but not everyday wear... unless you like the wild look.</li>
            <li> Package looked new, actual product inside was obviously old. curls were already out and some parts of the curly wig was straight. This was either on the floor and used to fit/try-on by customers.&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed with the quality and I know this would have been a great wig, will try again by another vendor.</li>
            <li> Perfect, perfect, perfect!</li>
            <li> Not the same wig anymore.</li>
