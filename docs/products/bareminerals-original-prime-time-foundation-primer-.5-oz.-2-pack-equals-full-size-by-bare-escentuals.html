            <li> Regarding the color...there is no color, it is clear.  That wasn&#x27;t an option in the questions above.  Does it last all day?  hard to tell, since it&#x27;s under my foundation.  It does seem to make the foundation application smoother.</li>
            <li> best primer of all I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Prime Time from Amazon, several times over the last few years. I am never disappointed. It is a quality product.

            <li> Love it. Look younger</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes on very smooth, makes skin feel silky smooth. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it makes any difference for purposes of primer whether you use it or not</li>
            <li> The best pre foundation set ever to be used with bare Minerals liquid foundation</li>
