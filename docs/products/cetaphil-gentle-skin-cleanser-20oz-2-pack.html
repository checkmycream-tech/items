            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>After the good results I had seen with Cetaphil, my girlfriend is using Cetaphil as well.</li>
            <li>GOOD  GOOD</li>
            <li>GOOD  </li>
            <li>GOOD GOOD GOOD GOO D</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I always use a toner (Thayers rose or lavender) after cleansing my skin.</li>
            <li>The Cetaphi Gentle Cleanser is great for use by people of all ages!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, my dermatologist was right!</li>
            <li>After use it,my skin is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin is very smooth; my girlfriend says my skin is \\&quot;buttery smooth.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>If I apply make up, I make sure I use OCeight before application.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I just love this prodsuct.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil is what I have been using for many years with my severe hand eczema condition.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I even had my girlfriend smell me to make sure I didn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li>Favorite product</li>
            <li>These 20 oz pump bottles are so much more convenient.</li>
            <li>GOOD VERY HELPFUL</li>
            <li>It cleans your skin and rinses off easily without leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to just rinse under warm water</li>
            <li>My skin gets very oily and I always thought I need a good face cleanser to help with the oil and get the dirt out of my pores (large pores).</li>
            <li>I just dealt with it because what is the point of taking a shower if I don&#x27;t use soap to get clean?</li>
            <li>Being able to simply pump when she&#x27;s in the bath allows me to always have one hand handy in case of emergency.</li>
            <li>So I am a true believer in the Cetaphil products.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t get sudsy, how is it supposed to clean, right?</li>
            <li>This is a great cleanser for average skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this to start a new skin regime using Cetaphil and Acne.org&#x27;s Benxoyl Peroxide since I wanted to try and get better results for complexion.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference with the first wash!</li>
            <li>Now, my skin is much more clearer and soft.</li>
            <li>However, the shipper of this product needs to fine a new way to ship it.  </li>
            <li>Well, I found my way to a forum about people who stopped using soap and shampoo entirely for a year and talked about how great they felt (and smelled, oddly enough).</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have water, you can lather and then wipe off... very, very gentle...</li>
            <li>However, the dermatologist assured me to give this a try and it should be more than enough for my skin.</li>
            <li>first, I didn&#x27;t like it because Cetaphil does not get sudsy like soap does.</li>
            <li>When I travel, I make sure I take a small bottle filled with Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding I like the gentle cleaning &amp; no drying element of this cleanser.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and you  don&#x27;t have to use water every time you need to wash your hands.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even calculate how much money I&#x27;ve thrown away all these years on over-priced cosmetic products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This product did not do much for me.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t ready to ditch cleaning products altogether.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anybody with acne problems.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, even though this Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser has fewer comedogenic ingredients than its counterpart the Cetaphil Daily Facial cleanser, it STILL contains Sodium Laurel Sulfate, which is a primary comedogenic</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive or dry skin, it&#x27;s SO worth it!  </li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really like this product, definitely noticed a decrease in breakouts when switching from my normal acne scrub to this one.</li>
            <li>Once or twice a month I use a facial mask with sulfer in it which helps my large pores.</li>
            <li>&amp; it was soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, the nozzle/pump had turned and squirted out some product, which made a mess for me to clean up when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>The next day my face was extremely soft!</li>
            <li>I pamper my skin &amp; have used some very expensive products to keep it smooth and wrinkle free @ 63.</li>
            <li>Before I started using Cetaphil, I was spending way too much for Olay, L&amp;#34;Oreal, Neutrogena and other cleansers, when all I needed was a simple product that gets the job  </li>
            <li>My 3 1/2 yr old granddaughters doctor recommended as she has dry skin.</li>

            <li> A few days later, I was half-expecting to smell bad.</li>
            <li> Did not clear out my face, and also made my face feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I found that putting fragranced creams on to moisturize was making the itching worse.  </li>
            <li> It was weird for me because I am in my late twenties.</li>
            <li> Areas of my face would start to peel and flake which was not attractive at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It seems that the sun causes my arms to itch, even keeping me awake at night.  I found that putting fragranced creams on to moisturize was making the itching worse.  Soaps are also fragranced.  I have substituted Cetaphil cleanser and Cetaphil moisturizing cream in my daily shower.  Since I switched to the Cetaphil cleanser the itching has stopped.  I am now adding sunblock as additional protection.</li>
            <li> For a few months I had a major issue with acne. It was weird for me because I am in my late twenties. I went to the dermatologist and he said the face wash I was using was too harsh. My skin gets very oily and I always thought I need a good face cleanser to help with the oil and get the dirt out of my pores (large pores). However, the dermatologist assured me to give this a try and it should be more than enough for my skin. Surprisingly, my dermatologist was right! Now, my skin is much more clearer and soft. The cleanser removes the makeup and surface oil. Once or twice a month I use a facial mask with sulfer in it which helps my large pores. I always use a toner (Thayers rose or lavender) after cleansing my skin. If I apply make up, I make sure I use OCeight before application. I will not be using any other face wash! Cetaphil is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is a great product that I&#x27;ve been using for over 15 years, so no problems there.  However, the shipper of this product needs to fine a new way to ship it.  When it arrived, the nozzle/pump had turned and squirted out some product, which made a mess for me to clean up when it arrived.  I don&#x27;t know what the answer is, but something to protect the nozzle from unlocking and leaking product.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to use this on my daughter who has eczema, but I noticed it has parabens in it, which is not good even in small amounts. So I returned it. Won&#x27;t use it on my skin anymore either.</li>
            <li> So when winter came this year, all the moisturizer in the world couldn&#x27;t help my skin after washing (with dove!) until i used this... just so you know, this stuff doesn&#x27;t lather... it&#x27;s a lotion that you massage into skin and then rinse off... if you don&#x27;t have water, you can lather and then wipe off... very, very gentle...</li>
            <li> This product was dermatologist recommended. I have used it for a number of years and find it to be extremely beneficial for my skin condition.</li>
            <li> Granted it&#x27;s a little pricey,. but if you have sensitive or dry skin, it&#x27;s SO worth it!  I could tell a difference with the first wash!</li>
            <li> Recommended years ago to me when I was scratching myself to death...obviously not to be taken literally!  Its just a superb product.  Don&#x27;t use anything else.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser. I have skin issues &amp; this keeps it from not drying out.&lt;br /&gt;I tried some Clinque but there was no difference.  The Clinque rep told me the ingredients are basically the same. So why spend the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is it does not remove all my make-up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for all skin types, I use it am and pm, my husband also. Let the face moisturized</li>
            <li> I just love this prodsuct.  I started using it 4 years ago after my dermatologist recommended  it.  I have dry, sensative skin so this works good for my skin type.  It cleans your skin and rinses off easily without leaving any residue.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I don&#x27;t use any other cleanser.  Before I started using Cetaphil, I was spending way too much for Olay, L&amp;#34;Oreal, Neutrogena and other cleansers, when all I needed was a simple product that gets the job  done.&lt;br /&gt;And also, buy it from Amazon.  I got 2 20oz. bottles for the price I used to pay for 1 16oz bottle at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Wonderful buy getting two 20 oz bottles for a 16 oz price! I&#x27;m finding I like the gentle cleaning &amp; no drying element of this cleanser. I suffer very dry skin this is great!</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is what I have been using for many years with my severe hand eczema condition.  It is gentle and you  don&#x27;t have to use water every time you need to wash your hands.  Doctor recommended.</li>
            <li> I had a sleepover with my friend a couple days ago. At night she used it and I tried it to see what would happen to my skin. The next day my face was extremely soft! Very good product.</li>
            <li> The Cetaphi Gentle Cleanser is great for use by people of all ages! My 3 1/2 yr old granddaughters doctor recommended as she has dry skin. Within a few days my daughter &amp; I noticed how much brighter her skin looked &amp; it was soft to the touch. I pamper my skin &amp; have used some very expensive products to keep it smooth and wrinkle free @ 63. I decided to try it. I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s not greasey or oily.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, definitely noticed a decrease in breakouts when switching from my normal acne scrub to this one. I highly recommend to anybody with acne problems.</li>
            <li> Very mild,Non - irritating to the skin.When i Use it,my skin without any discomfort.No pungent taste.After use it,my skin is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even calculate how much money I&#x27;ve thrown away all these years on over-priced cosmetic products.&lt;br /&gt;This Cetaphil Cleanser is all I will ever need from now on. My face feels baby-soft, even before I put on Moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Good for the price. I thought I was getting the face wash and not the body wash but that was my fault</li>
            <li> I bought this to start a new skin regime using Cetaphil and Acne.org&#x27;s Benxoyl Peroxide since I wanted to try and get better results for complexion. After perusing the forums on Acne.org and eliminating some facial cleansers (including the Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser) I thought I give this combination a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, even though this Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser has fewer comedogenic ingredients than its counterpart the Cetaphil Daily Facial cleanser, it STILL contains Sodium Laurel Sulfate, which is a primary comedogenic surfectant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this cleanser definitely dehydrated made my complexion and breakouts were very common. I just wash my hands with it now.</li>
            <li> This cleanser can be used as a lotion, too. Cetaphil was recommended to me by a Dermatologist, Dr. Zumwalt, over 25 years ago when I went to see him because of a rash on my hands and legs. Although the rash was due to stress, this lotion helps to soften and soothe the rash enough to make it disappear. When I use other lotions, the rash reappears. So I am a true believer in the Cetaphil products.</li>
            <li> This product did not do much for me. Did not clear out my face, and also made my face feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. My dermatologist recommends using Cetaphil either in bar form or liquid.</li>
            <li> I got tired of always having really dry skin after taking a shower. Areas of my face would start to peel and flake which was not attractive at all. I just dealt with it because what is the point of taking a shower if I don&#x27;t use soap to get clean? Well, I found my way to a forum about people who stopped using soap and shampoo entirely for a year and talked about how great they felt (and smelled, oddly enough). I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to just rinse under warm water yet so I decided to try out a recommendation from one of the posters about using Cetaphil instead of soap and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I didn&#x27;t like it because Cetaphil does not get sudsy like soap does. If it doesn&#x27;t get sudsy, how is it supposed to clean, right? It&#x27;s just a liquid that I rub all over me and then rinse off. However, I just kept using it because I did not want to go back to soap and I wasn&#x27;t ready to ditch cleaning products altogether. A few days later, I was half-expecting to smell bad. I even had my girlfriend smell me to make sure I didn&#x27;t stink. The paranoia went on for a couple weeks before I realized that Cetaphil does, in fact, work. And it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using only Cetaphil for about two years now on my body and my hair. I will NEVER go back to soap and shampoo again. When I travel, I make sure I take a small bottle filled with Cetaphil. My skin no longer gets dry and flaky. In fact, my skin is very smooth; my girlfriend says my skin is \\&quot;buttery smooth.\\&quot; After the good results I had seen with Cetaphil, my girlfriend is using Cetaphil as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser for average skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make it greasy. Favorite product</li>
            <li> These 20 oz pump bottles are so much more convenient. I use these for my daughter who is 7 months. She has very sensitive skin so this is all I can bathe her with. Being able to simply pump when she&#x27;s in the bath allows me to always have one hand handy in case of emergency. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The formulation I received was not the non comenogenic type.  I have been using what I was sent, but would rather have what was recommended by my dermatologist</li>
            <li> GOOD GOOD GOOD GOO D GOOD  GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD  FD  FDSG GOOD  GOOD VERY HELPFUL</li>
