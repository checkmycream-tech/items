            <li>This is a great deal for 10 treatments!</li>
            <li>Great purchase!</li>
            <li>Feels great!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li>However they are very nice to use and they make my under eyes feel refreshed!</li>
            <li>They make me feel great after using them.</li>
            <li>Not mention two of my friends asked me what I&#x27;ve been doing since my face it looked so great...</li>
            <li>When you take off the patches, your eye wrinkles look great.</li>
            <li>Great idea.</li>
            <li>Love these!!</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; it works too !!</li>
            <li>Omg this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Nice product to have around!</li>
            <li>This product feels so good after being used.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a good source of moisture for under the eye area..  </li>
            <li>I would get good sleep</li>
            <li>, I hear they&#x27;re really good.</li>
            <li>Honestly...cukes would probably do as good.  </li>
            <li>and it made me feel a great deal better.</li>
            <li>I love these eye patches!</li>
            <li>I really love these eye patches!</li>
            <li>I love these eye patches!</li>
            <li>I love these eye patches!  </li>
            <li>My eyes were more purple AFTER!</li>
            <li>Expect it to be filmy and gel like because it&#x27;s not an every day use kind of thing.</li>
            <li>Oh well ~ When they sometimes price this as $8.88, it&#x27;s a good deal :3</li>
            <li>but after getting them placed it felt nice and relaxing.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>But if you just want to just maintain healthy looking skin or give yourself a spa treat at home, I think this is a nice addition to your skin regimen.</li>
            <li>These are nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love them, and use them often to relax or look more awake.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s probably not going to do you any magic to improve your eye</li>
            <li>look anyway at all, but it is refreshing and moisturizing foe your eyes</li>
            <li>I love these patches.</li>
            <li>This thing works like magic.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>A miracle product wdnt be affordable either so don&#x27;t purchase these for magical effects.</li>
            <li>so I cant say for sure if this product cures you of it..</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these!</li>
            <li>but it feels refreshing..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li>These are ok, but i won&#x27;t be buying them again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying these for over a year now and love them.</li>
            <li>I FRICKING LOVE</li>
            <li>Peel off the cover and place under your eyes as directed and you will see a lovely difference after 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It gives me more moisture.</li>
            <li>I am in love with all Korean skin care and cosmetics and these babies didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>:) I love this product.</li>
            <li>I tend on trying more Korean products though</li>
            <li>Very refreshing to my under-eye area and really smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are so good for right before you go out.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;d super cute!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a nice and fun way to treat yourself, and the price is okay for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to reuse them again because some solution remains in the reclosable plastic case.</li>
            <li>Pretty neat-feels nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice cool temperature helps calm you and your puffiness.</li>
            <li>Also remember that great results will show but it takes time especially when it come to under eyes.</li>
            <li>They work great, I bought them for my mom, and they actually work</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge difference, but it does make me feel more refreshed and pampered after using it.</li>
            <li>These are OK--they provide good moisturization, but it does not last.</li>
            <li>put these in fridge for cool eye treat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice thanks very match</li>
            <li>Works good on my dry eye skin.</li>
            <li>Other eye patches I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t come like this, so it was a pleasant detail.</li>
            <li>They always leave my eyes feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>But it feels fresh after applying the eye patch.</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE these for my crepey, puffy over 50 year old eyes.  </li>
            <li>I  apply after a warm shower, I can definitely tell a difference.</li>
            <li>super cheap!&amp;#34; haha of course!</li>
            <li>I read about these and thought that the price was right and should give them a try.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this previously and the eye patches were good.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see very much difference in my eye area.</li>
            <li>Of course on their own they aren&#x27;t going to work miracles, but if you follow a regiment similar to that used by Koreans (Wash/Double wash, Toner, Eye Patches, Eye Cream, Moisturizer, etc etc etc), they are a nice little treat for your eyes.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The only way you&#x27;re going to see great anti-aging results is concerted, long term effort with the correct products, rest, diet, hydration, sun protection, etc.</li>
            <li>It feels like it is absorbed very well</li>
            <li>: when you peel the patch, make sure you only put on the fabric-y part....</li>
            <li>Absolutely love under eye patches, and these are no different!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything other than feel nice.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re shaped big enough to cover a good amount of &amp;#34;under eye&amp;#34; space.</li>
            <li>It arrived before my expectation, and they were packed really well.</li>
            <li>As for the product itself I dot really kno if I like it too much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very moisturizing eye mask.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say they are miracle workers though as I din&#x27;t notice that much difference after use except[t</li>
            <li>i really like these.</li>
            <li>They stay on very well.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very cooling and help a lot with hydration under the eye.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does much...</li>
            <li>I like it a lot, and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>They really make a difference around the eyes.</li>
            <li>The winkles are only filled in for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>biggest issue is they don&#x27;t fit well to the under eye area---I have to trim them with the scissors prior to application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this....</li>
            <li>First off, WOW....</li>
            <li>I love how they feel after I have them removed, however, I don&#x27;t think that it helps mask away any of my dark circles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless, it feels refreshing, and I do notice that my dark circles are less prominent than when I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li>It can get messy so if you&#x27;re very OCD and wouldn&#x27;t like dealing with the product, a under eye cream or roll on would be better for you.</li>
            <li>This is just decent I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen results yet, but I&#x27;ve only used them once, but other than that, I love them!</li>
            <li>It feels super moisturizing, but I personally don&#x27;t see any immediate changes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend storing these in the freezer.</li>
            <li>They are soothing under the eye and highly moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that you really can&#x27;t do much requiring you to sit up while having them on, but other than that they worked excellent for me.</li>
            <li>although I still drink 2 cups or more of coffee to get up everyday</li>
            <li>I mean, they feel nice and cooling on, but I saw no difference afterwards.</li>
            <li>Its a little better, not completely gone, but its fun to do</li>
            <li>I also expected a sample from the seller, Cosmetic Love, but it was only a circle lenses coupon...</li>
            <li>If anything they make me feel like I look more awake and refreshed, but with dark circles apparent.</li>
            <li>Not sure how much &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; it actually does but it feels fun and is fun to use.</li>
            <li>I really like the seller also as they we cool enough to give samples of the other products along with the patches.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a bit hard to figure out from the packaging, they have a little film attached to them that you have to throw out, but they&#x27;re very nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still fairly young (early twenties), so I can&#x27;t say anything about the wrinkle fighting action in these.</li>
            <li>the skin felt soft.</li>
            <li>Made skin soft, and reduced eye circles</li>
            <li>I think this is a product that requires frequent use for the results to show.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Completely moisturizes</li>
            <li>A couple of eye payches in each pack are kind of misaligned in their thin clear plastic container</li>
            <li>I use this at night time once every other week to help calm my under eye circles/bags.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I noticed a huge difference, but I use these eye patches on and off for whenever I feel like i need a pick me up.</li>
            <li>I thought all of their products are just great, but actually lots of their products are useless and just expensive, but cute looking.</li>
            <li>I have only used one package so far.  </li>
            <li>Also I read an article that says that collagen doesn&#x27;t really work since its too big of a molecule to go deep enough into your pores.</li>
            <li>Bye tired eyes :))</li>
            <li>Not a miracle but a nice shot of moisture for dry and tired under eye area that lasts all day</li>
            <li>~ Maybe if you used it consistently, there would be slight differences.</li>
            <li>There are other products, which are cheaper but really useful.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes to my dark circles or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Do them while lying down as they can slip, they&#x27;re very saturated in product.</li>
            <li>They do not hold the cold temperature for very long, but the initial cooling is a nice addition!</li>
            <li>But it not a long lasting affect.</li>
            <li>helps reduce fine lines, dryness, and tired eyes for a temporary fix for going or a date night.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Nonetheless, it feels refreshing, and I do notice that my dark circles are less prominent than when I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> It can get messy so if you&#x27;re very OCD and wouldn&#x27;t like dealing with the product, a under eye cream or roll on would be better for you.</li>
            <li> This is just decent I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen results yet, but I&#x27;ve only used them once, but other than that, I love them!</li>
            <li> It feels super moisturizing, but I personally don&#x27;t see any immediate changes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend storing these in the freezer.</li>
            <li> They are soothing under the eye and highly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that you really can&#x27;t do much requiring you to sit up while having them on, but other than that they worked excellent for me.</li>
            <li> although I still drink 2 cups or more of coffee to get up everyday</li>
            <li> I mean, they feel nice and cooling on, but I saw no difference afterwards.</li>
            <li> Its a little better, not completely gone, but its fun to do</li>
            <li> I also expected a sample from the seller, Cosmetic Love, but it was only a circle lenses coupon...</li>
            <li> If anything they make me feel like I look more awake and refreshed, but with dark circles apparent.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; it actually does but it feels fun and is fun to use.</li>
            <li> I really like the seller also as they we cool enough to give samples of the other products along with the patches.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit hard to figure out from the packaging, they have a little film attached to them that you have to throw out, but they&#x27;re very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still fairly young (early twenties), so I can&#x27;t say anything about the wrinkle fighting action in these.</li>
            <li> the skin felt soft.</li>
            <li> Made skin soft, and reduced eye circles</li>
            <li> I think this is a product that requires frequent use for the results to show.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Completely moisturizes</li>
            <li> A couple of eye payches in each pack are kind of misaligned in their thin clear plastic container</li>
            <li> I use this at night time once every other week to help calm my under eye circles/bags.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I noticed a huge difference, but I use these eye patches on and off for whenever I feel like i need a pick me up.</li>
            <li> I thought all of their products are just great, but actually lots of their products are useless and just expensive, but cute looking.</li>
            <li> I have only used one package so far.  </li>
            <li> Also I read an article that says that collagen doesn&#x27;t really work since its too big of a molecule to go deep enough into your pores.</li>
            <li> Bye tired eyes :))</li>
            <li> Not a miracle but a nice shot of moisture for dry and tired under eye area that lasts all day</li>
            <li> ~ Maybe if you used it consistently, there would be slight differences.</li>
            <li> There are other products, which are cheaper but really useful.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes to my dark circles or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Do them while lying down as they can slip, they&#x27;re very saturated in product.</li>
            <li> They do not hold the cold temperature for very long, but the initial cooling is a nice addition!</li>
            <li> But it not a long lasting affect.</li>
            <li> helps reduce fine lines, dryness, and tired eyes for a temporary fix for going or a date night.</li>
            <li> These little gems are decent.  </li>
            <li> This is the first I write common at amazon</li>
            <li> other 15 were ok, but I think it&#x27;s a useless product.</li>
            <li> , I like to keep them in the fridge for a little depuffing action too.</li>
            <li> There was really NO, even not a tiny, difference after using all of them...</li>
            <li> you will see minimal differences, although, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is after leaving on for 15 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> However, whenever I&#x27;m tired and need a bit of pampering, I use these as opposed to face masks because I can quickly slip these on, and go on about my day without worrying about them slipping off or scaring anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only used two due to price of product and haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet.......  </li>
            <li> my eyes have a tendency to feel dry</li>
            <li> I leave them on for about 15 minutes and they dry up as your skin soaks in the liquid stuff.</li>
            <li> Leave them on for about 15 minutes until they are almost dry.  </li>
            <li> used and didn&#x27;t see a single difference.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to get it a week and a half earlier than the arrival date.</li>
            <li> and I say ALL turned out to be empty and there was just liquid inside.</li>
            <li> but they were empty with the pieces of paper and liquid inside.</li>
            <li> I had a rough night)</li>
            <li> I really do not notice a difference at all</li>
            <li> Soothing , I just started using these last week, under eyelines  less visible!</li>
            <li> I leave them on while I&#x27;m getting other things done in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them every other day/every two days and notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t expect miracles from this or any other product.</li>
            <li> They make it look less hollow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s placebo or these other reviewers just have less substantial bags/darkness under the eyes, but the product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Put them on before makeup and watch the transformation of you dark circles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> but i have not seen any changes in dark circles.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would help with my dark circles</li>
            <li> If you have dark circles under your eyes, don&#x27;t expect this to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I use these in the morning to reduce my dark circles, they do a semi well job I think.</li>
            <li> Takes away puffiness (put them in the fridge) and makes that thin skin below the eye really soft and plumpy.</li>
            <li> Also came with a little packet of serum sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also like the little plastic case they come in.</li>
            <li> and it does help a little, and its inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> I wish I had the discipline to use these every day - they definitely make me look less tired when I use them.  </li>
            <li> My wife and kids have told me for years that I have very dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> no use waste of money</li>
            <li> and my eyes were heavy</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s a waste of money with no effect.</li>
            <li> I was expecting actual gel patches, but they are just thin sheets of paper with a gel substance on them.</li>
            <li> or I would go broke using them everyday!</li>
            <li> it was not comfortable!</li>
            <li> I suffer from dark circles under my eyes, and often tired eyes.</li>
            <li> I like using them in the morning if I am looking tired and a night to add a little pampering to my routine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and stuff, but collagen cannot literally inject itself into your system through the skin like that, at least from what I know.</li>
            <li> not a good product, do not stick to skin.  </li>
            <li> I was dumb and accidentally put on the plastic separator on my face...</li>
            <li> But I was a bit confused because of how its packaged it doesn&#x27;t look like there is two eye patches</li>
            <li> but it made it worse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really bad under eye bags or dark circles(unless</li>
            <li> I have really bad dark circles.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use them to see if I can see dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> DON NOT BUY - Irritate my eyes severely, too bad that it is too late to return it.</li>
            <li> I had really bad jet lag</li>
            <li> hmm :(</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but after trying this after bad night sleep… Amassing!</li>
            <li> I am VERY disappointed with this purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these eye patches! I use them on the mornings I&#x27;m looking especially panda like or puffy. Of course on their own they aren&#x27;t going to work miracles, but if you follow a regiment similar to that used by Koreans (Wash/Double wash, Toner, Eye Patches, Eye Cream, Moisturizer, etc etc etc), they are a nice little treat for your eyes. They always leave my eyes feeling fresh and moisturized. I have to limit myself to one every once in a while or I would go broke using them everyday! Definitely buying them again.</li>
            <li> It arrived before my expectation, and they were packed really well.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing the eye patches. I love them, and use them often to relax or look more awake. I would highly recommend storing these in the freezer. They do not hold the cold temperature for very long, but the initial cooling is a nice addition! I have not seen a change in wrinkles from using these, but that was not my goal.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast. As for the product itself I dot really kno if I like it too much I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of change as the product claims to do but maybe it&#x27;s jus me</li>
            <li> Not a miracle but a nice shot of moisture for dry and tired under eye area that lasts all day, I like to keep them in the fridge for a little depuffing action too. Do them while lying down as they can slip, they&#x27;re very saturated in product. This is a great deal for 10 treatments! These were sold out on Soko Glam.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, I buy it at DEC1, after I get it, I found the expiration Date is 2014/9/29. I cannot believe it. This is the first I write common at amazon</li>
            <li> This product feels so good after being used. I use this at night time once every other week to help calm my under eye circles/bags. It&#x27;s a very moisturizing eye mask. Expect it to be filmy and gel like because it&#x27;s not an every day use kind of thing. It&#x27;s nice cool temperature helps calm you and your puffiness. Also remember that great results will show but it takes time especially when it come to under eyes. You can add this to one of your under eye treatments. It can get messy so if you&#x27;re very OCD and wouldn&#x27;t like dealing with the product, a under eye cream or roll on would be better for you.</li>
            <li> This is just decent I&#x27;d say. It&#x27;s moisturizing and stuff, but collagen cannot literally inject itself into your system through the skin like that, at least from what I know. So it&#x27;s probably not going to do you any magic to improve your eye look anyway at all, but it is refreshing and moisturizing foe your eyes so that&#x27;s the pro part ~ Maybe if you used it consistently, there would be slight differences. I also expected a sample from the seller, Cosmetic Love, but it was only a circle lenses coupon... hmm :( Oh well ~ When they sometimes price this as $8.88, it&#x27;s a good deal :3</li>
            <li> I love these patches. They are soothing under the eye and highly moisturizing. I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> Oh.My.Gosh! It actually works!!!</li>
            <li> This thing works like magic. love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a nice and fun way to treat yourself, and the price is okay for the amount you get. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge difference, but it does make me feel more refreshed and pampered after using it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit hard to figure out from the packaging, they have a little film attached to them that you have to throw out, but they&#x27;re very nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember ordering these, but when I receive something in the mail with my name on it, I don&#x27;t ask questions.</li>
            <li> used and didn&#x27;t see a single difference. what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> no use waste of money</li>
            <li> I am VERY disappointed with this purchase. I have purchased this previously and the eye patches were good. However, this time I purchased the 10 and they ALL and I say ALL turned out to be empty and there was just liquid inside. The patches were not inside! I don&#x27;t know what happened but they were empty with the pieces of paper and liquid inside.</li>
            <li> Seem to work okay.  Can&#x27;t say they are miracle workers though as I din&#x27;t notice that much difference after use except[t the skin felt soft. The instructions are in an Asian language with no English translation.  Had to go online for use instructions.</li>
            <li> Love these!! Bye tired eyes :))</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but after trying this after bad night sleep… Amassing! My eyes look as I have 8 hours baby sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend patches to friends.</li>
            <li> I wish I had the discipline to use these every day - they definitely make me look less tired when I use them.  I leave them on while I&#x27;m getting other things done in the morning.</li>
            <li> Pretty neat-feels nice. Not sure how much &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; it actually does but it feels fun and is fun to use.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this product.</li>
            <li> Made skin soft, and reduced eye circles</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see improvement after using for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; it works too !!</li>
            <li> i really like these. my eyes have a tendency to feel dry so these patches help give extra moisture and allows concealer to spread easier.</li>
            <li> DON NOT BUY - Irritate my eyes severely, too bad that it is too late to return it.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing to my under-eye area and really smooth and easy to use. Absolutely love them. I haven&#x27;t seen results yet, but I&#x27;ve only used them once, but other than that, I love them!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re shaped big enough to cover a good amount of &amp;#34;under eye&amp;#34; space. They stay on very well. I can walk around and do chores around the house...and they&#x27;re maintain their position! It feels super moisturizing, but I personally don&#x27;t see any immediate changes. I think this is a product that requires frequent use for the results to show.</li>
            <li> I really love these eye patches! They make me feel great after using them. I had really bad jet lag and my eyes were heavy and so I tried using these and it made me feel a great deal better. Not mention two of my friends asked me what I&#x27;ve been doing since my face it looked so great... I attribute their reactions to this product because I saw them a day or two after using the patches. I really like the seller also as they we cool enough to give samples of the other products along with the patches.</li>
            <li> These little gems are decent.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything but a bit of refreshment tho.  They are not a miracle product.  A miracle product wdnt be affordable either so don&#x27;t purchase these for magical effects.</li>
            <li> Great purchase! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love these eye patches! They are so good for right before you go out. Put them on before makeup and watch the transformation of you dark circles and puffy eyes. My only complaint would be that you really can&#x27;t do much requiring you to sit up while having them on, but other than that they worked excellent for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I noticed a huge difference, but I use these eye patches on and off for whenever I feel like i need a pick me up. I have sensitive skin and this did not break me out or give me a rash or bumps. I would say it helps to moisturize the under eye area and I think that helps with my overall complexion. I don&#x27;t have really bad under eye bags or dark circles(unless I had a rough night) so I cant say for sure if this product cures you of it.. But if you just want to just maintain healthy looking skin or give yourself a spa treat at home, I think this is a nice addition to your skin regimen.</li>
            <li> My wife and kids have told me for years that I have very dark circles under my eyes.  I read about these and thought that the price was right and should give them a try.  After 10 days of using them regularly I saw no improvement and neither did my family.  I am not going to trash the product because I believe that my problem my be from age and not anything this product can correct.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see very much difference in my eye area.</li>
            <li> I have only used one package so far.  I like it overall.  I don&#x27;t know if I could tell a difference or not.  I will continue to use them to see if I can see dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> Soothing , I just started using these last week, under eyelines  less visible!</li>
            <li> They work great, I bought them for my mom, and they actually work</li>
            <li> Completely moisturizes but i have not seen any changes in dark circles. But it feels fresh after applying the eye patch. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fun but doesn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes to my dark circles or wrinkles. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again. It seems like it&#x27;s a waste of money with no effect.</li>
            <li> I mean, they feel nice and cooling on, but I saw no difference afterwards.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE these for my crepey, puffy over 50 year old eyes.  Takes away puffiness (put them in the fridge) and makes that thin skin below the eye really soft and plumpy.</li>
            <li> First off, WOW.... I didn&#x27;t expect to get it a week and a half earlier than the arrival date. Next is, I&#x27;ve only used it once so I haven&#x27;t noticed anything but after getting them placed it felt nice and relaxing. After I took them off I could sort of feel a difference, so I would say it works well with my skin. I can&#x27;t wait until I start seeing results.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these! They&#x27;re very cooling and help a lot with hydration under the eye. I&#x27;ve been using them every other day/every two days and notice a difference. Ladies, don&#x27;t expect miracles from this or any other product. The only way you&#x27;re going to see great anti-aging results is concerted, long term effort with the correct products, rest, diet, hydration, sun protection, etc.</li>
            <li> I like these patches. I put them on sometimes before bed n sit with some tea. I leave them on for about 15 minutes and they dry up as your skin soaks in the liquid stuff. I really do not notice a difference at all but it feels refreshing.. Hehe</li>
            <li> anything collagen for under my eyes I would recommend. It feels like it is absorbed very well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice difference but it&#x27;d super cute!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to this product. I used it only once.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.. i use it when i don&#x27;t want to do a face mask but want to depuff eyes</li>
            <li> Feels great!!! Also came with a little packet of serum sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: when you peel the patch, make sure you only put on the fabric-y part.... I was dumb and accidentally put on the plastic separator on my face... it was not comfortable! haha</li>
            <li> I ordered this again.</li>
            <li> These are nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. When you take off the patches, your eye wrinkles look great. But it not a long lasting affect. If the price doesn&#x27;t go up, I will probably buy again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love under eye patches, and these are no different! I suffer from dark circles under my eyes, and often tired eyes. I&#x27;m still fairly young (early twenties), so I can&#x27;t say anything about the wrinkle fighting action in these. However, whenever I&#x27;m tired and need a bit of pampering, I use these as opposed to face masks because I can quickly slip these on, and go on about my day without worrying about them slipping off or scaring anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution does remain a bit sticky on the skin after you take it off, and unless you rub the remaining solution into the skin, it&#x27;ll stay sticky for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it feels refreshing, and I do notice that my dark circles are less prominent than when I don&#x27;t use them. Also like the little plastic case they come in. Makes it easy to reuse them again because some solution remains in the reclosable plastic case. Other eye patches I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t come like this, so it was a pleasant detail.</li>
            <li> These are ok, but i won&#x27;t be buying them again.  I was expecting actual gel patches, but they are just thin sheets of paper with a gel substance on them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice thanks very match</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does much...</li>
            <li> helps reduce fine lines, dryness, and tired eyes for a temporary fix for going or a date night. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for over a year now and love them. I  apply after a warm shower, I can definitely tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I love these eye patches!  I use them for my puffy, morning eyes and they work.  I apply these after cleansing and toning.  Leave them on for about 15 minutes until they are almost dry.  Once I peel these off, my puffiness is gone!  I place them back in the plastic package and then back into the clamshell and use them again the next morning.  I know these are one -time use but there is plenty of solution left to re-soak and re-use again so I get 20 applications.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would help with my dark circles but they didn&#x27;t. However they are very nice to use and they make my under eyes feel refreshed!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, and very moisturizing. I&#x27;m very happy with them. I would buy them again. But I was a bit confused because of how its packaged it doesn&#x27;t look like there is two eye patches but there are, so keep looking. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Omg this product is amazing! In the mornings I put these puppies on in the morning before doing my makeup and now I sometimes don&#x27;t use under eye concealer! My eye bags are gone and my skin feels so hydrated! although I still drink 2 cups or more of coffee to get up everyday my eyes don&#x27;t show it!</li>
            <li> I thought &amp;#34;wow! super cheap!&amp;#34; haha of course! The expire date was already over by 5/20!&lt;br /&gt;The other 15 were ok, but I think it&#x27;s a useless product. There was really NO, even not a tiny, difference after using all of them... There are other products, which are cheaper but really useful.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it just because it&#x27;s from ETUDE HOUSE... I thought all of their products are just great, but actually lots of their products are useless and just expensive, but cute looking.</li>
            <li> Give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;I like them!!!. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes with the puffiness. However, it&#x27;s a good source of moisture for under the eye area..  After use your eyes will feel refreshed. Nice product to have around!</li>
            <li> I FRICKING LOVE THESE THINGS. They really make a difference around the eyes. They make it look less hollow.</li>
            <li> Peel off the cover and place under your eyes as directed and you will see a lovely difference after 20 minutes.  Try using on a slant board</li>
            <li> Used it twice haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> If you have dark circles under your eyes, don&#x27;t expect this to make a difference. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s placebo or these other reviewers just have less substantial bags/darkness under the eyes, but the product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Works good on my dry eye skin. It gives me more moisture.</li>
            <li> I am in love with all Korean skin care and cosmetics and these babies didn&#x27;t disappoint. I like using them in the morning if I am looking tired and a night to add a little pampering to my routine. I will repurchase these over and over again!</li>
            <li> These are OK--they provide good moisturization, but it does not last. The winkles are only filled in for a couple of hours. If I use these in the morning then by lunch I&#x27;m creasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue is they don&#x27;t fit well to the under eye area---I have to trim them with the scissors prior to application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fain and rather neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will not re-order these</li>
            <li> Just got the package. Thanks a lot :) I love this product.</li>
            <li> The package came from overseas so it takes a while to receive. A couple of eye payches in each pack are kind of misaligned in their thin clear plastic container so I had to stretch them out coz the patches got wrinkled. They made my under eye areas hydrated though.</li>
            <li> not a good product, do not stick to skin.  Will never order again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this....but it made it worse. My eyes were more purple AFTER! I have really bad dark circles. I would get good sleep but I don&#x27;t have time. I was hoping this would brighten my eyes but instead it concentrated my evenly spread out purple to one spot making my eyes look darker. Also I read an article that says that collagen doesn&#x27;t really work since its too big of a molecule to go deep enough into your pores. So yeah. I tend on trying more Korean products though, I hear they&#x27;re really good.</li>
            <li> I love how they feel after I have them removed, however, I don&#x27;t think that it helps mask away any of my dark circles. If anything they make me feel like I look more awake and refreshed, but with dark circles apparent.</li>
            <li> Reduced puffiness and added moisture!</li>
            <li> I use these in the morning to reduce my dark circles, they do a semi well job I think. Its a little better, not completely gone, but its fun to do and it does help a little, and its inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all will return</li>
            <li> Great idea. Doesn&#x27;t do anything other than feel nice.</li>
            <li> I like the eye patches. you will see minimal differences, although, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is after leaving on for 15 minutes or so. you will see some mark from that patch that left under your eyelid</li>
            <li> put these in fridge for cool eye treat.  Honestly...cukes would probably do as good.  I am 51 and getting those squint lines so I was hoping they would help.  Only used two due to price of product and haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet.......  We shall see....</li>
