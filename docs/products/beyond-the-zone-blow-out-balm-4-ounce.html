            <li>It goes on kind of oily, which is great for my hair because it eats up any moisture it can get, YET when I blow it out, it&#x27;s not oily AT ALL.</li>

            <li>THE BEST if you do not even blow dry.  </li>
            <li>This blowout balm makes my hair really nice and sleek and super shiny.  </li>
            <li>It would also be suitable for fine hair because it&#x27;s so light.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Got2b is available at grocery stores, Walgreens and CVS and Herstyler is on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I do love this product very much.</li>
            <li>I am almost finished with my first bottle and am about to order 2 more.  </li>
            <li>I have more hair than most people and it also happens to be extremely THICK and it works great, plus I think it really does do a good job of preventing heat damage because I don&#x27;t have it, despite using heat tools regularly</li>
            <li>Great product BUT packed incorrectly - it leaked on other items in my order....</li>
            <li>From the very first time I used this</li>
            <li>I live in a climate that is about 90% humidity most of the time so keeping my hair from &amp;quot;poofing up&amp;quot;</li>
            <li>Now I can go outside and not even worry about it any more!</li>
            <li>Before I apply either of these products I make sure my hair is damp, not wet.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this balm is suitable for fine hair because it&#x27;s somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this balm is suitable for fine hair because it&#x27;s somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li>I tried many products for blow drying, but finally found the one I like</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to help control the dryness of my hair when I straighten it, because it is so curly, and this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It doesnt even make it greasy, but the first try, i did use a bit too much.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much on the first go around.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much on the first go around.</li>
            <li>Some would even guess I&#x27;m naturally very curly, if I managed to gel or hairspray the frizzies or flyaways.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used just about every name brand product out there that promises to straighten/de-frizz your hair, and nothing I have tried has really worked.  </li>
            <li>10 minutes with a dryer, which makes it shiny and straight, and all I need to do is spend 3-5 minutes with an iron just to get any links out.  </li>
            <li>On days when I wear my hair straight</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised:  decreases blow dry speed, protects from heat, and goes in light.  </li>
            <li>I love how this makes my hair feel when I let I dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>If i choose to blow dry, its tames it &amp; creates a smooth style.  </li>
            <li>The main reason why I was turned off by heat protection products.</li>
            <li>but I get better results with these two Smooth Criminal products.  </li>
            <li>Use just a little bit at first because it&#x27;s easy to overdo it and your hair will lack body.  </li>
            <li>be sure not to use too much or use it dry, and I actually think there are stronger heat protectants out there, as my hair still gets a tad damaged.</li>
            <li>then I put a little more before I straighten and man my hair is soft , shiny and moves around instead of just laying on my head.</li>
            <li>and seriously WOW.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually really soft and doesn&#x27;t feel like I fried it like I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair &amp; it gives it the curly look with the wired look.  </li>
            <li>I use the concentrator nozzle and a round brush to smooth out my waves (my hair is schizoid because the wave isn&#x27;t evenly distributed).  </li>
            <li>The primer will wet it significantly and will help the balm disperse over the entire head.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 9-10 months, bottle still half full, and no lie-</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using really anything to protect my hair during blowouts and then flat ironing too afterwards</li>
            <li>I have to add that I use Smooth Criminal Primer as a first step.  </li>
            <li>It think it cuts down on drying time and leaves my bleached dry hair soft &amp; extra healthy looking!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair dry twice as fast as without, it gives volume if I apply it to the roots, and it smooths like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much money on products that just didn&#x27;t work, or only worked in the beginning.</li>

            <li> I have alot of wirey grey hair &amp; simply putting on my hair after towel drying &amp; letting it dry naturally</li>
            <li> this is going to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> It was dry feeling.</li>
            <li> Normally it would take about 20 minutes drying, at least 20 minutes of ironing.</li>
            <li> and I only use heat 1-3 times per week, and half the time, none.</li>
            <li> I put this in when my hair was wet</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, especially if you put this in after towel drying it a little bit.</li>
            <li> It definitely smooths away the flyways and seems to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The primer eliminates frizz (which is saying a lot because I live in Florida where the humidity is atrocious), provides thermal protection and makes my hair really shiny.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little, and it also can double as a silk drop for the frizzles at the end.</li>
            <li> and it was EXTREMELY STICKY.</li>
            <li> I think the key to this balm is to use just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for dark colored hair</li>
            <li> I generally hate the dryer and am somewhat uncoordinated so the less time I spend on this phase the better.  </li>
            <li> It also helps keep down the frizz.</li>
            <li> no more dye</li>
            <li> My hair is so damaged from the usual that all us ladies do in our 40s..</li>
            <li> My hair is medium in texture and somewhat thick so heavier products are not a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair is medium in texture and somewhat thick so heavier products are not a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> and then I wonder why my hair is so broken afterwards.</li>
            <li> I randomly stumbled upon this one, and I got it yesterday..</li>
            <li> I think these two products together are the holy grail for my weird hair.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Works exactly as advertised:  decreases blow dry speed, protects from heat, and goes in light.  I love the way my hair feels when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawbacks:  be sure not to use too much or use it dry, and I actually think there are stronger heat protectants out there, as my hair still gets a tad damaged.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped fast and in great shape! I do love this product very much. It definitely smooths away the flyways and seems to tame my hair. I have wavy hair, and when I&#x27;m using heat and dyes, my hair looks like I electrocuted myself. Some would even guess I&#x27;m naturally very curly, if I managed to gel or hairspray the frizzies or flyaways. It was coarse feeling. It was dry feeling. It&#x27;s been in recovery from years and years of heat and chemical damage, for the last 8 months no more dye and I only use heat 1-3 times per week, and half the time, none. It doesn&#x27;t take but one-two pumps for my mid back length, so this is going to last me a long time. It adds to the silkiness of my hair. It doesnt even make it greasy, but the first try, i did use a bit too much. A little goes a long way, especially if you put this in after towel drying it a little bit. On those days I don&#x27;t want to use any heat, I put this on it and it gives me a tamed curly look instead of looking like a mouse made a house out of it. I&#x27;ve spent so much money on products that just didn&#x27;t work, or only worked in the beginning. Great value for a great product and is highly recommended by one more person.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and shiny. Blow drying is easier with it. I tried many products for blow drying, but finally found the one I like</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using really anything to protect my hair during blowouts and then flat ironing too afterwards and then I wonder why my hair is so broken afterwards. It just suddenly clicked in me to try some sort of heat protection product. I tried Chi&#x27;s spray a while ago and it was EXTREMELY STICKY. The main reason why I was turned off by heat protection products. I randomly stumbled upon this one, and I got it yesterday.. and seriously WOW. It goes on kind of oily, which is great for my hair because it eats up any moisture it can get, YET when I blow it out, it&#x27;s not oily AT ALL. It&#x27;s actually really soft and doesn&#x27;t feel like I fried it like I&#x27;m used to. I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product. One use, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I went to sallys beauty supply looking for a different product but they were sold out so I asked the lady to pick out another serum and she handed me this. My hair is so damaged from the usual that all us ladies do in our 40s..lol. I put this in when my hair was wet then I put a little more before I straighten and man my hair is soft , shiny and moves around instead of just laying on my head. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> While this product is designed to create sleek hair after drying..it is without a doubt..THE BEST if you do not even blow dry.  I have alot of wirey grey hair &amp; simply putting on my hair after towel drying &amp; letting it dry naturally is AWESOME!  I have naturally curly hair &amp; it gives it the curly look with the wired look.  If i choose to blow dry, its tames it &amp; creates a smooth style.  No matter which way i go, this product is great.. smells wonderful too as added bonus!</li>

From the very first time I used this I was impressed.  I am almost finished with my first bottle and am about to order 2 more.

            <li> I love how this makes my hair feel when I let I dry naturally.  It smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. I have tons of hair, and its a wavy-mix. I double process it to platinum every 6 weeks. This stuff makes my hair dry twice as fast as without, it gives volume if I apply it to the roots, and it smooths like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen. It takes very little, and it also can double as a silk drop for the frizzles at the end. I recommend this to anyone who blow dries regularly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It think it cuts down on drying time and leaves my bleached dry hair soft &amp; extra healthy looking!&lt;br /&gt;I defiantly Reccomend 100%</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  good stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type who blows out my hair and straightens it every time I wash it. I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time with it at all. Normally it would take about 20 minutes drying, at least 20 minutes of ironing. I have been using this product for about 9-10 months, bottle still half full, and no lie- it takes me 15 minutes, tops, to get my hair looking the way I want it to.  10 minutes with a dryer, which makes it shiny and straight, and all I need to do is spend 3-5 minutes with an iron just to get any links out.  I have more hair than most people and it also happens to be extremely THICK and it works great, plus I think it really does do a good job of preventing heat damage because I don&#x27;t have it, despite using heat tools regularly</li>
            <li> Great product BUT packed incorrectly - it leaked on other items in my order....</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It also helps keep down the frizz. In the Florida humidity</li>

            <li> I am really pleased with this product.  It cuts drying time and makes my wavy hair nice and silky when I blowdry it.  I use the concentrator nozzle and a round brush to smooth out my waves (my hair is schizoid because the wave isn&#x27;t evenly distributed).  I generally hate the dryer and am somewhat uncoordinated so the less time I spend on this phase the better.  I then use a straightening iron to get out any kinks.  This blowout balm makes my hair really nice and sleek and super shiny.  It also protects against heat damage.  I have to add that I use Smooth Criminal Primer as a first step.  I think these two products together are the holy grail for my weird hair.  The primer eliminates frizz (which is saying a lot because I live in Florida where the humidity is atrocious), provides thermal protection and makes my hair really shiny.  It&#x27;s also supposed to enhance the effectiveness of styling products, which it does.  It&#x27;s not a repackaged leave in conditioner like I thought it was.  It would also be suitable for fine hair because it&#x27;s so light.  I was using a silicone serum and mousse but I get better results with these two Smooth Criminal products.  It only takes a dab of this balm the size of a quarter for my shoulder length hair.  Use just a little bit at first because it&#x27;s easy to overdo it and your hair will lack body.  Before I apply either of these products I make sure my hair is damp, not wet.  The primer will wet it significantly and will help the balm disperse over the entire head.  On days when I wear my hair straight I use these two products.  On day when I wear it wavy, I use the primer and then Got2be Ionic Power styling spray or Herstyler styling spray ($4.50 and $3.50 respectively).  Got2b is available at grocery stores, Walgreens and CVS and Herstyler is on Amazon.  Both hold my waves all day with the addition of Nexxus Comb Thru or Tresemme Perfectly Undone hairspray (both are excellent).  I think the key to this balm is to use just a small amount.  I purchased it at Sally Beauty Suppy for $6 so Amazon is asking quite a bit more.  I haven&#x27;t tried the Smooth Criminal hairspray yet but it will be my next purchase.  I like Beyond the Zone products and also use Revamp texturizing spray, which works great for updos.  I don&#x27;t think this balm is suitable for fine hair because it&#x27;s somewhat heavy. Instead, I suggest one of the styling sprays I mentioned, which work well for straightening too.  My hair is medium in texture and somewhat thick so heavier products are not a problem for me.  This balm works great for me and if your hair&#x27;s like mine, it will work for you too.  Just don&#x27;t use too much on the first go around. When I use it to straighten my hair, it stays in place all day, which is excellent.  I definitely recommend this product.purchased it at Sally Beauty Suppy for $6 so Amazon is asking quite a bit more.
