    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I bought a couple of tubes of Rapid Lash hoping for the best.</li>
            <li>Rapid lash is awesome.</li>
            <li>How awesome is that.</li>
            <li>I am very happy w/this product.  </li>
            <li>This is excellent.  </li>
            <li>My Lashes are WONDERFUL!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this Serum for well over a year and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great!  </li>
            <li>thought I&#x27;d mention this product (I have no affiliation with Careprost, just a very happy customer) to anyone who is looking for even longer lashes than Rapidlash can give.</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD RESULTS FROM RAPIDLASH.  </li>
            <li>I have been incredibly diligent in putting this on every night.</li>
            <li>Took WEEKS to see results but results were good!  </li>
            <li>I had great lashes.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I just hope it continues, I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li>But stick with it and you will have great results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff, and I&#x27;ve been using it for @ 3 months.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced it.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Nice results, VERY nice!</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I have been using since July and the result is good.  </li>
            <li>This product works really good on my lashes.</li>
            <li>The price is good too.</li>
            <li>For two months they were absolutely gorgeous, and then they started to fall out and break.  </li>
            <li>My sister has a pair of the most beautiful eyes I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>I am very Pleased with the item and would recomend it to others.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product and use it every evening.</li>
            <li>$22.25 is a much better price for a great product.</li>
            <li>The package says that it would vary from person to person and to continue usage to see results, but to me, that just sounds like a way for them to scam me out of more money!</li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>I love this serum!</li>
            <li>I NOW have amazing lashes.</li>
            <li>and she had amazing lashes.  </li>
            <li>My friend bought her own and said it irritated her</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I can find the best price.</li>
            <li>and I told her that her eyes looked just spectacular</li>
            <li>LOVING IT!!&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend to anyone</li>
            <li>I like it, but will give it more time to see how effective it is as some have said it takes quite awhile to work fully.</li>
            <li>I feel like they are strong now!</li>
            <li>For the first three or so days, I experienced a sensation when applying Rapid Lash around my lash line (and I also apply it under my lower lashes); not a stinging</li>
            <li>I got many complements and recommended it to whoever asked.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I notice mostly a difference in lenghth.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!I wish I could find it cheaper though.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I also started playing with different mascaras to see what worked best for me.  </li>
            <li>I also love that I can find Rapid Lash on amazon for $30.00.  </li>
            <li>is better than none.</li>
            <li>LiLash was better, but more side effects(darkening the eye lid).</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I read so many reviews on how it made people&#x27;s eyelashes grow \\&quot;so</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE RAPID LASH.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product.</li>
            <li>I love my lashes.</li>
            <li>&quot; and I wasn&#x27;t ready to give that up, obviously lol.</li>
            <li>I LOVE them.</li>
            <li>I would &amp; have recommended this product to family/friends :)</li>
            <li>The eyelash serum is ok.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>An exquisite blue that shimmer like jewels.</li>
            <li>So to make sure the product was safe</li>
            <li>The reason being it contains significantly more</li>
            <li>Rapidlash claims it takes four weeks to see results, but many folks see noticeable growth within a week.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I FELL IN LOVE with lilash and have been using it for a yr now.  </li>
            <li>Cant wait to see more difference with continued use.</li>
            <li>I would say it worked better on my lashes than my brows</li>
            <li>, so I guess I have more time than money...will purchase and keep using so don&#x27;t have to start over with waiting to see results.</li>
            <li>I could see the results myself and was pretty impressed, even though others didn&#x27;t see much difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my longer thicker eyelashes and love using this WAY more than getting extensions filled every 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used as directed, it keeps the eyelashes healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li>And I have to say it was the best $50 I have spent.</li>
            <li>My eye brows have never looked this full!</li>
            <li>Easy to store too.</li>
            <li>but it went away very quickly</li>
            <li>She swore mine would get longer if I was patient, and she was right! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how longer lashes really do enhance your appearance!</li>
            <li>I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH HOW FAST IT TOOK TO LENGTHEN MY LASHES.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product every night, making sure my eyelids are free of makeup and squeaky clean, for just over 9 weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with it, but am not getting results as quick as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>Of course, like most ladies, I would love to have long, gorgeous lashes.  </li>
            <li>The only time I experienced the redness/itching that others complain of is when I overused the product in the beginning.</li>
            <li>Yes, it did work fantastic for about a year.  </li>
            <li>I can only use it once a day, or my eyes get irritated, but I still get great results.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if it is worth the risk? :)</li>
            <li>although I know it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with this product, I was so happy when I finally found something to work on my brows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep using it for a couple more weeks, maybe it just takes extra time, but I have a feeling my lashes are about as good as they&#x27;re going to get.</li>
            <li>Long beautiful lashes in about 2 weeks time.</li>
            <li>I believe this product actually does what it says it does; my lashes look amazing!  </li>
            <li>Do not expect to get significant growth in lash length.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in Advertising for 35 years and research is a significant part of what I do.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews I was excited to try the product.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>After four weeks, can&#x27;t say the change is significant at all.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my over-tweezed eye brows.</li>
            <li>is a tremendous bargain, add to that free two day shipping with your Prime membership</li>
            <li>is a tremendous bargain, add to that free two day shipping with your Prime membership</li>
            <li>I have experienced some red around my eye lids, but I wear eye liner, so it covers that right up.  </li>
            <li>After using this, I tried smart lash to see if it worked better.  </li>
            <li>I did not get any noticeable results from smart lash and lost most of when I&#x27;d gained from using Rapid Lash.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff, but it&#x27;s pure magic.</li>
            <li>I barely need any where before i found myself putting much more on just to make it look as if I had lashes, and I wore eye liner on my top lid every day as well.</li>
            <li>My lashes aren&#x27;t remarkably longer, but they are much fuller and lush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product and have recommended it to my mother who has the same issue with her lashes, and several friends too.</li>
            <li>But it does what it claims to do, and that is kind of rare with beauty products in general.</li>
            <li>With all the positive reviews I read, I hoped to see a significant improvement in my lashes.  </li>
            <li>but wanted my own long full lashes.</li>
            <li>Overall I liked it and would use it again.</li>
            <li>, I still wonder if it is quite worth the money.</li>
            <li>I started noticing results pretty quickly, perhaps after about 2 or 3 weeks, they were definitely longer -- when I curl them and put on my favorite mascara (Tarte&#x27;s Light Camera Lashes) --</li>
            <li>Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, &amp; my eye lashes are LONGER!!</li>
            <li>friend who already has decent lashes naturally, uses this product and now her lashes are AMAZING.</li>
            <li>is right away.</li>
            <li>I remember the day when a coworker commented that my eyelashes were so long and asked what kind of mascara I used.</li>
            <li>I have always had short sparse lashes, and would get so depressed looking in the mirror, wishing I had beautiful long lashes.</li>
            <li>Then one of my coworkers told me she uses rapid lash, because I asked her how she gets such beautiful long lashes.</li>
            <li>So please, be warned, it may work really well at first, but I don&#x27;t think that it works forever!</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s too strong of a word, but definitely a sensation, perhaps a mild tingling?  </li>
            <li>I bought Rapidlash and wish I would have read reviews first.</li>
            <li>I tried it first when I bought it at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>If you do try this, be aware you may need to wait a month before you see results, as I did, when I first tried it.</li>
            <li>My friend with the amazing lashes is really who converted me, because hers were incredibly long after she started using this.</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first 2 months and have been using it for almost a year now.  </li>
            <li>However, after the first tube the results stopped working.</li>
            <li>When I first began to use it, I did notice itchy eyes</li>
            <li>Therefore, I do see some lengthening simply because they are healthy growing rather than falling out.</li>
            <li>Both have been pretty non existent for 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now if it only grew hair on my bald noggin.t takes four weeks to see results, but many folks see noticeable growth within a week.</li>
            <li>I first started using it at the end of July 2012.</li>
            <li>My lashes have definitely gotten longer, but I&#x27;m still waiting for them to fill out more.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working because I didn&#x27;t notice any results.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough...</li>
            <li>We carried jan Marini&#x27;s lash serum when it first came out years ago.</li>
            <li>Am glad I tried it initially.</li>
            <li>SO NOT waste your money on the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>I have run out, now a year later, and my lashes are still as healthy as before using Rapidlash.</li>
            <li>I tried eyelash extensions a few times and loved it</li>
            <li>I started using it on the top lashes only (nightly) and noticed a positive difference within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an easy process, and I use one dip for both eyes, and my lashes haven&#x27;t suffered.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the results for the amount of money I spent..</li>
            <li>I know I certainly am.</li>
            <li>The eye brows grew new hairs - but if you are in the same situation, I recommend this product for eye lashes since it doesn&#x27;t burn if used correctly and it&#x27;s safe for the eye lid -</li>
            <li>So maybe after you grow in the new hairs try to dye the brows, you&#x27;ll be amazed with the amount of hairs you actually do have that are just too light to be seen!</li>
            <li>When I first starting using this product I was so excited.</li>
            <li>We were going to get her the Revitalash product, but with the very high cost, decided to try this.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended by a friend that had great results using it, I was a little hesitant but have also had results in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Not too much in thickness.  </li>
            <li>and the lashes don&#x27;t fall out as fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Does what it promises and is very affordable.</li>
            <li>With mascara the difference is very dramatic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, after a couple of weeks, I even noticed some teeny tiny baby hairs growing on my eyelids ABOVE my lashline, where hair normally doesn&#x27;t grow -- something you might want to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much thicker my eyelashes are.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using RapidLash for about 5 weeks now and am very imressed with the results I have achieved already.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer and they continue to grow.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Rapidlash really does what it claims.  </li>
            <li>much longer and thicker\\</li>
            <li>They seem to be getting longer, but not so much thicker.</li>
            <li>I was really looking for a product that did both.</li>
            <li>In just 3 weeks, my lashes were thicker and in 6 weeks they were much longer.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much like Elizabeth&#x27;s Taylors eyes were.</li>
            <li>I saw results within one week, much shorter time than the advertised four weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>They are much longer and even a bit thicker.</li>
            <li>I had used this product in the past and was very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>As much as I wanted this product to work it didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone who wants thicker, longer eyelashes.</li>
            <li>After much research, I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working until around week 7 when they really started to lengthen.  </li>
            <li>and i really think they are longer.  </li>
            <li>and i am seeing noticeable difference, this product really works.</li>
            <li>Although the application is a bit sketchy, it really does the trick.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are very fine and about average length.  </li>
            <li>This product is just as good, if not better, for less&lt;br /&gt;the price!</li>
            <li>They are now going back to their original medium length.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants longer, thicker lashes.</li>
            <li>Now with very little mascara my eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li>I also have used this on my eyebrow that I over plucked and it helped grow it in much quicker than it would have normally.</li>
            <li>within 3 weeks, I saw new lashes appear!  </li>
            <li>But as you get older, your lashes can fall out as your browns get thinner and your hair as well.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t until the Rapid Lash kicked in and my lashes grew and thickened up that I realized that it was the lack of lashes that, to me, made me appear older when I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li>Most of the women said it worked but gave them headaches, made eyes red &amp; discolored the eye lid, and last but not least after using it for 6 mo.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The new ones grow back to regular length, thus the need for more.  </li>
            <li>That really bothered me because I&#x27;ve always looked young \\&quot;for</li>
            <li>With this product, after a few weeks I can see them fanning out more and</li>
            <li>To my knowledge, none of my lashes have fallen out, besides the normal amount, and my lashes seem thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li>I believe the key to success with RapidLash is that you keep using it.</li>
            <li>Because there are so many products on the market now claiming to grow lashes and brows, I decided to give a few of them a try.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I am a bit lax with that sort of thing, I&#x27;ll take aspirin</li>
            <li>My lashes are long and full.</li>
            <li>There was some mild, red irritation at first (not enough to bother me &amp; stop using the product).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using RapidLash for a year now and my lashes are super long</li>
            <li>When my lashes start to show signs of any breakage I just get a new tube</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>Eyelashes fall out and new ones grow.</li>
            <li>Barely noticeable unless your really looking</li>
            <li>More is not better in this case.</li>
            <li>WOW, what a difference!  </li>
            <li>have purchased my second one because I know I&#x27;m probably close to being done with this first one.  </li>
            <li>After using up the second tube, most of my lashes were gone, and the ones that were left were very short.  </li>
            <li>For the first time, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my eye lashes, they&#x27;re definitely a bit longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>Overall it works pretty well for me</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I went to CVS and spent the full $50 for a replacement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen more growth in length, maybe a little bit in thickness, but definitely in length.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I dislike is the serum does burn my eyes a little, but still ok to use with contacts.</li>
            <li>I bought it online for twenty bucks and now wish I had bought at least two more.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes curl naturally now, (without using an eyelash crimper).</li>
            <li>When I was young</li>
            <li>My only gripe really, is the applicator...</li>
            <li>I have to say that I&#x27;m quite pleasantly surprised by how well Rapid Lash has worked on my sparse, stick-straight eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheaper and natural alternative</li>
            <li>Thinking that my Rapidlash was getting old, I bought another tube.  </li>
            <li>far from it.</li>
            <li>then I started hearing about a lash enhancer called Careprost from a beauty forum I frequent that had the identical ingredients of Latisse at a fraction of the cost (and one bottle lasted me over 6 months) and started using that to see if my lashes could get longer.  </li>
            <li>(I applied it once daily, sometimes even twice, very liberally).</li>
            <li>It took a few weeks for me to be able to notice any change in my eye lashes, then all of a sudden I was like,</li>
            <li>Like most Asians, I have thick hair on my head, and sparse hair everywhere else, and my eyelashes were no exception:</li>
            <li>I noticed a big difference after two weeks my lashes were full and very long.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes and eyebrows were thinning but after using Rapidlash for just a few weeks had significant regrowth.  </li>
            <li>You do need to make sure you use it everyday or you will notice that you will start to lose your long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>My natural lashes are okay, not super long, not stubby and short...just really regular.</li>
            <li>While I have long eyelashes, they have always been very sparse.  </li>
            <li>It did take about 4 wks for new lashes to be entirely grown out.  </li>
            <li>I am just now ordering a new one as the one I initially purchased</li>
            <li>In either case, if you use this product or rogaine for your brows, the hairs grow in very light and thin.</li>
            <li>I had professional eyelash extensions for years, (then moved to a different state where it costs 3 times the price to get eyelash extensions)</li>
            <li>I started using Rapidlash and after a few weeks I didn&#x27;t think I was seeing much, but after the 5th week, WOW I noticed the difference when I was curling my eyelashes!</li>
            <li>I recently took off my false lashes and unfortunately my most of my lashes came out, i read the reviews on rapid lash and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this will make that kind of lash grow long, lush and thick, but it does make mine a little thicker and longer</li>
            <li>At first I had a little irritation around my eyes, but that stopped after a month or so.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it has done much for the fullness of my lashes - maybe ever so slightly - but they are noticebly longer.</li>
            <li>Works great and much less expensive than other products designed to do the same.</li>
            <li>I read some reveiws that were good and some bad, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try for myself.</li>

            <li> Nice results, VERY nice!</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I have been using since July and the result is good.  </li>
            <li> This product works really good on my lashes.</li>
            <li> The price is good too.</li>
            <li> For two months they were absolutely gorgeous, and then they started to fall out and break.  </li>

            <li> I am very Pleased with the item and would recomend it to others.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product and use it every evening.</li>
            <li> $22.25 is a much better price for a great product.</li>
            <li> The package says that it would vary from person to person and to continue usage to see results, but to me, that just sounds like a way for them to scam me out of more money!</li>
            <li> and I think you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I love this serum!</li>
            <li> I NOW have amazing lashes.</li>
            <li> and she had amazing lashes.  </li>
            <li> My friend bought her own and said it irritated her</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I can find the best price.</li>
            <li> and I told her that her eyes looked just spectacular</li>
            <li> LOVING IT!!&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend to anyone</li>
            <li> I like it, but will give it more time to see how effective it is as some have said it takes quite awhile to work fully.</li>
            <li> I feel like they are strong now!</li>
            <li> For the first three or so days, I experienced a sensation when applying Rapid Lash around my lash line (and I also apply it under my lower lashes); not a stinging</li>
            <li> I got many complements and recommended it to whoever asked.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I notice mostly a difference in lenghth.  </li>
            <li> I love this product!I wish I could find it cheaper though.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I also started playing with different mascaras to see what worked best for me.  </li>
            <li> I also love that I can find Rapid Lash on amazon for $30.00.  </li>
            <li> is better than none.</li>
            <li> LiLash was better, but more side effects(darkening the eye lid).</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I read so many reviews on how it made people&#x27;s eyelashes grow \\&quot;so</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE RAPID LASH.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product.</li>
            <li> I love my lashes.</li>
            <li> &quot; and I wasn&#x27;t ready to give that up, obviously lol.</li>
            <li> I LOVE them.</li>
            <li> I would &amp; have recommended this product to family/friends :)</li>
            <li> The eyelash serum is ok.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> An exquisite blue that shimmer like jewels.</li>
            <li> So to make sure the product was safe</li>
            <li> The reason being it contains significantly more</li>
            <li> Rapidlash claims it takes four weeks to see results, but many folks see noticeable growth within a week.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I FELL IN LOVE with lilash and have been using it for a yr now.  </li>
            <li> Cant wait to see more difference with continued use.</li>
            <li> I would say it worked better on my lashes than my brows</li>
            <li> , so I guess I have more time than money...will purchase and keep using so don&#x27;t have to start over with waiting to see results.</li>
            <li> I could see the results myself and was pretty impressed, even though others didn&#x27;t see much difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my longer thicker eyelashes and love using this WAY more than getting extensions filled every 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used as directed, it keeps the eyelashes healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li> And I have to say it was the best $50 I have spent.</li>
            <li> My eye brows have never looked this full!</li>
            <li> Easy to store too.</li>
            <li> but it went away very quickly</li>
            <li> She swore mine would get longer if I was patient, and she was right! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how longer lashes really do enhance your appearance!</li>
            <li> I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH HOW FAST IT TOOK TO LENGTHEN MY LASHES.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every night, making sure my eyelids are free of makeup and squeaky clean, for just over 9 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with it, but am not getting results as quick as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> Of course, like most ladies, I would love to have long, gorgeous lashes.  </li>
            <li> The only time I experienced the redness/itching that others complain of is when I overused the product in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Yes, it did work fantastic for about a year.  </li>
            <li> I can only use it once a day, or my eyes get irritated, but I still get great results.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if it is worth the risk? :)</li>
            <li> although I know it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with this product, I was so happy when I finally found something to work on my brows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep using it for a couple more weeks, maybe it just takes extra time, but I have a feeling my lashes are about as good as they&#x27;re going to get.</li>
            <li> Long beautiful lashes in about 2 weeks time.</li>
            <li> I believe this product actually does what it says it does; my lashes look amazing!  </li>
            <li> Do not expect to get significant growth in lash length.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in Advertising for 35 years and research is a significant part of what I do.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was excited to try the product.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> After four weeks, can&#x27;t say the change is significant at all.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my over-tweezed eye brows.</li>
            <li> is a tremendous bargain, add to that free two day shipping with your Prime membership</li>
            <li> is a tremendous bargain, add to that free two day shipping with your Prime membership</li>
            <li> I have experienced some red around my eye lids, but I wear eye liner, so it covers that right up.  </li>
            <li> After using this, I tried smart lash to see if it worked better.  </li>
            <li> I did not get any noticeable results from smart lash and lost most of when I&#x27;d gained from using Rapid Lash.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff, but it&#x27;s pure magic.</li>
            <li> I barely need any where before i found myself putting much more on just to make it look as if I had lashes, and I wore eye liner on my top lid every day as well.</li>
            <li> My lashes aren&#x27;t remarkably longer, but they are much fuller and lush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and have recommended it to my mother who has the same issue with her lashes, and several friends too.</li>
            <li> But it does what it claims to do, and that is kind of rare with beauty products in general.</li>
            <li> With all the positive reviews I read, I hoped to see a significant improvement in my lashes.  </li>
            <li> but wanted my own long full lashes.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked it and would use it again.</li>
            <li> , I still wonder if it is quite worth the money.</li>
            <li> I started noticing results pretty quickly, perhaps after about 2 or 3 weeks, they were definitely longer -- when I curl them and put on my favorite mascara (Tarte&#x27;s Light Camera Lashes) --</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, &amp; my eye lashes are LONGER!!</li>
            <li> friend who already has decent lashes naturally, uses this product and now her lashes are AMAZING.</li>
            <li> is right away.</li>
            <li> I remember the day when a coworker commented that my eyelashes were so long and asked what kind of mascara I used.</li>
            <li> I have always had short sparse lashes, and would get so depressed looking in the mirror, wishing I had beautiful long lashes.</li>
            <li> Then one of my coworkers told me she uses rapid lash, because I asked her how she gets such beautiful long lashes.</li>
            <li> So please, be warned, it may work really well at first, but I don&#x27;t think that it works forever!</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s too strong of a word, but definitely a sensation, perhaps a mild tingling?  </li>
            <li> I bought Rapidlash and wish I would have read reviews first.</li>
            <li> I tried it first when I bought it at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> If you do try this, be aware you may need to wait a month before you see results, as I did, when I first tried it.</li>
            <li> My friend with the amazing lashes is really who converted me, because hers were incredibly long after she started using this.</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first 2 months and have been using it for almost a year now.  </li>
            <li> However, after the first tube the results stopped working.</li>
            <li> When I first began to use it, I did notice itchy eyes</li>
            <li> Therefore, I do see some lengthening simply because they are healthy growing rather than falling out.</li>
            <li> Both have been pretty non existent for 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now if it only grew hair on my bald noggin.t takes four weeks to see results, but many folks see noticeable growth within a week.</li>
            <li> I first started using it at the end of July 2012.</li>
            <li> My lashes have definitely gotten longer, but I&#x27;m still waiting for them to fill out more.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working because I didn&#x27;t notice any results.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough...</li>
            <li> We carried jan Marini&#x27;s lash serum when it first came out years ago.</li>
            <li> Am glad I tried it initially.</li>
            <li> SO NOT waste your money on the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I have run out, now a year later, and my lashes are still as healthy as before using Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> I tried eyelash extensions a few times and loved it</li>
            <li> I started using it on the top lashes only (nightly) and noticed a positive difference within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an easy process, and I use one dip for both eyes, and my lashes haven&#x27;t suffered.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the results for the amount of money I spent..</li>
            <li> I know I certainly am.</li>
            <li> The eye brows grew new hairs - but if you are in the same situation, I recommend this product for eye lashes since it doesn&#x27;t burn if used correctly and it&#x27;s safe for the eye lid -</li>
            <li> So maybe after you grow in the new hairs try to dye the brows, you&#x27;ll be amazed with the amount of hairs you actually do have that are just too light to be seen!</li>
            <li> When I first starting using this product I was so excited.</li>
            <li> We were going to get her the Revitalash product, but with the very high cost, decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend that had great results using it, I was a little hesitant but have also had results in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Not too much in thickness.  </li>
            <li> and the lashes don&#x27;t fall out as fast.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Does what it promises and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> With mascara the difference is very dramatic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, after a couple of weeks, I even noticed some teeny tiny baby hairs growing on my eyelids ABOVE my lashline, where hair normally doesn&#x27;t grow -- something you might want to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much thicker my eyelashes are.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I have been using RapidLash for about 5 weeks now and am very imressed with the results I have achieved already.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer and they continue to grow.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Rapidlash really does what it claims.  </li>
            <li> much longer and thicker\\</li>
            <li> They seem to be getting longer, but not so much thicker.</li>
            <li> I was really looking for a product that did both.</li>
            <li> In just 3 weeks, my lashes were thicker and in 6 weeks they were much longer.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much like Elizabeth&#x27;s Taylors eyes were.</li>
            <li> I saw results within one week, much shorter time than the advertised four weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> They are much longer and even a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I had used this product in the past and was very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> As much as I wanted this product to work it didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone who wants thicker, longer eyelashes.</li>
            <li> After much research, I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> , I thought it wasn&#x27;t working until around week 7 when they really started to lengthen.  </li>
            <li> and i really think they are longer.  </li>
            <li> and i am seeing noticeable difference, this product really works.</li>
            <li> Although the application is a bit sketchy, it really does the trick.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very fine and about average length.  </li>
            <li> This product is just as good, if not better, for less&lt;br /&gt;the price!</li>
            <li> They are now going back to their original medium length.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants longer, thicker lashes.</li>
            <li> Now with very little mascara my eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> I also have used this on my eyebrow that I over plucked and it helped grow it in much quicker than it would have normally.</li>
            <li> within 3 weeks, I saw new lashes appear!  </li>
            <li> But as you get older, your lashes can fall out as your browns get thinner and your hair as well.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t until the Rapid Lash kicked in and my lashes grew and thickened up that I realized that it was the lack of lashes that, to me, made me appear older when I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Most of the women said it worked but gave them headaches, made eyes red &amp; discolored the eye lid, and last but not least after using it for 6 mo.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The new ones grow back to regular length, thus the need for more.  </li>
            <li> That really bothered me because I&#x27;ve always looked young \\&quot;for</li>
            <li> With this product, after a few weeks I can see them fanning out more and</li>
            <li> To my knowledge, none of my lashes have fallen out, besides the normal amount, and my lashes seem thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> I believe the key to success with RapidLash is that you keep using it.</li>
            <li> Because there are so many products on the market now claiming to grow lashes and brows, I decided to give a few of them a try.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I am a bit lax with that sort of thing, I&#x27;ll take aspirin</li>
            <li> My lashes are long and full.</li>
            <li> There was some mild, red irritation at first (not enough to bother me &amp; stop using the product).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using RapidLash for a year now and my lashes are super long</li>
            <li> When my lashes start to show signs of any breakage I just get a new tube</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes fall out and new ones grow.</li>
            <li> Barely noticeable unless your really looking</li>
            <li> More is not better in this case.</li>
            <li> WOW, what a difference!  </li>
            <li> have purchased my second one because I know I&#x27;m probably close to being done with this first one.  </li>
            <li> After using up the second tube, most of my lashes were gone, and the ones that were left were very short.  </li>
            <li> For the first time, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my eye lashes, they&#x27;re definitely a bit longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> Overall it works pretty well for me</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I went to CVS and spent the full $50 for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen more growth in length, maybe a little bit in thickness, but definitely in length.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike is the serum does burn my eyes a little, but still ok to use with contacts.</li>
            <li> I bought it online for twenty bucks and now wish I had bought at least two more.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes curl naturally now, (without using an eyelash crimper).</li>
            <li> When I was young</li>
            <li> My only gripe really, is the applicator...</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m quite pleasantly surprised by how well Rapid Lash has worked on my sparse, stick-straight eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheaper and natural alternative</li>
            <li> Thinking that my Rapidlash was getting old, I bought another tube.  </li>
            <li> far from it.</li>
            <li> then I started hearing about a lash enhancer called Careprost from a beauty forum I frequent that had the identical ingredients of Latisse at a fraction of the cost (and one bottle lasted me over 6 months) and started using that to see if my lashes could get longer.  </li>
            <li> (I applied it once daily, sometimes even twice, very liberally).</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks for me to be able to notice any change in my eye lashes, then all of a sudden I was like,</li>
            <li> Like most Asians, I have thick hair on my head, and sparse hair everywhere else, and my eyelashes were no exception:</li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference after two weeks my lashes were full and very long.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes and eyebrows were thinning but after using Rapidlash for just a few weeks had significant regrowth.  </li>
            <li> You do need to make sure you use it everyday or you will notice that you will start to lose your long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My natural lashes are okay, not super long, not stubby and short...just really regular.</li>
            <li> While I have long eyelashes, they have always been very sparse.  </li>
            <li> It did take about 4 wks for new lashes to be entirely grown out.  </li>
            <li> I am just now ordering a new one as the one I initially purchased</li>
            <li> In either case, if you use this product or rogaine for your brows, the hairs grow in very light and thin.</li>
            <li> I had professional eyelash extensions for years, (then moved to a different state where it costs 3 times the price to get eyelash extensions)</li>
            <li> I started using Rapidlash and after a few weeks I didn&#x27;t think I was seeing much, but after the 5th week, WOW I noticed the difference when I was curling my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I recently took off my false lashes and unfortunately my most of my lashes came out, i read the reviews on rapid lash and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this will make that kind of lash grow long, lush and thick, but it does make mine a little thicker and longer</li>
            <li> At first I had a little irritation around my eyes, but that stopped after a month or so.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it has done much for the fullness of my lashes - maybe ever so slightly - but they are noticebly longer.</li>
            <li> Works great and much less expensive than other products designed to do the same.</li>
            <li> I read some reveiws that were good and some bad, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try for myself.</li>
            <li> Sadly I am still waiting to see those long full thick eyelashes many of you are talking about.</li>
            <li> but I personally believe it depends how sensitive you usually are to new products and if your actually using it as directed.</li>
            <li> have been no documented health hazards regarding Isopropyl Cioprostenate with the exception of a few (less than 6%) of people who had redness and a mild allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> have been no documented health hazards regarding Isopropyl Cioprostenate with the exception of a few (less than 6%) of people who had redness and a mild allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I stopped using anything on my eye lashes awhile ago because they had gotten so long, then what happens is after about a month you lose lashes and if not using a lash growth serum of course they will grow back short.</li>
            <li> It was amazing but very expensive.</li>
            <li> I only have to apply the product 1 x week to maintain my long lashes.</li>
            <li> and they still look long, even though I only have to apply it 2-3 times a week to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was missing some lower lashes that got pulled out while removing a new mascara product.  </li>
            <li> The previous reviews say after 2 months their lashes fell out, I have been using Rapid Lash for nearly 2 mo and still have my lashes.</li>
            <li> I read more reviews after I noticed this and saw that this is a common complaint among RapidLash users.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted my long thick lashes back.</li>
            <li> a blind study by Consumer Labs and an independent clinical trial sponsored by RapidLash, RapidLash performed an average of 88% better than Nuelash and RevitaLash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a shot to try at the very least.</li>
            <li> Hardly noticeable, really.  </li>
            <li> No other side effects to report other than lashes that are one-third longer than before!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as long as I can...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and it works for me.  </li>
            <li> It is not a miracle drug that will give you long lashes in a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long term user.</li>
            <li> I always get comments on my long lashes.</li>
            <li> of today my eyelashes are about 2x as long as they were.</li>
            <li> Also the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My lashes are soo long and people ask me about them often.  </li>
            <li> and my lashes are still incredibly long.  </li>
            <li> Once I started using RL again, it takes about 4 weeks and you will start seeing those long lashes again.</li>
            <li> In general, my lashes were about half the volume and length that they were before I started using Rapidlash.  </li>
            <li> The other advantage of this product is that it only needs to be used once a day</li>
            <li> My lashes had been short and few over the last 2 yrs</li>
            <li> I felt like I was looking older lately</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s not new, it&#x27;s been used in Europe for over a decade.</li>
            <li> I used to use the product every single day after I washed my face and let my lashes dry</li>
            <li> They are still not as dramatic as the lash extensions, but they can be if you use the right mascaras and techniques.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I had long luscious dark lashes!</li>
            <li> I do not have very long lashes naturally and this stuff makes them at least 50 percent longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> so I did my research carefully.  </li>
            <li> It was totally bearable and went away after a few days.  </li>
            <li> tube lasts a lot longer than I expected too as you must use it continuously to keep the results.</li>
            <li> In the few months I&#x27;ve been using I&#x27;ve only missed twice.</li>
            <li> But at about 4 times the price of Rapid Lash, no thanks.</li>
            <li> In less than 3 month&#x27;s time, my lashes are nearly as long as they were when I had extensions!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I didn&#x27;t want my eyelashes to fall out, and I had read some reviews before I purchased Rapid Lash to check its credibility.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other stuff on the market (even those upwards 100 bucks a pop)</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I didn&#x27;t want pay the price of Latisse, nor even the price of some of the other non-prescription lash growth serums that are quite pricey (e.g., Revitalash).  </li>
            <li> what set&#x27;s it apart from any other product**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> Well, we hadn&#x27;t seen each other for about a month, met for lunch</li>
            <li> My lashes are about 20% longer -- nothing compared to what some other reviewers have state about looking like</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to think there is going to be a noticeable  difference to other people.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about anything that claims to make hair grow, but after doing a lot of research and reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t notice it from a distance, but I very carefully plucked them out.  </li>
            <li> They were broken, stubby, and they simply would not grow back in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What makes the lashes grow is the active ingredient \\&quot;Isopropyl Cioprostenate</li>
            <li> and Bam they are back to long and thick!</li>
            <li> After faithfully using RapidLash EVERY night before bed, (applying from across the roots to the tip of my lashes) by the middle of the fourth week, I began to see a dramatic difference in the length and fullness of my lashes.</li>
            <li> It was hard to believe a topical serum could encourage lashes and brows to grow.  </li>
            <li> In fact I feel that the inside skin of my eyes are dark, never had darkness around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I have never seen dark lines on my eye lids or anything.  </li>
            <li> after less than a month, my lashes are already thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> Now I wear less mascara and no eye liner, just a slightly darker shade of eyeshadow on my lid line.</li>
            <li> I could care less.</li>
            <li> I ordered a tube and have used it for less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> She has suffered through cancer and has had some hair loss, as is typical after treatment.  </li>
            <li> I do notice a slight darkening under my eyes, nothing concealer can&#x27;t cover up.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were a mess after the extensions fell out.</li>
            <li> I have long thick eyelashes and thicker eyebrows from using this item.  </li>
            <li> her lashes are getting long and thick again.  </li>
            <li> The included instructions said to give it eight weeks, but thought after four weeks there would have been a little differecne, nothing.</li>
            <li> so I will continue to use the product as a little growth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> They are a little darker too.  </li>
            <li> I did a little research on</li>
            <li> I decided to try Rapid Lash where my lashes were missing and</li>
            <li> I think it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t see results for quite a few weeks but hang in there</li>
            <li> It takes a while for results, but you will see longer, thicker lashes after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> A tube usually lasts about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I am natually blonde and have always hated my eyelashes in the past because they were so thin, fine, and stubby.</li>
            <li> Fred Meyer  on sale for 39.99, used it only two days and had a bad headache and red eyes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> I have seen a small amount of growth</li>
            <li> I used Revitalash and Lilash in the past..</li>
            <li> Just saying, don&#x27;t bother and don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It seemed to have reached it&#x27;s peak at 12 weeks, because after that there was no more lenthening.  </li>
            <li> Same thing, work but expensive.</li>
            <li> I thought $50 wasn&#x27;t that bad of a price to try something new for my lashes.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes look fake, they are so curled naturally, thick and long.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little out of date, but there is no way I&#x27;m putting this crap near my eyes.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed that they look slightly darker and fuller, but not as dramatic of a difference as in my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I would say at least 30% longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow process.</li>
            <li> err, I mean bat it with an eye</li>
            <li> err, I mean bat it with an eye</li>
            <li> So I began to use Rapid Lash on the rest of my eyelashes and although the results weren&#x27;t as dramatic as the missing lashes, I do think my lashes are a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> I will be a lifetime user of this product, and it is still WAY less expensive than Latisse or Rejuvalash in comparison.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any serious side effects at all.</li>
            <li> Stopped using it to try something less expensive.</li>
            <li> Considerably less expensive than the faster ones I&#x27;ve tryed</li>
            <li> I hate putting on fake lashes (I can never get it right), and I was even considering getting eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> only bad thing about it is that it hasn&#x27;t had any testing by the FDA.  </li>
            <li> You need to give this product at least 30 days of continuous use to see results, but you WILL SEE RESULTS!</li>
            <li> my hair started to thin</li>
            <li> My lashes are dramatically longer and fuller, and even my husband asked if I had false lashes on.</li>
            <li> Along with my MAC \\&quot;false lash\\&quot; mascara</li>
            <li> I even get people asking me if I wear false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> She looks like she has false lashes on.</li>
            <li> you have false lashes....</li>
            <li> Despite some of the negative reviews, I decided to purchase this product desperate for fuller, longer lashes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it has something to do with the product or of the users just had a fluke of bad luck with their lashes, but I swear by this product.</li>
            <li> I was wary of any side effects</li>
            <li> Everyone always asks me if my lashes are fake.</li>
            <li> I used Latise before and it works but is expensive.</li>
            <li> $30 bucks, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive to maintain</li>
            <li> I did notice a very slight darkening on the base on my eye lid but nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> I used this and the results were very dramatic.  </li>
            <li> I put a thin coat at the base of my lashes before bed.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t feel so guilty if you don&#x27;t get the results you wanted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed, RapidLash seems to have lost its effect on my lashes.</li>
            <li> horrible to committing to it for every day use</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had extensions for the last 7 mo. but wanted my own long full lashes. I bought Rapidlash and wish I would have read reviews first. Most of the women said it worked but gave them headaches, made eyes red &amp; discolored the eye lid, and last but not least after using it for 6 mo. lashes fell out!!! Anyway I bought it @ Fred Meyer  on sale for 39.99, used it only two days and had a bad headache and red eyes. Haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
            <li> I used it till it ran out and I loved it. I used it just like the box said and had no problems. I did notice a very slight darkening on the base on my eye lid but nothing to worry about. Barely noticeable unless your really looking and since I always wear eyeshadow you can&#x27;t even see it. I noticed a big difference after two weeks my lashes were full and very long. I got many complements and recommended it to whoever asked. I bought it online for twenty bucks and now wish I had bought at least two more. My friend bought her own and said it irritated her and she sent it back but I personally believe it depends how sensitive you usually are to new products and if your actually using it as directed. Overall I liked it and would use it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product around Christmas time at Fred Meyer, here in WA ST. I thought $50 wasn&#x27;t that bad of a price to try something new for my lashes. And I have to say it was the best $50 I have spent. My lashes are dramatically longer and fuller, and even my husband asked if I had false lashes on. Along with my MAC \\&quot;false lash\\&quot; mascara I NOW have amazing lashes. The previous reviews say after 2 months their lashes fell out, I have been using Rapid Lash for nearly 2 mo and still have my lashes. Not sure if it has something to do with the product or of the users just had a fluke of bad luck with their lashes, but I swear by this product. I will continue to use it as long as I can...who knew my lashes had such potential!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for a year. I love it. I&#x27;ve had no side effects whatsoever.  My lashes are tiny thing and stumpy. With this product, after a few weeks I can see them fanning out more and then about a week later I see growth!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m horrible to committing to it for every day use (maybe that&#x27;s why mine haven&#x27;t fallen out?)  but I do use min for about a month before any big event. I love it.</li>
            <li> This works, but there isn&#x27;t a drastic change.  I notice mostly a difference in lenghth.  Not too much in thickness.  My eyelashes are very fine and about average length.  I don&#x27;t think this will make that kind of lash grow long, lush and thick, but it does make mine a little thicker and longer and the lashes don&#x27;t fall out as fast.  I still have to wear mascara.</li>
            <li> I decided to try RapidLash because Latisse is too expensive and has too many possible side effects. Within 3 weeks of using I started noticing my lashes getting longer and stronger. At first I had a little irritation around my eyes, but that stopped after a month or so. I&#x27;ve been using RapidLash for a year now and my lashes are super long and I get people commenting on them all the time. I even get people asking me if I wear false eyelashes. I love this product!I wish I could find it cheaper though.</li>
            <li> I am natually blonde and have always hated my eyelashes in the past because they were so thin, fine, and stubby. I had professional eyelash extensions for years, (then moved to a different state where it costs 3 times the price to get eyelash extensions), so I had to stop. My eyelashes were a mess after the extensions fell out. They were broken, stubby, and they simply would not grow back in. I bought a couple of tubes of Rapid Lash hoping for the best. In less than 3 month&#x27;s time, my lashes are nearly as long as they were when I had extensions! My eyelashes curl naturally now, (without using an eyelash crimper). If you use the product as directed, one tube can last you up to 2 months. I am blown away how well this product works. Has the price gone up? Yes. But it does what it claims to do, and that is kind of rare with beauty products in general. I will be a lifetime user of this product, and it is still WAY less expensive than Latisse or Rejuvalash in comparison. Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t require a prescription and have the potentially permanent side effects of darkening your eye color for those with blue eyes (like myself). I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I have now been using Rapid Lash for over a year. I only have to apply the product 1 x week to maintain my long lashes. The only time I experienced the redness/itching that others complain of is when I overused the product in the beginning. Use as directed! More is not better in this case. My mother in law and grandmother both asked me if I had eyelash extensions again when they recently visited... Nope! Rapid lash is awesome.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I tried it first when I bought it at Walgreens. It was 49.99.  A volunteer at my work told me about it and she had amazing lashes.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and it works for me.  When I was young I had great lashes.  But as you get older, your lashes can fall out as your browns get thinner and your hair as well.  I also use an eyelash curler and maybe that damages your lashes as well.  After using this for about 3 weeks i saw a difference.  I also started playing with different mascaras to see what worked best for me.  After using this, I tried smart lash to see if it worked better.  I did not get any noticeable results from smart lash and lost most of when I&#x27;d gained from using Rapid Lash.  I also love that I can find Rapid Lash on amazon for $30.00.  How awesome is that.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Does what it promises and is very affordable. You do need to make sure you use it everyday or you will notice that you will start to lose your long eyelashes. I do not have very long lashes naturally and this stuff makes them at least 50 percent longer and thicker. With mascara the difference is very dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;My friend who already has decent lashes naturally, uses this product and now her lashes are AMAZING. She looks like she has false lashes on. It&#x27;s amazing how longer lashes really do enhance your appearance! I also have used this on my eyebrow that I over plucked and it helped grow it in much quicker than it would have normally. My only gripe really, is the applicator... it&#x27;s so small, I wish they could somehow improve that! If you do try this, be aware you may need to wait a month before you see results, as I did, when I first tried it. My friend with the amazing lashes is really who converted me, because hers were incredibly long after she started using this. She swore mine would get longer if I was patient, and she was right! :)</li>
            <li> this stuff is not working for me. I used it every night for 2 months and my eyelashes still the same length.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for four weeks. The included instructions said to give it eight weeks, but thought after four weeks there would have been a little differecne, nothing. In fact I feel that the inside skin of my eyes are dark, never had darkness around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to go the eight weeks, but not too encouraged.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I didn&#x27;t want my eyelashes to fall out, and I had read some reviews before I purchased Rapid Lash to check its credibility.  To my knowledge, none of my lashes have fallen out, besides the normal amount, and my lashes seem thicker and longer.  I have experienced some red around my eye lids, but I wear eye liner, so it covers that right up.  It took a few weeks for me to be able to notice any change in my eye lashes, then all of a sudden I was like, \\&quot;I think my lashes are growing!\\&quot;.[[ASIN:B0064FT4RK RapidLash Eyelash Enhancing Serum 0.1 fl oz (Quantity of 1)]]</li>
            <li> Yes, it did work fantastic for about a year.  Now my lashes seem shorter and thinner than before.  Waiting to see if it&#x27;s a permanent thing.  It&#x27;s been about 3 months since I stopped using it and I haven&#x27; t noticed them coming back yet.</li>
            <li> even helps when you have no eyebrows. I buy this often because it actually helps brows grow. Easy to store too.</li>
            <li> I am simply amazed with this product. I have always had short sparse lashes, and would get so depressed looking in the mirror, wishing I had beautiful long lashes.I hate putting on fake lashes (I can never get it right), and I was even considering getting eyelash extensions. It&#x27;s like $200 +60 a month. Pricey. Then one of my coworkers told me she uses rapid lash, because I asked her how she gets such beautiful long lashes. I have tried other stuff on the market (even those upwards 100 bucks a pop) they don&#x27;t do what this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after less than a month, my lashes are already thicker and longer. Even in the inner corners of my eyes where I didn&#x27;t even have lashes. I also notice they are growing on my bottom lashes. I&#x27;ve never had lashes there! I also swipe it on my brows (since those are sparse as well) and they are growing as well. I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff, but it&#x27;s pure magic. I just hope it continues, I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I didn&#x27;t want pay the price of Latisse, nor even the price of some of the other non-prescription lash growth serums that are quite pricey (e.g., Revitalash).  I was wary of any side effects so I did my research carefully.  I have to say that I&#x27;m quite pleasantly surprised by how well Rapid Lash has worked on my sparse, stick-straight eyelashes.  Like most Asians, I have thick hair on my head, and sparse hair everywhere else, and my eyelashes were no exception: short, stubby, and stick-straight.  I noticed that they were even stubbier now that I&#x27;m just over 40, and I wanted to see if I could do something about it.  I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash for 5 weeks now, and I have to say that my lashes are about one-third longer than they were before -- I&#x27;m hoping that they&#x27;ll get even longer with continued use!  I started noticing results pretty quickly, perhaps after about 2 or 3 weeks, they were definitely longer -- when I curl them and put on my favorite mascara (Tarte&#x27;s Light Camera Lashes) -- WOW, what a difference!  I&#x27;ve seen more growth in length, maybe a little bit in thickness, but definitely in length.  I use it every evening before bedtime, after cleaning my face.  Honestly, after a couple of weeks, I even noticed some teeny tiny baby hairs growing on my eyelids ABOVE my lashline, where hair normally doesn&#x27;t grow -- something you might want to be aware of.  You don&#x27;t notice it from a distance, but I very carefully plucked them out.  I also use Rapid Lash on my eyebrows, I&#x27;ve noticed that they look slightly darker and fuller, but not as dramatic of a difference as in my lashes.  For the first three or so days, I experienced a sensation when applying Rapid Lash around my lash line (and I also apply it under my lower lashes); not a stinging, that&#x27;s too strong of a word, but definitely a sensation, perhaps a mild tingling?  It was totally bearable and went away after a few days.  No other side effects to report other than lashes that are one-third longer than before!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every night, making sure my eyelids are free of makeup and squeaky clean, for just over 9 weeks. Sadly I am still waiting to see those long full thick eyelashes many of you are talking about. I have seen a small amount of growth so I will continue to use the product as a little growth is better than none.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I can only use it once a day, or my eyes get irritated, but I still get great results.  A tube usually lasts about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I am very happy w/this product.  While I have long eyelashes, they have always been very sparse.  RapidLash made my eyelashes grow thicker (and longer). I saw results within 2 wks w/new lashes growing out.  It did take about 4 wks for new lashes to be entirely grown out.  I cannot believe how much thicker my eyelashes are.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants longer, thicker lashes.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I am very Pleased with the item and would recomend it to others. My lashes are noticeably longer</li>
            <li> I bought this product after having eyelash extensions and my eyelashes were hashed.  I saw results within the first 2 months and have been using it for almost a year now.  I love my longer thicker eyelashes and love using this WAY more than getting extensions filled every 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about it is that it hasn&#x27;t had any testing by the FDA.  So, there are no known side effects and it is made up of hormones...I wonder if it is worth the risk? :)</li>
            <li> I used Revitalash and Lilash in the past..they both worked to some degree..LiLash was better, but more side effects(darkening the eye lid). RapidLash-this product just doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I was missing some lower lashes that got pulled out while removing a new mascara product.  The lashes never grew back.  I decided to try Rapid Lash where my lashes were missing and within 3 weeks, I saw new lashes appear!  So I began to use Rapid Lash on the rest of my eyelashes and although the results weren&#x27;t as dramatic as the missing lashes, I do think my lashes are a bit longer.  I&#x27;m sold on this product, especially when you compare the price to Latisse.  Though my sister&#x27;s lashes are definately longer and thicker using Latisse, I can&#x27;t afford the cost, so I will continue using Rapid Lash.</li>
            <li> I have been using RapidLash for about 5 weeks now and am very imressed with the results I have achieved already.  My lashes are much longer and they continue to grow.  I started using it on the top lashes only (nightly) and noticed a positive difference within 2 weeks. There was some mild, red irritation at first (not enough to bother me &amp; stop using the product). I wouldn&#x27;t say it has done much for the fullness of my lashes - maybe ever so slightly - but they are noticebly longer. If I had to put a percentage on it I would say at least 30% longer.  I have now started applying it to the bottom lashes aswell.  I believe the key to success with RapidLash is that you keep using it. It is not a miracle drug that will give you long lashes in a day. But stick with it and you will have great results. I really like this product and will continue to use it. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Rapidlash really does what it claims.  My eyelashes and eyebrows were thinning but after using Rapidlash for just a few weeks had significant regrowth.  I no longer need eyebrow pencil and can (almost) go without mascara.  Thanks to Amazon, I can find the best price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I read so many reviews on how it made people&#x27;s eyelashes grow \\&quot;so much longer and thicker\\&quot; and that it would take about a four weeks to see results. I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for a little over a month now and I can&#x27;t say that I see any noticeable change. The package says that it would vary from person to person and to continue usage to see results, but to me, that just sounds like a way for them to scam me out of more money! I&#x27;ve heard of people growing out their eyebrows and eyelashes using castor oil .. so I might switch to that after I&#x27;m finished with this tube. It&#x27;s a cheaper and natural alternative and you won&#x27;t feel so guilty if you don&#x27;t get the results you wanted! Just saying, don&#x27;t bother and don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE RAPID LASH.  I have long thick eyelashes and thicker eyebrows from using this item.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I first starting using this product I was so excited. Finally, I had long luscious dark lashes! I remember the day when a coworker commented that my eyelashes were so long and asked what kind of mascara I used. However, after the first tube the results stopped working. Thinking that the tube I bought online was faulty I went to CVS and spent the full $50 for a replacement. I&#x27;m so disappointed, RapidLash seems to have lost its effect on my lashes. They are now going back to their original medium length. I read more reviews after I noticed this and saw that this is a common complaint among RapidLash users. So please, be warned, it may work really well at first, but I don&#x27;t think that it works forever!</li>
            <li> I have been using since July and the result is good.  However, I don&#x27;t know why I have some lashes came off while I cleaned my face.  I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 - 4 years and I love it. I&#x27;ve not had any serious side effects at all. When I first began to use it, I did notice itchy eyes but it went away after my eyes got used to the product. I also noticed some eyelash shedding but it wasn&#x27;t anything noticeable and definitely stopped after my eyes adjusted to the product. No complaints and I&#x27;m a long term user. My eye lashes look fake, they are so curled naturally, thick and long. Everyone always asks me if my lashes are fake.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product. I read some reveiws that were good and some bad, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try for myself. After about 2 weeks i noticed my lashes getting longer and after a month they started to thicken. I love my lashes. My lashes had been short and few over the last 2 yrs and I really wanted my long thick lashes back. I felt like I was looking older lately and it wasn&#x27;t until the Rapid Lash kicked in and my lashes grew and thickened up that I realized that it was the lack of lashes that, to me, made me appear older when I looked in the mirror. That really bothered me because I&#x27;ve always looked young \\&quot;for my age\\&quot; and I wasn&#x27;t ready to give that up, obviously lol. It&#x27;s a pleasure to put mascara on now! I barely need any where before i found myself putting much more on just to make it look as if I had lashes, and I wore eye liner on my top lid every day as well. Now I wear less mascara and no eye liner, just a slightly darker shade of eyeshadow on my lid line. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and have recommended it to my mother who has the same issue with her lashes, and several friends too. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a shot to try at the very least. You never know.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, &amp; my eye lashes are LONGER!! It&#x27;s great stuff, and I&#x27;ve been using it for @ 3 months.</li>
            <li> This product works really good on my lashes. My lashes are thicker and longer. I put a thin coat at the base of my lashes before bed. The price is good too.</li>
            <li> This is excellent.  It makes your lashes thicker and longer, and I use it on brows too to make them thicker.</li>
            <li> I have been using RapidLash since mid May 2012, &amp; it&#x27;s now August 2012. My Lashes are WONDERFUL!! I LOVE them. I feel like they are strong now! I have never once used any lash-grower before this, or had extensions. I would &amp; have recommended this product to family/friends :)</li>
            <li> I was nervous trying this product.  It was hard to believe a topical serum could encourage lashes and brows to grow.  But, grow they did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my eyebrows and lashes are fuller.  My lashes aren&#x27;t remarkably longer, but they are much fuller and lush.  It&#x27;s such an easy process, and I use one dip for both eyes, and my lashes haven&#x27;t suffered.  I do dip separately for eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased my second one because I know I&#x27;m probably close to being done with this first one.  Nice results, VERY nice!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a couple of years.  I always get comments on my long lashes. They are a little darker too.  When my lashes start to show signs of any breakage I just get a new tube and Bam they are back to long and thick! I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 6 weeks now, and still waiting for results.  I have used it faithfully every night and still no changes.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After a month of using it my eyelashes started to fall off. Soooo Scaryyyyyyyy.I stoped using is right away. If u wanna lose your lashes buy it.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and have sold numerous &#x27;lash enhancing&#x27; products over the years. Once I started using Rapid Lash, I stopped using all others. The price is unbeatable as well. You need to give this product at least 30 days of continuous use to see results, but you WILL SEE RESULTS!</li>
            <li> The eyelash serum is ok. I&#x27;m satisfied with it, but am not getting results as quick as I thought I would. It&#x27;s a slow process. They seem to be getting longer, but not so much thicker. I was really looking for a product that did both.</li>
            <li> Despite some of the negative reviews, I decided to purchase this product desperate for fuller, longer lashes. After faithfully using RapidLash EVERY night before bed, (applying from across the roots to the tip of my lashes) by the middle of the fourth week, I began to see a dramatic difference in the length and fullness of my lashes. The key to getting results from this product is to use it with patience and dedication. You will not see results overnight.&lt;br /&gt;The tube lasts a lot longer than I expected too as you must use it continuously to keep the results. The only thing I dislike is the serum does burn my eyes a little, but still ok to use with contacts.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Serum for well over a year and am very happy with it.  Used as directed, it keeps the eyelashes healthy and strong.  It has some darkening effect as well.  Do not expect to get significant growth in lash length.  My lashes, because they are benefiting from the moisture and vitamins, just don&#x27;t fall out as often.  Therefore, I do see some lengthening simply because they are healthy growing rather than falling out.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a day and already my boyfriend says my lashes feel different.  LOVE this product. xoxo</li>
            <li> I used this and the results were very dramatic.  In just 3 weeks, my lashes were thicker and in 6 weeks they were much longer.  For two months they were absolutely gorgeous, and then they started to fall out and break.  Thinking that my Rapidlash was getting old, I bought another tube.  This time, however, there was zero improvement and my lashes continued to fall out.  After using up the second tube, most of my lashes were gone, and the ones that were left were very short.  In general, my lashes were about half the volume and length that they were before I started using Rapidlash.  I&#x27;ve since tried Ardell and Mavala with no improvement at all.  I am currently using Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Lashes to Die For.  While the name of the product is a bit of an overstatement, within 3 weeks after starting to use it, my lashes started to grow back.  It&#x27;s now been 3 months and my lashes are back to where they were before I started the Rapidlash.  I hope that with continued use, they&#x27;ll be thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo26AQTK8VBGULN]]&lt;br /&gt;** BIG MOMMA the Worlds Biggest Show Girl Talks about why Rapid Lash not only works, but what set&#x27;s it apart from any other product**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me caveat this review by saying I never gave a hoot about my eye lashes or brows. Both have been pretty non existent for 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair started to thin I just shaved my head. But eye lashes? I could care less. My sister has a pair of the most beautiful eyes I&#x27;ve ever seen. They&#x27;re much like Elizabeth&#x27;s Taylors eyes were. An exquisite blue that shimmer like jewels. Well, we hadn&#x27;t seen each other for about a month, met for lunch and I told her that her eyes looked just spectacular but I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on why the difference was so significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She told me she was using NueLash which sells for well over a $100 per tube. I&#x27;ve been in Advertising for 35 years and research is a significant part of what I do. So to make sure the product was safe I did a little research on her behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes the lashes grow is the active ingredient \\&quot;Isopropyl Cioprostenate - it&#x27;s not new, it&#x27;s been used in Europe for over a decade. Out of all the eye lash enhancer&#x27;s on the market there are only three that have Isopropyl Cioprosrenate - NueLash, RevitaLash and RapidLash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others use dense moisturizers to temporarily plump up the lashes. However the above three products are the only ones that can actually grow out eye lashes and brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a blind study by Consumer Labs and an independent clinical trial sponsored by RapidLash, RapidLash performed an average of 88% better than Nuelash and RevitaLash. The reason being it contains significantly more Isopropyl Cioprostenate - 27% more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered a tube and have used it for less than two weeks. For the first time, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my eye lashes, they&#x27;re definitely a bit longer and thicker. Same for my eye brows where they were bald there&#x27;s now growth. Rapidlash claims it takes four weeks to see results, but many folks see noticeable growth within a week. It works for about 80% of the people who use this product so the odds are in your favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been no documented health hazards regarding Isopropyl Cioprostenate with the exception of a few (less than 6%) of people who had redness and a mild allergic reaction to it. Whether I continue to use it remains to be seen - but it does work and it does out perform the others - not to mention it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost. Rapidlash sells in stores between $49.99 and $69.99 to find it on Amazon for $30 is a tremendous bargain, add to that free two day shipping with your Prime membership and you can&#x27;t beat it with a stick...err, I mean bat it with an eye lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if it only grew hair on my bald noggin.t takes four weeks to see results, but many folks see noticeable growth within a week. It works for about 80% of the people who use this product so the odds are in your favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been no documented health hazards regarding Isopropyl Cioprostenate with the exception of a few (less than 6%) of people who had redness and a mild allergic reaction to it.

            <li> This stuff is great!  I used the more expensive prescription lash lengthener before.  This product is just as good, if not better, for less&lt;br /&gt;the price!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was excited to try the product.  I have to say I did not see any improvement.  I used it according to the directions.  This may work on others, but not on me.  I think it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I saw results within one week, much shorter time than the advertised four weeks.  I had no side effects.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD RESULTS FROM RAPIDLASH.  IN FACT THIS IS A REFILL ORDER. I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH HOW FAST IT TOOK TO LENGTHEN MY LASHES.</li>
            <li> This product has worked well for me. My natural lashes are okay, not super long, not stubby and short...just really regular. I was excited to try this product. I first started using it at the end of July 2012. I have been incredibly diligent in putting this on every night. In the few months I&#x27;ve been using I&#x27;ve only missed twice. At one point in the beginning my eyes got a bit red on the lash line where I was applying but it went away very quickly and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today my eyelashes are about 2x as long as they were. It&#x27;s a very noticeable difference. They don&#x27;t look like falsies yet (still hoping). They are much longer and even a bit thicker. I no longer have to sit and apply coat after coat of mascara to get the look I want. Now with very little mascara my eyelashes look amazing. Also the product lasts a long time. I am just now ordering a new one as the one I initially purchased seems to be getting a bit low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about purchasing, I say give it a shot. Just be patient. You won&#x27;t see results for quite a few weeks but hang in there and I think you&#x27;ll be glad you did! I know I certainly am.</li>
            <li> I had used this product in the past and was very satisfied with the results.  Because there are so many products on the market now claiming to grow lashes and brows, I decided to give a few of them a try.  NONE of them worked as well as Rapidlash!  I believe this product actually does what it says it does; my lashes look amazing!  The other advantage of this product is that it only needs to be used once a day and it does not sting like some of the others.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend that had great results using it, I was a little hesitant but have also had results in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I like it, but will give it more time to see how effective it is as some have said it takes quite awhile to work fully.</li>
            <li> My lashes have definitely gotten longer, but I&#x27;m still waiting for them to fill out more. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now and I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the results for the amount of money I spent..</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted this product to work it didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations. I have been using the product daily for about 5 weeks.  I started using this product after having eyelash extensions for a couple months. Now I do think there has been SOME improvement in my lashes - ie longer/fuller lashes, I still wonder if it is quite worth the money. My lashes are about 20% longer -- nothing compared to what some other reviewers have state about looking like you have false lashes....far from it. I don&#x27;t think my lashes have changed in color. Maybe a scant amount fuller. I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to think there is going to be a noticeable  difference to other people. I haven&#x27;t experienced it. No comments yet.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife.  She has suffered through cancer and has had some hair loss, as is typical after treatment.  Her eyelashes were thinned out as well.  We were going to get her the Revitalash product, but with the very high cost, decided to try this.  She&#x27;s been using it for about 3 weeks and it&#x27;s working!  her lashes are getting long and thick again.  Works great and much less expensive than other products designed to do the same.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, does exactly what it says it will do. Would recommend it to anyone who wants thicker, longer eyelashes. Also thickens sparse brows.</li>
            <li> THIS SERUM IS NOT WHAT THEY SAID, I EVEN NOTICED I LOST MY LASHES</li>
            <li> After much research, I decided to try this product. It arrived and was 3 months expired. Normally, I am a bit lax with that sort of thing, I&#x27;ll take aspirin that&#x27;s a little out of date, but there is no way I&#x27;m putting this crap near my eyes. Sending it back!</li>
            <li> I used Rapidlash for several months.  At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working because I didn&#x27;t notice any results.  Then, after 7-8 weeks, I finally saw some lengthening starting to happen.  It seemed to have reached it&#x27;s peak at 12 weeks, because after that there was no more lenthening.  I could see the results myself and was pretty impressed, even though others didn&#x27;t see much difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I started hearing about a lash enhancer called Careprost from a beauty forum I frequent that had the identical ingredients of Latisse at a fraction of the cost (and one bottle lasted me over 6 months) and started using that to see if my lashes could get longer.  Sure enough...they did!  Same as with Rapidlash, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working until around week 7 when they really started to lengthen.  Now, when I put on mascara, my lashes touch my eyebrows and people definitely notice them.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 8 months and they still look long, even though I only have to apply it 2-3 times a week to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just thought I&#x27;d mention this product (I have no affiliation with Careprost, just a very happy customer) to anyone who is looking for even longer lashes than Rapidlash can give.</li>
            <li> I just bought Rapid Lash for the second time because...it works. It takes a while for results, but you will see longer, thicker lashes after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Latisse, which will get you even longer lashes. But at about 4 times the price of Rapid Lash, no thanks. I&#x27;m sold on Rapid Lash.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  Not one bit of improvement that was visible.  Spend your  money on something else.</li>
            <li> With all the positive reviews I read, I hoped to see a significant improvement in my lashes.  After four weeks, can&#x27;t say the change is significant at all.  Hardly noticeable, really.  My lashes are just a teeny bit longer, but not thicker.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it for a couple more weeks, maybe it just takes extra time, but I have a feeling my lashes are about as good as they&#x27;re going to get.</li>
            <li> Totally works!! Long beautiful lashes in about 2 weeks time. No irritations on my eyes. I love this serum! Great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year now and it 100% works.  My lashes are soo long and people ask me about them often.  I am neurotic about my mascara too so that helps with the appearance of my lashes, but the length comes from the rapid lash.  I have never seen dark lines on my eye lids or anything.  I used to use the product every single day after I washed my face and let my lashes dry but now I really only use it like 2-3x a week and my lashes are still incredibly long.  Will keep buying!</li>
            <li> I use once a day (at night).  After the 3rd week I thought I was seeing a difference. The 4th week and i really think they are longer.  I will keep using!</li>
            <li> Used for 30 days and no results. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I used Latise before and it works but is expensive. Stopped using it to try something less expensive. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Let me start of by saying I am a licensed Esthetician and owned a day spa for several years. We carried jan Marini&#x27;s lash serum when it first came out years ago. It was amazing but very expensive. I then moved on to Latisse. Same thing, work but expensive. Then I decided to give Rapid lash a shot. $30 bucks, can&#x27;t go wrong. Well I have found that Rapid lash works just as well or even better then the expensive brands. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years now. My lashes are long and full. I double take in the mirror sometimes cause it looks like I have my lash extensions that I use to wear on. People need to understand that our lashes have a cycle just life the hair on our heads. Eyelashes fall out and new ones grow. I stopped using anything on my eye lashes awhile ago because they had gotten so long, then what happens is after about a month you lose lashes and if not using a lash growth serum of course they will grow back short. Once I started using RL again, it takes about 4 weeks and you will start seeing those long lashes again. This product works!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the end of May, and I have just now ordered my second bottle.  It took about 6-7 weeks for me to see results.  My lashes were definitely longer, and a bit thicker.  After my lashes were longer, I reduced my application to about 4-5 times per week; just trying to stretch out the cost.  I do have eyelashes fall out, but we all do!  The new ones grow back to regular length, thus the need for more.  I definitely recommend this product if you can be patient to wait for results.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product and use it every evening. I have seen a noticeable difference in both eyelash length and thickness. I have been using RapidLash for about 6 months and replace it about every 3 months. Am glad I tried it initially.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about anything that claims to make hair grow, but after doing a lot of research and reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  I tried eyelash extensions a few times and loved it but it was too expensive to maintain and I noticed some gaps in my eyelashes after they were off. I started using Rapidlash and after a few weeks I didn&#x27;t think I was seeing much, but after the 5th week, WOW I noticed the difference when I was curling my eyelashes! My lashes are noticibly longer. It&#x27;s been about 8 weeks now, however not all my lashes are the same length and they aren&#x27;t thicker.  They are still not as dramatic as the lash extensions, but they can be if you use the right mascaras and techniques.  I do notice a slight darkening under my eyes, nothing concealer can&#x27;t cover up. They didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes only some itching from time to time.  Overall it works pretty well for me and I&#x27;m going to continue to use if for now.</li>
            <li> Of course, like most ladies, I would love to have long, gorgeous lashes.  I ended up buying this product because it was cheaper than others on the market.  After 6 wks of constant use, there was NO difference.  I ended up biting the bullet and getting lilash, as a friend suggested.  I FELL IN LOVE with lilash and have been using it for a yr now.  SO NOT waste your money on the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I recently took off my false lashes and unfortunately my most of my lashes came out, i read the reviews on rapid lash and decided to give it a try. I have been using it for a week now and i am seeing noticeable difference, this product really works. Cant wait to see more difference with continued use.</li>
            <li> On my second week using rapidlash and they are already started to look longer and fuller. LOVING IT!!&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend to anyone</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my over-tweezed eye brows. I ended up using it on my eyelids as well for the lashes. I would say it worked better on my lashes than my brows, I had a chunk/gap in my one eye lid and it regrew the lashed that I had lost in about 2-3 weeks (I applied it once daily, sometimes even twice, very liberally). The eye brows grew new hairs - but if you are in the same situation, I recommend this product for eye lashes since it doesn&#x27;t burn if used correctly and it&#x27;s safe for the eye lid - but for brows I finally found a way to regrow my over-tweezed brows after searching for several years! I purchased women&#x27;s rogaine, although I know it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with this product, I was so happy when I finally found something to work on my brows. In either case, if you use this product or rogaine for your brows, the hairs grow in very light and thin. I use to think that plucking them out again and again would have them grow in thicker and darker but it doesn&#x27;t work that way (obviously). I ended up purchasing eye brow tint (godefroy) to dye the hairs after I regrew them. WOW! I am blown away. My eye brows have never looked this full! Although the application is a bit sketchy, it really does the trick. So maybe after you grow in the new hairs try to dye the brows, you&#x27;ll be amazed with the amount of hairs you actually do have that are just too light to be seen!</li>
            <li> I bought RapidLash at my hair salon upon the advice of my stylist. Within 2 weeks, I&#x27;d say my lashes were about an 1/8 inch longer. I have run out, now a year later, and my lashes are still as healthy as before using Rapidlash. And the reason I&#x27;m on Amazon looking for my second tube of this product is that I paid $50 at my salon! $22.25 is a much better price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Took WEEKS to see results but results were good!  Considerably less expensive than the faster ones I&#x27;ve tryed, so I guess I have more time than money...will purchase and keep using so don&#x27;t have to start over with waiting to see results. Worked on brows also.</li>
