            <li>No residue, great shine coverage</li>

            <li>It gives me a very nice and shiny look.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure together they are awesome.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and it does a great job of setting my makeup, and helps to keep the oil at bay.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am able to use it I am even more impressed.</li>
            <li>love this powder!</li>
            <li>WORKS FANTASTIC!!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the most effective powder I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be an amazing product because I had heard about it on a blog.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>Works really nicely under eyes.</li>
            <li>I am tanned,so I had to mix it with my own powder than apply it.</li>
            <li>very fine powder.</li>
            <li>Glad I had a coupon</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more</li>
            <li>Pretty nice.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not taking pictures, it makes your skin SUPER soft and adds a great finish to your make up.</li>
            <li>What a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>overall its a great product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase the large size.</li>
            <li>but I wouldnt pay 30 bucks for the full size</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful but you have to be careful if you have golden or darker skin because it will show up looking white.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>&quot; Then I got a really good brush that could fit into all the hard to reach places on my face that tend to crease.</li>
            <li>I love this HD Micro finish powder, but it&#x27;s it so white</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked at all.</li>
            <li>Just wish the bigger ones were more affordable.</li>
            <li>More like the opposite.</li>
            <li>i have a light brown complexion and i don&#x27;t see white spots on my skin as i expecting to see after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>not even one whole ounce.</li>
            <li>it really removes all the oiliness on your face to give you that Matt look...</li>
            <li>I think by far this</li>
            <li>Its nice and all but its not excellent</li>

            <li> the sample is just absolutely way too small.</li>
            <li> not too mention it&#x27;s long lasting as well..</li>
            <li> I use it specifically for between layers of lipstick - it makes it stay ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> but I only use a little.</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Only negative is the price due to product size.</li>
            <li> I was looking for coverage because i have some dark spots on my skin, but this powder didn&#x27;t cover them.</li>
            <li> I was shocked how super small..tiny ..miniature size.</li>
            <li> but I use it everyday and it allows my face to stay matte.</li>
            <li> Reat small travel size powder</li>
            <li> I bought the small one to try.</li>
            <li> This size is very small</li>
            <li> I do not see the use for it and it was way too expensive.</li>
            <li> The price for this is outrageous.</li>

            <li> This is very very nice. It gives me a very nice and shiny look.  I only wish that it could be bigger.</li>
            <li> No residue, great shine coverage&lt;br /&gt;I love this powder! Only negative is the price due to product size. I was shocked how super small..tiny ..miniature size. Glad I had a coupon</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. i have a light brown complexion and i don&#x27;t see white spots on my skin as i expecting to see after reading the reviews. I was looking for coverage because i have some dark spots on my skin, but this powder didn&#x27;t cover them. That means i can&#x27;t use it alone.</li>
            <li> Its nice and all but its not excellent but I use it everyday and it allows my face to stay matte.</li>
            <li> amazing product!!!...It does its job</li>
            <li> Pretty nice. very fine powder. It didnt make me look as poreless and candlelit as allure put it. overall its a great product but I wouldnt pay 30 bucks for the full size</li>
            <li> Reat small travel size powder</li>
            <li> I love this product; however, I don&#x27;t use it when I am taking pictures because it gives you a weird glow. If you&#x27;re not taking pictures, it makes your skin SUPER soft and adds a great finish to your make up.</li>
            <li> Love it. I don&#x27;t have the foundation yet but I&#x27;m sure together they are awesome. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy a sample size of this before committing to the big size. I am very pleased with the product and it does a great job of setting my makeup, and helps to keep the oil at bay.  I will be buying the larger size!</li>
            <li> I love this HD Micro finish powder, but it&#x27;s it so white so I mix it with another product of powdery and it stays on great.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked at all. I kept saying \\&quot;what the heck is so great about this stuff?\\&quot; Then I got a really good brush that could fit into all the hard to reach places on my face that tend to crease. I dipped my brush, tapped it off a couple of times to get rid of the excess and worked it into those stubborn areas. What a HUGE difference. My skin felt like satin, my concealer didn&#x27;t look all caked and creased!! I love this stuff!! Just wish the bigger ones were more affordable. &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> This is the perfect finishing powder. I use it specifically for between layers of lipstick - it makes it stay ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> Works really nicely under eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful but you have to be careful if you have golden or darker skin because it will show up looking white. I am tanned,so I had to mix it with my own powder than apply it. This appears to work well and you still get the benefit of this powder. This size is very small but I only use a little. The price for this is outrageous.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for several months before I discovered that there is a plastic sticker that prevents the powder from coming out.  Since it was translucent I was impressed that I couldn&#x27;t see anything on my brush as I applied it.  It also has lasted for quite sometime since I opened it.  Now that I am able to use it I am even more impressed.</li>
            <li> This is just a setting powder. No coverage and doesn&#x27;t even set makeup all day, must be reapplied. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase the large size.</li>
            <li> I saw this on a Yahoo headliner and decided to try it.  WORKS FANTASTIC!!  I have oily skin and only have to apply this one time after I put my make up on!  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> the sample is just absolutely way too small. not even one whole ounce. $5.00 plus the shipping was $6.00.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be an amazing product because I had heard about it on a blog. More like the opposite. I do not see the use for it and it was way too expensive. Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I think by far this it&#x27;s the most effective powder I&#x27;ve ever used! it really removes all the oiliness on your face to give you that Matt look...not too mention it&#x27;s long lasting as well..</li>
            <li> I bought the small one to try. I am glad I did and will be purchasing more. It bots excess oil on my face and leaves it with an alabaster finish. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the best face powder</li>
            <li> I will be buying more</li>
