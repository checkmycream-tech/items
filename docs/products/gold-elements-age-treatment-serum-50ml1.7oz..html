            <li>That cancels out any positive effects.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Scam. This whole brand is a bunch of BS.  Stay away.</li>
            <li> I would not even give it 1 star. You can&#x27;t see an ingredient list before purchasing and it is not returnable. It contains formaldehyde disguised as DMDM hydantoin. That cancels out any positive effects. I thought it was a good brand and trusted that I would receive a good product. I will not purchase any more items without seeing a full list of ingredients first.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and as discribed!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great price and this product is the best I have ever used on my face and I get lots of complements.</li>
            <li> This was more expensive than I usually buy but so far it is a superior product. I expect the results to only get better with continued use.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, I WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too soon to rate I just got it, it appears a bit thin to be a serum. I don&#x27;t feel my skin absorbing it like other serums I used so I am just giving it a chance and see what happens.</li>
            <li> This is a great product it makes your face feel good &amp; soft. Great product for your money. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The Gold Elements Age Treatment Serum works really well.  I just wish it had moisture cream as well, it does dry a little.</li>
            <li> It was not new when I received it.  The box had been opened and resealed and now I don&#x27;t know whether it had been used and cant see how much it is left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best age treatment serum I have ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;You can see a difference in about 2 days</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is so much cheaper than purchasing it from the company.</li>
            <li> Propolene glycol is used in cheap hair products, moisturizers and anti-freeze.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and go for a healthier product.  Do your research at EWG.com&lt;br /&gt;16,000 skin and hair products are listed by how healthy it is for you.</li>
            <li> The product is good but it arrived with the box open and some of the serum all over the outside of the bottle. Don&#x27;t know if its a new bottle or used.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stufff and better priced at Amazon than buying it at the mall.</li>
            <li> great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;shipment arrived on time and as expected.&lt;br /&gt;light serum that soaks into your skin w/very little residue.&lt;br /&gt;I used it along w/the other Gold Elements products.&lt;br /&gt;works great</li>
            <li> I love this product, it has already done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice and light ,gives a soft glow appearance.</li>
            <li> This line of product is my very favorite!  It feels so smooth and silky going on!  I wish they carried more products in this line and more reasonably priced.  Every time I need to replace something I use, the price just keeps going up!</li>
            <li> Another fake product or expiered product that smelled like paint! Garbage can it goes! Amazon shouldnt allow this to cheap buyers. I can afford to trash it but I surely hate to see others good earned money going to scammer as this!</li>
            <li> Face felt smoother and easy to use. No irritation. Also love the packaging. I would definitely recommend this Gold serum.</li>
            <li> I enjoy very much with this product; it is easy to use, the product&#x27;s texture is smooth and the price is reasonable. You can see the result within couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product , I was looking for long time something special finaly i get it , I am very glad to find this product .</li>
            <li> Was empty when I recived it - very disappointed</li>
            <li> too soon to tell if advertising of this will work, but so far so g00d.</li>
            <li> I loved it I&#x27;ll get another one later</li>
            <li> This a great product. Leaves your face moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Misleading not the same as store. Bought it because of the price but its not even the same thing, I use this every night. FAKE</li>
            <li> I have seen the real product in the store and the package was completely different from what I have seen! The box and the package didn&#x27;t look geniune. I bought it for my mom and when she opened the package it was a shame. Hope she doesn&#x27;t show any allergic reaction. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> Works well &amp; priced right.</li>
