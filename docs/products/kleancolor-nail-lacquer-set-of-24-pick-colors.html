            <li>The amazing selection of great colors makes it a good choice.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of brands and Kleancolor is fairly good for the price.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Loved all my 24 colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m extremely happy with these polishes, and will absolutely purchase more!!!</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how very glad I am that I did.</li>
            <li>Would be great if Kleancolor could improve their formula for better coverage.</li>
            <li>They go on very smoothly!  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing a lot more!</li>
            <li>but i was pleased to find all of the specified colors in my package a day after the delivery date!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more!</li>
            <li>They chose the remaining one for me, which  was nice but its not one I&#x27;ll wear.  </li>
            <li>Best deal for nail polish,  you even get to choose the colors u want,  thanks so much for this awesome product.  </li>
            <li>I was able to pick exactly the colors I wanted and they shipped perfectly.</li>
            <li>It was a more than  fair price, and I enjoyed how I chose the colors I wanted.</li>
            <li>These are by far one of the best I&#x27;ve used!  </li>
            <li>:) Cheap polishes, cheap shipping to Canada, great seller.</li>
            <li>However, the darker colors did stain much more than most polishes.  </li>
            <li>Some have a somewhat matte finish, but can be shined up with a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really pleased me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but that was mostly my fault.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these colors as well.</li>
            <li>Was able to pick out the colours that I wanted and they were shipped out within a day of ordering.</li>
            <li>Love the glitters and 3d textures.</li>
            <li>love the Kleancolor nail polish.</li>
            <li>But still love the colors.</li>
            <li>I am planning to get some thinner to get some of the polishes to flow better.</li>
            <li>and before I even opened the package, I could smell that strong nail polish-y smell -</li>
            <li>However, two of these, \\&quot;grande finale\\&quot; and \\&quot;black out\\&quot; are so awesome</li>
            <li>that I wanted which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>but I suspect user error since all of the others I try have worked just fine.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic polishes.</li>
            <li>Tried a couple of colors and they look great, although, I believe some colors have a different formula than the others.</li>
            <li>These colors are vibrant and apply nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Add a coat of clear coat on top of favorite color &amp; it stays for weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the gorgeous shine that every other brand has, but the top coat can help.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the SV top coat I use, I can cover up some of the blemishes.</li>
            <li>Bought several sets of these for shower favors and the guests loved them.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to that kind of thing anyway</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different nail polishes and this is one of the better selections I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the coverage is excellent and I only needed one coat to be opaque for the darker colors and two coats for the lighter colors.  </li>
            <li>Others have also said that they chip quickly, and I also didn&#x27;t find that.  </li>
            <li>If you would like to use these products then I recommend a high quality bottom and top coat.</li>
            <li>They have a very nice shimmer and go on smoothly and opaquely with few streaks.  </li>
            <li>The package was labeled fragile in many places, but still came in the mail looking like it took quite a beating, that would be customs and the postal services fault though!</li>
            <li>only downside is it chips easily, however, I don&#x27;t use primer or top coat, either, so that could be a problem.</li>
            <li>They certainly offer a huge variety of colors and sparkles and cheaper than you can buy them in</li>
            <li>Really, they are just fantastic.</li>
            <li>Most were better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I had lots of fun trying all the colors</li>
            <li>I am a nail technician who is starting her own business.</li>
            <li>They came in pretty quick and were all in one piece.</li>
            <li>used amazon&#x27;s order inquiry system to send my color request immediately after ordering and they received it and acknowledged receipt right away.  </li>
            <li>The polish comes on really clean and very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The nail polish was shipped fast and I got all the colors I wanted except one, but that was my fault for not listing it!</li>
            <li>i ordered 48 other colors from this same seller, and loved them all!</li>
            <li>With these products, the first time you shower after using them they are all chipped up.</li>
            <li>First of all, I ordered all 24 of my colors in the sparkly, glittery range.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried after reading other&#x27;s reviews, but once I got and used them, I was happy I ordered them!  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the minor quibbles this product is much better than it&#x27;s price would indicate.  </li>
            <li>The bottles were all fine, but it almost over powered me when I actually put some of the polish on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything was packed reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>The polishes were wrapped very well, there was no way any of them could have broke.</li>
            <li>I received every color request and shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>I would really appreciate it if they uploaded a higher resolution version so that we could read the numbers clearly, or include a list in the description.  </li>
            <li>colors dried quickly and smoothly with the exception of the glitter polishes.  </li>
            <li>The brush/wand is slightly flattened out for better application, and it does help a bunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Colors are so vibrant.</li>
            <li>Only one handle was cracked, but luckily it happened to be the color I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I promise you will get in a few more days of staying power.</li>
            <li>I live just across the border from CA</li>
            <li>There were a couple that i had to add a few drops of thinner to in order to get the consistency that i wanted, but other than that it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>The other small complaint, and this could be &amp;#34;user error&amp;#34;, is that most of these lovely, sparkly colors are pretty much glitter in colorless polish.</li>
            <li>Nearly all the colors looked almost identical on the nail as they do in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I actually found that they dried more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I was supposed to put a colored undercoat first, but the first polish I tried out was Fireworks, and even after applying 3 coats to just bare nails, it still looked as if I rather unevenly sprinkled some glitter pieces on my nails and adhered them with clear polish.</li>
            <li>As a few other reviewers states, the smell is VERY strong.</li>
            <li>I used 2 coats out of habit, and with the Orchid Crome there was really no difference with the second coat, the Holo Pink did get more vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pictures on here were a bit hard to see for accurate names</li>
            <li>I went on their site to pick my colors and they looked amazing on the nails they show to model the different colors and they do not look like that on mine, but again, perhaps I am doing it wrong and need a white or colored undercoat to make it look like the pics.</li>
            <li>These polishes do not smell as bad as some people have said and they are gorgeous.</li>

            <li> These polishes do not smell as bad as some people have said and they are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a long lasting manicure with this brand of nail polish</li>
            <li> The only color I can&#x27;t make work so far is metallic green</li>
            <li> And as a few reviewers also said, some of the polishes are quite thick in formula and may work better being thinned down a bit.</li>
            <li> I have  probably 100+ bottles of nail polish, from expensive salon brands, to cheap dollar store brands.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to find an excuse to order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And even then it was only minimal chipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seller did not have 2 colors that I requested for but they replaced with almost similar looking colors from their other line.</li>
            <li> one and only downfall of this polish is that, as some other people have pointed out, yes it does take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, once it does dry this stuff will stay on for days!</li>
            <li> other reviewers said it took too long to dry, but I didn&#x27;t think it took longer than any other non-quick drying polish.  </li>
            <li> I painted my nails, and went to sleep about a half hour later, and woke up with absolutely NO marks at all!  </li>
            <li> A few of the ones I ordered, like \\&quot;grand finale\\&quot; and \\&quot;holiday jingle\\&quot; were glitter polishes, which means they have a clear base with almost all the color coming from the included glitter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Some of the polishes do not cover properly and brushes are bit uneven.</li>
            <li> And again if you have a base and top coat please use it</li>
            <li> I suggest you set aside sometime from the day that less movement/use of your hands is needed.</li>

            <li> I emailed them a list  with number and name of the colors i wanted immediately after placing my order. The pictures on here were a bit hard to see for accurate names but i googled bigger versions. The nail polish was shipped fast and I got all the colors I wanted except one, but that was my fault for not listing it! They chose the remaining one for me, which  was nice but its not one I&#x27;ll wear.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in the postal service for bending the package in half (which said FRAGILE across it!)and shoving it in my mailbox but the polish bottles were in bubble wrap and unharmed with the exception of one cracked cover which was not in a critical location to ruin the bottle. hopefully your postal service is more observant!!</li>
            <li> These are fantastic polishes. Colors are so vibrant. Excellent coverage with even one coat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different nail polishes and this is one of the better selections I&#x27;ve tried.  I would say it is on par with five dollar nail polishes, but it is no OPI.  The amazing selection of great colors makes it a good choice.  Out of the colors I selected, only one color was a real disappointment.  Most were better than I expected.  Overall, the coverage is excellent and I only needed one coat to be opaque for the darker colors and two coats for the lighter colors.  However, the darker colors did stain much more than most polishes.  You should use a base coat with darker colors to prevent this.  The metallics were excellent.  They have a very nice shimmer and go on smoothly and opaquely with few streaks.  Some have a somewhat matte finish, but can be shined up with a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most colors dried quickly and smoothly with the exception of the glitter polishes.  A few of the ones I ordered, like \\&quot;grand finale\\&quot; and \\&quot;holiday jingle\\&quot; were glitter polishes, which means they have a clear base with almost all the color coming from the included glitter.  However, these were very different in consistency.  They were thick and gloppy and take forever to dry.  However, two of these, \\&quot;grande finale\\&quot; and \\&quot;black out\\&quot; are so awesome I don&#x27;t really mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I did research the colors before ordering, it wasn&#x27;t absolutely necessary.  Nearly all the colors looked almost identical on the nail as they do in the bottle.  This really pleased me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get one color mix-up but that was mostly my fault.  I read 198 as 190 and they gave me 191?  I had a very hard time reading the numbers due to the low resolution image.  I would really appreciate it if they uploaded a higher resolution version so that we could read the numbers clearly, or include a list in the description.  Also, these are standard sized 0.5 fl oz. bottle.  Since the size wasn&#x27;t listed I was concerned I might get minis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the minor quibbles this product is much better than it&#x27;s price would indicate.  I had lots of fun trying all the colors and I can&#x27;t wait to find an excuse to order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used amazon&#x27;s order inquiry system to send my color request immediately after ordering and they received it and acknowledged receipt right away.  I live just across the border from CA and I received my package *before* the delivery window.  Everything was packed reasonably well.  Only one handle was cracked, but luckily it happened to be the color I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I am a nail technician who is starting her own business. I needed to get some polishes built up in my arsenal and purchased these. I cannot tell you how very glad I am that I did. These colors are vibrant and apply nice and smooth. Really, they are just fantastic. I will be purchasing a lot more!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these colors as well. There were a couple that i had to add a few drops of thinner to in order to get the consistency that i wanted, but other than that it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 sets of these. I emailed the list of colors I wanted. I received 2 that were not on the list which means I did not get 2 that I wanted which is fine by me. They came in pretty quick and were all in one piece. These polishes do not smell as bad as some people have said and they are gorgeous. I will definitely be coming back to order ones that I didn&#x27;t get in this order.</li>
            <li> i ordered 48 other colors from this same seller, and loved them all! i did want specific colors though so i bought these as well! now i have 70! i gave the email list of colors a couple times, and the seller didn&#x27;t receive it until after it shipped! but i was pleased to find all of the specified colors in my package a day after the delivery date! i am very pleased with the seller and product!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of brands and Kleancolor is fairly good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the gorgeous shine that every other brand has, but the top coat can help.</li>
            <li> Although I did not purchase my set from Amazon I still wanted to write a review for those who are like me and have to do research before buying everything lol.&lt;br /&gt;First I want to say that if you are hesitant to buy this item for fear of poor quality because of the relatively low price then you have nothing to worry about! The quality of this polish surpasses even some of the more expensive polishes that I have.&lt;br /&gt;The one and only downfall of this polish is that, as some other people have pointed out, yes it does take forever to dry. HOWEVER, once it does dry this stuff will stay on for days! I had mine on for 4 days before it started to chip. (I used the basecoat and topcoat so that also could have helped).&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for a long lasting manicure with this brand of nail polish I suggest you set aside sometime from the day that less movement/use of your hands is needed. (Not more than an hour is needed for drying time so it&#x27;s not too bad and trust me its well worth the wait!) And again if you have a base and top coat please use it I promise you will get in a few more days of staying power.</li>
            <li> Impressed by the fact that I could pick my own colors.&lt;br /&gt;They are jus loke china glaze without the price.</li>
            <li> Cheap shipping to Canada, and a great deal on the polish! The polishes were wrapped very well, there was no way any of them could have broke. One of the lids had a small crack in it, but it didn&#x27;t affect the polish. And a few seemed to be \\&quot;too full\\&quot; but that has nothing to do with the seller. Was able to pick out the colours that I wanted and they were shipped out within a day of ordering. The package was labeled fragile in many places, but still came in the mail looking like it took quite a beating, that would be customs and the postal services fault though! Once again, the polishes were wrapped so well that even though they took a beating none of them were damaged. :) Cheap polishes, cheap shipping to Canada, great seller. Order these!~</li>
            <li> Polishes are great. Love the glitters and 3d textures.</li>
            <li> Very nice nail polish. Goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and lasts a long time. This line has an extensive color selection as well.</li>
            <li> Best deal for nail polish,  you even get to choose the colors u want,  thanks so much for this awesome product.  Works great</li>
            <li> They offer some awesome colors! BUT the quality is just not there. Usually I can paint my toe nails for the summer and they hardly chip. I only change colors when I get bored. With these products, the first time you shower after using them they are all chipped up. If you would like to use these products then I recommend a high quality bottom and top coat.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Kleancolor nail polish. Add a coat of clear coat on top of favorite color &amp; it stays for weeks. I own over 150 colors! I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> It was a more than  fair price, and I enjoyed how I chose the colors I wanted. The polish comes on really clean and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is it chips easily, however, I don&#x27;t use primer or top coat, either, so that could be a problem. Anyway, who&#x27;s not stoked to get 24 bottles of nail polish for twenty dollars? versus two and a half.</li>
            <li> As always, the Kleancolor nail polish is beautiful. Great pigment and a great selection of colors. The hardest part was picking only 24 colors. I received every color request and shipping was really fast. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update! I&#x27;m in stamping heaven with my Kleancolor polish! The only color I can&#x27;t make work so far is metallic green but I suspect user error since all of the others I try have worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Loved all my 24 colors. No spills or breakage. Well packed. Smell isn&#x27;t too horrible as read in other comments. Tried a couple of colors and they look great, although, I believe some colors have a different formula than the others. Seller did not have 2 colors that I requested for but they replaced with almost similar looking colors from their other line. Happy &amp; will buy it again. Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Some of the polishes do not cover properly and brushes are bit uneven. Thanks to the SV top coat I use, I can cover up some of the blemishes. Would be great if Kleancolor could improve their formula for better coverage. Gets annoying sometimes. But still love the colors. I am planning to get some thinner to get some of the polishes to flow better. Still happy with the purchase but 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> got almost none of the colors requested</li>
            <li> Bought several sets of these for shower favors and the guests loved them. I was able to pick exactly the colors I wanted and they shipped perfectly. The seller even let me know that the colors I picked were all in stock. I&#x27;d order them again in a second.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried after reading other&#x27;s reviews, but once I got and used them, I was happy I ordered them!  I have  probably 100+ bottles of nail polish, from expensive salon brands, to cheap dollar store brands.  These are by far one of the best I&#x27;ve used!  They go on very smoothly!  I&#x27;m typically cleaning polish off my cuticles and around the edges of my fingers, but I didn&#x27;t have to at all with these!  The brush/wand is slightly flattened out for better application, and it does help a bunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They cover in one to two coats, depending on what you are using.  I&#x27;ve used so far the Orchid Chrome and Holo Pink, both covered perfectly in only one coat.  I used 2 coats out of habit, and with the Orchid Crome there was really no difference with the second coat, the Holo Pink did get more vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewers said it took too long to dry, but I didn&#x27;t think it took longer than any other non-quick drying polish.  I actually found that they dried more thoroughly.  I painted my nails, and went to sleep about a half hour later, and woke up with absolutely NO marks at all!  Others have also said that they chip quickly, and I also didn&#x27;t find that.  Granted I used a long wear base coat of a different brand first, but I painted one coat on Saturday, another on Sunday, and no top coat at all.  I didn&#x27;t have to re-polish at all until Thursday.  And even then it was only minimal chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely happy with these polishes, and will absolutely purchase more!!!</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered all 24 of my colors in the sparkly, glittery range. I got all 24 that I wanted, the package was well packed and came promptly and the colors are beautiful. So why the 4 star rating instead of 5?? These are the two cons I have: As a few other reviewers states, the smell is VERY strong. I am sensitive to that kind of thing anyway and before I even opened the package, I could smell that strong nail polish-y smell - in fact I thought that one of the bottles may have broken inside the package. The bottles were all fine, but it almost over powered me when I actually put some of the polish on. Since I tried one on shortly before I was going to bed, I ended up removing it becuz the smell was bothering me and will try again when I have all day to let it air out. The other small complaint, and this could be &amp;#34;user error&amp;#34;, is that most of these lovely, sparkly colors are pretty much glitter in colorless polish. Maybe I was supposed to put a colored undercoat first, but the first polish I tried out was Fireworks, and even after applying 3 coats to just bare nails, it still looked as if I rather unevenly sprinkled some glitter pieces on my nails and adhered them with clear polish. And as a few reviewers also said, some of the polishes are quite thick in formula and may work better being thinned down a bit. Since I just received them, I havent looked for thinner yet and read online that you can add colorless polish to thicker polishes to &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; and even them out - might try that. I went on their site to pick my colors and they looked amazing on the nails they show to model the different colors and they do not look like that on mine, but again, perhaps I am doing it wrong and need a white or colored undercoat to make it look like the pics. All in all, this is a great deal and if you can get over the smell, you can probably make these work well. They certainly offer a huge variety of colors and sparkles and cheaper than you can buy them in most stores!!t stores!!</li>
