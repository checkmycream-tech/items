            <li>A well loved item.</li>
            <li>If you want GOOD quality ears do not buy these.</li>
            <li>if you want cheap things this is perfect and works</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t very appealing.</li>
            <li>Honestly they don&#x27;t look like cat ears they look like mouse because it does not have a good structure.</li>
            <li>The materials are nice but the just don&#x27;t look good unless you fuss with them.</li>
            <li>They arrived on time and looked cute upon purchasing, but once I tried them on, they looked like bear ears!</li>
            <li>Great and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>The cat ears kind of look like it</li>
            <li>They kind have a mouse-ear look</li>
            <li>Worth it!!!</li>
            <li>so they look more like nice ears (</li>
            <li>This makes the ears much more floppy, and they do not hold any sort of cat ear shape at all.  </li>
            <li>They may not be made of the highest quality, but they are ok for the price paid.</li>
            <li>Cute though.</li>
            <li>Look cute as a button</li>
            <li>They are more side cat ears than anything.</li>
            <li>then i set them on cardboard cut outs i made to reshape them better.</li>
            <li>There comfortable and don&#x27;t fall off!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a pretty good purchase, I would recommend if you just want to dress up for something.</li>
            <li>so I can have fun with them and be cute with them!</li>
            <li>Super cute but very cheap.</li>
            <li>I am glad these were so cheap, or I would be even angrier.  </li>
            <li>Cute as all get out but kinda cheaply made.</li>
            <li>They are cute, fuzzy, and tons of fun!  </li>
            <li>These are actually pretty cute!</li>
            <li>The clips came of easily.</li>
            <li>but it was an easy fix,</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely cute and looked exactly like they do in the picture, except they look more circular, like mouse ears maybe, than like cat ears.</li>
            <li>so cheap looking</li>
            <li>after that I just reshaped how the ears fit</li>
            <li>ok so yes i love these things however they were not made very well...</li>
            <li>These ears seem to be of good quality and the fur is so soft.</li>
            <li>first time I used the ears, the clip came off, The ears are also a bit deformed, they look more like mouse ears than cat ears.</li>
            <li>These were very inexpensive, yet exceedingly cute and oft-used at our house.</li>
            <li>I love these for kids not so much for adults.</li>
            <li>If you get these I hope youre expecting only 1 good pair.</li>
            <li>i think i explained that good enough...</li>
            <li>But overall the product was a good deal for 3</li>
            <li>If they stayed shaped right I would love them but when you first put them on they are rounded off like mouse ears.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really complain about this product for this cheap price.</li>
            <li>They are really soft and adorable.</li>
            <li>You have to bobby pin them to keep them shaped right.</li>
            <li>so ehh it got 3 stars for right now.</li>
            <li>Super cute, especially for a cosplay.</li>
            <li>This is what I paid for, they are really soft, Easy to put in and take out, I wore them for a goof hour and forgot I was wearing them.</li>
            <li>They ship quickly and are super soft!</li>
            <li>First off you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>These ears were extra cute and just what I needed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for some cute kitty ears I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li>Okay... The black ears are perfect buuuut the pink ones were deformed and the white ones clips automatically broke.</li>
            <li>Just have to know how to put them on haha</li>
            <li>You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>For the price i cant really complain but for all you looking to buy these they dont really have a cat ear shape</li>
            <li>They work great with long and short hair; thick hair would probably get a better hold.</li>
            <li>I took them apart and made a new pair because I really didn&#x27;t like how they looked</li>
            <li>They look more like mouhe black ones are ok.&lt;br /&gt;white</li>
            <li>Cute but oddly shaped</li>
            <li>Not pointed as shown but is easily fixed with glue or string</li>
            <li>I will have to take them apart completely to add bobby pins and something to help them keep a cat-ear shape.  </li>
            <li>but they arrived early and are really soft</li>
            <li>and they look so cute, Wore the white ones when i went to the mall and a few people complimented them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>I wanted white ones myself, but the different colours really do help when you need the variety.</li>
            <li>I got them a bit earlier then expected which is always a plus, and they do look like cat ears if you put them in the right spot and fix them a bit.</li>
            <li>ordered em a few weeks ago and  the ears the other day , and I just LOVE them - thankyou!¢¾</li>
            <li>Fun little costume decorations.</li>
            <li>My 12-year old daughter wears them nonstop, and the other two pairs are often attached to the heads of her 4 and 6 year old siblings.</li>
            <li>I will have to add another clip to make it seem a little real and cut it open to place something in it to give it some sort of shape.</li>
            <li>Cute and soft, only complaint is that the clips can break off of the ear since they are glued on and are hard to re-attach.</li>

            <li> Cute and soft, only complaint is that the clips can break off of the ear since they are glued on and are hard to re-attach.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to shape, and the product can be hard to place in your hair, but they do kind of resemble cat ears if done well enough, and they are very soft.</li>
            <li> I say buy them just careful one clip in the white pair</li>
            <li> However, my friend, who is a guy, also wears them and he has super short thin hair and they hold on really tight.</li>
            <li> Other then that they do have some shaping issues from being flat</li>
            <li> I lost the white and black ones</li>
            <li> like it should and and one in the black pair doesn&#x27;t work won&#x27;t open.</li>
            <li> the clips fell off a few days after three uses when i was testing them and for each ear they looked like they were all made for the same side of the head</li>
            <li> and pink are eh.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> which is the pink  </li>
            <li> so yea Be care careful.</li>
            <li> Though my only complaint is the shipping took very long.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use another pin like other reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;(will post pictures of the black and pink ones when i wear them)</li>
            <li> (black ears)</li>
            <li> But if you take the time to mess with them and place them strategically, they do look like cat ears.</li>
            <li> The little boys wear them too, and crawl around on the floor pretending to be cats.  </li>
            <li> so it bulged out of the ear a little.</li>
            <li> They are a little round and look like mouse ears, but nothing a little bit of inserted wire can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Shapeless and the clip fell off as soon as I opened them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these ears.</li>
            <li> They are small which I like but dont keep a cat ear shape.</li>
            <li> For the small price you pay for these ears</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s over a month of waiting for a small package.</li>
            <li> But they are difficult to clip in your hair without them looking strange.</li>
            <li> they dont stay in place on thin hair</li>
            <li> The fabric isn&#x27;t bad, I&#x27;ve had these since April and the clips haven&#x27;t fallen off yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably never wear this since they look so stupid on me, but I can use them for something else one day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worthless</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like them at all and the customer service was HORRIBLE not to mention it took like 30 days to get here</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so cheap looking I don&#x27;t like them at all and the customer service was HORRIBLE not to mention it took like 30 days to get here (chico ca)</li>
            <li> Not pointed as shown but is easily fixed with glue or string</li>
            <li> The fabric isn&#x27;t bad, I&#x27;ve had these since April and the clips haven&#x27;t fallen off yet. But they are difficult to clip in your hair without them looking strange. I&#x27;m considering taking the clip off and reglueing it to make them easier to put in.&lt;br /&gt;It was a pretty good purchase, I would recommend if you just want to dress up for something.</li>
            <li> These were very inexpensive, yet exceedingly cute and oft-used at our house. My 12-year old daughter wears them nonstop, and the other two pairs are often attached to the heads of her 4 and 6 year old siblings. The little boys wear them too, and crawl around on the floor pretending to be cats.  A well loved item.</li>
            <li> This is what I paid for, they are really soft, Easy to put in and take out, I wore them for a goof hour and forgot I was wearing them. They hold their form well. If you want cat ears I would buy this they are awesome.</li>
            <li> I love these for kids not so much for adults. They are small which I like but dont keep a cat ear shape. You have to bobby pin them to keep them shaped right. (black ears) They are really soft and adorable. If they stayed shaped right I would love them but when you first put them on they are rounded off like mouse ears. (white ears)</li>
            <li> This product is not what I paid for.  There are bobby pins, rather than the clips shown in the pictures.  This makes the ears much more floppy, and they do not hold any sort of cat ear shape at all.  I will have to take them apart completely to add bobby pins and something to help them keep a cat-ear shape.  I am glad these were so cheap, or I would be even angrier.  I can&#x27;t believe I waited several weeks just to end up with this garbage.</li>
            <li> Fun little costume decorations.</li>
            <li> For the small price you pay for these ears I think they are perfect. They may not be made of the highest quality, but they are ok for the price paid.</li>
            <li> Super cute, especially for a cosplay. Just have to know how to put them on haha</li>
            <li> I had to do some work on these to make them cat like. so ehh it got 3 stars for right now.</li>
            <li> They have no cat ear shape. It looks like a furry circle clipped on. Not to mention its cloth is flimsy. I will have to add another clip to make it seem a little real and cut it open to place something in it to give it some sort of shape. Might work as some sort of mouse ear. I gave it two stars because the idea of it. Personally i think it should be 3 for 0.50.</li>
            <li> I have ended up buying two packs of these because everyone loves them. I wanted white ones myself, but the different colours really do help when you need the variety. They work great with long and short hair; thick hair would probably get a better hold. However, my friend, who is a guy, also wears them and he has super short thin hair and they hold on really tight.</li>
            <li> The clips came of easily.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have interior wire or anything so they look more like nice ears (which is what everyone was telling me) so I&#x27;d suggest looking elsewhere for clip on cat ears.</li>
            <li> First off you get what you pay for so you can&#x27;t really complain about this product for this cheap price. Honestly they don&#x27;t look like cat ears they look like mouse because it does not have a good structure. If you want GOOD quality ears do not buy these.</li>
            <li> two of the clips were glued shut but it was an easy fix, after that I just reshaped how the ears fit and they look so cute, Wore the white ones when i went to the mall and a few people complimented them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also noted they arrived almost two weeks early&lt;br /&gt;(will post pictures of the black and pink ones when i wear them)</li>
            <li> They are cute, fuzzy, and tons of fun!  They go perfectly with the cat paws we ordered as well. Happy granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Okay... The black ears are perfect buuuut the pink ones were deformed and the white ones clips automatically broke. If you get these I hope youre expecting only 1 good pair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a cat cosplay. They arrived on time and looked cute upon purchasing, but once I tried them on, they looked like bear ears!</li>
            <li> ordered em a few weeks ago and  the ears the other day , and I just LOVE them - thankyou!¢¾</li>
            <li> ok so yes i love these things however they were not made very well...the clips fell off a few days after three uses when i was testing them and for each ear they looked like they were all made for the same side of the head kinda like if i had bought three pairs of shoes but they were all for the left foot...i think i explained that good enough...i actually took the pair that had no clips and sewed them on to a head band to make them easier to place ^_^</li>
            <li> I lost the white and black ones</li>
            <li> Cute as all get out but kinda cheaply made. The inside of the ear was bigger than the outside so it bulged out of the ear a little. Cute though.</li>
            <li> They look more like mouhe black ones are ok.&lt;br /&gt;white and pink are eh.&lt;br /&gt;But if you want cheap things this is perfect and works</li>
            <li> The cat ears kind of look like it and I don&#x27;t have to use another pin like other reviews said so.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look like cat ears. If you&#x27;re gonna buy just realize that you&#x27;ll have to put work into shaping them.</li>
            <li> i wear these everywhere. perfect and at a great price &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Look cute as a button</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend of mine. These ears seem to be of good quality and the fur is so soft. Though some chinks of the fur will fall off but it&#x27;s nothing to worry about. Though my only complaint is the shipping took very long. It arrived 32 days after I ordered it. That&#x27;s over a month of waiting for a small package.</li>
            <li> I really loved these ears! They definetly aren&#x27;t front ears if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s your looking for! They are more side cat ears than anything. But overall the product was a good deal for 3 so I&#x27;m happy. ^_^</li>
            <li> You really do get what you pay for. 4 stars because the clip detached from the glue. They are a little round and look like mouse ears, but nothing a little bit of inserted wire can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Cute but oddly shaped</li>
            <li> Super cute but very cheap. Ive already had to sew the clips back on 2 of them. Other then that they do have some shaping issues from being flat but i used a steamer to make the them a bit lose then i set them on cardboard cut outs i made to reshape them better.</li>
            <li> Shapeless and the clip fell off as soon as I opened them. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these ears. It&#x27;s worthless</li>
            <li> Great and easy to wear. Cute and soft, only complaint is that the clips can break off of the ear since they are glued on and are hard to re-attach. They don&#x27;t break easily, I&#x27;ve only had one ear break and I&#x27;ve had these for over a year with occasional use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely cute and looked exactly like they do in the picture, except they look more circular, like mouse ears maybe, than like cat ears. But if you take the time to mess with them and place them strategically, they do look like cat ears. I definitely plan on using these for cosplay.</li>
            <li> There so amazing!! There comfortable and don&#x27;t fall off! Worth it!!!💖</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t very appealing. The materials are nice but the just don&#x27;t look good unless you fuss with them. I took them apart and made a new pair because I really didn&#x27;t like how they looked</li>
            <li> These are actually pretty cute! I got them a bit earlier then expected which is always a plus, and they do look like cat ears if you put them in the right spot and fix them a bit. They kind have a mouse-ear look but hey, I bought them so I can have fun with them and be cute with them! I like them.</li>
            <li> For the price i cant really complain but for all you looking to buy these they dont really have a cat ear shape an they dont stay in place on thin hair but they arrived early and are really soft</li>
            <li> first time I used the ears, the clip came off, The ears are also a bit deformed, they look more like mouse ears than cat ears.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain for the price. I&#x27;ll probably never wear this since they look so stupid on me, but I can use them for something else one day.</li>
            <li> These ears were extra cute and just what I needed. I shopped around quite a bit looking for some ears but all I could find were some attached to headbands which isn&#x27;t what I wanted. With these clipping into my hair it makes it easier for me to position them where I want them. If you&#x27;re looking for some cute kitty ears I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> Looks like mouse ears</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay. They are difficult to shape, and the product can be hard to place in your hair, but they do kind of resemble cat ears if done well enough, and they are very soft.</li>
            <li> They came and it was awesome opening  them I say buy them just careful one clip in the white pair doesn&#x27;t even click  the clip was broke on the whire ones. like it should and and one in the black pair doesn&#x27;t work won&#x27;t open. Only one pair that does work  which is the pink  so yea Be care careful.</li>
            <li> For the price and the fact that it comes with 3 pairs is great! They ship quickly and are super soft! You may have to replace the clips but that&#x27;s no problem at all</li>
