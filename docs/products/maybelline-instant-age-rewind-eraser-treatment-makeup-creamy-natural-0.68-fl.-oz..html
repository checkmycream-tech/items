            <li> but it was too pink.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t too thin or too thick, seems to be odorless and one tube lasts about a month.</li>
            <li> The only con is it is a medium coverage, might need to use concealer for really hard to cover areas.</li>
            <li> and I twisted until i saw  a wet sot on the sponge, but the rest rest that I had twisted kept seeping out until the sponge was a glob filled with makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in this make up.</li>
            <li> what a bad design,  I pulled the sponge thing off, its useless for application, and I think unsanitary.</li>
            <li> Bad, bad design .  </li>

            <li> This product is smooth, creamy, does not sit on skin to slide off later. Does not dry out your skin. It is very easy to apply. The only con is it is a medium coverage, might need to use concealer for really hard to cover areas.</li>
            <li> The sponge applicator makes this foundation go on very smooth with no clumps, streaks or cakey look. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine turned me on to this product. I am 60 and was finding mineral powders just didn&#x27;t cover and even out my skin very well anymore. It goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t too thin or too thick, seems to be odorless and one tube lasts about a month. I hadn&#x27;t used Maybelline products since college, but they won me back. I still have my other higher end favorite makeup products that I use over this foundation, but this works for me for now. Does a good job of covering uneven skin tone and dark spots without being too heavy. I use number 200 which is just a bit lighter than a medium. Since I live in the north US, I can use this for about 9 months out of the year. I go a step darker in the summer when I have sun on my skin.</li>
            <li> the color is darker than i saw, you should fix the color and the image in the website aaaa aa</li>
            <li> I like the product when I got the right shade. This color is Creamy Natural but it was too pink. I have since ordered 190 Nude and that&#x27;s the right level without the pink.  I took off a star because of the applicator. YUCK.  what a bad design,  I pulled the sponge thing off, its useless for application, and I think unsanitary. It works fine without out it and you can see how much you how much is comming out when you twist it. I coluldnt tell how much was comming out with the sponge on and I twisted until i saw  a wet sot on the sponge, but the rest rest that I had twisted kept seeping out until the sponge was a glob filled with makeup.  Bad, bad design .  BUT I like the concealer and I will continue to use it but toss the sponge away.</li>
            <li> My favorite of all time foundation!  Applicator is GENIUS!  Perfect color.  Good coverage, not too light, just enough, doesn&#x27;t ever appear &#x27;cakey.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Great coverage and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my skin tone</li>
            <li> The Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Eraser Treatment Makeup is the greatest makeup I have ever used. It goes on creamy and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This is a must have as it is good for concealing any blemishes that are on the face. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This make up covers extremely well and feels extraordinarily light on my skin. It covers much better than any heavier application of make up I&#x27;ve used before. I have a number of colored spots and blotchy areas on my face. This make up covers them all in a remarkable fashion. Honestly, I always thought of Maybelline as a second rate cosmetic company - until now. I am a firm believer in this make up. It covers better with much less quantity of product than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. The sponge applicator is very handy too. Like they say, try it; you&#x27;ll like it. I&#x27;m guessing that you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
