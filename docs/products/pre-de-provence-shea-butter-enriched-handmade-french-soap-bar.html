            <li>I love this, it&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Soaps up nicely and has a nice mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>Pre de Provence offers some very good soaps with excellent fragrances, including this one - white gardenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Left my balls smelling great!!!</li>
            <li>My husband uses it mostly.</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep them elevated and out of standing water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, just satisfying.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this soap.  </li>
            <li>and I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love these soaps.</li>
            <li>It costs more than brand name soap, but it lasts so much longer and smells great.  </li>
            <li>9 more words required.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>&gt; 9 more words</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>The bar has a very nice lather and it&#x27;s fairly moisturizing, but I still need to use lotion on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>subscribe and save is super handy</li>
            <li>It smells great, lasts long, great price--really large bar.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance...</li>
            <li>scent is nice but pretty strong.....</li>
            <li>They are big and really beautifully scented.</li>
            <li>My favorite one so far; I&#x27;ve tried the Lavender, Sage and Rose, but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Pre de Provence soaps are fantastic and smell intoxicating.</li>
            <li>it is a great buy; the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fragrance may put some people off.</li>
            <li>The razor glides so smoothly over it.</li>
            <li>This is worth treating yourself!</li>
            <li>I would only suggest this for women, or a family bathroom, because it does have a good strong smell, and it is sweet and feminine.</li>
            <li>They have great smell and the aroma really matches a natural gardenia.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to choose the best one</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the quality, the price is not bad for a quality soap like this one and is really a decent size,&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I bought one white gardenia bar and loved it so much I turned around and bought 3 more for presents.</li>
            <li>The scent makes my whole bathroom smell fragrant and leaves my skin smelling like gardenia after drying off, which I love.</li>
            <li>I could smell them through the seal and decided not to break it so it would stay super pungent.</li>
            <li>I have bought several different fragrances of this brand, gardenia has to be one of the best.</li>
            <li>Pre de Provence has many scents that L&#x27;Occitane doesn&#x27;t, I love scents that smell like flowers, and White Gardenia is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Quality french milled shea butter soap, with a very nice soft yet strong gardenia scent.  </li>
            <li>Love it and it makes a nice little gift.</li>
            <li>Puts a smile on my face.&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t get soggy AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth every penny</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone looking for a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Very LARGE bar of soap and well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>This is a very large bar and it lasts for even longer than I&#x27;d anticipated looking at its size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit I hesitated to spend much on a single bar of soap, but I&#x27;m really glad I did!</li>
            <li>This is a decent size bar of soap and has a sweet perfume that doesn&#x27;t overpower a room.</li>
            <li>I left them sealed and put them in a cute Christmas box and gave three of each to my boyfriend&#x27;s aunts and grandma.</li>
            <li>Along with the fabulously authentic scent, there are very tiny abrasive particles that help with skin scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely reorder more.</li>
            <li>This would be great as a small gift--everyone needs soap!</li>
            <li>The smell is quite a nice natural gardenia, but being gardenia it is not subtle -- not Pepe Le Pew asphyxiating, but some sensitive people may find it a bit cloying.  </li>
            <li>They looked pretty much exactly like the picture as well, but since I didn&#x27;t use them I can&#x27;t say what their feel is really like.</li>
            <li>And it makes a fantastic lather and does not dry.  </li>
            <li>large bar - lasts a month for two of us who shower (</li>
            <li>They lather very well.</li>
            <li>All in all, they are very well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I like this one surprisingly much.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is wonderful--strong enough to add a light scent to the bathroom after I use it without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Gardenia is nice.  </li>
            <li>I regularly use Pre de Provence soap and don&#x27;t review every type I purchase but given the intense scent of this soap, I realized I better give the future gardenia soap purchasers a heads up.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the soap enough that I bought more--in White Gardenia and a variety of other scents--and they&#x27;ve all been lovely.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, leave your skin super smooth</li>
            <li>The soap itself is great and like other Pre de Provence soaps, it has bits of the plant in the soap so don&#x27;t be put off by the little flecks of material in the bar.  </li>
            <li>Love the Pre de Provence soaps, favorites are Lavender and Peony, I like this but not a true gardenia scent.</li>
            <li>This White Gardenia bar of soap smells great, has a slight texture, and, when new, is quite big all the way around.</li>
            <li>I like this soap as far as cleansing and being gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely difficult to get a good, non-chemically gardenia smell and anyone who has ever smelled a real one knows that!  </li>
            <li>Nice large size bar - very hard to find these days.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t exactly like gardenia, but it&#x27;s in the same arena.</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you are allergic to these chemicals, you should think twice or use modestly.</li>
            <li>irritates sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My wife has sensitive skin; this soap does not compound that problem.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin incredibly soft and fragrant.</li>
            <li>This hydrates my skin and makes it feel baby soft.</li>
            <li>Pre de Provence is my idea of a good time in the bath, shower, sink.. and don&#x27;t forget your tired out stuffed toys!</li>
            <li>Usually she gets a whole bunch of verbena, but this year we decided to mix it up a bit and spread the love to some other flavors!</li>
            <li>My skin is delicate and I can use this without any issue on my skin - I mention the particles because my skin actually feels more refreshed using this soap, I believe because of them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality soap and the bar lasts me a long time despite showering with it each day.</li>
            <li>A very long lasting soap bar w/excellent cleaning properties that leaves you feeling fresh w/a slight sent of Gardenia, but not overly so.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time since it is very thick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pluses are they are large and last a long time due to being milled (compressed) and the air bubbles take out rendering a very solid soap with heft.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, high quality soap, wide spectrum of scents...</li>

            <li> The smell also lingered on my skin for a little while.</li>

            <li> Best soap and wonderful fragrance!! Love it and it makes a nice little gift.</li>
            <li> My mom tells me this is the best soap ever.  Usually she gets a whole bunch of verbena, but this year we decided to mix it up a bit and spread the love to some other flavors!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice soap and lathers well.  I keep it in my shower and also use it in my bath.  I like the shape and I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time since it is very thick.</li>
            <li> Very LARGE bar of soap and well worth the expense. Pre de Provence soaps are fantastic and smell intoxicating.</li>
            <li> Pre de Provence offers some very good soaps with excellent fragrances, including this one - white gardenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pluses are they are large and last a long time due to being milled (compressed) and the air bubbles take out rendering a very solid soap with heft. They have great smell and the aroma really matches a natural gardenia. They lather very well. All in all, they are very well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the small minus(es). These soaps contain small amounts of Tetrasodium EDTA &amp; Tetrasodium Etidronate (as listed), which I developed an allergy to over the years and a small percentage of the population is like me. Therefore, if you are allergic to these chemicals, you should think twice or use modestly.</li>
            <li> Generous size bar.  Bought as a gift.  Recipient very happy.  So am I.</li>
            <li> Left my balls smelling great!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the quality, the price is not bad for a quality soap like this one and is really a decent size,&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- nicely scented&lt;br /&gt;- large bar - lasts a month for two of us who shower (almost) daily&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;#34;made in france&amp;#34; - always a nice thing.  Puts a smile on my face.&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t get soggy AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;- subscribe and save is super handy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- not much exfoliation&lt;br /&gt;- scent is nice but pretty strong.....irritates sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My wife has sensitive skin; this soap does not compound that problem. Also this soap has excellent fragrance stability.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I purchased this product from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I left them sealed and put them in a cute Christmas box and gave three of each to my boyfriend&#x27;s aunts and grandma. They were awesome! I could smell them through the seal and decided not to break it so it would stay super pungent. They looked pretty much exactly like the picture as well, but since I didn&#x27;t use them I can&#x27;t say what their feel is really like.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, high quality soap, wide spectrum of scents... Leaves skin incredibly soft and fragrant. Pricey, but worth every penny</li>
            <li> I bought one white gardenia bar and loved it so much I turned around and bought 3 more for presents. It smells great, lasts long, great price--really large bar. I have bought several different fragrances of this brand, gardenia has to be one of the best. Many others are quite nice too--linden is wonderful and so is the honey almond. Well, and so are a few of the others. This would be great as a small gift--everyone needs soap! It lathers well and smells wonderful, but the scent does not linger after you bathe--a good thing in my opinion, as I don&#x27;t want dueling scents when I apply perfume after a shower.</li>
            <li> I regularly use Pre de Provence soap and don&#x27;t review every type I purchase but given the intense scent of this soap, I realized I better give the future gardenia soap purchasers a heads up.  The smell is quite a nice natural gardenia, but being gardenia it is not subtle -- not Pepe Le Pew asphyxiating, but some sensitive people may find it a bit cloying.  In fact, if you have this soap in the soap dish for any amount of time, you will not need a room freshener in the bathroom at all.  The soap itself is great and like other Pre de Provence soaps, it has bits of the plant in the soap so don&#x27;t be put off by the little flecks of material in the bar.  And it makes a fantastic lather and does not dry.  Of course, it lasts a long time as well.  Hands down it is a great buy; the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fragrance may put some people off.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the winter time when you need to be reminded of the Spring! Lasts a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult to get a good, non-chemically gardenia smell and anyone who has ever smelled a real one knows that!  This is my ONLY soap - I use it daily, sometimes twice.  Along with the fabulously authentic scent, there are very tiny abrasive particles that help with skin scrubbing.  My skin is delicate and I can use this without any issue on my skin - I mention the particles because my skin actually feels more refreshed using this soap, I believe because of them.  Nothing like showering with a bar of soap that looks like vanilla bean ice cream and smells of heavenly gardenias! A staple in my shower!</li>
            <li> Pre de Provence makes the best soaps; been using them for decades.  I love that they come in a wonderful variety of scents too.  It&#x27;s hard to choose the best one so I rotate the different scents I like.  Currently loving the Gardenia during the dreary winter months--the smell reminds me of summer.</li>
            <li> Pre de Provence has many scents that L&#x27;Occitane doesn&#x27;t, I love scents that smell like flowers, and White Gardenia is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> This is a decent size bar of soap and has a sweet perfume that doesn&#x27;t overpower a room. Nice lather and at this price it is eligible for gifting yourself.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful,creamy handsoap.  The bar is a bit larger than standard sizes from the grocery stores. My husband uses it mostly. This is worth treating yourself!</li>
            <li> I truly never want to bathe with anything else. The white gardenia scent is heavenly. It cleans well without drying out skin. The scent makes my whole bathroom smell fragrant and leaves my skin smelling like gardenia after drying off, which I love. It also works well as a shaving cream. The razor glides so smoothly over it. It&#x27;s a high quality soap and the bar lasts me a long time despite showering with it each day. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This White Gardenia bar of soap smells great, has a slight texture, and, when new, is quite big all the way around.</li>
            <li> I love the soaps that this company makes, they are wonderful. I have ought several different varieties from them and have not been disapointed.</li>
            <li> I like this one surprisingly much.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of gardenia, you will like this soap. I would only suggest this for women, or a family bathroom, because it does have a good strong smell, and it is sweet and feminine. It isn&#x27;t exactly like gardenia, but it&#x27;s in the same arena. I do like it and I like that it also makes the bathroom smell nice. Not overpowering, but it&#x27;s present.</li>
            <li> This hydrates my skin and makes it feel baby soft. I love this, it&#x27;s truly amazing. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance...</li>
            <li> smells divine and lasts a long while. Not drying like I thought it might be.</li>
            <li> Quality french milled shea butter soap, with a very nice soft yet strong gardenia scent.  These bars last forever, maybe 4 - 6 weeks. Make sure you keep them elevated and out of standing water.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of gardenia, and this scent is intoxicating!  It&#x27;s not overpowering, just satisfying.  It makes a creamy, luxurious lather.</li>
            <li> Love love love this soap.  Long lasting, leave your skin super smooth and I love the fragrance.  Will definitely reorder more.</li>
            <li> Nice large size bar - very hard to find these days.  Soaps up nicely and has a nice mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> A very long lasting soap bar w/excellent cleaning properties that leaves you feeling fresh w/a slight sent of Gardenia, but not overly so.</li>
            <li> Love these soaps. They also make great gifts.</li>
            <li> Lovely, beautifully made soap.  Pamper your body and buy this!  You will be happy you did.  It costs more than brand name soap, but it lasts so much longer and smells great.  I am a convert!</li>
            <li> Prefer stronger smell.  Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Gardenia is nice.  Not artificial.&lt;br /&gt; 9 more words required.&lt;br /&gt; 9 more words required.&lt;br /&gt;xxxx</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I hesitated to spend much on a single bar of soap, but I&#x27;m really glad I did! This is a very large bar and it lasts for even longer than I&#x27;d anticipated looking at its size. The fragrance is wonderful--strong enough to add a light scent to the bathroom after I use it without being overpowering. The smell also lingered on my skin for a little while. The bar has a very nice lather and it&#x27;s fairly moisturizing, but I still need to use lotion on my dry skin. I enjoyed the soap enough that I bought more--in White Gardenia and a variety of other scents--and they&#x27;ve all been lovely.</li>
            <li> I like this soap as far as cleansing and being gentle on my skin.  I only wish is that the fragrance be a little stronger and stay on the skin longer.</li>
            <li> this was a little something for my sister.  she loves gardenias and was very happy with the scent.</li>
            <li> These soaps are very good.  They are big and really beautifully scented.</li>
            <li> Love the Pre de Provence soaps, favorites are Lavender and Peony, I like this but not a true gardenia scent.</li>
            <li> The best soap, ever ! Nothing gets you cleaner.</li>
            <li> Pre de Provence is my idea of a good time in the bath, shower, sink.. and don&#x27;t forget your tired out stuffed toys! This makes them look new with very little effort! Luxuriant, creamy, wonderful soap... leave out the exfoliant for me, that is, this one has none of that scratchy stuff... 5 stars fersure.&lt;br /&gt;Pre de Provence Soap - White Gardenia 250g  yummy-licious treat for your skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Pre de Provence</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review...&amp;#34;I LOVE THIS SOAP&amp;#34;. My favorite one so far; I&#x27;ve tried the Lavender, Sage and Rose, but this one is my favorite.  My sister also loves this soap, she came over to visit and I gave her one and she is hooked!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife and she loves it.  Beautiful fragrance, lathers well and rinses clean.  Great product.</li>
