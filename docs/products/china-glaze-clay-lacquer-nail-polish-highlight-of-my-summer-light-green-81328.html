            <li>This is a one of a kind polish - it is a beautiful neon mint green</li>
            <li>China Glaze is a terribly cheap quality brand of nail polish.  </li>

            <li>the first time i used two coats and a top coat</li>
            <li>Nice color, but takes 2-3 coats and color pops better over a coat of white.</li>

            <li>Chips right of the bat.</li>
            <li>i tried again with three coats and a top coat and it began to chip the next day.  </li>
            <li>Exact color in the picture</li>
            <li>Great summer color, creamy white base looks great and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>The  nail polish seems brand new.</li>

            <li> Very professional.</li>
            <li> Nice color, unfortunately, china glaze lasts no longer than 24 hours, the most :(</li>
            <li> Not the same quality as other China Glaze products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other colors that have just been released and they all chip.</li>
            <li> Also needs a white base or 4 coats for full coverage.</li>
            <li> It is a neon lime mint green.</li>
            <li> It is thin and doesn&#x27;t cover well, and I also don&#x27;t like the flat finish.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it chiped the next day.</li>
            <li> but DISsapointe chipped after the first day :(</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this nail polish</li>
            <li> I was totally disappointed with this polish.  </li>

            <li> The color is amazing! I love it as soon as a put it on. Unfortunately it chiped the next day. I&#x27;ve tried using a bonder, it helped to keep it from chipping for 3 days. I&#x27;ve tried other colors that have just been released and they all chip. I won&#x27;t be buying China Glaze again.</li>
            <li> Love the color but DISsapointe chipped after the first day :(</li>
            <li> i have tried this product twice.  the first time i used two coats and a top coat and it began to chip that evening.  i tried again with three coats and a top coat and it began to chip the next day.  i tried to contact china glaze and got an initial response but nothing since then.</li>
            <li> Nice color, but takes 2-3 coats and color pops better over a coat of white.</li>
            <li> Perfect summertime color!</li>
            <li> Love this color for spring and summer!!</li>
            <li> very good product thank you .</li>
            <li> Love, love,love this color!</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this nail polish it is the best color ever!! The formula is alright i hve to use 2 coats but thats just about every polish.</li>
            <li> I was totally disappointed with this polish.  It is thin and doesn&#x27;t cover well, and I also don&#x27;t like the flat finish.</li>
            <li> Really great polish. Finished a bit matte but a good top coat made it beautiful.</li>
            <li> Chips right of the bat. Peels without any causation. Not the same quality as other China Glaze products.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product, and the shipping. Very professional.</li>
            <li> The delivery time was good. The  nail polish seems brand new. I did two coats. This polish is so amazing, I am very happy I purchased it because I do not have any color like it. It is a neon lime mint green. It looks best outside, it really glows in the sun. I would recommend:)</li>
            <li> Much more of a mint color. Also needs a white base or 4 coats for full coverage.</li>
            <li> This is a one of a kind polish - it is a beautiful neon mint green</li>
            <li> Great summer color, creamy white base looks great and exactly as expected. I also recommend Beauty Shine for VERY quick shipping.</li>
            <li> China Glaze is a terribly cheap quality brand of nail polish.  It chips literally within hours and flakes off every nail.  I will not buy this brand ever again.</li>
            <li> Nice color, unfortunately, china glaze lasts no longer than 24 hours, the most :(</li>
            <li> Lovely color. Exact color in the picture and I am glad about that!!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color!!! Shipping was quick. Ty</li>
            <li> Awesome color.. shipping took forever though</li>
