            <li>I can look in my rearview mirror (which I find myself doing, in wonder at how great it looks....)</li>
            <li>The Smashbox BB cream looked great by itself, and great with my Smashbox foundation, but when paired with the MAC foundation product, it appeared orange-ish.</li>

            <li>The sellers were very nice and had good customer service but this products shade of color was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It gives you the perfect coverage, it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>use the Fair, there are two shades of fair.</li>
            <li>But not so good anymore.  </li>
            <li>A good BB cream for oily skin that doesn&#x27;t need a ton of coverage.</li>
            <li>The coverage is good though and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out</li>
            <li>Initially, I loved this product.</li>
            <li>and I loved how I looked in pictures.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as some of the drug store ones I&#x27;ve tried (Maybelline and L&#x27;Oreal both make one with nicer coverage at 1/3 the price).</li>
            <li>Love Smash box and love that I can get for a great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and smooth, has great coverage and makes your skin look flawless!  </li>
            <li>This BB cream lies so lightly but still has very good coverage.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product &amp; delivery time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup guru or anything, but I love this BB cream!</li>
            <li>Love this tinted moisturizer!</li>
            <li>ALL DAY this stuff held on, evening out the blotchy pinkness and giving my skin this amazing perfection.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER been the kind of person to want to spackle my face to cover up zits all day, so</li>
            <li>but it really looks great on and in photographs!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m kind of on the lighter side of medium.  </li>
            <li>(kind of like I had bronzer).  </li>
            <li>Goes on light and smooth while doing a superb job of coverage.</li>
            <li>are absolutely enough to make perfect and smooth color.&lt;br /&gt;Another very good product from Smashbox.</li>
            <li>I had mild acne and it covered great.</li>
            <li>Sure about $38 for a tube might give you a shock, but I paid more than that for the two tubes of primer/day SPF cream!</li>
            <li>Best BB cream I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li>but this BB Cream is so much more.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m testing out another brand and will update the Smashbox review if I find a better one.</li>
            <li>My favorite still remains the Smashboxuct, it appeared orange-ish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m testing out another brand and will update the Smashbox review if I find a better one.</li>
            <li>My favorite still remains the Smashbox</li>
            <li>It is magic in a tube.</li>
            <li>Love the staying power and the texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more breathable than Smashbox.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I expeted way more from a company like Smashbox.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t cover any better than a BB cream from a drug store.</li>
            <li>Even the L&#x27;Oreal BB cream is better than this.</li>
            <li>I did some research to be sure I&#x27;d buy the correct shade for my complexion.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for three weeks and will always make sure I have this on hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this bb cream for almost a year &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said it is one of the best BBcreams on the market for pale people, but it does have it&#x27;s own faults.</li>
            <li>The Light Medium is a MUCH better match than the Medium.  </li>
            <li>Top with Smashbox Halo in Light.  </li>
            <li>The Light Medium is a MUCH better match than the Medium.  </li>
            <li>Top with Smashbox Halo in Light.  </li>
            <li>There is just something SPECIAL about this BB cream!</li>
            <li>Works great as a foundation as well as a primer, expensive but an awesome product.  </li>
            <li>Coverage is pretty good, not as good as Estee Lauder Double wear or Revlon Colorstay, but a bit better than my Tarte Tinted Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>with sunlight hitting my face: normally sunlight will spotlight flaws in older skin and amplify them, but this BB cream makes my skin look like I have on NO MAKEUP and naturally perfect skin, in real broad bright revealing daylight.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to wear underneath the eyes, because it conceals dark circles!</li>
            <li>YET...every morning, on would go the BB cream and a light tapping of foundation</li>
            <li>when I say that this BB Cream is too amazing, I was even willing to have my face look like this at night, to have it look so great ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li>Being olive complected, I chose the \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; color (my choices were light or medium for the sample).  </li>
            <li>and I went ahead and ordered the Light Medium.  </li>
            <li>and I went ahead and ordered the Light Medium.  </li>
            <li>And, since it goes on so lightly that is not a problem.</li>
            <li>Completely bummed because I really loved this BB cream.</li>
            <li>Their Extra Light cream (not the compact!) is comparable with the Smashbox Fair.</li>
            <li>Completely bummed because I really loved this BB cream.</li>
            <li>Their Extra Light cream (not the compact!) is comparable with the Smashbox Fair.</li>
            <li>Aveeno gve me good coverage but still that natural, dewy look.</li>
            <li>I have flawless skin normally, I&#x27;m Persian and barely ever need to wear makeup.</li>
            <li>If you manage to order the right color for you this is a lovely BB cream.</li>
            <li>As much as I loved the quality and finish of this product the color I ordered was about two shades too dark, which is my own fault.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have found that provides coverage, evens out my skin, and also offers great sun protection.  </li>
            <li>i have a new favorite!  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true test of any cosmetic is how it looks in real light; I am of an older age</li>
            <li>Smashbox has always been one that I can rely on to look good in daylight (no orange or pink) and this BB cream goes one better.</li>
            <li>I love that it covers but doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup, for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>but wow, in the daylight it looked amazing.</li>
            <li>When I buy a full sized, I will probably get Light-Medium.  </li>
            <li>It basically looked like a tan, so not bad at all</li>
            <li>The cream actually does give relatively good coverage, but dries too quickly to spread</li>
            <li>I felt like a sellout for about a week and was not willing to give up how great my face looked during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with a few Smashbox products, and this Camera Ready BB cream is no exception.</li>
            <li>It is a great high spf product and only needs additional applications to keep the sun blocking in place.  </li>
            <li>I like the Fair because it cancels out the redness, but there is a Light that is a little darker.</li>
            <li>The only thing I put on before this product is Finacea, and the BB cream goes on top of that smoothly.</li>
            <li>My skin looks natural and healthy with this routine and photographs beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks natural and healthy with this routine and photographs beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, and I&#x27;m a cheapskate when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I take this traveling with me, it&#x27;s easy to carry, easy to use, and takes the place of multiple products (sunscreen, moisturizer, foundation and powder) in my bag.</li>
            <li>I was surprised about how very little product can provide this impressive coverage.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but will not buy it again since I can get better results for less.</li>
            <li>I broke out about 2 weeks in and I&#x27;m still having to stay on top of my treatments to recover about 3 weeks later....</li>
            <li>The color I received is not the same as I&#x27;ve used many times.  </li>
            <li>First I used a bit of concealer on hyperpigmented spots.  </li>
            <li>(Estee Lauder Double Wear powder in Tawny), a bit of Blush (Smashbox Blush Rush in Pose), and Smashbox baked bronzer on top of that.</li>
            <li>It definitely did not aggravate my acne and in fact, my skin looked better after removal.  </li>
            <li>At first, I found that I still needed a primer, but now, I don&#x27;t bother with primer.  </li>
            <li>At first, I found that I still needed a primer, but now, I don&#x27;t bother with primer.  </li>
            <li>I regularly use the Smashbox lip products and love them</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Smashbox primers and so was very excited when they put out a BB product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you have problems finding shades light enough for your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the decent foundations for people with very, very light skin color, as it&#x27;s hard to find a better shade to suit.</li>
            <li>only thing I would change about this product is that by the end of the day, it will sink in my large pores around the nose, (but that happens to me with every type of liquid makeup ) and it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to camouflage that with a mineral veil or powder foundation.</li>
            <li>and I can leave the house looking fairly decent!</li>
            <li>I was really torn about the BB cream</li>
            <li>The finish is on the dewy side (though not as dewy as my Tarte Smooth Operator tinted moisturizer) and not matte like Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and acne prone.  </li>
            <li>but so far from my experience using it, it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s not too thick, it doesn&#x27;t exactly give a whole new layer to my skin (you can still kind of see some freckles), but it gives it enough coverage to make my skin look even. :)</li>
            <li>As suspected the color was slightly dark (darker than Tarte Agent 14), but may work better in the summer.  </li>
            <li>so I use a matte clear loose powder on top of it</li>
            <li>Great coverage and less shine than my other BB cream</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because it ranks high on EWG.ORG.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>It has more of a powder-like, matte finish and contains little to no oil.</li>
            <li>Normally if something makes me break out, I pitch it in the trash</li>
            <li>Smashbox feels more heavy like a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a more heavy &amp; oily feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>and my complexion is better after using Smashbox for just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying a tube of this (in the right color)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In terms of oil control, I still would use a primer (Smash Box Light Primer) underneath in summer, but the product didn&#x27;t melt off my face like some other foundations (I&#x27;m looking at you, Bobbi Brown).  </li>
            <li>And the light is a good color match to me, a brunette but not fair or pale</li>
            <li>No more acne, and in fact my skin tone is looking more even than before.</li>
            <li>No more daytime moisturizer (this is SPF35) needed, and I don&#x27;t have to use my Smashbox primer any more.</li>
            <li>While it has the ability to conceal dark circles, it also can bring light to your face where it is needed.</li>
            <li>I usually use it to even out some blotchy Rosacea skin, but it does so much more.</li>
            <li>so make sure to do small amounts at a time</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with Estee Lauder Double Wear in Tawny, Tawny is slightly yellower whereas this BB cream is a bit more orange (I wish it were less orange, but summer is coming...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with Estee Lauder Double Wear in Tawny, Tawny is slightly yellower whereas this BB cream is a bit more orange (I wish it were less orange, but summer is coming...</li>
            <li>It is not thick, so it barely looks and feels like you have any make up on.</li>
            <li>While Smashbox is not as heavy as foundation, it&#x27;s not as light and breathable as Aveeno.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>As a busy working mom I put this on with some lip gloss</li>
            <li>It leaves a natural, even finish, will keep my oily skin non-shiny all day ,it doesn&#x27;t break me out, it doesn&#x27;t get patchy and does not settle in lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aveeno is much more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Smashbox is at least 2x more expensive than Aveeno BB cream.</li>
            <li>The bottle lasts a good while and is exactly what I don&#x27;t hate about foundations.</li>
            <li>The other shades looked very versatile, get lighter than you think you need.</li>
            <li>and it actually seems to be drying on certain parts of my face because it leaves little flakes.  </li>
            <li>A tiny little 1/4\\&quot; line will do your whole face.</li>

            <li> ALL DAY this stuff held on, evening out the blotchy pinkness and giving my skin this amazing perfection.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER been the kind of person to want to spackle my face to cover up zits all day, so</li>
            <li> but it really looks great on and in photographs!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m kind of on the lighter side of medium.  </li>
            <li> (kind of like I had bronzer).  </li>
            <li> Goes on light and smooth while doing a superb job of coverage.</li>
            <li> are absolutely enough to make perfect and smooth color.&lt;br /&gt;Another very good product from Smashbox.</li>
            <li> I had mild acne and it covered great.</li>
            <li> Sure about $38 for a tube might give you a shock, but I paid more than that for the two tubes of primer/day SPF cream!</li>
            <li> Best BB cream I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li> but this BB Cream is so much more.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m testing out another brand and will update the Smashbox review if I find a better one.</li>
            <li> My favorite still remains the Smashboxuct, it appeared orange-ish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m testing out another brand and will update the Smashbox review if I find a better one.</li>
            <li> My favorite still remains the Smashbox</li>
            <li> It is magic in a tube.</li>
            <li> Love the staying power and the texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more breathable than Smashbox.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I expeted way more from a company like Smashbox.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cover any better than a BB cream from a drug store.</li>
            <li> Even the L&#x27;Oreal BB cream is better than this.</li>
            <li> I did some research to be sure I&#x27;d buy the correct shade for my complexion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for three weeks and will always make sure I have this on hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this bb cream for almost a year &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said it is one of the best BBcreams on the market for pale people, but it does have it&#x27;s own faults.</li>
            <li> The Light Medium is a MUCH better match than the Medium.  </li>
            <li> Top with Smashbox Halo in Light.  </li>
            <li> The Light Medium is a MUCH better match than the Medium.  </li>
            <li> Top with Smashbox Halo in Light.  </li>
            <li> There is just something SPECIAL about this BB cream!</li>
            <li> Works great as a foundation as well as a primer, expensive but an awesome product.  </li>
            <li> Coverage is pretty good, not as good as Estee Lauder Double wear or Revlon Colorstay, but a bit better than my Tarte Tinted Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> with sunlight hitting my face: normally sunlight will spotlight flaws in older skin and amplify them, but this BB cream makes my skin look like I have on NO MAKEUP and naturally perfect skin, in real broad bright revealing daylight.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to wear underneath the eyes, because it conceals dark circles!</li>
            <li> YET...every morning, on would go the BB cream and a light tapping of foundation</li>
            <li> when I say that this BB Cream is too amazing, I was even willing to have my face look like this at night, to have it look so great ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> Being olive complected, I chose the \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; color (my choices were light or medium for the sample).  </li>
            <li> and I went ahead and ordered the Light Medium.  </li>
            <li> and I went ahead and ordered the Light Medium.  </li>
            <li> And, since it goes on so lightly that is not a problem.</li>
            <li> Completely bummed because I really loved this BB cream.</li>
            <li> Their Extra Light cream (not the compact!) is comparable with the Smashbox Fair.</li>
            <li> Completely bummed because I really loved this BB cream.</li>
            <li> Their Extra Light cream (not the compact!) is comparable with the Smashbox Fair.</li>
            <li> Aveeno gve me good coverage but still that natural, dewy look.</li>
            <li> I have flawless skin normally, I&#x27;m Persian and barely ever need to wear makeup.</li>
            <li> If you manage to order the right color for you this is a lovely BB cream.</li>
            <li> As much as I loved the quality and finish of this product the color I ordered was about two shades too dark, which is my own fault.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have found that provides coverage, evens out my skin, and also offers great sun protection.  </li>
            <li> i have a new favorite!  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true test of any cosmetic is how it looks in real light; I am of an older age</li>
            <li> Smashbox has always been one that I can rely on to look good in daylight (no orange or pink) and this BB cream goes one better.</li>
            <li> I love that it covers but doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup, for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> but wow, in the daylight it looked amazing.</li>
            <li> When I buy a full sized, I will probably get Light-Medium.  </li>
            <li> It basically looked like a tan, so not bad at all</li>
            <li> The cream actually does give relatively good coverage, but dries too quickly to spread</li>
            <li> I felt like a sellout for about a week and was not willing to give up how great my face looked during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with a few Smashbox products, and this Camera Ready BB cream is no exception.</li>
            <li> It is a great high spf product and only needs additional applications to keep the sun blocking in place.  </li>
            <li> I like the Fair because it cancels out the redness, but there is a Light that is a little darker.</li>
            <li> The only thing I put on before this product is Finacea, and the BB cream goes on top of that smoothly.</li>
            <li> My skin looks natural and healthy with this routine and photographs beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin looks natural and healthy with this routine and photographs beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, and I&#x27;m a cheapskate when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I take this traveling with me, it&#x27;s easy to carry, easy to use, and takes the place of multiple products (sunscreen, moisturizer, foundation and powder) in my bag.</li>
            <li> I was surprised about how very little product can provide this impressive coverage.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but will not buy it again since I can get better results for less.</li>
            <li> I broke out about 2 weeks in and I&#x27;m still having to stay on top of my treatments to recover about 3 weeks later....</li>
            <li> The color I received is not the same as I&#x27;ve used many times.  </li>
            <li> First I used a bit of concealer on hyperpigmented spots.  </li>
            <li> (Estee Lauder Double Wear powder in Tawny), a bit of Blush (Smashbox Blush Rush in Pose), and Smashbox baked bronzer on top of that.</li>
            <li> It definitely did not aggravate my acne and in fact, my skin looked better after removal.  </li>
            <li> At first, I found that I still needed a primer, but now, I don&#x27;t bother with primer.  </li>
            <li> At first, I found that I still needed a primer, but now, I don&#x27;t bother with primer.  </li>
            <li> I regularly use the Smashbox lip products and love them</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Smashbox primers and so was very excited when they put out a BB product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you have problems finding shades light enough for your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the decent foundations for people with very, very light skin color, as it&#x27;s hard to find a better shade to suit.</li>
            <li> only thing I would change about this product is that by the end of the day, it will sink in my large pores around the nose, (but that happens to me with every type of liquid makeup ) and it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to camouflage that with a mineral veil or powder foundation.</li>
            <li> and I can leave the house looking fairly decent!</li>
            <li> I was really torn about the BB cream</li>
            <li> The finish is on the dewy side (though not as dewy as my Tarte Smooth Operator tinted moisturizer) and not matte like Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and acne prone.  </li>
            <li> but so far from my experience using it, it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s not too thick, it doesn&#x27;t exactly give a whole new layer to my skin (you can still kind of see some freckles), but it gives it enough coverage to make my skin look even. :)</li>
            <li> As suspected the color was slightly dark (darker than Tarte Agent 14), but may work better in the summer.  </li>
            <li> so I use a matte clear loose powder on top of it</li>
            <li> Great coverage and less shine than my other BB cream</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it ranks high on EWG.ORG.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> It has more of a powder-like, matte finish and contains little to no oil.</li>
            <li> Normally if something makes me break out, I pitch it in the trash</li>
            <li> Smashbox feels more heavy like a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a more heavy &amp; oily feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> and my complexion is better after using Smashbox for just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying a tube of this (in the right color)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In terms of oil control, I still would use a primer (Smash Box Light Primer) underneath in summer, but the product didn&#x27;t melt off my face like some other foundations (I&#x27;m looking at you, Bobbi Brown).  </li>
            <li> And the light is a good color match to me, a brunette but not fair or pale</li>
            <li> No more acne, and in fact my skin tone is looking more even than before.</li>
            <li> No more daytime moisturizer (this is SPF35) needed, and I don&#x27;t have to use my Smashbox primer any more.</li>
            <li> While it has the ability to conceal dark circles, it also can bring light to your face where it is needed.</li>
            <li> I usually use it to even out some blotchy Rosacea skin, but it does so much more.</li>
            <li> so make sure to do small amounts at a time</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with Estee Lauder Double Wear in Tawny, Tawny is slightly yellower whereas this BB cream is a bit more orange (I wish it were less orange, but summer is coming...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with Estee Lauder Double Wear in Tawny, Tawny is slightly yellower whereas this BB cream is a bit more orange (I wish it were less orange, but summer is coming...</li>
            <li> It is not thick, so it barely looks and feels like you have any make up on.</li>
            <li> While Smashbox is not as heavy as foundation, it&#x27;s not as light and breathable as Aveeno.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> As a busy working mom I put this on with some lip gloss</li>
            <li> It leaves a natural, even finish, will keep my oily skin non-shiny all day ,it doesn&#x27;t break me out, it doesn&#x27;t get patchy and does not settle in lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aveeno is much more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Smashbox is at least 2x more expensive than Aveeno BB cream.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a good while and is exactly what I don&#x27;t hate about foundations.</li>
            <li> The other shades looked very versatile, get lighter than you think you need.</li>
            <li> and it actually seems to be drying on certain parts of my face because it leaves little flakes.  </li>
            <li> A tiny little 1/4\\&quot; line will do your whole face.</li>
            <li> Hard to color match online though so go to a store and look first.</li>
            <li> and the next day I had a minor zit in the Cindy Crawford area...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every day for over a week, I would put this on on the morning with a flat foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Use this with Smashbox primer and you will have a day with long lasting foundation and no worries about reapplying before you get through the office day.</li>
            <li> I got a few facials to take the gunk out of my face, switched to CoverFX, tried new cleansing washes, used a retinol, (I DID EVERYTHING) and thankfully my face is now clearer than ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not the type to spend this much money on 1.4 oz.</li>
            <li> complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I also use way less foundation than before; my foundation currently lasts me about 5 months so at this rate I may get almost a year out of</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it can cause pretty severe breakouts if you don&#x27;t use it often enough for your skin to get used to the make-</li>
            <li> It also gave an oddly shiny finish that was not to be confused with &#x27;fresh and dewy&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It also gave an oddly shiny finish that was not to be confused with &#x27;fresh and dewy&#x27;.</li>
            <li> not much to say.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time in the sun.</li>
            <li> This product must be a fake or something because when I put it on my face it immediately started to clump up and then just fall right off.</li>
            <li> Anyway, a little bit of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve compared this product to Aveeno BB cream, and Aveeno won.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve literraly put Smabox BB cream on one side of my face, and Aveeno BB cream on the other.</li>
            <li> Holy cow.</li>
            <li> And then get ready to rearend the driver in front of you as you are unable to stop looking at the flawlessness that BB Cream</li>
            <li> The color, as I said, was a bit too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a professional model you might want to avoid it, as it does come off quite chalky on HD film and photography without a normally unnecessary amount of editing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> after about 10 days, my face calmed down.</li>
            <li> (the Agent 14 is slightly too dark for me, btw).  </li>
            <li> But I tend to prefer a less bronzed look.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I mix a bit of the photo finish primer with it for an even smoother, less heavy appearance.</li>
            <li> It is actually a little chalky and doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin</li>
            <li> I was told by someone at Sephora the spf used in this product blocks and clogs the sh*t out of your pores and isn&#x27;t for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for photos, but as a person who suffers from bad acne, this isn&#x27;t for me!</li>
            <li> It is watered down and does not do anything, at least for my fair,freckled skin.</li>
            <li> Then, I put a small bit on my hand and used my foundation brush (EcoTools) to blend it in.  </li>
            <li> am a devoted BB cream person, I find foundations cakey, too heavy and unnecessary.</li>
            <li> otherwise it will be too thick by the time it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was much less expensive on Amazon than at Sephora.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t replace the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Well, you&#x27;ll probably say worse than that when you see for yourself.</li>
            <li> The only base that I use.</li>
            <li> but my face got worse.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it at all.  </li>
            <li> That is so sad....</li>
            <li> I was left with awful blemishes.</li>
            <li> and it gets a scathing review on here.</li>
            <li> And every night when I took off my foundation, my face looked like I had chicken pox from the acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on ordering this again once it&#x27;s out because it&#x27;s too expensive!</li>
            <li> However, this ridiculously expensive product made me break out so bad!</li>
            <li> To the point where I have never seen my skin like this, it looks terrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Another Pinterest find. Great coverage without looking plastered with foundation.  Blends well into the skin.  And the light is a good color match to me, a brunette but not fair or pale</li>
            <li> I accidentally stumbled upon this product after seeing a Youtube video of it, had never seen it before or heard of it. HOW? How can folks not shout about this from the rooftops?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it the second it arrived in the mail....and the next day I had a minor zit in the Cindy Crawford area...ugh. I&#x27;d read reviews about it causing acne, and dummy that I am, ordered it anyway just in case. Normally if something makes me break out, I pitch it in the trash and it gets a scathing review on here. But...something was different about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day for over a week, I would put this on on the morning with a flat foundation brush. A tiny little 1/4\\&quot; line will do your whole face. And every night when I took off my foundation, my face looked like I had chicken pox from the acne. YET...every morning, on would go the BB cream and a light tapping of foundation and my skin looked great. I was really torn about the BB cream, my face looked like hell at night but wow, in the daylight it looked amazing. ALL DAY this stuff held on, evening out the blotchy pinkness and giving my skin this amazing perfection. I thought the Smashbox foundation I use is great but this BB Cream is so much more..... I have NEVER been the kind of person to want to spackle my face to cover up zits all day, so when I say that this BB Cream is too amazing, I was even willing to have my face look like this at night, to have it look so great ALL DAY LONG. That is so sad....I felt like a sellout for about a week and was not willing to give up how great my face looked during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...after about 10 days, my face calmed down. No more acne, and in fact my skin tone is looking more even than before. I can wash my face at night and wake up with perfectly even skin tone in the morning, no blotch or discoloration. The only thing I put on before this product is Finacea, and the BB cream goes on top of that smoothly. No more daytime moisturizer (this is SPF35) needed, and I don&#x27;t have to use my Smashbox primer any more. This BB cream does it all! Sure about $38 for a tube might give you a shock, but I paid more than that for the two tubes of primer/day SPF cream! And to boot, nothing short of painting concealer all over my face would have covered up and smoothed things out like this. Hell no, concealer wouldn&#x27;t work. There is just something SPECIAL about this BB cream! I also use way less foundation than before; my foundation currently lasts me about 5 months so at this rate I may get almost a year out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true test of any cosmetic is how it looks in real light; I am of an older age so my skin in daylight doesn&#x27;t look like a teenager. Smashbox has always been one that I can rely on to look good in daylight (no orange or pink) and this BB cream goes one better. I can look in my rearview mirror (which I find myself doing, in wonder at how great it looks....) with sunlight hitting my face: normally sunlight will spotlight flaws in older skin and amplify them, but this BB cream makes my skin look like I have on NO MAKEUP and naturally perfect skin, in real broad bright revealing daylight. Holy cow. Well, you&#x27;ll probably say worse than that when you see for yourself. I have even just dabbed some of this BB Cream on and then ran some errands and it still looked like I had flawless skin; I have anything BUT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Fair, there are two shades of fair. I like the Fair because it cancels out the redness, but there is a Light that is a little darker. The other shades looked very versatile, get lighter than you think you need. And then get ready to rearend the driver in front of you as you are unable to stop looking at the flawlessness that BB Cream imparts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I switched to MAC&#x27;s Studio Fix Fluid, and it just does not work with Smashbox BB cream, not for me anyway. The Smashbox BB cream looked great by itself, and great with my Smashbox foundation, but when paired with the MAC foundation product, it appeared orange-ish. It also gave an oddly shiny finish that was not to be confused with &#x27;fresh and dewy&#x27;. It was like the North and South of products, dueling it out on my face! So I switched to Philosophy The Present as a primer with MAC foundation products. However, there is no color to it, no anti-aging benefits, and no SPF. Completely bummed because I really loved this BB cream. I just needed to move on from the PhotoReady cream (for now, or forever, not decided yet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11-17-12: I still use Studio Fix Fluid and found that MAC makes a BB Cream and BB Compact. If I could get the Smashbox and MAC products to cooperate I would still be using the Smashbox as it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried yet! Their Extra Light cream (not the compact!) is comparable with the Smashbox Fair. My advice would be to avoid the MAC Compact BB Balm. (Review on that coming) I&#x27;m testing out another brand and will update the Smashbox review if I find a better one. My favorite still remains the Smashboxuct, it appeared orange-ish.

If I could get the Smashbox and MAC products to cooperate I would still be using the Smashbox as it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried yet! Their Extra Light cream (not the compact!) is comparable with the Smashbox Fair. My advice would be to avoid the MAC Compact BB Balm. (Review on that coming) I&#x27;m testing out another brand and will update the Smashbox review if I find a better one. My favorite still remains the Smashbox</li>
            <li> Really beautiful bb cream üëç</li>
            <li> This BB cream is absolutely wonderful. It is not thick, so it barely looks and feels like you have any make up on. It is wonderful to wear underneath the eyes, because it conceals dark circles! While it has the ability to conceal dark circles, it also can bring light to your face where it is needed. It is magic in a tube. Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> Use this with Smashbox primer and you will have a day with long lasting foundation and no worries about reapplying before you get through the office day.</li>
            <li> i have a new favorite!  i will be reordering</li>
            <li> As much as I loved the quality and finish of this product the color I ordered was about two shades too dark, which is my own fault. If you manage to order the right color for you this is a lovely BB cream.</li>
            <li> The only base that I use. Love the staying power and the texture. The bottle lasts a good while and is exactly what I don&#x27;t hate about foundations.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing. It gives you the perfect coverage, it&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s a great option for when you don&#x27;t have time to put foundation. The only bad thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t replace the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I did like it.  Covered well.  But not so good anymore.  I gave it 3 stars because it ranks high on EWG.ORG.  I will only be using it every once in a while because of not-so-healthy ingredients and will find something that is skin-friendly.</li>
            <li> A good BB cream for oily skin that doesn&#x27;t need a ton of coverage. However, I&#x27;ve compared this product to Aveeno BB cream, and Aveeno won.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve literraly put Smabox BB cream on one side of my face, and Aveeno BB cream on the other. I wore it for the duration of the day, to make my decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno won because:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s more breathable than Smashbox. Smashbox feels more heavy like a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I am a devoted BB cream person, I find foundations cakey, too heavy and unnecessary. While Smashbox is not as heavy as foundation, it&#x27;s not as light and breathable as Aveeno. Aveeno gve me good coverage but still that natural, dewy look. (not cakey!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Aveeno is much more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Smashbox is at least 2x more expensive than Aveeno BB cream.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s perfect lightweight coverage</li>
            <li> I have been using primer and powder from Smashbox and decided to buy BB cream of the same color. They go so well together. This BB cream lies so lightly but still has very good coverage. I do not need foundation with it - this BB cream and powder from Smashbox are absolutely enough to make perfect and smooth color.&lt;br /&gt;Another very good product from Smashbox.</li>
            <li> not much to say. I was looking forward to trying this BB cream. I expeted way more from a company like Smashbox. It is watered down and does not do anything, at least for my fair,freckled skin. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cover any better than a BB cream from a drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup guru or anything, but I love this BB cream! It covers everything I need it to cover (I use it with concealer as well though and primer), and it doesn&#x27;t feel like my face is being caked on! I use a primer over my face, then put concealer on my T zone (I hope that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called), then I apply this BB cream using my beauty sponge! Because it&#x27;s not too thick, it doesn&#x27;t exactly give a whole new layer to my skin (you can still kind of see some freckles), but it gives it enough coverage to make my skin look even. :)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and it actually seems to be drying on certain parts of my face because it leaves little flakes.  The coverage is good though and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and I have sensitive skin. It just ends up getting drier as the day goes on. I don&#x27;t plan on ordering this again once it&#x27;s out because it&#x27;s too expensive!</li>
            <li> The sellers were very nice and had good customer service but this products shade of color was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. Hoping this was a one time thing.</li>
            <li> Awesome delivery time, nicely packaged, and great product to use with or without foundation. For work i use this alone but if i&#x27;m going out i use with foundation for extra coverage. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years and i love it now just like the day i bought it!! Fabulous!!!!</li>
            <li> The best BB cream I have ever had. Will always continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for photos, but as a person who suffers from bad acne, this isn&#x27;t for me! I broke out about 2 weeks in and I&#x27;m still having to stay on top of my treatments to recover about 3 weeks later....</li>
            <li> I have flawless skin normally, I&#x27;m Persian and barely ever need to wear makeup. However, this ridiculously expensive product made me break out so bad! To the point where I have never seen my skin like this, it looks terrible! Even the L&#x27;Oreal BB cream is better than this. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before from Sephora.  The color I received is not the same as I&#x27;ve used many times.  The packaging reads the same but the makeup color is way off.</li>
            <li> Initially, I loved this product. I had mild acne and it covered great. It didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin and I loved how I looked in pictures. But my face started to break out. ALOT. I thought maybe it was my moisturizer so I omitted that from my routine but my face got worse. I had gross whiteheads, pimples on the edges of my face, my cheeks exploded. I was left with awful blemishes. I was told by someone at Sephora the spf used in this product blocks and clogs the sh*t out of your pores and isn&#x27;t for everyday use. I got a few facials to take the gunk out of my face, switched to CoverFX, tried new cleansing washes, used a retinol, (I DID EVERYTHING) and thankfully my face is now clearer than ever.</li>
            <li> This product must be a fake or something because when I put it on my face it immediately started to clump up and then just fall right off. Couldn&#x27;t get it to go on evenly. Cannot even wear this at all... complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was much less expensive on Amazon than at Sephora.  I love that it covers but doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup, for a more natural look.  I use with a stipple brush.  As a busy working mom I put this on with some lip gloss and I can leave the house looking fairly decent!</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with a few Smashbox products, and this Camera Ready BB cream is no exception. I was surprised about how very little product can provide this impressive coverage. I usually use it to even out some blotchy Rosacea skin, but it does so much more. I did some research to be sure I&#x27;d buy the correct shade for my complexion. It melts with my skin and makes it look flawless. Sometimes I mix a bit of the photo finish primer with it for an even smoother, less heavy appearance. It&#x27;s PERFECT..!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. Best BB cream I&#x27;ve had so far. My skin is oily and prone to breakouts. This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of Smashbox BB cream.  It goes on easily and smooth, has great coverage and makes your skin look flawless!  I have oily skin so I use a matte clear loose powder on top of it but it really looks great on and in photographs!</li>
            <li> INITIAL IMPRESSIONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample of this product (0.25 oz, so 1/4 size of the regular package) when placing an order on smashbox.com.  Being olive complected, I chose the \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; color (my choices were light or medium for the sample).  For reference, I wear Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation in Tawny and Tarte Tinted Moisturizer in Agent 14 (the Agent 14 is slightly too dark for me, btw).  So I&#x27;m kind of on the lighter side of medium.  As suspected the color was slightly dark (darker than Tarte Agent 14), but may work better in the summer.  When I buy a full sized, I will probably get Light-Medium.  Anyway, a little bit of this product goes a long way. First I used a bit of concealer on hyperpigmented spots.  Then, I put a small bit on my hand and used my foundation brush (EcoTools) to blend it in.  I added bit by bit until my face was covered.  It blended in well.  The color, as I said, was a bit too dark for me.  It basically looked like a tan, so not bad at all (kind of like I had bronzer).  But I tend to prefer a less bronzed look.  The finish is on the dewy side (though not as dewy as my Tarte Smooth Operator tinted moisturizer) and not matte like Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation.  Coverage is pretty good, not as good as Estee Lauder Double wear or Revlon Colorstay, but a bit better than my Tarte Tinted Moisturizer.  I topped it off with powder (Estee Lauder Double Wear powder in Tawny), a bit of Blush (Smashbox Blush Rush in Pose), and Smashbox baked bronzer on top of that. My skin is very oily and acne prone.  It definitely did not aggravate my acne and in fact, my skin looked better after removal.  The color lasted all day.  In terms of oil control, I still would use a primer (Smash Box Light Primer) underneath in summer, but the product didn&#x27;t melt off my face like some other foundations (I&#x27;m looking at you, Bobbi Brown).  I will definitely be buying a tube of this (in the right color)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a coupon for Smashbox.com and I went ahead and ordered the Light Medium.  The Light Medium is a MUCH better match than the Medium.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s 100% perfect in that it looks like I have a touch of bronzer, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about 95% perfect for my skin tone.  If you&#x27;re familiar with Estee Lauder Double Wear in Tawny, Tawny is slightly yellower whereas this BB cream is a bit more orange (I wish it were less orange, but summer is coming...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product almost every day since April.  At first, I found that I still needed a primer, but now, I don&#x27;t bother with primer.  I think my oil production has evened out because of the hydration provided by this product. I do still have to blot a bit, but I&#x27;ve never ever NOT had to blot with any product that I&#x27;ve used, including with primer.  I still have makeup on at the end of the day without primer, so that&#x27;s a win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine is as follows:  Wash my face and use my Neutrogena stress control gel because my skin is acne prone.  Then add Smashbox BB cream.  Top with Smashbox Halo in Light.  Add a touch of Estee Lauder Double Wear powder to the T-zone.  Add blush and eyeshadow.  That&#x27;s it!  I only use concealer under my eyes if I haven&#x27;t slept well.  Otherwise, I don&#x27;t need concealer when using this product.  My skin looks natural and healthy with this routine and photographs beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a 4.5 star product for me.  I&#x27;m knocking off 1/2 a star for price.box.com and I went ahead and ordered the Light Medium.  The Light Medium is a MUCH better match than the Medium.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s 100% perfect in that it looks like I have a touch of bronzer, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about 95% perfect for my skin tone.

            <li> Been using this product on-and-off for 2 years when face modeling. It&#x27;s one of the decent foundations for people with very, very light skin color, as it&#x27;s hard to find a better shade to suit. Unfortunately, it can cause pretty severe breakouts if you don&#x27;t use it often enough for your skin to get used to the make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a more heavy &amp; oily feel on the skin. The cream actually does give relatively good coverage, but dries too quickly to spread well- so make sure to do small amounts at a time otherwise it will be too thick by the time it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said it is one of the best BBcreams on the market for pale people, but it does have it&#x27;s own faults. In fact it doesn&#x27;t do well to cover up genetic eye circles or red spots/acne at all. You will need to also use cover-up and highlighter if you suffer from those issues. If you&#x27;re a professional model you might want to avoid it, as it does come off quite chalky on HD film and photography without a normally unnecessary amount of editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you have problems finding shades light enough for your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this tinted moisturizer! It does everything I need it to when it comes to evening out my skin tone, covering up blemishes, and protecting my skin. I apply it once in the morning using a brush, and it lasts all day! It has more of a powder-like, matte finish and contains little to no oil. I got this to help minimize the oil my face produces throughout the day, and it does just that. By the end of the day, my face still looks close to what it did when I applied the product that morning. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. I have been using it for three weeks and will always make sure I have this on hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this bb cream for almost a year &amp; love it. It has great coverage that lasts all day. Very satisfied with the product &amp; delivery time.</li>
            <li> Best BB Cream on the market.  Once applied, give it about 3 minutes to set before applying foundation. I follow with the Makeup Forever foundation using the Beauty Blender Sponge and get a FLAWLESS finish every time.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and less shine than my other BB cream so I don&#x27;t need powder. I take this traveling with me, it&#x27;s easy to carry, easy to use, and takes the place of multiple products (sunscreen, moisturizer, foundation and powder) in my bag.</li>
            <li> Works great as a foundation as well as a primer, expensive but an awesome product.  Hard to color match online though so go to a store and look first.</li>
            <li> Goes on light and smooth while doing a superb job of coverage. I would highly recommend this brand. Thx for the supply.</li>
            <li> I regularly use the Smashbox lip products and love them so I thought I would try this.  Ick.  Not happy with it at all.  I&#x27;ll stick with using the lip products and go back to my airbrush makeup.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Smashbox primers and so was very excited when they put out a BB product. It is not as good as some of the drug store ones I&#x27;ve tried (Maybelline and L&#x27;Oreal both make one with nicer coverage at 1/3 the price). It is actually a little chalky and doesn&#x27;t blend well. Works fine, but will not buy it again since I can get better results for less.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time in the sun. This is the first product I have found that provides coverage, evens out my skin, and also offers great sun protection.  It doesn&#x27;t melt like regular foundation does and my complexion is better after using Smashbox for just a few weeks.  Well worth the money, and I&#x27;m a cheapskate when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> It is a great high spf product and only needs additional applications to keep the sun blocking in place.  And, since it goes on so lightly that is not a problem.</li>
            <li> Love Smash box and love that I can get for a great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I had been seeing a lot of makeup tutorials all over the web with girls using this be cream. I&#x27;m honestly not the type to spend this much money on 1.4 oz. of be cream but so far from my experience using it, it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny. I got a 0.4 oz. sample from sephora about 2 weeks ago and I just ran out 2 days ago. So it does last! I recommend this product to any makeup lover like myself</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  Excellent for your skin and can be worn as makeup, which I often do.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. One pea sized dot primes, moisturizes, controls oil, has SPF and even skin tone. Skin looks great with zero effort. Great for travel too.</li>
            <li> It leaves a natural, even finish, will keep my oily skin non-shiny all day ,it doesn&#x27;t break me out, it doesn&#x27;t get patchy and does not settle in lines.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change about this product is that by the end of the day, it will sink in my large pores around the nose, (but that happens to me with every type of liquid makeup ) and it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to camouflage that with a mineral veil or powder foundation.</li>
