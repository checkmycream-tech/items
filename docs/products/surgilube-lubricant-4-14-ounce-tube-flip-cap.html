            <li>Depending on your personal tastes, this may or may not be the one that you like best.</li>
            <li>This can lend to a bit more nervousness.</li>
            <li>I love this brand</li>
            <li>good product - dries fast!</li>
            <li>I probably could&#x27;ve doubled that without the lubricant wearing off or becoming too sticky.  </li>
            <li>They work great, not much more you can say about a tube of steri-lube, flip cap is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stain, doesn&#x27;t sting, no offensive odor, washes up easily.</li>
            <li>No stains, no fuss, easy flip-cap dispensing.</li>
            <li>It makes insurtion easy on the clients.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that there&#x27;s enough lubricant in this tube to keep Florida State University happy for a month.</li>
            <li>Saw it originally in doctor&#x27;s examinations and figured  </li>
            <li>Works great in conjunction with other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Works as good as expected.</li>
            <li>Use it for insertion of new jewelry in my piercings or for any sound play.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>Great lube for urethra sounding/stretching or any other adult toy insertion.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s quite as effective as any other brand.</li>
            <li>This tube is LARGE.</li>
            <li>After all, it&#x27;s just a very high end petroleum jelly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please, if you are using this product to perform a procedure in which sterility is is a must, ALWAYS BUT ALWAYS prepare the area where the procedure will be performed first, ensuring adequate lighting, that the area where instruments or materials that must be kept sterile is large enough or over-sized, free from any clutter, easily accessible while performing the procedure start to finish, and that the instruments and/or other materials needed are laid out in a well organized fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since it was never designed for prolonged friction protection but for brief probing, I guess that&#x27;s why sex lubes where so thoughtfully invented.</li>
            <li>When used on a sound that is left inserted for a while it seems to get sticky making withdrawal somewhat</li>
            <li>If you DO need a sterile lubricant, this one works very very well, at least in my own experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So taking the time to run through things in our minds, SLOWLY, and ahead of time can and will allow us to have a good deal more confidence, and make us a LOT less prone to rookie mistakes too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see ever running out of the quantity you get here in normal household use</li>
            <li>those of us who are not medical professionals find ourselves needing to practice such procedures, whether by necessity or by choice, we generally are performing them either on ourselves, or someone else whom we love.</li>
            <li>It seems to dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>No problems so far - normal size.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t too messy &amp; easy to cleanup.</li>
            <li>but in hindsight the packets are a cleaner way to go as far as preserving the sterile integrity of the product.  </li>
            <li>I use this to help insert my piercings when I change my jewelry as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>you are new to performing this type of procedure/providing this type of care, I suggest preparing the area in a &amp;#34;trial run&amp;#34; fashion, a few times, laying everything out, whether the actual supplies or just a reasonable facsimile that is about the same size and shape.</li>
            <li>Look for snags in your system this way rather than finding them when you&#x27;re in the middle of the real procedure and discover you&#x27;ve placed something somewhere where it compromises the sterility of other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This tube is LARGE. I was expecting the normal little fit-in-your-hand tube. I guess I wasn&#x27;t paying attention. This tube is as long as my forearm. Nice!</li>
            <li> Okay and nice size tube</li>
            <li> I feel safe using this for sounding and it came on time and was what was promised.</li>
            <li> Product works great for our needs.  But we ordered and paid for a box of 4 tubes and only received one tube.  No explanation why ordered wasn&#x27;t completed, no refund for the tubes not received.</li>
            <li> Reliable for safer urethral sounding but it dries out after a while.  Consider keeping a mister/spray bottle of distilled water to wet it when it starts to get sticky.  I bought the tube but in hindsight the packets are a cleaner way to go as far as preserving the sterile integrity of the product.  Doesn&#x27;t stain, doesn&#x27;t sting, no offensive odor, washes up easily.</li>
            <li> good product - dries fast! If you need a longer lasting slippery surface, you might prefer another brand. This one works for me. Performs as described, and speedy service from the seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make giant bubbles with.  It seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Suits purpose &amp; no complaints.  Definitely thicker than other personal lubricants, but that&#x27;s what I expected &amp; was looking for.  Not sure how long people expect a water based lubricant to last, but I used a single application for at least a half hour &amp; felt I probably could&#x27;ve doubled that without the lubricant wearing off or becoming too sticky.  Wasn&#x27;t too messy &amp; easy to cleanup.</li>
            <li> Great stuff here!  Use it for insertion of new jewelry in my piercings or for any sound play.  Very Happy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to re-up my trauma kit. I didn&#x27;t realize that there&#x27;s enough lubricant in this tube to keep Florida State University happy for a month. Wow, my reviews are getting weird. Anyway, I&#x27;ve used this brand before and it&#x27;s quite as effective as any other brand. I use it for various catheters, nasal devices and door knobs.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a must for keeping my kitchen slicer properly lubricated.  The bonus is that it also works as a fantastic fire starter for backpacking!  Not only do I grease the slicer but I also apply some of this to cotton balls and dryer lint for use as one-strike fire starters in the back country.  After all, it&#x27;s just a very high end petroleum jelly that&#x27;s FDA approved for foodservice use.  I can&#x27;t see ever running out of the quantity you get here in normal household use so why not use it for everything else you&#x27;d use petroleum jelly for?</li>
            <li> A great and affordable water based lube, cleans up well. Saw it originally in doctor&#x27;s examinations and figured  it was worth a try and wasn&#x27;t wrong</li>
            <li> Works as good as expected. No problems so far - normal size. The flip cap is not as durable as it could be, but seriously if that&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; with it..</li>
            <li> Always a trusty brand of sterile lube for my sounding purposes.</li>
            <li> Compare this product to KY jelly at about half the price. My doctor recommends this stuff. No stains, no fuss, easy flip-cap dispensing.</li>
            <li> I use it for making giant bubbles. Works great in conjunction with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have and do use better products. It seems to dry out quickly. It has become my back up. Since placing this review I&#x27;ve had occasion to use this lube again. And never will again. I threw it away. It dries out way too fast and is too thick for my liking. Since it was never designed for prolonged friction protection but for brief probing, I guess that&#x27;s why sex lubes where so thoughtfully invented. Just saying.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Although it does dry out after a while. When used on a sound that is left inserted for a while it seems to get sticky making withdrawal somewhat problematic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue use it however.</li>
            <li> i had a temporary problem with a urinary infection and this product was great for what i needed at the time.</li>
            <li> Great lube for urethra sounding/stretching or any other adult toy insertion.</li>
            <li> I would prefer something a bit more slippery but safe is better. Works just great for avoiding an undesirable infection.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product that I use with my client for a bowel care program. It has a very good consistency and I do not worry about my client having a bad reaction with continued use.</li>
            <li> Good product worth the cost and wait. Was delivered  on time.</li>
            <li> this added to your bubble mix will create bubbles so big. Every one will be amazed so make sure you stock up</li>
            <li> Good Product. does what it says. easy to use flip cap is very nice. i would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use with my catheters. They work great, not much more you can say about a tube of steri-lube, flip cap is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li> I use this to help insert my piercings when I change my jewelry as I have sensitive skin. Love it</li>
            <li> I am fastidious and am more than pleased with this, it is by far the best I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Awesome. Very gentle. Great for people with skin allergy problems.</li>
            <li> This is some good lube, I use it with almost every sexual toys H have. Works well in all situations and I have found that I don&#x27;t need a lot to be effective</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need a sterile lubricant, I think there are tons of other options, all with different properties. Depending on your personal tastes, this may or may not be the one that you like best.

Then imagine yourself performing the procedure step by step, including where to place each item used when you are done with it, either by disposing of it or placing it in an area specifically designated for items that are now NOT sterile. Look for snags in your system this way rather than finding them when you&#x27;re in the middle of the real procedure and discover you&#x27;ve placed something somewhere where it compromises the sterility of other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When those of us who are not medical professionals find ourselves needing to practice such procedures, whether by necessity or by choice, we generally are performing them either on ourselves, or someone else whom we love. This can lend to a bit more nervousness. So taking the time to run through things in our minds, SLOWLY, and ahead of time can and will allow us to have a good deal more confidence, and make us a LOT less prone to rookie mistakes too.Absolutely a very worthwhile investment!</li>
            <li> I love this brand I use it on clients for lubrication when they are getting Colon Hydrotherapy.  It makes insurtion easy on the clients. I appreciate the price also it is more expensive at the surgical stores.</li>
