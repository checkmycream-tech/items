            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>I received them right away and was very pleased on how fast the seller shipped out my items</li>
            <li>SATISFIED CUSTOMER -- PRODUCT EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Price is great by comparison to a lot of other vendors.</li>
            <li>worth the money</li>
            <li>They are soft and perfect for cleaning delicate areas and applying product to the face.</li>

            <li> Love these for my clients. Since I don&#x27;t like applying the actual lip stick to them for cleanliness reasons. I rub the applicator to the lip stick and apply, then throw away it looks good.</li>

I finally found them! These are perfect they came in today! Now my clients don&#x27;t have to smear their fingers to sample our colors.&lt;br /&gt;I just saw that there are only a few left in stock! I hope they reStock because I&#x27;m sure to be a regular customer! They came in 2 seprate zip baggies which is very convenient for me to store in. I will definitely recommend to my unit&#x27;s beauty consultants.</li>

            <li> I guess I&#x27;m the only one who received a bunch of wands with yellowy glue stains all over the tips.  A couple wands were missing their tips.  What really grossed me out was that the little bag they came in was beat up and the bar code sticker was peeling and a bit dirty.  I would be afraid to use these on myself or anyone else.  I&#x27;m upset because I was so excited to use these :(</li>
