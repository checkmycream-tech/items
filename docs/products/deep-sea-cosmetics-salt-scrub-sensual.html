            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have a nice glow to their skin and doesn&#x27;t mind the geranium scent.</li>
            <li>Then I also get free gift&#x60;s.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>They made my skin extremely smooth and made bath</li>
            <li>on your whole body it does what it says and the feeling of my skin is amazing</li>
            <li>The salt scrubs the dead skin off wonderfully when used on a washcloth, and the oil stays on your skin and penetrates it under the hot water of the shower.  </li>
            <li>dollars!I have only good</li>
            <li>Of course I get lucky because they like me</li>
            <li>The next person to get in might slip so be sure to rinse well and make sure the oil is on your skin not the shower floor.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this Deep Sea Body Salt Scrub at a kiosk in a mall and was so delighted to find it on-line.  </li>
            <li>The salt scrub has very fine particles and rinse off cleanly, so you don&#x27;t feel any particles later that day.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>This scrub is very much worth the price.  </li>
            <li>think this product is well worth its cost.</li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft and smooth after words!</li>
            <li>It works wonders and you smell good too.......be careful after you are finished,</li>
            <li>I have many products in my home that have the honey and milk scent; the scent of this product is definitely NOT honey and milk.  </li>
            <li>I love my Deep Sea Scrub  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and smooth that I don&#x27;t even need lotion after my shower.</li>
            <li>When I first found this product in a mall</li>
            <li>I love the product, but the the jar shown and the one I bought before are different and misleading.</li>
            <li>I received the first of these as a holiday gift.  </li>
            <li>This product cost about $69.00 ,This is the first asking price.</li>
            <li>will buy again, first purchased inside shopping mall.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, the product does moisturize the skin nicely but be careful - when rinsing, the oil coats the bottom of the bathtub and makes it slippery.    </li>
            <li>Its great at smoothing out all the small bumps and leaves your skin feeling feeling very soft afterwords</li>
            <li>The aroma is very soothing and leaves skins feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It even burns ever so slightly which is sort of nice; lets you know something is happening.</li>
            <li>I started using this sea salt about 3 months ago and now can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li>As much as I have loved this in the past, it is just way too much work now.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to cleanse your skin of all those dead cells as the salt is abrasive enough to do that and the oil in the product provides emollient to the skin.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower 2x a week for my psoriasis, and it is really working well.  </li>
            <li>Too much water these days.</li>
            <li>my skin is much softer and softer</li>
            <li>Instead the salt scrub has a masculine scent of sandlewood and/or cedar which is strong, overpowering and stays on the skin for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>BEFORE YOU ORDER PLEASE NOTE&amp;#62; The add clearly states (copied and pasted from the add)&amp;#34;The results are visible after first treatment.</li>
            <li>have bought numerous jars at different aromas but must say recent purchases are not as good as it used to be.</li>
            <li>The older packaging is 15.8 oz.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times in the past and it did not smell like the product that I received.</li>
            <li>If you are wondering the same the same, it&#x27;s the same and at a much better price.</li>
            <li>It helps heal my skin while keeping it clear, soft.</li>
            <li>indescribable!&lt;br /&gt;I am a frequent buyer of this product and would recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li>I am completely committed to these products.</li>
            <li>You open the jar, stir it really well with your fingers to get the oil and salt mixed, then you can use it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently received this item.  I agree with the other reviews in that it is annoying that the salt and oil separate.  This creates a messy product with the oil seeping out of and down the jar.  Putting the cap back on the jar also causes the excess oil to drip down the sides of the jar and I end up with a jar sitting on the countertop in a circle of oil.    The claim that this is a \\&quot;honey and milk\\&quot; scent is highly questionable and I dispute it.  I have many products in my home that have the honey and milk scent; the scent of this product is definitely NOT honey and milk.  Instead the salt scrub has a masculine scent of sandlewood and/or cedar which is strong, overpowering and stays on the skin for the entire day.  The fragrance is similar to men&#x27;s deodorant.  I am not fond of the woodsy scents and found the odor nauseating.    On the positive side, the product does moisturize the skin nicely but be careful - when rinsing, the oil coats the bottom of the bathtub and makes it slippery.    I would return the item for a refund since the smell of it sickens me, but it would cost me more for return shipping than the item is worth.  I do not recommend this product unless it is for a man.</li>
            <li> I had this product in another flavor in the past. I cannot remember what it was but I do know that I liked it better than this scent. This is a great way to cleanse your skin of all those dead cells as the salt is abrasive enough to do that and the oil in the product provides emollient to the skin. It even burns ever so slightly which is sort of nice; lets you know something is happening. The oil and the salt are annoyingly separate in the jar so need scooped up and mixed in your hand. As much as I have loved this in the past, it is just way too much work now.</li>
            <li> Well a French garden?  It now has Geranium oil in it, and a lot of it.  So its perfumey and you have to get used to that.    For those of you who have never used it before:  This Salt scrub is fantastic.  You open the jar, stir it really well with your fingers to get the oil and salt mixed, then you can use it.  The oil rises to the top while its stored on the shelf.  I use it in the shower 2x a week for my psoriasis, and it is really working well.  The salt scrubs the dead skin off wonderfully when used on a washcloth, and the oil stays on your skin and penetrates it under the hot water of the shower.  I can already see the difference in 3-4 uses.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have a nice glow to their skin and doesn&#x27;t mind the geranium scent.</li>
            <li> I love my Deep Sea Scrub  I have diabetes and my skin was awful , awful with dry skin big time.  Now I use the scrub 3 times a week and it works great .</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it was received promptly. However, this jar of product has a different scent than the jars of the same product in the past. On the advertisement it states milk and honey scent, but this product has a sandalwood scent instead.  When I wrote to the seller, they insist that I received the correct product and requested that retract my negative review. I have used this product many times in the past and it did not smell like the product that I received. Having said that , the sandalwood scent is not offensive, but it is not the milk and honey scent that I expected. Also, the seller did get in contact with me after I wrote the negative review. I am sure that I did not navigate the contact seller site effectively, which is my fault.</li>
            <li> I have been using this produce for over a year now and it does what it says.  [[ASIN:B000X81832 Deep Sea Cosmetics Sensual Dead Sea Body Salt Scrub milk and honey scent]]</li>
            <li> I am a psoriasis sufferer always looking for additional products to help treat my skin in addition to my doctors prescriptions. This product is awesome. I can&#x27;t live without it. I&#x27;m hooked for life. It helps heal my skin while keeping it clear, soft. Plus it  smells wonderful. Excellent!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  The salt scrub has very fine particles and rinse off cleanly, so you don&#x27;t feel any particles later that day.  It leaves my skin so soft and smooth that I don&#x27;t even need lotion after my shower.</li>
            <li> Great product, nice texture and scent.  Originally bought at kiosk in mall for greater cost.  Glad I found this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife has bad eczema and this definitely helps cure it with the cream supplied by the same company. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Deep Sea Cosmetic brand comes through again versus other brands we have tried. I could be mistaken but product just feels better than others I have tried, plus scented to my liking.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is delightful, and the way my skin feels afterwards is indescribable!&lt;br /&gt;I am a frequent buyer of this product and would recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> When I first found this product in a mall I was impressed. But then again the attractive saleslady was very good at her presentation.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought numerous jars at different aromas but must say recent purchases are not as good as it used to be. Too much water these days. I guess they are saving costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the aromas and will continue to buy it. I just need to squeeze out the extra water. Not very greasy.</li>
            <li> I tried this in the mall. Loved it but not the price. I wondered if this would be the same stuff. If you are wondering the same the same, it&#x27;s the same and at a much better price.</li>
            <li> This scrub is very much worth the price.  The aroma is very soothing and leaves skins feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but the the jar shown and the one I bought before are different and misleading. The older packaging is 15.8 oz., the one I received is 12.3 oz. at the same price. What&#x27;s up? Bait and switch? Disappointing......</li>
            <li> this little jar goes further than you think it would. I get silky, smooth skin every time I use it, I also get compliments!</li>
            <li> Same as other  wife loves this stuff !!</li>
            <li> love love love this product</li>
            <li> I received the first of these as a holiday gift.  Now I am hooked! This is a very good product.  My skin felt amazing after the first use.</li>
            <li> I was in the mall this product is very good! This product cost about $69.00 ,This is the first asking price.Of course I get lucky because they like me so they drop the price to $49.00 dollars !Then I also get free gift&#x60;s.Well the lowest cost of this item was dropped for me because I am just so liked was $25.00  dollars!I have only good thing&#x60;s to say about this product it is one of my favorite&#x60;s!I think this product is well worth its cost.I don&#x60;t know why amazon sell&#x60;s it so cheep, but I used it NO FEAR it was the best!</li>
            <li> This is the best sea salt scrub I have purchased. I loved the exfoliation I receive from this scrub. My skin is so smooth after using it. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> will buy again, first purchased inside shopping mall. Much better price at amazon. It works just as described great body scrub</li>
            <li> I Love this product it does just as it advertises! my skin feels so soft and smooth after words! and smells really good too!</li>
            <li> Was introduced to this having received it for a gift and now purchase my own supply- lovely scent and leaves skin feeling like silk!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin on their arms or legs. Its great at smoothing out all the small bumps and leaves your skin feeling feeling very soft afterwords</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the salt crystals are wonderful.  It works wonders and you smell good too.......be careful after you are finished, sometimes the residue from the oil in with the crystals can remain behind in the bottom of the tub.  The next person to get in might slip so be sure to rinse well and make sure the oil is on your skin not the shower floor.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my Dad, who has an undiagnosable skin condition on his hands and feet.  As long as he uses this product the skin condition remains in remission.</li>
            <li> I discovered this body scrub in my mall and have been in love since. Works like a dream and smells amazing. Shipper was prompt.</li>
            <li> Love the oil and salt! They made my skin extremely smooth and made bath enjoyable!!Very pleased and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this Deep Sea Body Salt Scrub at a kiosk in a mall and was so delighted to find it on-line.  It is wonderful for the \\&quot;barnicles\\&quot; that come with old age.  I makes you feel pampered and still does the job of cleaning up ones skin.</li>
            <li> I so love this product I first got it in the mall and loved it had to have more but did not want to spend that amount on it so I found it here and I will keep getting it here as for the product my skin is much softer and softer it is amazing to use just on your hands or on your whole body it does what it says and the feeling of my skin is amazing</li>
            <li> I started using this sea salt about 3 months ago and now can&#x27;t live without it!! My skin is softer than it has been since I was a teenager!</li>
            <li> I am completely committed to these products. They are excellent. It&#x27;s just what I wanted. I love the scents and the results of them.</li>
            <li> BEFORE YOU ORDER PLEASE NOTE&amp;#62; The add clearly states (copied and pasted from the add)&amp;#34;The results are visible after first treatment. Size - 15.8 Oz&amp;#34;  I received the 12.8 oz size in the picture.  I gambled that the add was correct and the picture was not.....I lost.  Great product just wanted to point out that what you read is not what you receive.</li>
