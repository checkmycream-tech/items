            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Avon or Almay, honest companies that don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li>great, I&#x27;ve used it for years with good results</li>
            <li>, you would see that she has really nice skin!</li>

            <li>This cream is really nice!  </li>
            <li>imagine what it can do for someone with nice skin!</li>
            <li>Great for fading forehead lines, and good for firming the jawline too.</li>
            <li>Anyone who uses Olay products knows this is one of the best:)</li>
            <li>Without a doubt, the BEST, most affordable moisturizer on the planet.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and I am happy to be able to continue using it!</li>
            <li>Good to use, and the customer services is also very kind</li>
            <li>Nice to get at a good cost.....always a very good thing.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant sent.</li>
            <li>I agreed, but I find it thicker and not as pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>this cream is especially good on my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area, but a great night cream, full face as well.</li>
            <li>WHAT A GREAT PRICE FOR A CREAM THAT I LOVE!  </li>
            <li>That being said, Oil of Olay smells just fine and works great!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any results with reducing fine lines yet, but I&#x27;m hoping for the best.  </li>
            <li>that was a great buy,and the  cream was great love it.</li>
            <li>The product feels good on my skin, altho</li>
            <li>Price and delivery were too good.</li>
            <li>It has kept my aging skin fairly wrinkle-free.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT..BE NICE IF THEY COULD UNISEX-UP THE SCENT</li>
            <li>I preface this review by saying that I&#x27;ve been using night cream for years and have fairly good skin (except for the areas around my eyes).  </li>
            <li>I am told by people that \\&quot;I look good for my age\\&quot; (30&#x27;s rather than 40&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>I paired this with the regenerist cleanser and get superior results.</li>
            <li>Another tip with using this product: try using this cream on your feet after a pedicure - it will make your feet look and feel SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>Is it as good as a $150 face cream?  </li>
            <li>It feels good going on.  </li>
            <li>Good price for this product.  </li>
            <li>Imagine how delighted I was when I discovered the subscription price on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>This is a good cream, it does work, but I perfer my Pro-X.  </li>
            <li>But if there&#x27;s a day I don&#x27;t want to wear foundation, or I&#x27;m having a particularly good \\&quot;skin</li>
            <li>I had used that for years, then this summer saw an article in Vanity Fair magazine about this product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use soap on my face because it dries my fair skin out.</li>
            <li>I have never found something like this that felt so good on my face.</li>
            <li>My husband always tells me I smell good after I put it on.</li>
            <li>but this cream gives good moisture to the skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have problem skin, and I&#x27;ve always taken good care of it.</li>
            <li>Good job Olay and Thank you.</li>
            <li>During that flight I washed my face with just water then put on a good amount of this cream and repeated for another time.</li>
            <li>all that said, I recommend a good quality face cream, before bed and upon waking.  </li>
            <li>With all that said, I recommend a good quality face cream, before bed and upon waking.  </li>
            <li>It mosturizes well and makes your skin feel so good.</li>
            <li>Good Luck.</li>
            <li>Feels good and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I started looking for a good anti-aging cream as a preemptive measure against wrinkles before it&#x27;s too</li>
            <li>Always a good product.</li>
            <li>The Olay Regenerist cream is a wonderful, light feeling moisturizer that I use both day and night.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I use when I run out of my good stuff.</li>
            <li>so that was good.</li>
            <li>This product is good, subscribe and save is good,</li>
            <li>This is as the reviews suggest a really good cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the neck, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If so, good for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite that good</li>
            <li>and it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>once a week for optimum results.  </li>
            <li>This skin care cream is good to apply to your skin while you sleep</li>
            <li>But this one is good for its price point.</li>
            <li>I have had lots of comments on how good my skin looks</li>
            <li>feels good will buy again</li>
            <li>It feels good under my makeup mornings and nights.  </li>
            <li>Does not seem to be a good product...same ole stuff.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I did not find anything in the drugstore</li>
            <li>And I am always being asked what I do to have my skin look this good.  </li>
            <li>in all, it is good.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE A GOOD VALUE AND WORK</li>
            <li>Got this when it was a good price.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer, but did not work well for night cream.  </li>
            <li>this cream is really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But just to be fair, I don’t like the smell, but I would give it a 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this cream and needed a night creme.</li>
            <li>The Regenerist Micro-Scullpting Cream is a really good bargain.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably just as good as the department store creams.</li>
            <li>but we guess this product is good to prevent.</li>
            <li>It feels so good going on</li>
            <li>I saw the ad from Olay claiming that this cream was as good as $500 creams, so I went and purchased one.</li>
            <li>The one made in the USA is good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this is getting good reviews.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>It works just as good as the CHR which cost almost 2x the price of this one.</li>
            <li>Deff a good product.</li>
            <li>This is a good wrinkle cream.  </li>
            <li>My  wife turned me on to this product when I kept wondering how she looked so good .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and it as good as anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I have to be fair, might be made for women&#x27;s skin and works for them.</li>
            <li>not conceited; I inherited my good skin from my mother.  </li>
            <li>so it has a fair chance.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years, and it is a good, all purpose moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good stuff at a good price</li>
            <li>Really good night cream.</li>
            <li>Good coalition and price</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>and I thought the cream was going be good for my face</li>
            <li>My girlfriend says it is good stuff.</li>
            <li>It also has a very pleasant smell that is not too strong.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>The cream feels pleasant as you put on, and the skin feels nice after the cream is on.</li>
            <li>So when I purchased this I decided to get both this and the fragrance free version to see which one I liked best.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, it has a wonderfully creamy smooth feel and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I love love love the way this makes my skin feel!!!</li>
            <li>price relatively cheap , but quality is very good.</li>
            <li>very good product True to color and a very interesting good product within week</li>
            <li>Got it for a great price here, better than at Costco.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I use the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush at night, followed by this cream and my skin looks great, I don&#x27;t know of anything better than this cream</li>
            <li>Very pleased.  </li>
            <li>The advertising is very appealing</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of the cream and was great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go ahead and give this 3 stars because most qualities in this product stand out and are really great..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d raise my eye brows, lower them, and smile because even after lowering my eye brows, there were no visible wrinkles and that made me very happy.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO BE OKAY, BUT I DO NOT SEE ANY GREAT IMPROVEMENT WITH MY SKIN YET.</li>
            <li>Very pleased</li>
            <li>Great product, face always look refreshing.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and my face feels good.</li>
            <li>Nice to get this without having to deal with the lines at Costco for a good value.  </li>
            <li>Great formula with a pleasant scent, moisturizes well and leaves your skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>The Best 100% Pure Skin Restoring Anti-Aging Phytoceramides!]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly confident that my face is smoother and softer now than it was when I was a baby!  </li>

            <li>and I love it!  </li>

            <li>And a lot of people complain about the scent, but I think the scent is very refreshing and kind of cucumbery.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many!  </li>
            <li>- I love it too!  </li>
            <li>I like how you can use this morning and night (but in the morning - I will always top it with a sunscreen!)</li>

            <li>Love this product and all olay products!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m 38 by the way so great skin is does not come easy at this stage.</li>
            <li>The first two days were wonderful and it made my skin look nice...</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Works to help keep good skin and very comfortable to wear.</li>

            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>The Micro-Sculpting cream soaks in perfect and has a nice fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>

            <li>Please take this into consideration when you decide what product to buy and what kind of company you want to support.</li>
            <li>She loved the perfume smell. :)</li>
            <li>but I thought it was nice.</li>
            <li>Absorbs in nicely.  </li>
            <li>Amazon you are the best it is amazing that you have everything a consumer needs for their shopping from the comfort of their homes and receiving your products is fast.  </li>
            <li>A refund would be nice.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cream.  </li>
            <li>(Absolute is the best in that line), Chanel, Pevonia( for sensetive skin)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it one start for smelling nice and one star for not giving me pimples.  </li>
            <li>Nice bonus.</li>
            <li>The texture is nice and it does help moisturize and doesn&#x27;t seem to break me out.</li>
            <li>This has been a nice substitution.</li>
            <li>) I was using regenerist night firming cream before and loved it, but wanted something with a bit more oomph?</li>
            <li>I will never buy any product of any kind that contains an animal product or that has been tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Helps reduce the puffiness under my eyes and smells nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>The cream soaks in really nice too.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling nice.</li>
            <li>On the good note, I love to use it on my neck.</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>It give the skin a nice feeling not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>The package arrived on time and nicely wrapped up so a trustworthy seller.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this product because the reviews were awesome.  </li>
            <li>But, it leaves a nice feeling on the skin after application.</li>
            <li>After almost three weeks of use, I find nice improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I know it helps when I get those nice compliments from friends.</li>
            <li>There is mica in this moisturizer (which creates a shimmering effect) and that has given my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li>AND it does make it feel nice as does their &amp;#34;&amp;#34;Total effects</li>
            <li>B001THPA1C Good Housekeeping (1-year auto-renewal)]] tested it, and said it was better than a $500 cream they also tested.  </li>
            <li>I think my skin looks as good as or maybe even better than when I moved here 2 1/2 years ago.  </li>
            <li>My mom is kind of old-school.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go into all of my trials and errors, here are some of the things I found effective so you can avoid my guinea pig routine.  </li>
            <li>A nice moisturizer</li>
            <li>I found it to be just another nice moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes just as effectively as cheaper options.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizer  </li>
            <li>It has a nice feel to it when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in wrinkles, but I don&#x27;t worry about that kind of thing.</li>
            <li>and it was a nice surprise to find</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I do not know, smells nicely.</li>
            <li>I am 60, and my skin still looks nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having no sensitivity reaction, the cream goes on nicely without a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I love the Microgenerist), Olay sometimes has a rebate (a good one) for spending $50 on their products.  </li>
            <li>Nice, premium packaging.</li>
            <li>Switched from aveeno to this bc of the good reviews and boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>Nice feel, not greasy.</li>
            <li>well, kind of.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest...</li>

            <li>The scent is very strong, so if you cannot handle scented lotion, do not purchase this.</li>
            <li>It goes on very easily and has no fragrance.  </li>

            <li>and most importantly it&#x27;s WORKING!!</li>
            <li>Better than most department store creams!  </li>
            <li>Amazons great delivery services and returning policies easy to find and easy to use</li>
            <li>This one has a pleasant scent that&#x27;s not too strong and doesn&#x27;t linger, much better than the elmers glue or plastic like smell of unscented lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also impressed that, while this Micro-Sculpting Cream keeps my skin soft and supple, it never leaves a greasy or oily feeling.</li>

            <li>It has the most amazing silky texture, too.</li>

            <li>This is by far the best over the counter cream I&#x27;ve found on the market.</li>
            <li>Having suffered sun damage over the years I am pleased with how nice my skin  looks.</li>
            <li>But as far as stating that I was completely impressed, I was not..</li>
            <li>The cream just feels really good going on your face, kind of like putting your face on a cool satin pillow.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and great price and product :)</li>
            <li>Great compliment to Olay Regenerist Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Soaks right in...not</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love Olay Regenerist!  </li>
            <li>I was delighted with the results, I definitely had fewer lines and purchased it at the warehouse club where it was a very good price.</li>
            <li>Such a great product for a great price.  </li>
            <li>The Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is a great face cream that is wonderful for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>Pretty cool, I am impressed</li>
            <li>Most of the people who compliment me are yound women in their early 20&#x27;s who are very beautiful.</li>
            <li>I was able to sensitize my own skin, but you may not be able to.  </li>
            <li>Incredible product, good price, same at Walmart, but here you can use Amazon credit!!!!!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product as it has a lot of good reviews and seems well loved.</li>
            <li>So this cream meets my criteria for a good face cream and the price is right!  </li>
            <li>But then, this is my first time using the Olay brand, so who knows, maybe there is a great moisturizer in this line that has SPF.     </li>
            <li>If I could give it 3 1/2 that might be more suitable.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great, and you don&#x27;t need to apply much!</li>
            <li>This is a great cream to use。The price is not expensive also, used in the face is not greasy, very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Very light, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t oily either and feels very light weight.</li>
            <li>Also, it makes my face feel very smooth and not oily.  </li>
            <li>It makes the cream feel very cheap and substandard.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>and my skin is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am lucky that I have always had good skin, but now I do not.</li>
            <li>It has kept my skin from getting more wrinkles (As I am rather senior) and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product is very good on your face, feels nice and refreshing, I use it twice a day, morning and night, I totally recommend this item to everybody.</li>
            <li>Very nice product; keeps my skin nice and soft!</li>
            <li>so make sure you look under the price, it will say clip coupon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream for years, love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>I love this product I would give more stars if there were more.</li>
            <li>the price is excellent will definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li>Love all things &#x27;Olay&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>PETA has a list online of all the companies that test and do not test on animals and there are so many wonderful,natural products out there to choose from that don&#x27;t come to us at another creature&#x27;s expense.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels, how it smells, and the difference it&#x27;s made in my skin.  </li>
            <li>As I continue to apply twice a day, I expect the wrinkles will soften even more.</li>
            <li>I am sure that those that aren&#x27;t may benefit.  </li>
            <li>Nice light scent.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fully absorb into your skin, just sits on top so when it dries, you can rub it off into rubbery flakes.</li>
            <li>CREATED TOO MANY BREAKOUTS IN MY FACE AFTER 3 DAYS OF USE.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the best facial cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have gotten more compliments on my skin since using this Olay cream than I ever did before.</li>
            <li>It also has a mild pleasant smell, not to strong at all.</li>
            <li>any more breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise skin looks so much better sijnce I started using.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are products that do an even better job</li>
            <li>I love this Cream just give it a shot, and you will love it too</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels and look.  </li>
            <li>I hope I have better luck.  </li>
            <li>BUT ITS OK..</li>
            <li>STILL AWESOME FOR A VALUE TERRIFIC PRODUCT LINE.</li>
            <li>and after three the change was striking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Olay Regenerist Microsculpting cream gave me the allergic reaction even tho it does not have fragrance listed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have combo/acne-prone skin, and have tried many moisturizers over the years.  </li>
            <li>NONE have been able to both keep my skin well hydrated and not cause more breakouts, until I found this gem.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m know that there are a lot of products that do a better job and have better ingredients but they will be triple the price.</li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin is a bit raw/sensitive feeling (I notice it mostly during exercising/sweating) or if I use a wash cloth across my face in the morning, but I hope this will cease with continued use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure as of yet</li>
            <li>It does moisturize well...and the areas look better with use, but</li>
            <li>I love Olay products and when I viewed the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream, I saw where I could have discounts.  </li>
            <li>Am glad I signed up for Amazon&#x27;s standing order program.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, it works for me.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter, more moisturized and smoother.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I just love shopping with you.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>At 62, I swear I have tried everything in the department stores, including Creme de la Mer, and most of what is in the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with it, and will buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought Lancome, Lauder, Chanel, Clinique, many others, and with many I had skin irritations, couldn&#x27;t use them and returned them.      </li>
            <li>My skin is ok with most of the face cream.</li>
            <li>I use it as night moisturizer, I love it   </li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer and wrinkle delayer.</li>
            <li>Just love this Olay moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>photos, but, whether I do or don&#x27;t look better</li>
            <li>-- I FEEL better.  </li>

            <li>I love all the products except the regenerating cream.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I tried a jar and love it.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been quite a week yet since using both products, but to me my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>If not, I still love Olay products anyway and will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li>I have read many recommending reviews about the cream</li>
            <li>I have been using LaMer (my favorite), Arden, Lancome</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>So I thought, after I stopped, I could tell that it WAS giving me more of a youthful feel and look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in search for something better....</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>it!I am looking forward to purchaseing more</li>
            <li>This stuff is okay.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>love the cream, lasts forever</li>
            <li>It helps my skin look moist and my makeup to go on better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a firmer, more \\&quot;sculpted\\&quot; appearance to my face having used this product for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for over a year and love the way it feels on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63; most people think I&#x27;m 45.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure as I advance in years</li>
            <li>I use it every morning and most nights.  </li>
            <li>No doubt this is my best facial product,  l have used it for years and will still keep using it...</li>
            <li>and i did notice that my skin feels better in the morning.  </li>
            <li>The lines appear to be minimized and the color appears to be much more healthy and glowing.  </li>
            <li>My skin is usually healthy.</li>
            <li>And, with my skin looking refreshed and dewy, I can go without foundation more often.</li>
            <li>and they love this product as well.</li>
            <li>and I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I recently saw a dermatologist who told me that this is the best product out there.....</li>
            <li>I love the texture, smell and the way it works.  </li>
            <li>Well okay, for firming, this is not it.</li>
            <li>its making wrinkles disappear there too :)</li>
            <li>always use this  love it</li>
            <li>I also wanted to start using something more anti-aging since I just turned 40.</li>
            <li>My face is more hydrated, more toned, it&#x27;s tightened yet more hydrated than its been in ages.</li>
            <li>My redness and scars are evened out more already in just one week.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer, it hydrates well</li>
            <li>I love the results.</li>
            <li>Eventually, I started mixing it with my daily moisturizer in order to get the best of both worlds (SPF 30 and moisture) during the winter months.</li>
            <li>This is now the only way I use moisturizer (the micro-sculpting cream paired with the SPF 30/tint oil-free one) and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I use more at night.</li>
            <li>I  love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love Olay products.</li>

            <li>Thank you so much for a great product.</li>
            <li>I just love the way this makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a better anti-aging cream than others, but keeping your skin moisturized is the easiest defense against aging.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would have been better than what it was.</li>
            <li>Used for many years.</li>
            <li>and my skin is well moisturized and even more as  </li>
            <li>Regenerist is an OK choice for an inexpensive cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read that this works better than $150.00 creams</li>
            <li>With this, skin showed almost immediate improvement - even more with time.  </li>
            <li>After using it now for 4 years, I really believe through Amazon&#x27;s pricing, this is one of the best values on a great product, especially factoring in time saved using their Subscribe &amp; Save plan.</li>
            <li>They just love the texture and fell and</li>
            <li>Works better than more expemnsive ones.</li>
            <li>This cream smells nice and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It has really lessened the crows feet around the eyes and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>give it a try what have u got to lose :)</li>
            <li>Just love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard of much better results going this route than to keep using these supposed miracle creams.</li>
            <li>I like the Pro-x  hydra firming cream better than this one</li>
            <li>Feels nice and light on my skin.</li>
            <li>, what more could I say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an okay product.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any better face cream.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels once applied.</li>
            <li>skin is tighter and more lifted.  </li>
            <li>Lovely cream,  </li>
            <li>I made amistake order to many of them.</li>
            <li>Nice to smooth on my face.</li>
            <li>but it has to be one of the better products I have used.  </li>
            <li>A light fragrance makes it smell nice.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so much better as I use it on the go and at bed time....</li>
            <li>Purchasing at Amazon convenient and price usually better than in stores.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 2 years, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33, and my skin never has looked better.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to most creams around my eyes, but not Regenerist.  </li>
            <li>but if I try to use more, it balls up.</li>
            <li>--more</li>
            <li>I have used Regenerist Micro Ssculpting for more than 3 years .</li>
            <li>The most acne I have ever had in my life was maybe 3 pimples on my chin at a time.</li>
            <li>Not a terrible product.</li>
            <li>away.&lt;br /&gt;I am comparing apples to oranges, but if you can afford a better product use it.</li>
            <li>I love this product too.</li>
            <li>It has the most pleasing orange scent.</li>

            <li>I also love it and the price through your site.  </li>
            <li>just make sure you use an SPF.</li>
            <li>This is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I use this at night although I prefer the serum&#x27;s texture better.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better I&#x27;ve found in my 6 year quest to replace Klinger.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is better than many others I have tried....</li>
            <li>I needed something more, since I&#x27;m now 51.</li>

            <li>:) I QUESTION THE SAFETY OF THE PRODUCT, THOUGH, BECAUSE IT IS MADE IN A COUNTRY THAT IS TOXIC AND POLLUTED.  </li>
            <li>WILL NOT BUY AGAIN UNTIL I AM SURE OF THE QUALITY OF THE INGREDIENTS AND SAFETY OF THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>It has the most pleasing orange scent.</li>

            <li>After Avon discontinued my favorite All-in-one cream, I&#x27;ve been trying so many creams.  </li>
            <li>Well, it works BETTER.</li>
            <li>My favorite.  </li>
            <li>I looked for some products that would give me more of the vitamins, etc.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes ok but its not a miracle in a jar by any means.</li>
            <li>Need I say more.</li>
            <li>I love Olay regenerist products</li>
            <li>and I have been using the moisturizer bought at retail stores for many years without a problem.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li>Still love Olay regenerist moisturizer just not from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love the silky feeling</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>this is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a problem not just with this cream but with most face creams/anti aging products these days.</li>
            <li>Silicone forms a barrier on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>lOVE</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>

            <li>Nothing works better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I totally love OlAY REGENERIST micro-sculpting cream.</li>
            <li>Nobody has been able to guess my age correctly.</li>
            <li>I love Olay products.</li>
            <li>The rest of the review will be done after the 90 days they say will improve my skin.  :)</li>
            <li>i ordered one more to my cousin and she loves it tooo....</li>
            <li>I love Olay products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist for years and have recommended it to many friends and family members.</li>
            <li>and I love it for the price.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re just glad we can get this delivered on a recurring schedule.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product before and am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I think there&#x27;s probably better stuff for your under eyes though.</li>
            <li>, I LOVE</li>
            <li>I love this product in fact</li>
            <li>Love this product and use it every day.</li>
            <li>what more could I ask for.</li>
            <li>Good deal！The cream is worth the price and performs well in moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My skin has always been flawless and I modeled when I was younger.</li>
            <li>more hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, now my skin feels more hydrated. :)</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this, been using it for years now..</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>They are not counterfeits but more like an inferior product.</li>
            <li>The one shown in the picture is how it&#x27;s suppose to be with the top lid being with the OLAY name on top.</li>
            <li>many people are buying it without knowing this.</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t want to peel my skin off eliminating too many layers at a time.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, but when I&#x27;ve seen others try to peel many layers off at once it looks as if they will scar.)</li>
            <li>I love this product and was not going to get it, sure am glad that I changed my mind</li>
            <li>I have used it for years and love the difference it makes in my skin.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my morning routine, and it keep my skin moisture for couple of hours, and I apply some more in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li>and I am more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was satisfied with Olay 7-in</li>
            <li>Love anything for Olay, have nothing but results on all their products.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It feels so light, but works so well!</li>
            <li>but I love the feel on my skin</li>
            <li>But I could manage, most of the time.  </li>
            <li>but I love the smell of the cream, and I like the fact that the container fully seals (...the Almay stuff has</li>
            <li>I bought this cream thinking it will be able to moisturize my skin while providing anti-age benefit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In fact, according to Olay&#x27;s website, it is claimed that the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream moisturisers better than $200 luxury moisturisers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More hep and no results....</li>
            <li>To Use&lt;br /&gt;Improves Skin Texture on most women&lt;br /&gt;Minimizes</li>
            <li>I love the silky texture of this cream</li>
            <li>but they class of the packaging combined with the backed science of their innovative products is really impressive and would not surprise me if it was on par with medical grade stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and texture.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>Wonderful price on the daily deal&#x27;s</li>
            <li>but then I probably need more applications.</li>
            <li>and I love it .</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of it.</li>
            <li>Olay is such a great skin care company!</li>
            <li>Shorter is better.</li>
            <li>AND  I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I SAY MORE?</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I have been using this more than 4 years, and friend introduce me.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this...</li>
            <li>I just did it because I wanted more hydration.</li>
            <li>I used to love the cream</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s mostly on the rest of my body because it came from my swimming; not my lying in the sun without sun protection.  </li>
            <li>My lovely face was protected because I used to swim underwater</li>
            <li>This is another one of my favorite creams from Olay.</li>
            <li>I can say that I like most of the Olay products and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>

            <li>I usually love Olay products, but I had to return this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for many years.  </li>
            <li>However I have noticed that my face has more acne like blemishes in the areas I have applied the cream.</li>
            <li>I used with regenerist anti aging cleanser and was hoping for better results.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li>I just want to look better without alot of lines and</li>

            <li>Since regenerist....my skin looks great, I now know what my skin type is, it feels good every single day on my face anytime of the year and not to mention the price........</li>
            <li>;) feels good on</li>
            <li>I have been using this for some time and have found that my skin stays in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li>the regenerist is pretty good</li>
            <li>but this one is still pretty good.</li>
            <li>She looks young &amp; beautiful, which is the end result,</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a repeat purchase, first time on Amazon, good price and delivery.</li>
            <li>I get compliments about my beautiful skin (I am 58 yrs old)</li>
            <li>Great product that really does remove fine lines.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the original Olay product!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to buy it elsewhere making sure of the true label and ingredients like marine proteins!</li>
            <li>I inherited great skin from my mother and have been rather lax about taking care of it for most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>This cream is wonderful and proves to be as satisfactory as all Olay products that I frequently use.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for my 50 year-old dry skin, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love how it feels on and how my makeup goes on so easily over it.</li>
            <li>Best cream for my dry aging skin.  </li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizing for dry skin</li>
            <li>I have a combination of oily and dry skin, and this cream does the job of perfectly moisturizing without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m being honest, I liked the La Mer, but I like the Olay Regenerist just as much, and it&#x27;s waaaaay cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with how this cream glides on and how smooth and refreshed my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product love how you can subscribe and get even a better deal</li>
            <li>The fine lines and areas of dryness I was starting to see are gone, my skin feels smooth and healthy, and I am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>But, this cream makes my face feel smooth and comfortable, it smells nice, goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>Now I have to go through the hassle of finding a reasonably priced replacement for the original great product.</li>
            <li>My skin gets VERY dry in the winter months and this product keeps it looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li>it is a very good moisturizer leaving me with younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>Does not bother sensitive skin and feels great.</li>
            <li>Let me begin by describing my skin, issues, and desired effects and what I have experienced so far.</li>
            <li>think it is also important to tell you that I am NOT one of those 25 year olds who has young skin anyway and is trying to tell you how beautiful my skin is.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin it will probably work great for you.</li>
            <li>and so far it seems really great.</li>
            <li>I love the Olay Regenerist line of fragrance free products.</li>
            <li>im becoming an Amazon addict.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great moisture creme esp for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am in my 40s, my skin is sensitive and though the occurrences have greatly reduced do have a tendency to break out if I eat junk</li>
            <li>&quot; If it is \\&quot;micro,\\&quot; what&#x27;s the point, as any firming would be nearly unnoticeable, lol.</li>
            <li>used the cream (light, non greasy, lovely)</li>
            <li>I find this makes the product go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li>good texture and you don&#x27;t need too much.</li>
            <li>Its really just a good product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot for one use, so this lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for repair and really does the work.</li>
            <li>Good stuff at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>I really really think this product has a lot to do with my good skin.</li>
            <li>I had heard this was safe for pregnancy and wrote Olay who assured me that all of their products are safe for pregnant women to use.</li>
            <li>the seller was so sweet too!</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was my skin peeling its top layer!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this night cream for years, and love how rich but not greasy it is.  </li>
            <li>I usually love Olay products and this has not disappointed me.  </li>
            <li>Not certain that this night cream is the best out there, but for the price it is certainly a fine</li>
            <li>Finding it online saved me some money, and the delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>Oh my...))) trust me, if your skin tried the BEST- it will NOT accept an imitation.</li>
            <li>It goes on your face smooth and it just really feels good going on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results and I will definitely try more Olay products.</li>
            <li>its good for more mature skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this really would work for you, or maybe you&#x27;d be so filled with happiness endorphins after applying it that you literally begin aging in reverse.</li>
            <li>Love this product and this was such a great price on here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li>I use sunblock in the summer since I burn easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply .</li>
            <li>It also absorbs very quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>So easy now to pick up my iPad and place my order.</li>
            <li>Seen in reviews that people think that it has a really strong smell</li>
            <li>So strong, in fact, that it made my husband&#x27;s nose and eyes sting.</li>
            <li>Too strong.</li>
            <li>Smells way too strong for me.</li>
            <li>smells nice but only good for night time.  </li>
            <li>But the scent is truly way too strong.</li>
            <li>But I found it to be too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>, the scent is way too strong.  </li>
            <li>I purchased \\&quot;Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream\\&quot; as a gift to my mother-in-law, and she liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend at a good price also.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work, but I was able to get a full refund for the product</li>
            <li>After the first night of usage, my skin was kind of flaking.</li>
            <li>I switched to organic sweet almond oil, and saw more results from it in just three days.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on smoothly and absorbs easily, but the fragrance is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best skin cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>it is, hands down, the best product I have ever used to treat my seborrheic dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>Very good for dry, aging skin.you can see the difference soon.</li>
            <li>I now am stuck with 2 almost full jars of this stuff that I will not use - largely because I had faith in the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced at most retailers with coupons available- even through Amazon!  </li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m only 30, LOL) how to use best use moisturizers and other beauty products.</li>
            <li>friend used it and her skin was fine</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement of fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>, especialy note a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>but it turns out that this cream was fine for me in the summer as well.  </li>
            <li>I can wear it under makeup and has helped some with the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>No complains, it works fine as discribed on the package.</li>
            <li>I am in my 30&#x27;s and was looking for a prevention product as I am beginning to see fine lines in my forehead and around my mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine if I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, but I can not put it under makeup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products over the years, and this one is the most effective I have used!  </li>
            <li>Just a dab is all you need to erase fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>My skin looked smoother and the fine line were diminished.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any difference with fine lines on my face/forehead, so I cannot attest to this product&#x27;s claim</li>
            <li>The creme&#x27;s texture wasn&#x27;t as fine either.</li>
            <li>Does not remove fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It probably works just fine</li>
            <li>Fine lines gone in 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>No change in fine lines</li>
            <li>Regardless, they both do reduce fine lines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My best friend suggested I try Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Intesives line, but it smells so heinous, and the serum is an unfamiliar goopy mess when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product at night, goes on smooth and has a soft pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer feels great to the touch but does not absorb into skin - sits on top and clogs pores and in fact, made my skin feel dry.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and even tone although it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I look great and refreshed for awhile, but eventually, as with all moisturizers, the fine lines and dryness come back.  </li>

            <li>I started using the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream so much that my wife suggested I purchase my own.  </li>
            <li>However, since switching to the Olay brand, I&#x27;ve noticed simply fantastic results.</li>
            <li>After running out I didn&#x27;t think it was great enough to purchase again.</li>
            <li>If you do not have such issues though, I&#x27;d say this was a great product to use for firming your skin as for wrinkles?</li>
            <li>So overall great for firming skin if you are not acne prone, but ineffective for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Bummer though, because I wanted something I could use under my eyes which is an important area.</li>
            <li>my skin is smooth and silky after use.</li>

            <li>Says my face looks smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>(Olay&#x27;s new professional products line is really very good.)</li>
            <li>It was a very strong scent that I had to have very close to my nose</li>
            <li>I really like the jar because it makes it very easy to get every drop out-</li>
            <li>The combination of these products has given me amazing results, highly recommended</li>
            <li>The combination of these products has given me amazing results, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Very fast service, and I Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It is light, absorbs quickly, leaving a smooth feel to the skin and no stickiness.  </li>
            <li>Also Amazon has the best prices, and usually there is a coupon</li>
            <li>It significantly reduced the appearance of wrinkles and increased the &#x27;freshness&#x27; of our skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many of the Olay products and had settled into the Regenerist ones for most of my skincare (love the night firming cream), but got this in my Christmas stocking and have left the rest of my daytime Regenerist lotions and serums by the wayside!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Olay products for many years; and, this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this one.  </li>
            <li>and/or through consistent healthy living practices.  </li>
            <li>Each time that I use it, I am more and more amazed at how smooth and soft my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>So can&#x27;t say at this point that I&#x27;m too excited with these products.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and am very pleased with my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and am very pleased with my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin so this one is too rich to apply to my nose.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this cream in the mail and after using the one time applicator, I went out and bought a full jar.</li>
            <li>The original Olay product is made by P &amp; G in Cincinnati</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed and plan to continue using Regenerist with</li>
            <li>It seems to work well and is rich but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Using the cream with the Olay gave me both the immediate effects of a great moisturizer and long term change.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased a jar of this at CVS after using Oil of Olay for years.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin dewy and fresh but not oily!  </li>
            <li>I use it sparingly because of the cost, but it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>The problem is they don&#x27;t even have the original paper package as you see in the drug stores.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied though and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>so I did have a significant amount of sun damage on my face.</li>
            <li>Like I said in my last review Love, Love, Love this product have used it since it came out and will continue to use it, i hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li>This is the best Olay cream I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve used a few!</li>
            <li>This product works better than others costing 4 or 5 times higher.  </li>
            <li>It says to use nights and mornings, and it really is worth using twice a day!</li>
            <li>really gets rid of fine wrinkles you are asking for too many words for these reviews.</li>
            <li>love this so far, esp the price!!!!</li>
            <li>Very effective and quick acting.</li>
            <li>I am 25, sometimes I get fine lines on my forehead from stress or making faces while applying makeup (it comes and goes), and I get puffy bags under my eyes, but mostly I was looking for something to firm my cheek and jawline area to appear more youthful (I&#x27;m a very cheeky person! :P</li>
            <li>It is important to be sure that when ordering face cream (or anything else) that the seal is not broken when it arrives.  </li>
            <li>This is a great night creme or day if your skin is dry like mine.</li>
            <li>By the way, I don&#x27;t care about sticking a finger in the jar, after all, I wash my hands, then my face, so it&#x27;s clean fingers going in there anyway.</li>
            <li>My co-worker suggested for me to use \\&quot;Clean and Clear\\</li>
            <li>Great for smoothing rough elbows, etc., but does not seem to do anything for my already smooth face, neck or chest areas insofar as wrinkles or tightening skin.</li>
            <li>I used this creme for years and it was perfect for my sensitive skin until recently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to report that after sticking with these products, that my skin is now, in my early 50&#x27;s, younger looking and softer than when I was in my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Its light and absorb quickly and make my skin look softer.</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and my dermatologist told me last week that I have wonderful skin for my age.  </li>
            <li>Just applying it, with its smooth texture and mild, clean scent, makes me feel rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>Being a person that wants to stay looking young, this is a great cream to use.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a real downer for me since I have extremely fair skin and absolutely have to wear sunscreen when I leave my house.</li>
            <li>I read many positive reviews</li>
            <li>Great smell seemed to be exactly what I expected couldn&#x27;t be done better.</li>
            <li>I noticed results right away as advertised, not face lift changes but complimentary and i felt confident the product works.</li>
            <li>very smooth on skin but to much perfume for facecream nor recomeded for peaple that has allergies or dont like perfume</li>
            <li>works fast and makes my skin very smooth</li>
            <li>I just found that spending more money on higher end products made a HUGE difference in my skin right</li>
            <li>I like the light scent, and I believe it keeps my skin firm and bright!</li>
            <li>I started noticing fine lines around my eyes and deepening smile lines when I was about 24.</li>
            <li>a rich alternative to the costly ones and does a better all-around job..</li>
            <li>and you certainly don&#x27;t need to spend more.  </li>
            <li>and this was after washing it off right away!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with my skin right now!</li>
            <li>It is fresh and clean, not greasy, to the touch and leaves a smooth surface to apply make up.</li>
            <li>I will probably switch back once I am able but for now it was nice to find something that is safe to use, helps with my dry skin and is effective.</li>
            <li>my skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily with most skincare products but not this one.</li>
            <li>The price is fair, much cheaper than some of those high end products you buy from Macy&#x27;s, Dillard&#x27;s, Saks etc...  </li>
            <li>I use the 3-step, which gets a lot of haters, but it keeps my skin clear which is amazing since I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and reactions to stuff.</li>
            <li>The seller was great and the product came faster than expected.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s very hydrating without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It does go on nicely and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>BTW, I never felt that stinging, which I mentioned before, with Prevera makes it seem like a more gentle product.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and more radiant.</li>
            <li>Not only have I saved money, but my skin looks really good.  </li>
            <li>However, I will continue to use the product because it is the only moisturizer that noticeably lasts all day, all night, AND I my friends continue to make comments on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I know some on here have talked about how the scent of this product is too much, but I personally *love* it.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not \\&quot;intended\\&quot; for this use, but I tried it on a whim and it worked very well... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>So now I ended up with a lot more of this product than I wanted, no rebate and very distrustful of Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li>My sons (in their 20s are very choosy about their skin creams and spend much more than I) and they have tried this and like it too.</li>
            <li>Overall its probably a good cream, just not for me.</li>
            <li>I love this Olay Regenerist product so much that I have mine on set and save</li>
            <li>it really does make a lovely moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I still use acne control face wash, and am prone to breakouts and over-drying, so a good moisturizer is necessary for my skin.</li>
            <li>After 4 days use on my face and neck, morning and evening, my face and neck feel really nice and soft</li>
            <li>and I think its a good deal overall.</li>
            <li>and I believe that it&#x27;s a better moisturizer than the $150 creams (I would never pay that much to find out).</li>
            <li>it made my skin much smoother for sure.</li>
            <li>They both love it and neither of them noticed much a fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>Have been using them for some time now and found this to be true.</li>
            <li>they promise on the commercials that you will see results in 5 days and it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I am 69 years old and people often ask me what I do to keep my skin looking so nice.  </li>
            <li>I guess it is true</li>
            <li>I really have always trusted Olay and have used their products for 35 years or more.</li>
            <li>Although my skin feels softer and more hydrated than it did with Mary Kay, it doesn&#x27;t do what I wanted to do, and that&#x27;s the whole reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Honestly, my skin is not that sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Regenerist Mico-Sculpting Cream for about a month and so far I&#x27;m really loving it.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy yet does not leave an oily feeling on my face which I love.</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good, basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so smooth and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>love the whole line of Regenerist products.</li>
            <li>Good enough that I will buy again</li>
            <li>The fast delivery makes it convenient and saves me from using more gas in my car.</li>
            <li>bought this product because I read that it provides the best results for the least amount of money.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much.  </li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer...absorbs into skin very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK as a cream, but I don&#x27;t see any visible results and it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.  </li>
            <li>I eventually tossed it, even though it was still 1/2 full.  </li>
            <li>so I try to be sure not to apply too much.</li>
            <li>It did arrive on time and was the full size it advertised.  </li>
            <li>I have paid four times as much for creams that do&#x27;t do any better than this.  </li>
            <li>Although it may be too sweet to somebody.</li>
            <li>I just find out that this olay product is made in Thailand, I will wonder that the quality of this cream might not be the same good as though t made in usa</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good cream for the price</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it is a happy medium between not too thick and not too light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with the whole regenerist line of products.</li>
            <li>This is an incredible moisturizing cream, leaving your skin feeling like velvet after its use, without being at all heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping I may be able to resume using the Microsculpting cream because it really worked.</li>
            <li>HAVE HAD THIS MANY TIMES AND REALLY LIKE IT, WILL BE ORDERING IT AGAIN.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time but wasn&#x27;t sure if it really worked.</li>
            <li>What I really notice is the smoothness and reduction of wrinkles, also it seems to lighten my face up giving me a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Good Housekeeping Institute, after extensive testing, rated this as the</li>
            <li>I loved it enough to give it as a gift to my dear sweet mother.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not a bad scent</li>
            <li>It is not your $100 cream, but it is not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li>It does feel good on the skin and does moisturize, and has a very slight&lt;br /&gt;scent, very, very, I should say, because I would have liked a little more.</li>
            <li>Luckily I decided to look them up on amazon and was able to find a price that reasonably fits into my budget.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old and proud of growing to that age and many more, but sometimes we need just a little help.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, it has a pretty strong scent.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells pretty strong although I see they now have an unscented version.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised that Amazon was shipping it for free and has special $3.00 discount on top of it.</li>
            <li>I did get a compliment that I have great skin the other day.</li>
            <li>It STILL works at hydrating but not so great at that dewy look due to air degrading the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I remember that my lines around my eyes and mouth greatly reduced within weeks, and it has stayed very minimal ever since.  </li>
            <li>I really hope Olay would stick to the original formula!</li>
            <li>my face always looks fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I use this cream every morning and in the afternoon sometimes for a quick pick me up.  </li>
            <li>So what if its super moisturizing.....</li>
            <li>Before I was using Olay Total Effects(which is WONDERFUL), but decided to try the next anti aging product up, and that was this product.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and smooth my skin feels.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t use retinol products while pregnant.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the last 6 months, after moving over from the Olay Night Recovery Cream (which I liked, but wasn&#x27;t available at the time).</li>
            <li>I read a review before I started using the micro-sculpting cream that a woman had acne trouble after using it, but most reviews were good</li>
            <li>It came quickly.</li>
            <li>The shipping time was adequate.</li>
            <li>and I love their products, and particularly this</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, no complaints.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I kept the box it came in.  </li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with how this moisturizes my skin in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>The product is adequate for my skin</li>
            <li>This improves them tremendously, but hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of them.  </li>
            <li>it was adequate and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li>and it works quickly.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Olay customer.</li>
            <li>Not for people over 70, I don&#x27;t think there is anything out there for old people, might be great for young people.</li>
            <li>but by the 7th morning it was undeniable and even more prominent than the 3rd</li>
            <li>Lucky are those who can bear the over powering smell.</li>
            <li>After trying many high end creams, I gave Olay Regenerist a shot...</li>
            <li>I highly doubted its authentic now.  </li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m pretty frugal and normally wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $10 for skin cream, but my experience with it has been pleasant and it only costs about $5-6/month.</li>
            <li>I only use it at night and am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>recommend this for anyone with light crease lines and who wants to keep their skin rejuvenated!</li>
            <li>I am 31, take good care of my skin and show almost no signs of aging, and will keep using it for a long time.</li>
            <li>many, many brands including expensive cream with all the bells and whistles and this Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is by far producing the best results ever.</li>
            <li>I tried many, many brands including expensive cream with all the hype and this Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is by far producing the best results for me.</li>
            <li>Besides this moisturizer is in reasonable price, but come with amazing result, highly recommended to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And with Amazon, the prices are a lot less than the drugstores and delivered to your doorstep:)  LOVE!</li>
            <li>: I was most excited to try this product since it says \\&quot;Dermatologically  Tested, Non Comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), Fast- Absorbing and Non Greasy.</li>
            <li>I do break out when I try new products that aggravate my skin, but that is more like a rash than acne.</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite night cream.  </li>
            <li>(I proved it by writing the date I opened the new jar), combining the cream with the serum works even BETTER</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make me break out or make my skin oilier, it pretty much did nothing more than moisturize.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>This cream, used together with the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum, is really working, better than products costing three times as much!  </li>
            <li>Lip Stick is very moist and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Good for my dry skin and keep the moisture in after putting my Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>It is not oily and is absorbed quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin feel very soft, and although I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, I like to go for the preventative route.</li>
            <li>Its smells nice, feels good on the skin (not heavy or greasy) and sinks in pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Been using almost every day and notice a definite difference in being more soft, wrinkles stay the same (thus, 4 stars), complexion better, hydration better, don&#x27;t get in eyes as it stings, esp with contacts!!</li>
            <li>nothing dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Since I did want to find something that wouldn&#x27;t break my face out and would help reverse time - I bought a facial cream and under eye cream by Patricia Wexler(Bath and Body Works) - LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Since I did want to find something that wouldn&#x27;t break my face out and would help reverse time - I bought a facial cream and under eye cream by Patricia Wexler(Bath and Body Works) - LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product because it was my first time buying an &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; cream.</li>
            <li>the first a significant  sign that it is working.</li>
            <li>and it really works!!</li>
            <li>This cream REALLY and TRULY made a difference!!  </li>
            <li>The Most Complete Anti-Aging Skin Supplement!]]</li>
            <li>The Micro Sculpting Cream is moisturizing without being heavy and has a pleasant, light scent.</li>
            <li>Skin feels very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Makes it very smooth and alive after applying.</li>
            <li>But I was very optimistic after reading so many positive reviews</li>
            <li>I started to notice some fine lines on my forehead from squinting and furrowing my brow, too much stress in my life.  </li>
            <li>I love its silky texture, and my husband loves its very subtle and beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li>Every bit as great as what we have bought at local drug stores, only the savings is fantastic.</li>
            <li>product is also great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I ran out and purchased some Regenerist as I have heard such amazing reviews from women who use this product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is worth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given this cream a fair shot, 4 months now and see no real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I am 44 years of age with fair skin that would be classified as combination which is both sensitive and adult acne</li>
            <li>and once I read that the ingredients are the same I felt confident to try them, and all the generic versions I have tried work equally as good.  </li>
            <li>So definitely if you are on a budget and have sensitive skin, this is a GREAT option.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it proves to be worth.</li>
            <li>through my teens i was fortunate enough to seldom break out but ever since i started using this product i had more pimples on my face than ever.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to many products and fragrances and have had no issues with this cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, about the age defying properties, I don&#x27;t think it actually does anything for the skin except moisturize and keep the complexion looking nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it left my face feeling moisturized, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I purchased one last year, she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>I would think (based on my initial results) that this cream would have really nice results when used over an extended period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok I wanted to try olay one more time, since I&#x27;ve spend thousands of dollar on their products but never really see what the hype is about.</li>
            <li>Only thing I would advise is making sure you purchase the fragrance free version - which this was not.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that they are kind of expensive-but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and rosacea, so was pleased when I found something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Olay&#x27;s products are far better for you and your pocket book.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>At 66, that&#x27;s definitely worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else leaves my face filling fresh not greasy</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so radiant and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>do hope the success continues and am optimistic for the cream to refine some loss of elasticity in my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I love the Olay Regenerist products because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and most people think I look like I am 40.</li>
            <li>I love how soft this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I rarely get three hours of sleep and</li>
            <li>It smooths on nicely, so one 20.00 bottle should last a while.  </li>
            <li>It does have a fresh scent that I like, but I noticed they have unscented if you need</li>
            <li>thanks for asking, I bought the regenerist for my mother and she loves it, I&#x27;ve already ordered more so thanks again Greg</li>
            <li>I switched from Olay to more natural products, and now that I think about it -</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I can say it gives a nice tiny tingle, which makes my face feel like its been cleaned and moisturized and refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who comes up with the names for products, but you have to laugh at some of them.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for several years mow and always being told how nice my skin is</li>
            <li>I got the wrinkle cream also and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price even after the ingredient change.</li>
            <li>by far my favorite beauty product</li>
            <li>My mother is 65 years old, she and I love it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>Just hopefully you didn&#x27;t buy it for a loved one as a present and them finding out why it&#x27;s not working very well.</li>
            <li>I found it was a good skin cream, but my more expensive face cream was much better.</li>
            <li>So far using for about a month, love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>I have been using Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Micro Sculpting creme for several years (off and on) and have always liked how WELL</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Love this product so expensive in the shop&#x27;s I new Amazon would do one better price wise will certainly be ordering plenty more well done.</li>
            <li>I bought this with the night repair cream, and I am very pleased with Olay that it gives me the moisture and softness that my dry skin needed.</li>
            <li>I use to look much more younger and more vibrant before I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I have used numerous face creams and serums hoping to get positive results.i purchased this cream because of the positive reviews on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different skin care products over the past 35 years or so and this one is the absolute best thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my face.</li>
            <li>Bought it because it was recommended by Good Housekeeping together with other products to minimize wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rich and super-moisturizing, and it&#x27;s making a real difference to my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Purchased multiple Olay products in the past and found them to be the best value and available when needed.</li>
            <li>Price is right</li>
            <li>&quot; then I use this right out of the shower because it minimizes my need for foundation.</li>
            <li>No greasey or cakey, just right.</li>
            <li>but you will def notice the moisture level in your face right away.</li>
            <li>Olay knows how to do it right.  </li>
            <li>And I was right.  </li>
            <li>right??</li>
            <li>AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT.</li>
            <li>Using both the Vitamin C before my make-up regimen, and Olay, I have started to see changes happen right away, just like the product says.</li>
            <li>While I like the unscented version better, the scented is still nice and not offensive; I have gotten creams in the past which are just too offensive and give me a headache.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a dramatic change in the surface of your skin it would be best to go with a prescription product.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s all about selecting the right type of moisturizer for your face - if a heavier cream like this one is making your skin \\&quot;too oily,\\&quot; then drop down to a lotion or serum that doesn&#x27;t have as many moisturizing agents in it, and that may work better for your skin type.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing cream, light, moisturizes, does not weigh down face.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the Micro-Sculpting cream that caused it since it wasn&#x27;t a major breakout.  </li>
            <li>If you want to improve your skin, use Retin A, good sunscreen, moderate your drinking of alcohol, don&#x27;t smoke, and take good care of your skin by cleansing it properly and moisturizing when necessary</li>
            <li>I was pretty sure I had chosen this particular cream because it didn&#x27;t have much silicone in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other product lines over the years, but Olay always seems to produce a great cream or lotion that equals skin care product lines that are many times more expensive.  </li>
            <li>If you check my review of Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum, you will see that I truly believe that the combination of the two have helped to keep my sixty-four-year-old skin looking softer, less wrinkled and better than the skin of most women</li>
            <li>his skin looked so much better not to mention how quickly my jar was approaching the bottom!!</li>
            <li>Use it every single night and love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told time and again that moisturizing is one of the keys, not to just healthy skin in general, but also in fighting acne.  </li>
            <li>I have used this in the past when I lived in the desert and it was great.</li>
            <li>I have no fine lines on my forehead, my puffy eyes are gone, my skin seems brighter and has a nice youthful glow (under the eyes too!)</li>
            <li>I really like this cream, and I have tried more expensive creams which are not as good as this!  </li>
            <li>I think it does help - certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt!  </li>
            <li>It feels very creamy when applied, but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It really makes my 66-year old skin look lovely.</li>
            <li>If it does get heavy feeling in summer I will switch back to the regenerist serum or the lotion (the one with the SFP and Self Tanner is great!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, but gentle, at the same time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s dead skin falling off, or what it was, but after the second night, my skin felt and looked wonderful.</li>
            <li>Only laugh lines are allowed :-)</li>
            <li>This is actually the same price if I purchased a two-pack there, so this is a great alternative to have.</li>
            <li>FOR HELPING WITH MY BUDGET AND FOR YOUR SUPER FAST SERVICE.</li>
            <li>Maybe there&#x27;s a correlation between the strong fragrance and the breakout on sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li>Not as high-level as P&amp;G SK-II but more economical version with some of the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>I only just started using it, and my skin looks more plump and fresh.</li>
            <li>I had previously used Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream with good results.</li>
            <li>This cream work a great for face and neck compares to the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>It smells divine, not overpowering, but very soft.... and goes on creamy smooth.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommended and at a price less than Walmart.  </li>
            <li>In all honesty, I am not sure that I would be willing to pay full retail no matter how good a product is.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend any of the Olay products, but especially the Regenerist line; and, I also recommend using the subscription service for even more savings!</li>
            <li>It is an effective moisturizer and does reduce the appearance of wrinkles and loose skin.  </li>
            <li>Gift for lover, she loves very much</li>
            <li>Also a very reasonable price for the amount of product in this jar, and it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of product to do what you want it to.</li>
            <li>and it is very gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift to my mom, she likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the lower cost of this cream, which I like very much.  </li>
            <li>My mama likes it very much</li>
            <li>I do have some fine lines on my forehead, and those are almost completely gone and part of that</li>
            <li>have bought other creams that cost 3x more, but I didn&#x27;t not see huge difference, so I&#x27;ll stick to my Regenerist</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and the fine lines that I had, have appeared to have gone away.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and does as good as any other product I have used.</li>
            <li>Surely, the more expensive the product, the better -- right?    </li>
            <li>I always come back because, unlike many others, this is mild, gentle, smoothes in well, and really does help!</li>
            <li>I will look for something else to add to my beauty regimen for firming my face, but I will keep using this as a moisturizer, I really like it, and I think it smells pretty!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my new skin cream</li>
            <li>[my main reason for using it] and that lovely soft dewy look it gives my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel fine about this product I just need to buckle down and use it more often.</li>
            <li>It is equally important to tell you that I did nothing special to my skin until about 4 years ago when I began a regular face cream routine.  </li>
            <li>It is equally important to tell you that I did nothing special to my skin until about 4 years ago when I began a regular face cream routine.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it since it first came out and am never without a jar of it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and applies smoothly but not much more than that.</li>
            <li>My face felt firmer instantly, especially around the jaw line where I needed it the most.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will only get better the longer that I use it.</li>
            <li>your face will have so many red dots and bumps,</li>
            <li>A very noticeable improvement of my jawline!  </li>
            <li>but they wil be at much higher price.</li>
            <li>Our only wish is that Olay came out with a product with retin-A and hydroquinone (a skin lightener), but it&#x27;s sure to be in stores soon.    </li>
            <li>The forehead got better after one week but my jaw and neck allergies turned into red swelts and thickening and made my neck wrinkly.  </li>
            <li>I plan to begin using as the directions instruct and apply these 2 products together; first applying the serum and topping off with the cream.</li>
            <li>When I first began using it on my face, I used it a week or so before adding the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum.</li>
            <li>First of all, one of the number one mistakes most women make is that they put moisturizer ALL over their face and nine times out of ten, you don&#x27;t need to do that!</li>
            <li>Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is one of my favorite facial creams.</li>
            <li>Olay also makes many of the big department store brands, by the way.  </li>
            <li>It leaves skin soft, smooth, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars, as I like my Olay Pro-X products better.  </li>
            <li>It only feels \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; the first minute or so, but I consider it more of a hydrated glow.</li>
            <li>Looked more noticeable even without a facial expression.</li>
            <li>like I wasn&#x27;t getting the result I first got with the micro- sculpting cream sample.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream!</li>
            <li>This cream actually worked and alleviated my problem of dryness caused by shaving.  </li>
            <li>It even goes on sale occasionally which makes the price even better.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it makes my skin look and feel smooth with a natural glow.</li>
            <li>This is my first use of this product.</li>
            <li>I found this product to OK for it&#x27;s sole purpose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t remember exactly when and how I started using this cream, but I remember the day when I knew it was &#x27;the one&#x27;.</li>
            <li>After my first application I could tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I use the cleansing Regenerist system and I love it, especially the night cream.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate it and it seems to really help with the sagging!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>It does what it says it will, and my skin looks smooth and young.</li>
            <li>but I like this SO much better than the last 2 moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried ...</li>
            <li>I will most likely purchase this again.</li>
            <li>Amazon has it pretty well priced</li>
            <li>I have been using this for one week exactly.</li>
            <li>No one ever guesses even close to My actual age.  :-)</li>
            <li>This product works much better than the last cream I tried.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Have ordered my second jar already and am definitely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  sure I&#x27;m  looking younger.</li>
            <li>my skin is nw smooth and nearly wrinkle-less.</li>
            <li>I cannot find this for a better price locally.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the difference from the first application.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cream after seeing the commercial about it being better than creams that cost $350.  </li>
            <li>My face was so shiny at work the first day, I almost didn&#x27;t recognize myself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite skincare products next to Philosophy Purity cleanser and Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I started using the fragranced version first.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s actually helping to heal the pimples faster and not leaving more acne marks.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;ve used it for several years and not found anything that works better.  </li>
            <li>I love the Olay Regenerist Products - I switched to the ProX line, but went back to the regenerist after about 6 months.</li>
            <li>I have tried more pricey products in the past, but now basically stick with Olay night and day moisturizers and am pleased.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference from the first application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream for several years and love the effect that it has on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is a thick cream which I like and smells great.  </li>
            <li>My skin does look better but not remarkably different.  </li>
            <li>I would not mind paying the higher price</li>
            <li>wish I had tried this first.  </li>
            <li>ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure), so I can&#x27;t really say how it works on that front.  </li>
            <li>I recommend buying the smallest jar you can when first trying this and see whether your skin can handle it.  </li>
            <li>First let me say the</li>
            <li>Yes,if this is your first time using it, breaks out may occur.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to add the serum to my routine next:)    </li>
            <li>The cream keeps my skin silkly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I love this facial cream.  </li>
            <li>THIS WAS A REAL FIND FOR ME!  </li>
            <li>FIRST TIME I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely brighter and more even</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years and am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it I noticed that my face felt like it had a residue on it.  </li>
            <li>First off, let me say I am not in any way benefitting from this review.....</li>
            <li>works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream on my face and neck for several years and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Olay moisturizer for several years and love it.</li>
            <li>have been using this product for a few years, and though I just turned 80, my skin looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li>First of all, The bottle came without a box.</li>
            <li>We are both in our mid sixties and healthy.</li>
            <li>Has kept my face soft, smooth and moist - keeps those wrinkles at bay.  </li>
            <li>my first time buying beauty products online</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
            <li>, so I tried the Regenerist Serum first on my neck, and as recommended, used the Olay Micro-Sculpting Moisture Cream</li>
            <li>Wish I could wear it, and I am sure store would take back, even without the packaging.  </li>
            <li>but I hope it was more midly scented..</li>
            <li>This was recommended as one of the top ten skin products in 2009, and I started using it at that time.</li>
            <li>but it definitely moisturizes well and gives my face a healthy, youthful glow.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks of using it my skin is glowing and it&#x27;s so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I might need the next version of this cream for \\&quot;more mature\\&quot; skins.</li>
            <li>First of all my tub was made in Thailand not USA.</li>
            <li>My face feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>RECOMMEND TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR AN ANTI AGE CREAM ;-)</li>
            <li>I actually thought my face looked better after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so very upset!</li>
            <li>and I feel a bit greasy for the first hour or so after putting in on.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my forehead with the first application.</li>
            <li>Shame on you Amazon who I trust so much!  </li>
            <li>Out of all the rejuvenating creams on the market, this one had the most potential.</li>
            <li>a nutshell, I was a dubious purchaser of this Olay Regenerist line when it first came out</li>
            <li>Pretty</li>
            <li>If you massage more, you can feel the skin is younger with shining.</li>
            <li>I have tried many creams over the years and keep going back to Olay.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for years, works just as well for me as higher priced creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew exactly what I was purchasing.  </li>
            <li>After reading a fair few reviews I made my purchase and used the Olay Micro-Sculpting Cream twice a day.</li>
            <li>It is a nice cream, a bit heavy but not bad.</li>
            <li>Heavy and moisturizing cream that is good to use at night time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I saw amazing results the next day from this new product I found and</li>
            <li>This is a good cream if you have sensitive or combination skin....or dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Olay products all my life, they are all good, but this product keeps my dry skin feeling moisturized and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Price is right but goes much faster than my jar of Kiehls</li>
            <li>They apparently buy every product on the market and they are extremely easy to impress.  </li>
            <li>I got this because I had to switch up a lot of my normal products when I became pregnant.</li>
            <li>I am 37 and starting to get those fine laugh lines and \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I bought my first jar of Regenerist.  </li>
            <li>I found that it does work better when mixed with a drop or two of Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum--but then any cream&#x27;s benefits would be boosted from this addition..</li>
            <li>I noticed a great improvement in my skin, and now a week later I am almost fully back to normal.</li>
            <li>I am 67 and don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, but I can&#x27;t honestly say whether this is due to the use of Olay products for a number of years or heredity.</li>
            <li>I read great reviews about this product in fashion magazines-it fits right up in the top 15-20 products of any and all very expensive products.</li>
            <li>recommend this product to anyone that wants to have smooth, clear skin and diminish wrinkle lines in your face.</li>
            <li>I like the way it is absorbed into my skin so that when I put light powder on my face there is no greasy residue left to interact with the powder.</li>
            <li>And importantly, the facial scrub that goes with it too is worth a check out.</li>
            <li>Olay used to be at least ok until they keep coming out with so many lines of products.</li>
            <li>The best feature of the cream, for me at least, is its sculpting ability, especially around the jawline.  </li>
            <li>They care more about the customer having an instant experience rather than a real improvement.</li>
            <li>I think, this is a very suitable for the ordinary people of cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I have had large pores and redness my whole life and this cream has changed the texture of my skin!  </li>
            <li>You need a good moisturizer with it, because the major drawback to all the retinol products is that they dry your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now the major, HUGE problem with this product is that it makes me break out.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, the bottle was not even clean!</li>
            <li>love the feel on my skin, but haven&#x27;t really used it long enoguh to see real results as far as reducing fine lines yet.</li>
            <li>I gave this one a try after seeing all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any positive improvement in the firmness of my cheeks or jawline, BUT~</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it took so long to find a product that I love.</li>
            <li>It has definitely made my complexion look younger and more important, healthier.</li>
            <li>This cream is easily absorbed, and although I cannot compare it with many other skin creams, it seems to keep my skin well moisturized at night.  </li>
            <li>and you will love how your skin will stay moist for a long period of time.....</li>
            <li>The other nice thing, is when I do wear makeup (about twice a month), the make up goes on much, much nicer.</li>
            <li>First off, the fragrance IS very overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it took so long to find a product that I love..  </li>
            <li>But most importantly, it caused nearly 100 closed comedones to break out all over my forehead, jaw, and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a long time and as a swimmer and biker and marathon runner i have always strive to keep my skin well protected and healthy..</li>
            <li>so I give up, no more wasting my good earned money on non sense cream.</li>
            <li>The smell is not overwhelming and the results seem good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works as a sculpting cream, but it  does moisten the skin, goes on smoothly, and has a nice subtle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(it gets more necessary as you get older).  </li>
            <li>I love the results I&#x27;ve seen with this brand, especially since I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to perform any better than the other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I normally use it right before bed, with the serum.</li>
            <li>I am in my late 30s and have decent skin, so I am not looking for miracles when it comes to wrinkles, but I do see better texture and a more even tone since I started using this a couple months ago.  </li>
            <li>The first night I used this, I woke up in the morning to distinctly lessened lines and soft dewy skin.</li>
            <li>I felt my skin very healthy after only 1 day, I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to run slightly dry, and more so in the winter months.</li>
            <li>but I could get over that if it wasn&#x27;t such a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>If this was a lotion, I would expect the scent to be strong, but for a facial cream, the scent is overpowering and feels like it belongs on the body, not on the face.</li>
            <li>It did give a descent result - but not a dramatic result.</li>
            <li>Oh, and as an aside, I wish my mother, who was a strong proponent of using moisturizer, had told me to put it on the Back of my neck, not just the front.  </li>
            <li>and I love every single product.</li>
            <li>product did nothing for my noticeable large pores</li>
            <li>It certainly does help your skin feel softer.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so thought it cleared up and wore newly purchased, never used hypoallergenic makeup and within 48 hours same experience.  </li>
            <li>Top was loose.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and many creams irritate my skin and leave my skin blotchy looking, but this cream has actually cleared up the blotchiness and has evened out my skin tone and improved the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m starting to get fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Olay products continue to outshine many other products of higher prices.</li>
            <li>Her fine lines are starting to fade and her skin looks well moisturized.</li>
            <li>Same thing as the big box stores sell for a much better price!</li>
            <li>Recently, I have noticed some fine lines - particularly between my eyebrows (vertical lines!)  </li>
            <li>I am not a particular fan of a lot of Olay products, but the Regenerist line, I&#x27;ve always been pleased with their results.</li>
            <li>It definitely decreases the appearance of fine lines</li>
            <li>Limit  it to those facial wrinkles and you&#x27;ll be fine .</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin, so I was thrilled to have found a lotion that was this affordable and  VERY moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>This is a good daily face cream for the price - not to thick so that you can easily add your sunscreen without looking oily.</li>
            <li>My husband actually likes the scent (and he&#x27;s super picky!)</li>
            <li>This product is very amazing, eliminating all the stress related aging without weighing my skin down.</li>
            <li>In any case, a good product, when used with the overnight product, that really does leave your skin nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t have any unpleasant smell to it (as many similar products do).</li>
            <li>For my skin that&#x27;s seen too much sun, has large pores and some wrinkles?</li>
            <li>28 and pretty much everyone I meet says I don&#x27;t look a day older than 21 tops.</li>
            <li>The only result was my face was very moisturized, but fine line around my forehead was still apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend this to those are interested.</li>
            <li>The texture of this cream is great - doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy even though it is thick, and makes my skin feel very smooth,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer for years and years, and, while that&#x27;s wonderful for daily after shower moisturizing, I finally sighed and faced the inevitable ..</li>
            <li>good for very dry skin ONLY.</li>
            <li>chose to get the scented cream just because I enjoy a little scent to cosmetic products, but it is available in unscented.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to have good quality control that way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even finished with my first jar and my skin looks radiant and feels soft !!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, firms, and has a light scent which some people have complained about, but I find ok.  </li>
            <li>I have a huge red bump that appears to be formed from underneath and breakouts with pus on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li>i have used olay regenerist micro sculpting creams for years works very well at keeping wrinkles away..</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for reading this.</li>
            <li>The smell is VERY noticeable, almost like a &#x27;suntan lotion&#x27; smell.  </li>
            <li>I really really like this Olay regenerist micro-sculpting cream.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really get that.</li>
            <li>I have found this is light enough to use in the morning before makeup and at night after cleansing.</li>
            <li>It really has improved the texture and smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It smooths wrinkles really well</li>
            <li>I continue to use the product just not as much alittle</li>
            <li>This product is produced and made by Proctor &amp; Gamble and works very well to sooth the skin</li>
            <li>I switched over because of all of the hype but haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference or improvement.  </li>
            <li>It smooths wrinkles really well</li>
            <li>: I really like the wash.</li>
            <li>It does have a very noticeable scent -</li>
            <li>This is the product I was very nervous about trying since it said nothing about being Non-Comedogenic.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen a change...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen a change...</li>
            <li>This product is reasonable priced and does what $100 products claim to do.  </li>
            <li>Very expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>And my mom use it , she loves it so much</li>
            <li>I really prefer all products I use too</li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
            <li>I apply 2x a day, it&#x27;s not oily and leaves no oily residue and works very well with my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>My face is so much smoother and my skin just seems brighter than it used to be.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any real results and have used it for a month now.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this cream to anyone!</li>
            <li>So I bought a whole jar.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a bit overpowering, however, it moisturizes well and leaves skin feeling really silky.</li>
            <li>This really wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for me</li>
            <li>I like this product so much that I am thinking of signing up for the Subscribe &amp; Save program.    </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and was as described</li>
            <li>but when you are nearing 60 your face wants to take a swan dive to your feet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reason I took one star off is it contains too much fragrance,</li>
            <li>I’m still searching for something that will make a real difference.</li>
            <li>I like this cream, it really shows a lift of my face skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using Olay products my whole life.</li>
            <li>I really like Regenerist.</li>
            <li>It has a very silky feeling going on</li>
            <li>Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream, I am very Impress, with how it looks on my face after I have applied it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily, but still retains my skin&#x27;s moisture (thanks to the glycerin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and fresh again.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I could almost immediately tell a difference in my skin texture where I applied it on my cheeks, they are so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream and hope I&#x27;m not deluding myself that it softens lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>If I haven&#x27;t used it for a day or two, I can absolutely tell.</li>
            <li>, when I woke up in the morning by the my skin was really oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very drying to the skin and leaves a sticky feeling to the skin.</li>
            <li>but I guess you really do have to be in your 40s for this product to work.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it from 30-60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I highly advise you buy from him!</li>
            <li>It really does take years off your skin</li>
            <li>Moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I feel this was very obtuse and misleading.</li>
            <li>This product really works to restore skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li>Not a pimple my whole life until I tried this product.</li>
            <li>Very disheartening.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>and I believe in it so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>MY SKIN TONE,TEXTURE,AND FIRMNESS HAS REALLY IMPROVED SINCE USING.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>but I really like how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works in two days</li>
            <li>A friend of mine are jealous hahahaha, but i share a litle with her</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds .. cosmetic counter stuff to cheapo stuff, thinking none of it would make much of a difference except for moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is very competitive compared to Walmart or Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like the Regenerist  micro-sculpting cream.</li>
            <li>My purchase was delivered on time and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>so i need as much protection on my face as i can get and</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that I actually like the light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I get compliments about my skin all the time thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very stressed out because of the loss of two family members in one year</li>
            <li>I really like this product too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it to much anymore</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but really the sculpture part...just did not see that</li>
            <li>It really hydrates your skin and does not irritate.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Even my dermatologist recommends their products, much to my (and my wallet&#x27;s) delight.  </li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing for your skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles (I bought this product off the adage</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how much smoother my skin looks and feels after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li>Then I tried buying it from Amazon because the price was so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream</li>
            <li>Very irritated with this seller.</li>
            <li>this product has served this purpose very well over the years.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li>so dont&#x27; know if it&#x27;s really a money saver.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Received it in a reasonable amount of time also.</li>
            <li>and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I think this product helps a LOT to smooth and mosturize my skin and keep me looking much younger.</li>
            <li>My hands are much softer and my age spots have diminished.</li>
            <li>A real deal for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who absolutely loves it &amp; will not use anything else.</li>
            <li>it just softens your whole face.</li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Very moisturous product.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have too much wrinkle</li>
            <li>and I absolutely need it before I apply my makeup, helps makeup apply without pulling your skin</li>
            <li>this does not smell or feel like an olay product and has done absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>i have always appreciated feeling like i could trust that</li>
            <li>gave it the two stars for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Skin much smoother-noticable difference in morning</li>
            <li>It lasted almost all winter (3 months) because it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover the face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want too much skin to peel off, and</li>
            <li>Face really looks firmer and silky after a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>I had use this product for about a year now and the results are very visible.</li>
            <li>It comes very close to the results you will get from it.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really feel that this has helped me from getting wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing</li>
            <li>There was a partial plastic wrap on the bottle top.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t yet used this product as frequently/regularly as I eventually plan to.</li>
            <li>i feel uneasy using it as it may not be the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Product came fast &amp; since I have prime I didn&#x27;t pay for shipping .</li>
            <li>I assume it doesn&#x27;t really sink in .I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone else with this condition!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and find it really works for me.  </li>
            <li>and I put in on my neck and chest area daily for a smooth appearance.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any cream is a miracle time reversal, but I really do prefer this one.  </li>
            <li>I like the whole line of Olay products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how much it &#x27;tightens&#x27; my skin</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not seeing much of the advertised effects of it...</li>
            <li>I have to say it does make the face/neck feel and look much &#x27;</li>
            <li>I wanted to puke the whole day, and I got a headache from the smell.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement after using a whole jar.  </li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s working after finishing the whole jar..</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>SO, do I use it on my whole face and neck?</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>I look real.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have much hope for it..</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it a 5 star if there is not that much silicon.</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell how much I like it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>After using for a month straight I saw no change in the overal appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>the sagging around the jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;Since using the Olay Micro Sculpting I have noticed real improvements in days.  </li>
            <li>skin is much smoother and brighter.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well.  </li>
            <li>I have not used it much because of that.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really have any expectations that my wrinkles are going to</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>moisturizer which surpassed some of the very high-end products which sell for as&lt;br /&gt;much as $450.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>It was much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>This cream is really the holy grail.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work as much as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Priced much lower than in stores.  </li>
            <li>Olay has so many types of moisture creams, but for mature skin I recommend this for a night time cream AND a daily moisture cream under makeup.</li>
            <li>My skin looked older,less firm, puffier and didn&#x27;t have that nice glow.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that i can buy such a good product with so low price.</li>
            <li>I have had several people recently comment on how nice my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I had some samples and after using them for nine days, I decided not to open it when if arrived because I think my Regenerist works far better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it once per day for about 6 months (enough to have just run out of my first jar) and it&#x27;s true that within 2-3 weeks, I had noticeably tighter skin.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty dry dehydrated face and can tell a huge difference with all of the Olay products.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and supple and I often hear I don&#x27;t look my age, so it must be doing something right.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice cream, however if your prone to breaking out easily, do not use this because this is what happened to  me</li>
            <li>The price is quite good comparing to other big brands.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item, particularly since it works well and is not expensive compared to many other face creams.</li>
            <li>My wife, Jan, has been using the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream for many years now and would not even consider using any other cream.</li>
            <li>Now, I have my favorite moisturizer delivered to my home every other month, and I never run out.  </li>
            <li>I just perfer the other line better, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>but you will come back to your $300 cream-since ITS WORTH IT!)))</li>
            <li>This is better than the other Regenerist products I use.</li>
            <li>I have used many other skin care products and never had this reaction before.</li>
            <li>There are other much better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li>Products sometimes work better when rotated with other products.</li>
            <li>I have other products from Olay that I love.  </li>
            <li>Great texture, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>so originally i was a big fan of aveeno</li>
            <li>and I remember applying the beautiful pink fluid when I was tall enough to reach on tippy toe to reach for it on my Mom&#x27;s dresser!  </li>
            <li>I love this product of olay than any other...</li>
            <li>Use it with the serum and like it better tan other products on the market.</li>
            <li>This product does better than any other product I have tried.  </li>
            <li>My wrinkles have disappear and my skin is smooth, soft, and dark circle free.</li>
            <li>i received this item initially wrapped in a cellophane, as opposed to receiving it brand new,meaning sealed &amp; stored in its original box.</li>
            <li>The first morning I woke up, my neck seemed to look a little better (this product promises firming by the 5th day).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It tried many other products - nothing came close to the Almay.  </li>
            <li>Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream is the BEST money I&#x27;ve spent on new skincare product in a long, long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to think about what other options and alternatives are available to me, but right now this seems to be working well.</li>
            <li>Nice face cream but a little less perfume would be better.  </li>
            <li>I usually buy my moisturizers of the same amount about once a month, so that is great.</li>
            <li>I have had many positive comments and people always think I look younger than my actual age of 51.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried a large handful of various moisturizers, including some of Olay&#x27;s other items, and they were &#x27;okay&#x27;, but I noticed an almost IMMEDIATE difference when I tried this one!  </li>
            <li>And another thing, I only wear-it at special times, and  as a result</li>
            <li>But most likely its because at a certain age nothing in a jar is actually going to sculpt one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>During a recent special, I ordered a moisturizer that cost $89 a bottle.  </li>
            <li>live a pretty simple life: mostly organic, avoiding GMO when possible, hydrate well and exercise.  </li>
            <li>I am 35 with dry skin and some fine lines.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Olay, for helping those of us starting over in love get back on the scene with confidence.</li>
            <li>I have been an avid Olay user since my early 30s - about 28 years now.  </li>
            <li>I am 48 and a former sun worshiper, so I can also tell a good product that actually works from a lightweight that only someone under 25 would rave about.</li>
            <li>I am not sure of the results this can provide on its own.  </li>
            <li>was not able to use on face.did make nice hand cream.</li>
            <li>This, combined with the overnight sculpting lotion, never fails to leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years and find it as good as some of the more expensive creams.</li>
            <li>This product is hands down my favorite moisturizer out there</li>
            <li>This product is hands down my favorite moisturizer out there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather live with an \\&quot;un-firm\\&quot; jawline than drive him out of the room!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without Olay Regenerist cream!</li>
            <li>There was new puffiness UNDER the bags under my eyes, plus wrinkly sagging on my cheekbones that had never been there before!</li>
            <li>And my neck had NEW wrinkles on it!</li>
            <li>I saw less pores, a more polished look and a smoother wrinkle.  </li>
            <li>my skin is firmer,spots and wrinkles are less noticeable and have a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Some like more, some like less.</li>
            <li>I will most likely look for a different product.</li>
            <li>I can say for a fact that what you do in your youth determines how your skin looks when you get older.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night mainly.</li>
            <li>so their skin is different and that&#x27;s why they see quick results</li>
            <li>wanted to see if I could actually change the condition of my skin, and have skin that was permanently line free and soft.  </li>
            <li>did some more research to see if there is some way to actually change your skin so that it is younger looking permanently.  </li>
            <li>I have been religious about applying sunscreen everyday before I go outside as well as a good diet and enough exercise, which all help:)  </li>
            <li>Although the Olay website recommended the Total Effects line for my skin, I like the Regenerist line much better (after trying out the Total Effects).  </li>
            <li>The last jar came from a deep discount store and was $6.00 more not including taxes.  </li>
            <li>problem with silicone (and this product in particular) is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, only takes a tiny bit</li>
            <li>If anything I looked older because of patches of dryness.</li>
            <li>The cream texture is soft and smooth, and it stays the same on you face.</li>
            <li>In a short time it has helped me to have smooth and clear skin.</li>
            <li>I have never had any particular skin sensitivities before.</li>
            <li>I realize all skin types are different and interact differently with different products.l&#x27;pp  &amp;#34; I have always had good skin with the occasional blemish right before that time of the month.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product twice, but I could tell a difference the very first time that I applied it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very hydrating and keep the skin moist for a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;It works as a day cream as well, if I am not putting on extra sunscreen on top of that and just stay indoors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend only using it under your eyes and barely any anywhere else if you&#x27;re young, because this will caused me to have more breakouts.</li>
            <li>I only use it in the mornings and within a few days of the first use I saw nice improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have normal skin, it is good anywhere from 35 yrs old to late 40s into 50s.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything even those high priced named brands.....</li>
            <li>It is a very light scrub; without harsh scrubbing particles.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone ...</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li>This is high quality cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller to all, Cheers 🍻 Bex</li>
            <li>High quality product well priced</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this moisturizer and I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li>with high concentrations of all the nutrients Dr. Oz talked about.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recomend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>the s&amp;h on this one is particularly high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>When I moved to the mountains, the dry air really seemed to take its toll on my skin (I was used to living in much more humid climates), so I changed from the Olay 7-in-1 Total Effects to this cream (between the dryness and aging, needed a little more help).  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea, sensitive skin with blackheads, large pores, oily skin.</li>
            <li>Clearly helps skin and refreshes it!!</li>
            <li>I mostly use the micro sculpting cream at night as it is a little heavier than the DNA Superstructure cream with sunscreen I use during the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited for long term results!</li>
            <li>After work I washed my face and discovered many little hives on my cheeks that itched like there was no tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>Under my eyes looks better too, a little firmer</li>
            <li>Why do all these lesser costing products have sooo much perfume!?!</li>
            <li>so I use kojic soap to get rid of my pigmentation scars and sun tan and as this soap really makes my skin super dry</li>
            <li>In other reviews I&#x27;ve read, people have noted that it has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>A little about myself: I&#x27;m 40 and have recently (intentionally) lost over 30 pounds, have had a stressful last six months, and have an expressive face (I wrinkle my eyebrows a lot).</li>
            <li>really make a difference with my *old* skin.</li>
            <li>If they come out with a fragrance free version, I&#x27;ll be a lifelong user.</li>
            <li>I really like this product so far.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on my sensitive skin and wake up with refreshed skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not upset that Olay Regenerist did nothing to help the small fine lines I have since most products don&#x27;t do that at all, but the breakouts and dry patches, etc. is unacceptable and hopefully will go away.</li>
            <li>It works great, but was getting expensive.  </li>
            <li>It can really moisture my sensitive without feeling greasy, and it won’t leave any stains on the pillow.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 85-year old Mom, and she told me she really likes it.</li>
            <li>Will never stray again, which means a lot from someone who rarely purchases the same beauty product twice.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have pimple normally.</li>
            <li>Normally I prefer a retinol cream by Neutrogena</li>
            <li>Only laugh lines are allowed :</li>
            <li>I looked mostly at 5 star reviews and a few 4 star.  </li>
            <li>and I normally can not do this with</li>
            <li>The laugh lines on my face have been dramatically softened and my overall skin texture has improved dramatically as well.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles at this point, but I do have a few.</li>
            <li>Within a few days, I can tell how much better her skin looks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few night face creams from the drugstore, and this one is definitely my favorite -</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday and always buy it from Amazon as the price is better than even my membership store.</li>
            <li>You get your moneys worth with this cream...bought for mom who is 55 and people cannot believe her age because her skin is smooth and soft with few lines.  </li>
            <li>The cream is thick and luxurious and smoothes on nicely</li>
            <li>I am very skeptical about beauty products in general and even more when they claimed to help with wrinkles and un_even skin color; but I have to admitt my face returned to the way is used to be before pregnant, better</li>
            <li>many of wrinkles are gone on the test subject area!</li>
            <li>I now live in San Antonio and the moisture seems heavy at times but my neck and chest love it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this cream after reading many very good reviews and was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Most of them make me break out, leave me to dry or oily, or simply don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>So when I use the cream, I put it on my entire face and neck EXCEPT right under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I can say that after 35+ years of gazing at her angelic countenance, whatever she is doing, she&#x27;s doing it right, and this product has always been a requirement of her daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>This worked even better than the plain argan oil.</li>
            <li>Since Olay creams are sold for much less in many countries, it explains why this is available for so much less.</li>
            <li>After selling many different skin care lines for many years and experimenting with others I&#x27;ve learned not to try to do too much of a dramatic change to the skin at once and peel a lot of layers off.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, but, at the same time, is deeply penetrating and helps to replace the natural soft feel of a more youthful complexion.</li>
            <li>My sister absolutely raves about this product and said the same as many reviewers, that she read a consumer report that states that this product is better than the expensive products.      </li>
            <li>My mum has used this for a few years, and it works really well in reducing the fine lines.</li>
            <li>But I have to say, it does have pretty decent instant effects.  </li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars, but it is STRONG, so down to 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>I was afraid it would smell like that yucky pink lotion my mom used in the 70s, but it is nothing like that at all, very light, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>After you apply it to your face for a while, your face will feel smooth and moist, not greasy and sticky like some other creams.</li>
            <li>My mother used the original pink Olay cream.</li>
            <li>I purchased the product with other two regenerist products: regenerist cream cleanser and regenesit serum fragance free day cream.</li>
            <li>They will swear it is only done when no other means available, but how is that true when other cosmetic companies DON&#x27;T test on animals?      </li>
            <li>And, naturally, I think it makes my skin look a little more perky.  </li>
            <li>(Would anybody like to buya new, unused, jar?)</li>
            <li>Well, I forgot i was trying a new product and reapplied it after</li>
            <li>I have been implicating some new exfoliation techniques though, which could be the source.</li>
            <li>I need a new one about every six months.</li>
            <li>I will report any new changes to my  skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a new product for me.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live with out this product for my skin</li>
            <li>All the magazines say a Micro-sculpting cream is the new &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; product</li>
            <li>(thank god I didn&#x27;t put any of it around my eyes since I didn&#x27;t trust a new product yet).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new jar today.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t swear to you that it gets rid of wrinkles, but I can tell you that it helps to prevent new ones from daring to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also noticed new clogged pores resulting in white-headed milia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have moved on to try a new product.</li>
            <li>I decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t nearly as pronounced and my smile lines don&#x27;t appear as deeply ridged.  </li>
            <li>My make-up rides on top of the products with absolutely no problem (Estee Lauder Double Wear)</li>
            <li>People who don&#x27;t know how old I am are always surprised to find out my real age.</li>
            <li>I have sun damaged skin on my neck from too much sun worship as a teen and this product really improved the look of my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I use mainly unscented products, I was also surprised by the strength of the scent.  </li>
            <li>would love to find a commercial cream with proven ingredients that just sinks in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to my Olay 7-in-One Fragrance Free Moisturizer, which has kept my wrinkles from increasing for two years, and makes my older wrinkles look less obvious, and my foundation goes on smoothly and without getting into creases.</li>
            <li>BEEN USING THIS FOR A LONG, LONG - LOVE IT</li>
            <li>before long I did not know what my skin really needed!!.</li>
            <li>It has a heavenly texture, subtle, but very nice smell and has maintained my facial skin to the point most people find it hard to believe I am 59.</li>
            <li>If perfumes generally do not bother you than you&#x27;ll likely be fine with it.     </li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and use this as a night cream.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Thank you very much, will definitely buy from you again.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this cream is a life saver.</li>
            <li>I believe this happens when a product gets very old.</li>
            <li>HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li>it made my skin feel very soft and somewhat firmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and velvety on my skin, I also like the scent it has nothing chemically.</li>
            <li>Its a very rich, thick cream that feels like it really moisturizes without leaving residue nor an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>I have better results with plain old coconut oil and using baking soda to wash my face.</li>
            <li>this time, it&#x27;s in a plain collapsible RED box, the kind you buy at a craft store,and the jar still wrapped in cellophane.</li>
            <li>I use very little moisturizer now because my skin is so much more supple after using the Regenerist.</li>
            <li>You only need a little of this cream so it should last a good while.</li>
            <li>At first, I also had some trouble with a breakout after using it, but this passed quickly once my skin adjusted.</li>
            <li>Olay offers other good skin creams for much less than this one, I&#x27;ll stick to those.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 47, very fair skin, only a few small wrinkles, or I guess they&#x27;re called \\&quot;laugh lines\\&quot;--except who actually laughs at getting wrinkles?--not prone to blemishs/acne etc.</li>
            <li>I had done\\&quot; because my skin was so clear!    </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hispanic, dark hair, light skin and in my 30s.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m not sure this cream is any better than Regenerist Nightly Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The first night I used it I felt quite a bit of stinging on my face, but I left it on.</li>
            <li>and I usually do not have any acne.</li>
            <li>If you have the same skin type, be aware of it.</li>
            <li>and of course as many of you I was attracted to the recent ads, claiming that Regenerist is better than all expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I apply this product daily, then apply a thin layer of Olay Night Recovery Cream on top to keep my skin moist and comfortable all day.  </li>
            <li>I have used Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream for a few years and most people are surprised to find out how old I am.</li>
            <li>I like this product, usually use this at night before going to bed and thinks it helps to make my skin look better.</li>
            <li>Try another cream; this one is cheap but not worth it.</li>
            <li>or I should say young!</li>
            <li>My mom swore by oil of Olay and when she passed at 87years young her skin was glowing !</li>
            <li>It took me a long time of trying different skincare products and different combinations of things, and I&#x27;ve finally found my personal routine - and it works great.  </li>
            <li>The Mary Kay product and this product are the exact same price...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed in the month since I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer that my fine lines appear less visible.</li>
            <li>I am 41 and began a consistent face moisturizing regime about ten years ago.  </li>
            <li>that has natural plant oils (9!)</li>
            <li>When I first tried this product, I woke up the next morning with milia dotting my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>and first came upon this one at a Sam&#x27;s Club when I actually had the money to buy it.</li>
            <li>i love olay products and usually can see and feel a difference within days.</li>
            <li>, My skin is so soft!.</li>
            <li>All my lines in my face are softened up so much you can barely tell they are there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second jar of this and the serum which goes on first.</li>
            <li>I love how my face feels after using this cream for the past month.</li>
            <li>It helps in many ways that are unbelievable.</li>
            <li>noticeable results pretty quickly on regular skin, non-oily, non-dry..</li>
            <li>I tried many other face creams and I always go back to this product.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines were finer and less noticable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use it now, although I&#x27;m very careful to use the cream only at night and another, noncollagenic moisturizer by day.  </li>
            <li>The perfume is a little too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>These past few years, however,  I noticed that my &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; were becoming deeper and my smile lines seemed more etched into my face with dry ridges.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It may work for the older ladies who seek younger looking skin or even people my age who have drier skin than I who are looking to prevent aging skin, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly scented and initially soothing, this cream can also be put on over other (at least partially absorbed) skin products.  </li>
            <li>It does plump up my facial lines and wrinkles, and minimizes them better than any other drugstore wrinkle cream I have used so far.</li>
            <li>While my skin was soft, I was still experiencing break outs, so I searched for a new option.</li>
            <li>my skin looks refreshed new and young again.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a moisturizer for a long time, this was right under my nose</li>
            <li>I would like to have the crows feet disappear (especially since they are very light as is) and have the  lines around my mouth and forehead become less visible.</li>
            <li>I never would have purchased an Oil of Olay product from a drugstore, but due to the positive feedback I saw on the Amazon website, I took a chance, and I&#x27;m not sorry.</li>
            <li>Most cleansers make my skin break out(same with moisturizers too), but this whole line of products are strong enough to keep my skin looking young and fresh, without it being heavy or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are completely gone, the deeper lines are not as long or as deep, and are almost unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>The first few days were fine and all of a sudden my face had a reaction.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine what it will look like after continual usage and will come back for and update when I am done with a full jar.  </li>
            <li>It is not very thick or oily so it can be used for both day and night use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product -- especially when the company offers a very generous rebate.  </li>
            <li>tried this product after using a similar product from Mary Kay, hands down Olay is better.  </li>
            <li>I was using another product which worked fine but was a little pricey</li>
            <li>if this is a fake product or what the problem is but about 10 minutes after I applied this moisturizer bought from Amazon, my face turned bright red and started feeling hot, burning, and itching.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned above - I get very nervous using new products and start in baby steps.</li>
            <li>First application, I noticed a slight tingly sensation and thought it was because the lotion was working (also the scent is pretty over-powering) ...</li>
            <li>so if your looking for something that will help firm and minimize wrinkles and not harsh on the skin and easy to find ...</li>
            <li>It does have a semi-heavy scent blast that hits you when you put the first smear on, but it is not overwhelming and it seems to disipate quickly.  </li>
            <li>Over the last 40 yrs I&#x27;ve been  a Revlon wholesale rep, an individual Mary Kay rep, and a long-ago Olay loyal -- they all have comparable products to this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Suitable for everyday use for normal, dry, and combination skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent: I&#x27;m very particular about the way products smell, especially when I put them on my face.</li>
            <li>and I have a few fine lines under my eyes and one on my forehead.</li>
            <li>My large pores around my nose are smaller too.</li>
            <li>(They can only sell up to a certain strength without a prescription.)</li>
            <li>A tube packaging it not at flashy chic looking but very sound at keeping the product fresh.</li>
            <li>Her face is a little sensitive, so she tried a lot of cream, which doesn&#x27;t fit her.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to say that about my skin since it tends to look dull and lifeless.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it seems to leave a weird sticky film that just sits on top of your skin, which I didn&#x27;t particularly like but was willing to put up with.</li>
            <li>After reading so many great reviews and a few bad ones, I wanted to give this cream a try and see how it worked for me.  </li>
            <li>and my younger loveO wants to keep me looking and feeling young.</li>
            <li>I stopped using both; let my face clear and began again with just the cream.</li>
            <li>So, I stopped using the cream; let my face clear and started using the serum (alone).</li>
            <li>So, I stopped using the cream; let my face clear and started using the serum (alone).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;n in my early 20s and only ever get maybe 3 zits at a time on my face, so this was extremely unusual for me.</li>
            <li>&quot; It has been nearly one month since I began using this product</li>
            <li>My skin is a bit sensitive and I have had acne.  </li>
            <li>I think that maybe this product is not for those with sensitive skin or are/have been prone to break outs.  </li>
            <li>Replaced it with Olay Pro-X which does a better job...at least for me.</li>
            <li>think my skin had to cycle through and turnover old cells (and purge itself of oil and debris)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to fragrances</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>and it still leaves my skin looking and feeling soft with out the allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>The cream is not for sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble with this cream at all.  </li>
            <li>I am 18 and bought this cream to start preventing aging early on.</li>
            <li>Too busy fighting acne flair ups.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It also really irritated my eyes especially at night time.</li>
            <li>I always woke up with sensitive eyes and crusties.</li>
            <li>Can you say \\&quot;Class Action</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t smoke, no heavy drinking and  </li>
            <li>if you are sensitive to scents you will want to pass this product up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 54 year old woman and my skin is so soft, firm and wrinkle free from using this cream.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>I have always looked young for my age</li>
            <li>Face feels so soft.</li>
            <li>(silky soft).  </li>
            <li>it leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily/acne/breakout prone skin and this product</li>
            <li>I am 32 years old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>yes I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s but from reading those comments</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, so I got a pigmentation spots:    </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and I use this twice a day.</li>
            <li>Im 36y old and</li>
            <li>I am so surprised to see the results and quality for product.</li>
            <li>my skin is sensitive and acne prone and this cream doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li>not for teens or early twenties...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53 and refusing to grow old gracefully.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 20s</li>
            <li>far as improving wrinkles, I cannot comment on that for I do not have any.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have no reaction to this project.</li>
            <li>I also broke out from this product but my skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 years old....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given it to my daughter and niece who are in their early 20&#x27;s and early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Only been using this product for about 2 weeks, but it is very moisturizing, and does seem to somewhat &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; my face temporarily.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be sensitive to face creams.</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars only because it did provide some moisture and didn&#x27;t break me out as much as some products have.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for all women, start young and keep the skin young.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years, I am 70 years old, and people ask me &amp;#34;why don&#x27;t you have any wrinkles?  </li>
            <li>It reduces a lot the signs of age, I higly recommend to everybody over 40 years old</li>
            <li>I found an all natural vegan product that I now use faithfully.</li>
            <li>I really do feel like I see a difference in my skin tone and evenness when I use this, but it has a tendency to leave a white residue after awhile.  </li>
            <li>I have lightly oily skin, and this cream is still not too heavy.</li>
            <li>It is SO silky and soft.</li>
            <li>But the Mary Kay has a whole 3 oz&#x27;s where as this only has 1.7 oz&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product if you think your skin is the slightest bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>People think that my 50 year old son is my husband.  </li>
            <li>Those products aren&#x27;t nearly as fragrant as the Micro cream.  </li>
            <li>Might work for people that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy moisturizer</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that it does a lot as far as &amp;#34;sculpting&amp;#34; is concerned .</li>
            <li>My face is so soft in the mornings.</li>
            <li>But my skin is a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>It works so well on my 50+ skin and makes it feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>This cream leaves my skin soft and fills out wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone who wants younger skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin to the point where the majority of products do not work for me in drug stores</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive combination 20-something year old skin</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The chapter on skin was enlightening - our skin needs basicvitamins (A, B, C, E), omega 3&#x27;s and fatty acids to keep it healthy and build the collagen and elastin that keep it firm and young looking.  </li>
            <li>If you have oily or sensitive skin, beware.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy or too light.</li>
            <li>But as far as it working, no.</li>
            <li>and I use it 2X&#x27;s a day, but as far as any difference when I look in the mirror, not seeing that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just too old ??</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the old label to confirm it</li>
            <li>IT MAKES MY SKIN SO SOFT  </li>
            <li>As far as the regenerating and micro-sculpting goes will have to use it longer.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and not oily</li>
            <li>You should think twice about using this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by the affect.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels much smoother and younger than before.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, but I haven&#x27;t had any problem after finishing almost one jar.</li>
            <li>and most people think I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to spend much money on facial creams...</li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and does not cause problems with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m too young for this stuff .i</li>
            <li>Recommended by an old lady with wrinkles....</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels much smoother and younger than before.</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old</li>
            <li>At age 75 it makes my face feel young and is definetly softening.</li>
            <li>But so far, when I use this I encounter no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be trying these old favorites on my neck, which I&#x27;d never thought of doing.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the price.</li>
            <li>I often get comments about how clear and soft my skin appears.</li>
            <li>I even have my 30 yr old daughter using it.</li>
            <li>Never too young to start taking care of your face.</li>
            <li>Within a week of using this skin on my cheek bones developed cracks and started flaking.</li>
            <li>In winter my face (especially cheek area) is much drier</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I am early thirties and have used this product for about a month.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit 35 is not that young anymore.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
            <li>For a guy in his early 40, this face cream works</li>
            <li>This cream kept my face soft and hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so was worried about break outs, but had no problems at all.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the nicer face creams that Olay offers.</li>
            <li>So far I have not seen any noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 years old.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel old.</li>
            <li>Recently, I developed a sensitivity to the product and had to stop using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair-skinned 51 year old Arizona native that spends a lot of time outdoors</li>
            <li>I am probably just sensitive to something in this cream</li>
            <li>but the money spent is WELL worth it.</li>
            <li>Apparently the formula for the exact same product varies depending on the manufacturing location.</li>
            <li>It was as good as expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and always had a problem with choosing the right moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Now my old standby doesn&#x27;t even work right, it feels different, smells different and also bothers my skin now so something has changed with it.</li>
            <li>Skin feels softer, less dry, and I swear it gets rid of fine wrinkles, just as it said it would (I never believe advertising, but this seems to work!).</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this product I felt a little tingling which I read is normal.</li>
            <li>like I have you will find Olay Regenerist in the top 10 of all other moisturizers along with the most expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Truly a let down, especially with the really strong scent for a cream.</li>
            <li>Although it made my skin feel smooth after I use it I get the same result with other products.</li>
            <li>believe this cream holds its own against the other face products that I use, which include the Victoria Principal line, the Olay line, and the Seacret line (in the malls, from the Dead Sea).</li>
            <li>but inside the jar was half full.</li>
            <li>This (and the other Olay products) seem to be worth your time and money.  </li>
            <li>This (and the other Olay products) seem to be worth your time and money.  </li>
            <li>I have forehead wrinkles and they are significantly reduced after a few uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to say whether it&#x27;s effective because I found the scent so strong and so irritating</li>
            <li>Most of my new friend thought I was only in the late forties.</li>
            <li>I have been using this around my eyes for months and not one small difference to the fine wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Not sure I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in the fine lines or elasticity but will continue to apply this morning and night because I trust Olay with my skin care.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years and think it is better and less expensive than many brands.</li>
            <li>I was pretty sad when I thought that I would have to give up one of my favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I need more skin damage to actually see a change</li>
            <li>I feel that I don&#x27;t look much older than I did five or ten years ago.  </li>
            <li>I was only recently introduced to this product (am still finishing up my first jar).  </li>
            <li>This is the third or fourth jar that I have had, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it from Amazon, and Amazon&#x27;s price is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product many times in the past from local stores.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m signing up for the S&amp;S on amazon - which makes it super affordable and less than 20 buck for a cream that outperforms the ones sold at my counter</li>
            <li>I have used Olay products for years &amp;amp; recently started using this particular product when Olay discontiinued the Divinity line.  </li>
            <li>I have used Regenerist in the past and it made my skin blemish free and soft.  </li>
            <li>I definitely plan to continue using this product and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I  am a big fan of the Regenerist line and highly recommend Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend that you use the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash, as aforementioned.  </li>
            <li>would not buy this product again, very disappointed,didn&#x27;t live up to what was expected of this product, what was advertised</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my skin feel much less dry and much more soft!  </li>
            <li>, I noticed a major break out over my nose on my chin, even on my cheeks!  </li>
            <li>I have used everything from super expensive to cheap.</li>
            <li>someone puts in a scathing review against a product based on their own ill-health or over-sensitivity, ignore it!</li>
            <li>The scent is like a cheap drier sheet, I just couldn&#x27;t get past it.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole Regenerist system not that long ago but immediately returned it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth, and I think its claim to firm up saggy skin is at least partially justified.</li>
            <li>My budding wrinkles have already started fading away while my skin in general has evened out in color...</li>
            <li>Usually just a skin pH balancer, sun screen and/or light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I will say though, at first the Micro Sculpting Cream can seem a bit greasy but its really not.</li>
            <li>It took me three weeks to get back to my normal skin after I stopped using this cream.</li>
            <li>After using it a couple of times, I realized that it wasn&#x27;t much different than my normal 7 in 1 moisturizer..</li>
            <li>I think it has a nice, but faint fragrance, and since I am not able to tolerate SPF around the eyes and am also sensitive to many types of facial sunscreen, I appreciate that I can put my SPF where i want.</li>
            <li>(after always using my old standby Olay regular for sensitive skin that&#x27;s been around forever --which, also seems to have changed now!).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
            <li>Just within a week my skin was back to normal.</li>
            <li>After washing my face felt squeaky clean but not dry or tight.</li>
            <li>I am 28 and don&#x27;t have real signs of aging besides some faint smile lines and forehead crinkles, but prevention is the key, right!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very moisturizing but a little much for the summer.</li>
            <li>but I found other more natural creams that work and don&#x27;t include the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results: I can&#x27;t say that it has actually prevented any wrinkles, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones since I started using it.</li>
            <li>I live in a desert climate and it&#x27;s moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li>Great to use year round; enough to keep skin hydrated in the dry winter and not too heavy in the sticky summer</li>
            <li>Just work it in to your skin gently and let it dry.</li>
            <li>It really helps dry skin.</li>
            <li>It was for my wife - I am simply here to let you know that this was MUCH cheaper than at my local stores.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the anti-aging properties of this product as I have been using it for only 3 days and in my late twenties I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles to complain about.</li>
            <li>After using, our skin are not dry and feel soft and tendered.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be worth the price for less than $20.</li>
            <li>and I find it to be as good, if not better, than the Orlane products I was buying for the past 25 years.  </li>
            <li>I use Shiseido Future Solution LX Night Cream ($220) and this cream does not even come close to what it claims (as good as $500 creams), it can&#x27;t even match Shiseido&#x27;s which is 1/2 as expensive.</li>
            <li>Also, after the third straight night I applied, my skin became really sensitive to the product causing redness as well as minor breakouts</li>
            <li>but nothing major.  </li>
            <li>Product caused major acne in all areas</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to my old lightweight night moisturizer from Neutrogena Naturals, and both of these things (thank goodness!)</li>
            <li>The Microsculpting Cream is a rich cream that doesn&#x27;t go on heavy, but has just enough moisturization for my combination skin without being too much or leaving my skin too dry.  </li>
            <li>Since I have a mild case of rosacea, I put a thin layer of Finacea lotion (from my dermatologist) on first, then the Regenerist Cream.  </li>
            <li>This did nothing for me, I have dry skin and have to moisturize several times a day, this dried out my skin even more and did nothing for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I keep trying other brands, but keep coming back to this  as it firms my jawline and decreases my laugh lines.</li>
            <li>Used it every morning and night before going to bed, and by the time I was starting my 2nd bottle, I was getting compliments from friends and colleagues regarding how vibrant my face</li>
            <li>I have tried other moisturizers and come right back to Olay Regenerist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and it works as well as the high priced facial creams.</li>
            <li>You need just a little bit to cover your whole face and it does last the whole day.  </li>
            <li>Seems all the Oil of Olay line works well fro me generally.</li>
            <li>Generally I like the Olay Regenerist line.</li>
            <li>but I generally use it alone.  </li>
            <li>Well...the only reason for me to write this review- just to make clear to High-end users-</li>
            <li>So I am a no fuss, barely any product girl who is 26.  </li>
            <li>am looking for results, not fluff.</li>
            <li>EVERY time I am using it, my skin breaks in bumps, next morning it feel very greasy and definitely not refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to make my story short-</li>
            <li>I am only mentioning it because I understand that some people are sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly 50 and my facial lines were getting too noticeable.</li>
            <li>Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to something in it.  </li>
            <li>I mainly got this because I&#x27;ve had dry skin this winter, saw this as a Lightning Deal, and figured I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>I will probably stick with Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive daily moisturizing cream, since it worked well and did not irritate my face.</li>
            <li>I am 60 and the firmness of my jawline was starting to grow soft.</li>
            <li>Apparently that&#x27;s not me.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and this product has definitely improved my skin and I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>it was this product causing the sudden acne all over my face, and it completely wreaked havoc on my skin.</li>
            <li>it was the #1 anti aging cream and now in my early forties, I&#x27;m looking into different formulas to help with cellular turnover and wrinkle prevention.</li>
            <li>The shine is back, feels soft, and all that flakiness, blemish is gone.</li>
            <li>My skin looks nowhere near my actual age.  </li>
            <li>It smoothed my skin overnight, left it silky and soft.</li>
            <li>The product I received was different in texture, consistency and fragrance and the packaging was different from what I normally purchase in stores.</li>
            <li>I like this, it is thick and smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use allot and rub the serum into where the wrinkles are the most pronounced and then thinly apply the cream all over.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a creamy compound and goes on to your skin silky smooth, not greasy or too thick.</li>
            <li>But out of frustration thinking it would get better it just got worse.</li>
            <li>I think the aloe in it has helped calm my skin down and it doesn&#x27;t look as red as it used to.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who has noticeable wrinkles or fine lines, dark blemishes or circles due to aging skin.</li>
            <li>When we at  [...] read in Consumer Reports that Olay&#x27;s new line of products was one of only two which actually reduced the appearance of wrinkles, our jaws hit the floor and we raced to the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I was trying to decide between this and some other high end products (estee lauder, clinique), but so far this is working for me</li>
            <li>What it finally came down to was something that was adequately moisturizing but not greasy, and above all, non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>It has the right balance of moisture without feeling too greasy or heavy on my skin.  </li>
            <li>While laying in a hospital bed for a month, my skin dried out and I really looked ten years older.</li>
            <li>I am currently serving in Afghanistan and the climate here is pretty extreme.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to spread around your face with a small amount so that it isn&#x27;t greasy and you don&#x27;t waste it.  </li>
            <li>Signing up for automatic shipments saves you money and very convenient that can&#x27;t be beat in any other venue.</li>
            <li>Wash face (nose area) lightly for 10-15 seconds with a 1\\&quot; sponge and a very small amount of Dove moisturizing soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to put too much on my face due to perfumes being added to product.  </li>
            <li>I like other Olay products, but this one will be trashed...or given away to whomever wants it.</li>
            <li>I like that it is not expensive (which I have tried many expensive creams with not much difference).</li>
            <li>it is equally  high quality and effective when compared to the very expensive creams at the beauty shops and at the  dermatologist office</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and this seems to help.</li>
            <li>I live in a tropical climate so my skin isn&#x27;t terribly dry to begin with</li>
            <li>It does moisturize well...and the areas look better with use, but nothing dramatic.  </li>
            <li>I tend to get dry and oily at the same time on different areas of my face and this really helps balance it.</li>
            <li>My only complaint about Olay is the fact that they are highly fragranced and that really seems to irritate my sensitive acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I normally have very dry skin</li>
            <li>I usually am allergic to most facial creams, cheap ones expensive ones</li>
            <li>It was after one of my annual 12+ hours non-stop flights that normally made me look at least 5 years older thanks to the dry air and lack of sleep.</li>
            <li>It thick and applies easily and keeps my skin hydrated for a long time.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed my complexion looks brighter and lots of my dark spots from acne and sun damage are gone or very faded.</li>
            <li>I still like it over some other brands I tried lately, but I started looking again because this cream seem to have a lot more silicon in it now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a product that I trust, especially for my sensitive skin, but over the years, when the economy occasionally took a toll on our purse strings, I found that I would use the product super-sparingly to make it last longer.  </li>
            <li>but I notice small wrinkles around my eyes (crows feet) and what I would call creases around my mouth (laugh lines?) and a line that goes across my forehead (an expression line).</li>
            <li>I am anxious to see what a week&#x27;s worth of use will do.</li>
            <li>I, like many other reports here, got bad breakouts mostly in the form of closed pimples that don&#x27;t come to a head or go away, milia, dark spots, and puffy eyes (pretty low away from the eyes</li>
            <li>My face felt a little red and irritated for the first week</li>
            <li>IN FACT I&#x27;VE HAD MORE LITTLE BREAKOUT PATCHES THEN USUAL.  </li>
            <li>I no longer see them for this particular product, or the coupons I do see have to be combined with an Olay product I&#x27;m not interested in.</li>
            <li>Try googling \\&quot;steroids\\&quot; to see if you would want the potential side effects of a destroyed immune system, potential emotional breakdown, ER admissions, gaining 65 lbs and a whole menu of lifelong complications.  </li>
            <li>This is alright if you&#x27;re on  a budget when comparing other high costing creams.</li>
            <li>And besides that you are not paying the high prices that come with other creams.</li>
            <li>and I remember looking in the mirror and was shocked to notice that my skin looked great than it had in a long time.</li>
            <li>This cream really helps me around the eyes, I&#x27;m much less wrinkled than my peers.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eye was always so dry and sensitive in the winter before I started using Olay.</li>
            <li>Real improvements typically take time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may just be me,but I didn&#x27;t understand why it was soo much cheaper,as I paid less than 12.00</li>
            <li>I read a book by Dr. Oz that talks about what your body needs to stay young as long as possible.</li>
            <li>After several months of using both together along with the retinol products (not every day!), I noticed that lines were almost gone, and now, after a year, I barely have any lines on my forehead or around my eyes - even when I miss my daily skin</li>
            <li>Since this is a time sensitive product -- I haven&#x27;t had it or used it long enough to share results.  </li>
            <li>I use the Watts Beauty first, and then apply this Oil of Olay cream a few minutes later.  </li>
            <li>My skin is starting to have the smooth, even texture it used to have and those little wrinkles seem to be less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I have a dry skin and a little bit sensitive, but this bottle really surprises me.</li>
            <li>Once I purchased this cream which happened to be in the winter, my sore red sensitive dry skin immediately felt saturated with moisture without any stinging or acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>For reference: I&#x27;m 30, have VERY OILY skin, with no significant aging yet.</li>
            <li>It may be a little too creamy for oily skin tones or if your living in really humid climates.</li>
            <li>I like a little scent but not this much.  </li>
            <li>I personally didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in this product vs. the other anti wrinkle creams I have purchased in the past for a much cheaper cost.</li>
            <li>food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very careful with trying out new products on my face.</li>
            <li>I do not believe Olay can make a bad product I use a lot of their line,it feels so good on your skin</li>
            <li>This product has helped so much to literally reduce considerably the negative affects of my condition.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I had used this before and was happy to find it at a good price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This cream is really nice!  </li>
            <li> imagine what it can do for someone with nice skin!</li>
            <li> Great for fading forehead lines, and good for firming the jawline too.</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses Olay products knows this is one of the best:)</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, the BEST, most affordable moisturizer on the planet.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and I am happy to be able to continue using it!</li>
            <li> Good to use, and the customer services is also very kind</li>
            <li> Nice to get at a good cost.....always a very good thing.</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant sent.</li>
            <li> I agreed, but I find it thicker and not as pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> this cream is especially good on my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area, but a great night cream, full face as well.</li>
            <li> WHAT A GREAT PRICE FOR A CREAM THAT I LOVE!  </li>
            <li> That being said, Oil of Olay smells just fine and works great!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any results with reducing fine lines yet, but I&#x27;m hoping for the best.  </li>
            <li> that was a great buy,and the  cream was great love it.</li>
            <li> The product feels good on my skin, altho</li>
            <li> Price and delivery were too good.</li>
            <li> It has kept my aging skin fairly wrinkle-free.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT..BE NICE IF THEY COULD UNISEX-UP THE SCENT</li>
            <li> I preface this review by saying that I&#x27;ve been using night cream for years and have fairly good skin (except for the areas around my eyes).  </li>
            <li> I am told by people that \\&quot;I look good for my age\\&quot; (30&#x27;s rather than 40&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> I paired this with the regenerist cleanser and get superior results.</li>
            <li> Another tip with using this product: try using this cream on your feet after a pedicure - it will make your feet look and feel SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> Is it as good as a $150 face cream?  </li>
            <li> It feels good going on.  </li>
            <li> Good price for this product.  </li>
            <li> Imagine how delighted I was when I discovered the subscription price on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> This is a good cream, it does work, but I perfer my Pro-X.  </li>
            <li> But if there&#x27;s a day I don&#x27;t want to wear foundation, or I&#x27;m having a particularly good \\&quot;skin</li>
            <li> I had used that for years, then this summer saw an article in Vanity Fair magazine about this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use soap on my face because it dries my fair skin out.</li>
            <li> I have never found something like this that felt so good on my face.</li>
            <li> My husband always tells me I smell good after I put it on.</li>
            <li> but this cream gives good moisture to the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have problem skin, and I&#x27;ve always taken good care of it.</li>
            <li> Good job Olay and Thank you.</li>
            <li> During that flight I washed my face with just water then put on a good amount of this cream and repeated for another time.</li>
            <li> all that said, I recommend a good quality face cream, before bed and upon waking.  </li>
            <li> With all that said, I recommend a good quality face cream, before bed and upon waking.  </li>
            <li> It mosturizes well and makes your skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> Good Luck.</li>
            <li> Feels good and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I started looking for a good anti-aging cream as a preemptive measure against wrinkles before it&#x27;s too</li>
            <li> Always a good product.</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist cream is a wonderful, light feeling moisturizer that I use both day and night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I use when I run out of my good stuff.</li>
            <li> so that was good.</li>
            <li> This product is good, subscribe and save is good,</li>
            <li> This is as the reviews suggest a really good cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the neck, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If so, good for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite that good</li>
            <li> and it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> once a week for optimum results.  </li>
            <li> This skin care cream is good to apply to your skin while you sleep</li>
            <li> But this one is good for its price point.</li>
            <li> I have had lots of comments on how good my skin looks</li>
            <li> feels good will buy again</li>
            <li> It feels good under my makeup mornings and nights.  </li>
            <li> Does not seem to be a good product...same ole stuff.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I did not find anything in the drugstore</li>
            <li> And I am always being asked what I do to have my skin look this good.  </li>
            <li> in all, it is good.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE A GOOD VALUE AND WORK</li>
            <li> Got this when it was a good price.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, but did not work well for night cream.  </li>
            <li> this cream is really good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But just to be fair, I don’t like the smell, but I would give it a 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this cream and needed a night creme.</li>
            <li> The Regenerist Micro-Scullpting Cream is a really good bargain.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably just as good as the department store creams.</li>
            <li> but we guess this product is good to prevent.</li>
            <li> It feels so good going on</li>
            <li> I saw the ad from Olay claiming that this cream was as good as $500 creams, so I went and purchased one.</li>
            <li> The one made in the USA is good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is getting good reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> It works just as good as the CHR which cost almost 2x the price of this one.</li>
            <li> Deff a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a good wrinkle cream.  </li>
            <li> My  wife turned me on to this product when I kept wondering how she looked so good .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and it as good as anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I have to be fair, might be made for women&#x27;s skin and works for them.</li>
            <li> not conceited; I inherited my good skin from my mother.  </li>
            <li> so it has a fair chance.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, and it is a good, all purpose moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good stuff at a good price</li>
            <li> Really good night cream.</li>
            <li> Good coalition and price</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> and I thought the cream was going be good for my face</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says it is good stuff.</li>
            <li> It also has a very pleasant smell that is not too strong.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> The cream feels pleasant as you put on, and the skin feels nice after the cream is on.</li>
            <li> So when I purchased this I decided to get both this and the fragrance free version to see which one I liked best.</li>
            <li> If nothing else, it has a wonderfully creamy smooth feel and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love love love the way this makes my skin feel!!!</li>
            <li> price relatively cheap , but quality is very good.</li>
            <li> very good product True to color and a very interesting good product within week</li>
            <li> Got it for a great price here, better than at Costco.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush at night, followed by this cream and my skin looks great, I don&#x27;t know of anything better than this cream</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  </li>
            <li> The advertising is very appealing</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of the cream and was great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go ahead and give this 3 stars because most qualities in this product stand out and are really great..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d raise my eye brows, lower them, and smile because even after lowering my eye brows, there were no visible wrinkles and that made me very happy.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO BE OKAY, BUT I DO NOT SEE ANY GREAT IMPROVEMENT WITH MY SKIN YET.</li>
            <li> Very pleased</li>
            <li> Great product, face always look refreshing.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and my face feels good.</li>
            <li> Nice to get this without having to deal with the lines at Costco for a good value.  </li>
            <li> Great formula with a pleasant scent, moisturizes well and leaves your skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> The Best 100% Pure Skin Restoring Anti-Aging Phytoceramides!]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly confident that my face is smoother and softer now than it was when I was a baby!  </li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many!  </li>
            <li> - I love it too!  </li>

            <li> Love this product and all olay products!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m 38 by the way so great skin is does not come easy at this stage.</li>
            <li> The first two days were wonderful and it made my skin look nice...</li>

            <li> (Absolute is the best in that line), Chanel, Pevonia( for sensetive skin)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it one start for smelling nice and one star for not giving me pimples.  </li>
            <li> Nice bonus.</li>
            <li> The texture is nice and it does help moisturize and doesn&#x27;t seem to break me out.</li>
            <li> This has been a nice substitution.</li>
            <li> ) I was using regenerist night firming cream before and loved it, but wanted something with a bit more oomph?</li>
            <li> I will never buy any product of any kind that contains an animal product or that has been tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I was really looking forward to using this product because the reviews were awesome.  </li>
            <li> But, it leaves a nice feeling on the skin after application.</li>
            <li> After almost three weeks of use, I find nice improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I know it helps when I get those nice compliments from friends.</li>
            <li> There is mica in this moisturizer (which creates a shimmering effect) and that has given my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> AND it does make it feel nice as does their &amp;#34;&amp;#34;Total effects</li>
            <li> B001THPA1C Good Housekeeping (1-year auto-renewal)]] tested it, and said it was better than a $500 cream they also tested.  </li>
            <li> I think my skin looks as good as or maybe even better than when I moved here 2 1/2 years ago.  </li>
            <li> My mom is kind of old-school.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go into all of my trials and errors, here are some of the things I found effective so you can avoid my guinea pig routine.  </li>
            <li> A nice moisturizer</li>
            <li> I found it to be just another nice moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes just as effectively as cheaper options.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer  </li>
            <li> It has a nice feel to it when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in wrinkles, but I don&#x27;t worry about that kind of thing.</li>
            <li> and it was a nice surprise to find</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I do not know, smells nicely.</li>
            <li> I am 60, and my skin still looks nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having no sensitivity reaction, the cream goes on nicely without a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I love the Microgenerist), Olay sometimes has a rebate (a good one) for spending $50 on their products.  </li>
            <li> Nice, premium packaging.</li>
            <li> Switched from aveeno to this bc of the good reviews and boy am I glad I did.</li>

            <li> Makes more sense to buy something with a good retinol in it</li>
            <li> Originally, I didn&#x27;t think this cream was that great.</li>
            <li> well worth it, esp seeing as i cant stop shopping!!!</li>

            <li> and this is the best over-all cream that I have found for keeping my face looking as good as possible.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very strong, so if you cannot handle scented lotion, do not purchase this.</li>
            <li> It goes on very easily and has no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> very strong scent.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  </li>

            <li> This one has a pleasant scent that&#x27;s not too strong and doesn&#x27;t linger, much better than the elmers glue or plastic like smell of unscented lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also impressed that, while this Micro-Sculpting Cream keeps my skin soft and supple, it never leaves a greasy or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> It is so important to use a good cream on your face and</li>
            <li> It has the most amazing silky texture, too.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so smooth and bright .</li>
            <li> This is by far the best over the counter cream I&#x27;ve found on the market.</li>
            <li> Having suffered sun damage over the years I am pleased with how nice my skin  looks.</li>
            <li> But as far as stating that I was completely impressed, I was not..</li>
            <li> The cream just feels really good going on your face, kind of like putting your face on a cool satin pillow.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great price and product :)</li>
            <li> Great compliment to Olay Regenerist Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Soaks right in...not</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Olay Regenerist!  </li>
            <li> I was delighted with the results, I definitely had fewer lines and purchased it at the warehouse club where it was a very good price.</li>
            <li> Such a great product for a great price.  </li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is a great face cream that is wonderful for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Pretty cool, I am impressed</li>
            <li> Most of the people who compliment me are yound women in their early 20&#x27;s who are very beautiful.</li>
            <li> I was able to sensitize my own skin, but you may not be able to.  </li>
            <li> Incredible product, good price, same at Walmart, but here you can use Amazon credit!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product as it has a lot of good reviews and seems well loved.</li>
            <li> So this cream meets my criteria for a good face cream and the price is right!  </li>
            <li> But then, this is my first time using the Olay brand, so who knows, maybe there is a great moisturizer in this line that has SPF.     </li>
            <li> If I could give it 3 1/2 that might be more suitable.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great, and you don&#x27;t need to apply much!</li>
            <li> This is a great cream to use。The price is not expensive also, used in the face is not greasy, very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> Very light, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t oily either and feels very light weight.</li>
            <li> Also, it makes my face feel very smooth and not oily.  </li>
            <li> It makes the cream feel very cheap and substandard.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> and my skin is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am lucky that I have always had good skin, but now I do not.</li>
            <li> It has kept my skin from getting more wrinkles (As I am rather senior) and very smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product is very good on your face, feels nice and refreshing, I use it twice a day, morning and night, I totally recommend this item to everybody.</li>
            <li> Very nice product; keeps my skin nice and soft!</li>
            <li> so make sure you look under the price, it will say clip coupon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for years, love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> I love this product I would give more stars if there were more.</li>
            <li> the price is excellent will definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Love all things &#x27;Olay&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> PETA has a list online of all the companies that test and do not test on animals and there are so many wonderful,natural products out there to choose from that don&#x27;t come to us at another creature&#x27;s expense.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels, how it smells, and the difference it&#x27;s made in my skin.  </li>
            <li> As I continue to apply twice a day, I expect the wrinkles will soften even more.</li>
            <li> I am sure that those that aren&#x27;t may benefit.  </li>
            <li> Nice light scent.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fully absorb into your skin, just sits on top so when it dries, you can rub it off into rubbery flakes.</li>
            <li> CREATED TOO MANY BREAKOUTS IN MY FACE AFTER 3 DAYS OF USE.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best facial cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have gotten more compliments on my skin since using this Olay cream than I ever did before.</li>
            <li> It also has a mild pleasant smell, not to strong at all.</li>
            <li> any more breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise skin looks so much better sijnce I started using.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are products that do an even better job</li>
            <li> I love this Cream just give it a shot, and you will love it too</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels and look.  </li>
            <li> I hope I have better luck.  </li>
            <li> BUT ITS OK..</li>
            <li> STILL AWESOME FOR A VALUE TERRIFIC PRODUCT LINE.</li>
            <li> and after three the change was striking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure Olay Regenerist Microsculpting cream gave me the allergic reaction even tho it does not have fragrance listed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have combo/acne-prone skin, and have tried many moisturizers over the years.  </li>
            <li> NONE have been able to both keep my skin well hydrated and not cause more breakouts, until I found this gem.  </li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m know that there are a lot of products that do a better job and have better ingredients but they will be triple the price.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is a bit raw/sensitive feeling (I notice it mostly during exercising/sweating) or if I use a wash cloth across my face in the morning, but I hope this will cease with continued use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be sure as of yet</li>
            <li> It does moisturize well...and the areas look better with use, but</li>
            <li> I love Olay products and when I viewed the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream, I saw where I could have discounts.  </li>
            <li> Am glad I signed up for Amazon&#x27;s standing order program.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it works for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, more moisturized and smoother.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I just love shopping with you.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> At 62, I swear I have tried everything in the department stores, including Creme de la Mer, and most of what is in the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with it, and will buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Lancome, Lauder, Chanel, Clinique, many others, and with many I had skin irritations, couldn&#x27;t use them and returned them.      </li>
            <li> My skin is ok with most of the face cream.</li>
            <li> I use it as night moisturizer, I love it   </li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer and wrinkle delayer.</li>
            <li> Just love this Olay moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> photos, but, whether I do or don&#x27;t look better</li>
            <li> -- I FEEL better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile and was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love all the products except the regenerating cream.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I tried a jar and love it.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been quite a week yet since using both products, but to me my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> If not, I still love Olay products anyway and will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li> I have read many recommending reviews about the cream</li>
            <li> I have been using LaMer (my favorite), Arden, Lancome</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> So I thought, after I stopped, I could tell that it WAS giving me more of a youthful feel and look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in search for something better....</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> it!I am looking forward to purchaseing more</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> love the cream, lasts forever</li>
            <li> It helps my skin look moist and my makeup to go on better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a firmer, more \\&quot;sculpted\\&quot; appearance to my face having used this product for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for over a year and love the way it feels on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63; most people think I&#x27;m 45.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure as I advance in years</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and most nights.  </li>
            <li> No doubt this is my best facial product,  l have used it for years and will still keep using it...</li>
            <li> and i did notice that my skin feels better in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The lines appear to be minimized and the color appears to be much more healthy and glowing.  </li>
            <li> My skin is usually healthy.</li>
            <li> And, with my skin looking refreshed and dewy, I can go without foundation more often.</li>
            <li> and they love this product as well.</li>
            <li> and I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I recently saw a dermatologist who told me that this is the best product out there.....</li>
            <li> I love the texture, smell and the way it works.  </li>
            <li> Well okay, for firming, this is not it.</li>
            <li> its making wrinkles disappear there too :)</li>
            <li> always use this  love it</li>
            <li> I also wanted to start using something more anti-aging since I just turned 40.</li>
            <li> My face is more hydrated, more toned, it&#x27;s tightened yet more hydrated than its been in ages.</li>
            <li> My redness and scars are evened out more already in just one week.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, it hydrates well</li>
            <li> I love the results.</li>
            <li> Eventually, I started mixing it with my daily moisturizer in order to get the best of both worlds (SPF 30 and moisture) during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This is now the only way I use moisturizer (the micro-sculpting cream paired with the SPF 30/tint oil-free one) and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I use more at night.</li>
            <li> I  love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love Olay products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it works.</li>
            <li> I have used Regenerist moisturizer for many years(when</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for a great product.</li>
            <li> I just love the way this makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a better anti-aging cream than others, but keeping your skin moisturized is the easiest defense against aging.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would have been better than what it was.</li>
            <li> Used for many years.</li>
            <li> and my skin is well moisturized and even more as  </li>
            <li> Regenerist is an OK choice for an inexpensive cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that this works better than $150.00 creams</li>
            <li> With this, skin showed almost immediate improvement - even more with time.  </li>
            <li> After using it now for 4 years, I really believe through Amazon&#x27;s pricing, this is one of the best values on a great product, especially factoring in time saved using their Subscribe &amp; Save plan.</li>
            <li> They just love the texture and fell and</li>
            <li> Works better than more expemnsive ones.</li>
            <li> This cream smells nice and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It has really lessened the crows feet around the eyes and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> give it a try what have u got to lose :)</li>
            <li> Just love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of much better results going this route than to keep using these supposed miracle creams.</li>
            <li> I like the Pro-x  hydra firming cream better than this one</li>
            <li> Feels nice and light on my skin.</li>
            <li> , what more could I say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an okay product.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any better face cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels once applied.</li>
            <li> skin is tighter and more lifted.  </li>
            <li> Lovely cream,  </li>
            <li> I made amistake order to many of them.</li>
            <li> Nice to smooth on my face.</li>
            <li> but it has to be one of the better products I have used.  </li>
            <li> A light fragrance makes it smell nice.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so much better as I use it on the go and at bed time....</li>
            <li> Purchasing at Amazon convenient and price usually better than in stores.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 years, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33, and my skin never has looked better.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to most creams around my eyes, but not Regenerist.  </li>
            <li> but if I try to use more, it balls up.</li>
            <li> --more</li>
            <li> I have used Regenerist Micro Ssculpting for more than 3 years .</li>
            <li> The most acne I have ever had in my life was maybe 3 pimples on my chin at a time.</li>
            <li> Not a terrible product.</li>
            <li> away.&lt;br /&gt;I am comparing apples to oranges, but if you can afford a better product use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product too.</li>
            <li> It has the most pleasing orange scent.</li>
            <li> I love this line of Olay.</li>

            <li> I also love it and the price through your site.  </li>
            <li> just make sure you use an SPF.</li>
            <li> This is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I use this at night although I prefer the serum&#x27;s texture better.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better I&#x27;ve found in my 6 year quest to replace Klinger.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is better than many others I have tried....</li>
            <li> I needed something more, since I&#x27;m now 51.</li>
            <li> my skin was so much better and after 3 days</li>

            <li> it looks more luminous and refined compared to before.</li>
            <li> :) I QUESTION THE SAFETY OF THE PRODUCT, THOUGH, BECAUSE IT IS MADE IN A COUNTRY THAT IS TOXIC AND POLLUTED.  </li>
            <li> WILL NOT BUY AGAIN UNTIL I AM SURE OF THE QUALITY OF THE INGREDIENTS AND SAFETY OF THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It has the most pleasing orange scent.</li>

            <li> and I love that my crows feet are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how nice and smooth this goes on to the skin on my neck.  </li>

            <li> Best possible price.</li>
            <li> and I felt even more optimistic.</li>

            <li> I love love love this product and can wear it in the day and at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing with it what it says to do with it, but nothing is getting better.</li>
            <li> Love this for my face.</li>
            <li> After Avon discontinued my favorite All-in-one cream, I&#x27;ve been trying so many creams.  </li>
            <li> Well, it works BETTER.</li>
            <li> My favorite.  </li>
            <li> I looked for some products that would give me more of the vitamins, etc.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes ok but its not a miracle in a jar by any means.</li>
            <li> Need I say more.</li>
            <li> I love Olay regenerist products</li>
            <li> and I have been using the moisturizer bought at retail stores for many years without a problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>

            <li> AS WELL OR BETTER THAN THE HIGHEND PRICEY CREAMS.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a problem not just with this cream but with most face creams/anti aging products these days.</li>
            <li> Silicone forms a barrier on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> lOVE</li>

            <li> The rest of the review will be done after the 90 days they say will improve my skin.  :)</li>

            <li> I love Olay products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist for years and have recommended it to many friends and family members.</li>
            <li> and I love it for the price.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re just glad we can get this delivered on a recurring schedule.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product before and am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s probably better stuff for your under eyes though.</li>
            <li> , I LOVE</li>
            <li> I love this product in fact</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it every day.</li>
            <li> what more could I ask for.</li>
            <li> Good deal！The cream is worth the price and performs well in moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been flawless and I modeled when I was younger.</li>
            <li> more hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, now my skin feels more hydrated. :)</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this, been using it for years now..</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> They are not counterfeits but more like an inferior product.</li>
            <li> The one shown in the picture is how it&#x27;s suppose to be with the top lid being with the OLAY name on top.</li>
            <li> many people are buying it without knowing this.</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t want to peel my skin off eliminating too many layers at a time.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, but when I&#x27;ve seen others try to peel many layers off at once it looks as if they will scar.)</li>
            <li> I love this product and was not going to get it, sure am glad that I changed my mind</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and love the difference it makes in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my morning routine, and it keep my skin moisture for couple of hours, and I apply some more in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> and I am more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was satisfied with Olay 7-in</li>
            <li> Love anything for Olay, have nothing but results on all their products.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It feels so light, but works so well!</li>
            <li> but I love the feel on my skin</li>
            <li> But I could manage, most of the time.  </li>
            <li> but I love the smell of the cream, and I like the fact that the container fully seals (...the Almay stuff has</li>
            <li> I bought this cream thinking it will be able to moisturize my skin while providing anti-age benefit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In fact, according to Olay&#x27;s website, it is claimed that the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream moisturisers better than $200 luxury moisturisers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More hep and no results....</li>
            <li> To Use&lt;br /&gt;Improves Skin Texture on most women&lt;br /&gt;Minimizes</li>
            <li> I love the silky texture of this cream</li>
            <li> but they class of the packaging combined with the backed science of their innovative products is really impressive and would not surprise me if it was on par with medical grade stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and texture.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> love it...</li>
            <li> Wonderful price on the daily deal&#x27;s</li>
            <li> but then I probably need more applications.</li>
            <li> and I love it .</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of it.</li>
            <li> Olay is such a great skin care company!</li>
            <li> Shorter is better.</li>
            <li> AND  I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I SAY MORE?</li>

            <li> I wanted to love this product...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this...</li>
            <li> I just did it because I wanted more hydration.</li>
            <li> I used to love the cream</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s mostly on the rest of my body because it came from my swimming; not my lying in the sun without sun protection.  </li>
            <li> My lovely face was protected because I used to swim underwater</li>
            <li> This is another one of my favorite creams from Olay.</li>
            <li> I can say that I like most of the Olay products and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>

            <li> I usually love Olay products, but I had to return this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for many years.  </li>
            <li> However I have noticed that my face has more acne like blemishes in the areas I have applied the cream.</li>
            <li> I used with regenerist anti aging cleanser and was hoping for better results.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> I just want to look better without alot of lines and</li>

            <li> This is definitely a great new year gift for her!</li>
            <li> The Micro Sculpting makes my skin soft, and most of all it gives it a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li> As particular as she is about her face cream, it must be great.</li>

            <li> A GREAT PRICE FOR THIS HIGH QUALITY ITEM  RECOMMEND TO ALL</li>
            <li> Great results - Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for shopping on amozan, and every thing was in good order and at the time  went excepted,</li>
            <li> Since regenerist....my skin looks great, I now know what my skin type is, it feels good every single day on my face anytime of the year and not to mention the price........</li>
            <li> ;) feels good on</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some time and have found that my skin stays in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li> the regenerist is pretty good</li>
            <li> but this one is still pretty good.</li>
            <li> She looks young &amp; beautiful, which is the end result,</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a repeat purchase, first time on Amazon, good price and delivery.</li>
            <li> I get compliments about my beautiful skin (I am 58 yrs old)</li>
            <li> Great product that really does remove fine lines.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the original Olay product!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to buy it elsewhere making sure of the true label and ingredients like marine proteins!</li>
            <li> I inherited great skin from my mother and have been rather lax about taking care of it for most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful and proves to be as satisfactory as all Olay products that I frequently use.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect for my 50 year-old dry skin, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on and how my makeup goes on so easily over it.</li>
            <li> Best cream for my dry aging skin.  </li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizing for dry skin</li>
            <li> I have a combination of oily and dry skin, and this cream does the job of perfectly moisturizing without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m being honest, I liked the La Mer, but I like the Olay Regenerist just as much, and it&#x27;s waaaaay cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with how this cream glides on and how smooth and refreshed my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product love how you can subscribe and get even a better deal</li>
            <li> The fine lines and areas of dryness I was starting to see are gone, my skin feels smooth and healthy, and I am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> But, this cream makes my face feel smooth and comfortable, it smells nice, goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to go through the hassle of finding a reasonably priced replacement for the original great product.</li>
            <li> My skin gets VERY dry in the winter months and this product keeps it looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li> it is a very good moisturizer leaving me with younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Does not bother sensitive skin and feels great.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by describing my skin, issues, and desired effects and what I have experienced so far.</li>
            <li> think it is also important to tell you that I am NOT one of those 25 year olds who has young skin anyway and is trying to tell you how beautiful my skin is.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin it will probably work great for you.</li>
            <li> and so far it seems really great.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Regenerist line of fragrance free products.</li>
            <li> im becoming an Amazon addict.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great moisture creme esp for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am in my 40s, my skin is sensitive and though the occurrences have greatly reduced do have a tendency to break out if I eat junk</li>
            <li> &quot; If it is \\&quot;micro,\\&quot; what&#x27;s the point, as any firming would be nearly unnoticeable, lol.</li>
            <li> used the cream (light, non greasy, lovely)</li>
            <li> I find this makes the product go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li> good texture and you don&#x27;t need too much.</li>
            <li> Its really just a good product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot for one use, so this lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for repair and really does the work.</li>
            <li> Good stuff at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I really really think this product has a lot to do with my good skin.</li>
            <li> I had heard this was safe for pregnancy and wrote Olay who assured me that all of their products are safe for pregnant women to use.</li>
            <li> the seller was so sweet too!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was my skin peeling its top layer!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this night cream for years, and love how rich but not greasy it is.  </li>
            <li> I usually love Olay products and this has not disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> Not certain that this night cream is the best out there, but for the price it is certainly a fine</li>
            <li> Finding it online saved me some money, and the delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> Oh my...))) trust me, if your skin tried the BEST- it will NOT accept an imitation.</li>
            <li> It goes on your face smooth and it just really feels good going on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results and I will definitely try more Olay products.</li>
            <li> its good for more mature skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this really would work for you, or maybe you&#x27;d be so filled with happiness endorphins after applying it that you literally begin aging in reverse.</li>
            <li> Love this product and this was such a great price on here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I use sunblock in the summer since I burn easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply .</li>
            <li> It also absorbs very quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> So easy now to pick up my iPad and place my order.</li>
            <li> Seen in reviews that people think that it has a really strong smell</li>
            <li> So strong, in fact, that it made my husband&#x27;s nose and eyes sting.</li>
            <li> Too strong.</li>
            <li> Smells way too strong for me.</li>
            <li> smells nice but only good for night time.  </li>
            <li> But the scent is truly way too strong.</li>
            <li> But I found it to be too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> , the scent is way too strong.  </li>
            <li> I purchased \\&quot;Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream\\&quot; as a gift to my mother-in-law, and she liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend at a good price also.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work, but I was able to get a full refund for the product</li>
            <li> After the first night of usage, my skin was kind of flaking.</li>
            <li> I switched to organic sweet almond oil, and saw more results from it in just three days.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on smoothly and absorbs easily, but the fragrance is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best skin cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> it is, hands down, the best product I have ever used to treat my seborrheic dermatitis.  </li>
            <li> Very good for dry, aging skin.you can see the difference soon.</li>
            <li> I now am stuck with 2 almost full jars of this stuff that I will not use - largely because I had faith in the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced at most retailers with coupons available- even through Amazon!  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m only 30, LOL) how to use best use moisturizers and other beauty products.</li>
            <li> friend used it and her skin was fine</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement of fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> , especialy note a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but it turns out that this cream was fine for me in the summer as well.  </li>
            <li> I can wear it under makeup and has helped some with the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> No complains, it works fine as discribed on the package.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and was looking for a prevention product as I am beginning to see fine lines in my forehead and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine if I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, but I can not put it under makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products over the years, and this one is the most effective I have used!  </li>
            <li> Just a dab is all you need to erase fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> My skin looked smoother and the fine line were diminished.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference with fine lines on my face/forehead, so I cannot attest to this product&#x27;s claim</li>
            <li> The creme&#x27;s texture wasn&#x27;t as fine either.</li>
            <li> Does not remove fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It probably works just fine</li>
            <li> Fine lines gone in 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> No change in fine lines</li>
            <li> Regardless, they both do reduce fine lines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My best friend suggested I try Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Intesives line, but it smells so heinous, and the serum is an unfamiliar goopy mess when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product at night, goes on smooth and has a soft pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels great to the touch but does not absorb into skin - sits on top and clogs pores and in fact, made my skin feel dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and even tone although it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I look great and refreshed for awhile, but eventually, as with all moisturizers, the fine lines and dryness come back.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, the pros about this product is that it does feel great on the skin, hydrates and goes on silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I see a huge difference in my face.</li>
            <li> As a woman having a smooth and clearer skin makes me extra happy, and Olay has helped me achieve that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all goodamazingly smooth</li>
            <li> Texture not as smooth as I like.</li>
            <li> Great choice for overall moisturizer/wrinkle reducer.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and you won&#x27;t need to use a make-up primer if you use this product.   </li>
            <li> If staying on a budjet is important to you than this is produnt for you.</li>
            <li> MAKES ME SKIN SO SMOOTH..</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream makes my skin smooth and diminished my age spot and lessen wrinkles.</li>
            <li> the product did all it claims I would definitely give it 5 stars and be happy to pay the cost, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> AND IT LEAVES THE SKIN HYDRATED AND SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> I use this each night and my face feels supple and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This one goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that this is great facial cream.</li>
            <li> I started using the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream so much that my wife suggested I purchase my own.  </li>
            <li> However, since switching to the Olay brand, I&#x27;ve noticed simply fantastic results.</li>
            <li> After running out I didn&#x27;t think it was great enough to purchase again.</li>
            <li> If you do not have such issues though, I&#x27;d say this was a great product to use for firming your skin as for wrinkles?</li>
            <li> So overall great for firming skin if you are not acne prone, but ineffective for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Bummer though, because I wanted something I could use under my eyes which is an important area.</li>
            <li> my skin is smooth and silky after use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Texture: It has a light, silky feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> this is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and leaves no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> and i like the light scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, not overly-scented.</li>

            <li> The texture is non-greasy, light and makes my skin luminous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> This is the 3rd week of my allergic reaction and I have not been sleeping good because it is at night when it itches most.  </li>
            <li> My favorite daily moisturizer is the Regenerist Serum without fragrance, and I use this one at night because it is heavier and a good moisturizer for the night.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt nice and I didn&#x27;t break out, huge for me as my skin is normally very touchy.</li>

            <li> My favorite face moisturizer, Thank you so much :)</li>
            <li> Very happy to pay half the price with Amazon than the store!  </li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily on my face, I can put my makeup on right away or go to bed.  </li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference right away and even more so over time.</li>
            <li> IT does have a strong perfume smell which is not bad nor too overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I will be back to buy more!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaging good, very pleased overall.</li>
            <li> Says my face looks smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> (Olay&#x27;s new professional products line is really very good.)</li>
            <li> It was a very strong scent that I had to have very close to my nose</li>
            <li> I really like the jar because it makes it very easy to get every drop out-</li>
            <li> The combination of these products has given me amazing results, highly recommended</li>
            <li> The combination of these products has given me amazing results, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very fast service, and I Love this product.  </li>
            <li> It is light, absorbs quickly, leaving a smooth feel to the skin and no stickiness.  </li>
            <li> Also Amazon has the best prices, and usually there is a coupon</li>
            <li> It significantly reduced the appearance of wrinkles and increased the &#x27;freshness&#x27; of our skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many of the Olay products and had settled into the Regenerist ones for most of my skincare (love the night firming cream), but got this in my Christmas stocking and have left the rest of my daytime Regenerist lotions and serums by the wayside!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products for many years; and, this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> and/or through consistent healthy living practices.  </li>
            <li> Each time that I use it, I am more and more amazed at how smooth and soft my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> So can&#x27;t say at this point that I&#x27;m too excited with these products.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and am very pleased with my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and am very pleased with my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin so this one is too rich to apply to my nose.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this cream in the mail and after using the one time applicator, I went out and bought a full jar.</li>
            <li> The original Olay product is made by P &amp; G in Cincinnati</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed and plan to continue using Regenerist with</li>
            <li> It seems to work well and is rich but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Using the cream with the Olay gave me both the immediate effects of a great moisturizer and long term change.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased a jar of this at CVS after using Oil of Olay for years.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin dewy and fresh but not oily!  </li>
            <li> I use it sparingly because of the cost, but it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> The problem is they don&#x27;t even have the original paper package as you see in the drug stores.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied though and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> so I did have a significant amount of sun damage on my face.</li>
            <li> Like I said in my last review Love, Love, Love this product have used it since it came out and will continue to use it, i hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> This is the best Olay cream I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve used a few!</li>
            <li> This product works better than others costing 4 or 5 times higher.  </li>
            <li> It says to use nights and mornings, and it really is worth using twice a day!</li>
            <li> really gets rid of fine wrinkles you are asking for too many words for these reviews.</li>
            <li> love this so far, esp the price!!!!</li>
            <li> Very effective and quick acting.</li>
            <li> I am 25, sometimes I get fine lines on my forehead from stress or making faces while applying makeup (it comes and goes), and I get puffy bags under my eyes, but mostly I was looking for something to firm my cheek and jawline area to appear more youthful (I&#x27;m a very cheeky person! :P</li>
            <li> It is important to be sure that when ordering face cream (or anything else) that the seal is not broken when it arrives.  </li>
            <li> This is a great night creme or day if your skin is dry like mine.</li>
            <li> By the way, I don&#x27;t care about sticking a finger in the jar, after all, I wash my hands, then my face, so it&#x27;s clean fingers going in there anyway.</li>
            <li> My co-worker suggested for me to use \\&quot;Clean and Clear\\</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing rough elbows, etc., but does not seem to do anything for my already smooth face, neck or chest areas insofar as wrinkles or tightening skin.</li>
            <li> I used this creme for years and it was perfect for my sensitive skin until recently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to report that after sticking with these products, that my skin is now, in my early 50&#x27;s, younger looking and softer than when I was in my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Its light and absorb quickly and make my skin look softer.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and my dermatologist told me last week that I have wonderful skin for my age.  </li>
            <li> Just applying it, with its smooth texture and mild, clean scent, makes me feel rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> Being a person that wants to stay looking young, this is a great cream to use.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a real downer for me since I have extremely fair skin and absolutely have to wear sunscreen when I leave my house.</li>
            <li> I read many positive reviews</li>
            <li> Great smell seemed to be exactly what I expected couldn&#x27;t be done better.</li>
            <li> I noticed results right away as advertised, not face lift changes but complimentary and i felt confident the product works.</li>
            <li> very smooth on skin but to much perfume for facecream nor recomeded for peaple that has allergies or dont like perfume</li>
            <li> works fast and makes my skin very smooth</li>
            <li> I just found that spending more money on higher end products made a HUGE difference in my skin right</li>
            <li> I like the light scent, and I believe it keeps my skin firm and bright!</li>
            <li> I started noticing fine lines around my eyes and deepening smile lines when I was about 24.</li>
            <li> a rich alternative to the costly ones and does a better all-around job..</li>
            <li> and you certainly don&#x27;t need to spend more.  </li>
            <li> and this was after washing it off right away!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with my skin right now!</li>
            <li> It is fresh and clean, not greasy, to the touch and leaves a smooth surface to apply make up.</li>
            <li> I will probably switch back once I am able but for now it was nice to find something that is safe to use, helps with my dry skin and is effective.</li>
            <li> my skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily with most skincare products but not this one.</li>
            <li> The price is fair, much cheaper than some of those high end products you buy from Macy&#x27;s, Dillard&#x27;s, Saks etc...  </li>
            <li> I use the 3-step, which gets a lot of haters, but it keeps my skin clear which is amazing since I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and reactions to stuff.</li>
            <li> The seller was great and the product came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s very hydrating without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It does go on nicely and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> BTW, I never felt that stinging, which I mentioned before, with Prevera makes it seem like a more gentle product.</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother and more radiant.</li>
            <li> Not only have I saved money, but my skin looks really good.  </li>
            <li> However, I will continue to use the product because it is the only moisturizer that noticeably lasts all day, all night, AND I my friends continue to make comments on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I know some on here have talked about how the scent of this product is too much, but I personally *love* it.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not \\&quot;intended\\&quot; for this use, but I tried it on a whim and it worked very well... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> So now I ended up with a lot more of this product than I wanted, no rebate and very distrustful of Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> My sons (in their 20s are very choosy about their skin creams and spend much more than I) and they have tried this and like it too.</li>
            <li> Overall its probably a good cream, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I love this Olay Regenerist product so much that I have mine on set and save</li>
            <li> it really does make a lovely moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I still use acne control face wash, and am prone to breakouts and over-drying, so a good moisturizer is necessary for my skin.</li>
            <li> After 4 days use on my face and neck, morning and evening, my face and neck feel really nice and soft</li>
            <li> and I think its a good deal overall.</li>
            <li> and I believe that it&#x27;s a better moisturizer than the $150 creams (I would never pay that much to find out).</li>
            <li> it made my skin much smoother for sure.</li>
            <li> They both love it and neither of them noticed much a fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> Have been using them for some time now and found this to be true.</li>
            <li> they promise on the commercials that you will see results in 5 days and it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and people often ask me what I do to keep my skin looking so nice.  </li>
            <li> I guess it is true</li>
            <li> I really have always trusted Olay and have used their products for 35 years or more.</li>
            <li> Although my skin feels softer and more hydrated than it did with Mary Kay, it doesn&#x27;t do what I wanted to do, and that&#x27;s the whole reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Honestly, my skin is not that sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Regenerist Mico-Sculpting Cream for about a month and so far I&#x27;m really loving it.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy yet does not leave an oily feeling on my face which I love.</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good, basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so smooth and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> love the whole line of Regenerist products.</li>
            <li> Good enough that I will buy again</li>
            <li> The fast delivery makes it convenient and saves me from using more gas in my car.</li>
            <li> bought this product because I read that it provides the best results for the least amount of money.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much.  </li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer...absorbs into skin very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK as a cream, but I don&#x27;t see any visible results and it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.  </li>
            <li> I eventually tossed it, even though it was still 1/2 full.  </li>
            <li> so I try to be sure not to apply too much.</li>
            <li> It did arrive on time and was the full size it advertised.  </li>
            <li> I have paid four times as much for creams that do&#x27;t do any better than this.  </li>
            <li> Although it may be too sweet to somebody.</li>
            <li> I just find out that this olay product is made in Thailand, I will wonder that the quality of this cream might not be the same good as though t made in usa</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good cream for the price</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is a happy medium between not too thick and not too light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the whole regenerist line of products.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible moisturizing cream, leaving your skin feeling like velvet after its use, without being at all heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping I may be able to resume using the Microsculpting cream because it really worked.</li>
            <li> HAVE HAD THIS MANY TIMES AND REALLY LIKE IT, WILL BE ORDERING IT AGAIN.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time but wasn&#x27;t sure if it really worked.</li>
            <li> What I really notice is the smoothness and reduction of wrinkles, also it seems to lighten my face up giving me a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> Good Housekeeping Institute, after extensive testing, rated this as the</li>
            <li> I loved it enough to give it as a gift to my dear sweet mother.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a bad scent</li>
            <li> It is not your $100 cream, but it is not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li> It does feel good on the skin and does moisturize, and has a very slight&lt;br /&gt;scent, very, very, I should say, because I would have liked a little more.</li>
            <li> Luckily I decided to look them up on amazon and was able to find a price that reasonably fits into my budget.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and proud of growing to that age and many more, but sometimes we need just a little help.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it has a pretty strong scent.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells pretty strong although I see they now have an unscented version.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised that Amazon was shipping it for free and has special $3.00 discount on top of it.</li>
            <li> I did get a compliment that I have great skin the other day.</li>
            <li> It STILL works at hydrating but not so great at that dewy look due to air degrading the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I remember that my lines around my eyes and mouth greatly reduced within weeks, and it has stayed very minimal ever since.  </li>
            <li> I really hope Olay would stick to the original formula!</li>
            <li> my face always looks fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I use this cream every morning and in the afternoon sometimes for a quick pick me up.  </li>
            <li> So what if its super moisturizing.....</li>
            <li> Before I was using Olay Total Effects(which is WONDERFUL), but decided to try the next anti aging product up, and that was this product.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and smooth my skin feels.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t use retinol products while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 6 months, after moving over from the Olay Night Recovery Cream (which I liked, but wasn&#x27;t available at the time).</li>
            <li> I read a review before I started using the micro-sculpting cream that a woman had acne trouble after using it, but most reviews were good</li>
            <li> It came quickly.</li>
            <li> The shipping time was adequate.</li>
            <li> and I love their products, and particularly this</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I kept the box it came in.  </li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with how this moisturizes my skin in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> The product is adequate for my skin</li>
            <li> This improves them tremendously, but hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of them.  </li>
            <li> it was adequate and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> and it works quickly.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Olay customer.</li>
            <li> Not for people over 70, I don&#x27;t think there is anything out there for old people, might be great for young people.</li>
            <li> but by the 7th morning it was undeniable and even more prominent than the 3rd</li>
            <li> Lucky are those who can bear the over powering smell.</li>
            <li> After trying many high end creams, I gave Olay Regenerist a shot...</li>
            <li> I highly doubted its authentic now.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m pretty frugal and normally wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $10 for skin cream, but my experience with it has been pleasant and it only costs about $5-6/month.</li>
            <li> I only use it at night and am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> recommend this for anyone with light crease lines and who wants to keep their skin rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> I am 31, take good care of my skin and show almost no signs of aging, and will keep using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> many, many brands including expensive cream with all the bells and whistles and this Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is by far producing the best results ever.</li>
            <li> I tried many, many brands including expensive cream with all the hype and this Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is by far producing the best results for me.</li>
            <li> Besides this moisturizer is in reasonable price, but come with amazing result, highly recommended to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And with Amazon, the prices are a lot less than the drugstores and delivered to your doorstep:)  LOVE!</li>
            <li> : I was most excited to try this product since it says \\&quot;Dermatologically  Tested, Non Comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), Fast- Absorbing and Non Greasy.</li>
            <li> I do break out when I try new products that aggravate my skin, but that is more like a rash than acne.</li>
            <li> It is my new favorite night cream.  </li>
            <li> (I proved it by writing the date I opened the new jar), combining the cream with the serum works even BETTER</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me break out or make my skin oilier, it pretty much did nothing more than moisturize.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> This cream, used together with the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum, is really working, better than products costing three times as much!  </li>
            <li> Lip Stick is very moist and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Good for my dry skin and keep the moisture in after putting my Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> It is not oily and is absorbed quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin feel very soft, and although I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, I like to go for the preventative route.</li>
            <li> Its smells nice, feels good on the skin (not heavy or greasy) and sinks in pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Been using almost every day and notice a definite difference in being more soft, wrinkles stay the same (thus, 4 stars), complexion better, hydration better, don&#x27;t get in eyes as it stings, esp with contacts!!</li>
            <li> nothing dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Since I did want to find something that wouldn&#x27;t break my face out and would help reverse time - I bought a facial cream and under eye cream by Patricia Wexler(Bath and Body Works) - LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Since I did want to find something that wouldn&#x27;t break my face out and would help reverse time - I bought a facial cream and under eye cream by Patricia Wexler(Bath and Body Works) - LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product because it was my first time buying an &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; cream.</li>
            <li> the first a significant  sign that it is working.</li>
            <li> and it really works!!</li>
            <li> This cream REALLY and TRULY made a difference!!  </li>
            <li> The Most Complete Anti-Aging Skin Supplement!]]</li>
            <li> The Micro Sculpting Cream is moisturizing without being heavy and has a pleasant, light scent.</li>
            <li> Skin feels very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Makes it very smooth and alive after applying.</li>
            <li> But I was very optimistic after reading so many positive reviews</li>
            <li> I started to notice some fine lines on my forehead from squinting and furrowing my brow, too much stress in my life.  </li>
            <li> I love its silky texture, and my husband loves its very subtle and beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Every bit as great as what we have bought at local drug stores, only the savings is fantastic.</li>
            <li> product is also great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I ran out and purchased some Regenerist as I have heard such amazing reviews from women who use this product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this cream a fair shot, 4 months now and see no real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 44 years of age with fair skin that would be classified as combination which is both sensitive and adult acne</li>
            <li> and once I read that the ingredients are the same I felt confident to try them, and all the generic versions I have tried work equally as good.  </li>
            <li> So definitely if you are on a budget and have sensitive skin, this is a GREAT option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it proves to be worth.</li>
            <li> through my teens i was fortunate enough to seldom break out but ever since i started using this product i had more pimples on my face than ever.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to many products and fragrances and have had no issues with this cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, about the age defying properties, I don&#x27;t think it actually does anything for the skin except moisturize and keep the complexion looking nice.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it left my face feeling moisturized, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I purchased one last year, she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> I would think (based on my initial results) that this cream would have really nice results when used over an extended period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok I wanted to try olay one more time, since I&#x27;ve spend thousands of dollar on their products but never really see what the hype is about.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would advise is making sure you purchase the fragrance free version - which this was not.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that they are kind of expensive-but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and rosacea, so was pleased when I found something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s products are far better for you and your pocket book.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> At 66, that&#x27;s definitely worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else leaves my face filling fresh not greasy</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so radiant and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> do hope the success continues and am optimistic for the cream to refine some loss of elasticity in my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Regenerist products because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and most people think I look like I am 40.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I rarely get three hours of sleep and</li>
            <li> It smooths on nicely, so one 20.00 bottle should last a while.  </li>
            <li> It does have a fresh scent that I like, but I noticed they have unscented if you need</li>
            <li> thanks for asking, I bought the regenerist for my mother and she loves it, I&#x27;ve already ordered more so thanks again Greg</li>
            <li> I switched from Olay to more natural products, and now that I think about it -</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can say it gives a nice tiny tingle, which makes my face feel like its been cleaned and moisturized and refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who comes up with the names for products, but you have to laugh at some of them.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for several years mow and always being told how nice my skin is</li>
            <li> I got the wrinkle cream also and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price even after the ingredient change.</li>
            <li> by far my favorite beauty product</li>
            <li> My mother is 65 years old, she and I love it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Just hopefully you didn&#x27;t buy it for a loved one as a present and them finding out why it&#x27;s not working very well.</li>
            <li> I found it was a good skin cream, but my more expensive face cream was much better.</li>
            <li> So far using for about a month, love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Micro Sculpting creme for several years (off and on) and have always liked how WELL</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Love this product so expensive in the shop&#x27;s I new Amazon would do one better price wise will certainly be ordering plenty more well done.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the night repair cream, and I am very pleased with Olay that it gives me the moisture and softness that my dry skin needed.</li>
            <li> I use to look much more younger and more vibrant before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous face creams and serums hoping to get positive results.i purchased this cream because of the positive reviews on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different skin care products over the past 35 years or so and this one is the absolute best thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my face.</li>
            <li> Bought it because it was recommended by Good Housekeeping together with other products to minimize wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rich and super-moisturizing, and it&#x27;s making a real difference to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Purchased multiple Olay products in the past and found them to be the best value and available when needed.</li>
            <li> Price is right</li>
            <li> &quot; then I use this right out of the shower because it minimizes my need for foundation.</li>
            <li> No greasey or cakey, just right.</li>
            <li> but you will def notice the moisture level in your face right away.</li>
            <li> Olay knows how to do it right.  </li>
            <li> And I was right.  </li>
            <li> right??</li>
            <li> AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT.</li>
            <li> Using both the Vitamin C before my make-up regimen, and Olay, I have started to see changes happen right away, just like the product says.</li>
            <li> While I like the unscented version better, the scented is still nice and not offensive; I have gotten creams in the past which are just too offensive and give me a headache.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a dramatic change in the surface of your skin it would be best to go with a prescription product.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s all about selecting the right type of moisturizer for your face - if a heavier cream like this one is making your skin \\&quot;too oily,\\&quot; then drop down to a lotion or serum that doesn&#x27;t have as many moisturizing agents in it, and that may work better for your skin type.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cream, light, moisturizes, does not weigh down face.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the Micro-Sculpting cream that caused it since it wasn&#x27;t a major breakout.  </li>
            <li> If you want to improve your skin, use Retin A, good sunscreen, moderate your drinking of alcohol, don&#x27;t smoke, and take good care of your skin by cleansing it properly and moisturizing when necessary</li>
            <li> I was pretty sure I had chosen this particular cream because it didn&#x27;t have much silicone in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other product lines over the years, but Olay always seems to produce a great cream or lotion that equals skin care product lines that are many times more expensive.  </li>
            <li> If you check my review of Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum, you will see that I truly believe that the combination of the two have helped to keep my sixty-four-year-old skin looking softer, less wrinkled and better than the skin of most women</li>
            <li> his skin looked so much better not to mention how quickly my jar was approaching the bottom!!</li>
            <li> Use it every single night and love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told time and again that moisturizing is one of the keys, not to just healthy skin in general, but also in fighting acne.  </li>
            <li> I have used this in the past when I lived in the desert and it was great.</li>
            <li> I have no fine lines on my forehead, my puffy eyes are gone, my skin seems brighter and has a nice youthful glow (under the eyes too!)</li>
            <li> I really like this cream, and I have tried more expensive creams which are not as good as this!  </li>
            <li> I think it does help - certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt!  </li>
            <li> It feels very creamy when applied, but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It really makes my 66-year old skin look lovely.</li>
            <li> If it does get heavy feeling in summer I will switch back to the regenerist serum or the lotion (the one with the SFP and Self Tanner is great!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, but gentle, at the same time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s dead skin falling off, or what it was, but after the second night, my skin felt and looked wonderful.</li>
            <li> Only laugh lines are allowed :-)</li>
            <li> This is actually the same price if I purchased a two-pack there, so this is a great alternative to have.</li>
            <li> FOR HELPING WITH MY BUDGET AND FOR YOUR SUPER FAST SERVICE.</li>
            <li> Maybe there&#x27;s a correlation between the strong fragrance and the breakout on sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li> Not as high-level as P&amp;G SK-II but more economical version with some of the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> I only just started using it, and my skin looks more plump and fresh.</li>
            <li> I had previously used Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream with good results.</li>
            <li> This cream work a great for face and neck compares to the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It smells divine, not overpowering, but very soft.... and goes on creamy smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommended and at a price less than Walmart.  </li>
            <li> In all honesty, I am not sure that I would be willing to pay full retail no matter how good a product is.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend any of the Olay products, but especially the Regenerist line; and, I also recommend using the subscription service for even more savings!</li>
            <li> It is an effective moisturizer and does reduce the appearance of wrinkles and loose skin.  </li>
            <li> Gift for lover, she loves very much</li>
            <li> Also a very reasonable price for the amount of product in this jar, and it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of product to do what you want it to.</li>
            <li> and it is very gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to my mom, she likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the lower cost of this cream, which I like very much.  </li>
            <li> My mama likes it very much</li>
            <li> I do have some fine lines on my forehead, and those are almost completely gone and part of that</li>
            <li> have bought other creams that cost 3x more, but I didn&#x27;t not see huge difference, so I&#x27;ll stick to my Regenerist</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and the fine lines that I had, have appeared to have gone away.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and does as good as any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> Surely, the more expensive the product, the better -- right?    </li>
            <li> I always come back because, unlike many others, this is mild, gentle, smoothes in well, and really does help!</li>
            <li> I will look for something else to add to my beauty regimen for firming my face, but I will keep using this as a moisturizer, I really like it, and I think it smells pretty!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my new skin cream</li>
            <li> [my main reason for using it] and that lovely soft dewy look it gives my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel fine about this product I just need to buckle down and use it more often.</li>
            <li> It is equally important to tell you that I did nothing special to my skin until about 4 years ago when I began a regular face cream routine.  </li>
            <li> It is equally important to tell you that I did nothing special to my skin until about 4 years ago when I began a regular face cream routine.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it since it first came out and am never without a jar of it.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and applies smoothly but not much more than that.</li>
            <li> My face felt firmer instantly, especially around the jaw line where I needed it the most.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will only get better the longer that I use it.</li>
            <li> your face will have so many red dots and bumps,</li>
            <li> A very noticeable improvement of my jawline!  </li>
            <li> but they wil be at much higher price.</li>
            <li> Our only wish is that Olay came out with a product with retin-A and hydroquinone (a skin lightener), but it&#x27;s sure to be in stores soon.    </li>
            <li> The forehead got better after one week but my jaw and neck allergies turned into red swelts and thickening and made my neck wrinkly.  </li>
            <li> I plan to begin using as the directions instruct and apply these 2 products together; first applying the serum and topping off with the cream.</li>
            <li> When I first began using it on my face, I used it a week or so before adding the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum.</li>
            <li> First of all, one of the number one mistakes most women make is that they put moisturizer ALL over their face and nine times out of ten, you don&#x27;t need to do that!</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is one of my favorite facial creams.</li>
            <li> Olay also makes many of the big department store brands, by the way.  </li>
            <li> It leaves skin soft, smooth, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars, as I like my Olay Pro-X products better.  </li>
            <li> It only feels \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; the first minute or so, but I consider it more of a hydrated glow.</li>
            <li> Looked more noticeable even without a facial expression.</li>
            <li> like I wasn&#x27;t getting the result I first got with the micro- sculpting cream sample.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream!</li>
            <li> This cream actually worked and alleviated my problem of dryness caused by shaving.  </li>
            <li> It even goes on sale occasionally which makes the price even better.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it makes my skin look and feel smooth with a natural glow.</li>
            <li> This is my first use of this product.</li>
            <li> I found this product to OK for it&#x27;s sole purpose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t remember exactly when and how I started using this cream, but I remember the day when I knew it was &#x27;the one&#x27;.</li>
            <li> After my first application I could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I use the cleansing Regenerist system and I love it, especially the night cream.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate it and it seems to really help with the sagging!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will, and my skin looks smooth and young.</li>
            <li> but I like this SO much better than the last 2 moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried ...</li>
            <li> I will most likely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Amazon has it pretty well priced</li>
            <li> I have been using this for one week exactly.</li>
            <li> No one ever guesses even close to My actual age.  :-)</li>
            <li> This product works much better than the last cream I tried.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Have ordered my second jar already and am definitely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  sure I&#x27;m  looking younger.</li>
            <li> my skin is nw smooth and nearly wrinkle-less.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this for a better price locally.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the difference from the first application.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream after seeing the commercial about it being better than creams that cost $350.  </li>
            <li> My face was so shiny at work the first day, I almost didn&#x27;t recognize myself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite skincare products next to Philosophy Purity cleanser and Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I started using the fragranced version first.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s actually helping to heal the pimples faster and not leaving more acne marks.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;ve used it for several years and not found anything that works better.  </li>
            <li> I love the Olay Regenerist Products - I switched to the ProX line, but went back to the regenerist after about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have tried more pricey products in the past, but now basically stick with Olay night and day moisturizers and am pleased.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference from the first application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for several years and love the effect that it has on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a thick cream which I like and smells great.  </li>
            <li> My skin does look better but not remarkably different.  </li>
            <li> I would not mind paying the higher price</li>
            <li> wish I had tried this first.  </li>
            <li> ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure), so I can&#x27;t really say how it works on that front.  </li>
            <li> I recommend buying the smallest jar you can when first trying this and see whether your skin can handle it.  </li>
            <li> First let me say the</li>
            <li> Yes,if this is your first time using it, breaks out may occur.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to add the serum to my routine next:)    </li>
            <li> The cream keeps my skin silkly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cream.  </li>
            <li> THIS WAS A REAL FIND FOR ME!  </li>
            <li> FIRST TIME I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely brighter and more even</li>
            <li> I have used it for several years and am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it I noticed that my face felt like it had a residue on it.  </li>
            <li> First off, let me say I am not in any way benefitting from this review.....</li>
            <li> works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream on my face and neck for several years and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olay moisturizer for several years and love it.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for a few years, and though I just turned 80, my skin looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li> First of all, The bottle came without a box.</li>
            <li> We are both in our mid sixties and healthy.</li>
            <li> Has kept my face soft, smooth and moist - keeps those wrinkles at bay.  </li>
            <li> my first time buying beauty products online</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
            <li> , so I tried the Regenerist Serum first on my neck, and as recommended, used the Olay Micro-Sculpting Moisture Cream</li>
            <li> Wish I could wear it, and I am sure store would take back, even without the packaging.  </li>
            <li> but I hope it was more midly scented..</li>
            <li> This was recommended as one of the top ten skin products in 2009, and I started using it at that time.</li>
            <li> but it definitely moisturizes well and gives my face a healthy, youthful glow.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks of using it my skin is glowing and it&#x27;s so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I might need the next version of this cream for \\&quot;more mature\\&quot; skins.</li>
            <li> First of all my tub was made in Thailand not USA.</li>
            <li> My face feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> RECOMMEND TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR AN ANTI AGE CREAM ;-)</li>
            <li> I actually thought my face looked better after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very upset!</li>
            <li> and I feel a bit greasy for the first hour or so after putting in on.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my forehead with the first application.</li>
            <li> Shame on you Amazon who I trust so much!  </li>
            <li> Out of all the rejuvenating creams on the market, this one had the most potential.</li>
            <li> a nutshell, I was a dubious purchaser of this Olay Regenerist line when it first came out</li>
            <li> Pretty</li>
            <li> If you massage more, you can feel the skin is younger with shining.</li>
            <li> I have tried many creams over the years and keep going back to Olay.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years, works just as well for me as higher priced creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew exactly what I was purchasing.  </li>
            <li> After reading a fair few reviews I made my purchase and used the Olay Micro-Sculpting Cream twice a day.</li>
            <li> It is a nice cream, a bit heavy but not bad.</li>
            <li> Heavy and moisturizing cream that is good to use at night time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I saw amazing results the next day from this new product I found and</li>
            <li> This is a good cream if you have sensitive or combination skin....or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products all my life, they are all good, but this product keeps my dry skin feeling moisturized and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Price is right but goes much faster than my jar of Kiehls</li>
            <li> They apparently buy every product on the market and they are extremely easy to impress.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I had to switch up a lot of my normal products when I became pregnant.</li>
            <li> I am 37 and starting to get those fine laugh lines and \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I bought my first jar of Regenerist.  </li>
            <li> I found that it does work better when mixed with a drop or two of Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum--but then any cream&#x27;s benefits would be boosted from this addition..</li>
            <li> I noticed a great improvement in my skin, and now a week later I am almost fully back to normal.</li>
            <li> I am 67 and don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, but I can&#x27;t honestly say whether this is due to the use of Olay products for a number of years or heredity.</li>
            <li> I read great reviews about this product in fashion magazines-it fits right up in the top 15-20 products of any and all very expensive products.</li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone that wants to have smooth, clear skin and diminish wrinkle lines in your face.</li>
            <li> I like the way it is absorbed into my skin so that when I put light powder on my face there is no greasy residue left to interact with the powder.</li>
            <li> And importantly, the facial scrub that goes with it too is worth a check out.</li>
            <li> Olay used to be at least ok until they keep coming out with so many lines of products.</li>
            <li> The best feature of the cream, for me at least, is its sculpting ability, especially around the jawline.  </li>
            <li> They care more about the customer having an instant experience rather than a real improvement.</li>
            <li> I think, this is a very suitable for the ordinary people of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I have had large pores and redness my whole life and this cream has changed the texture of my skin!  </li>
            <li> You need a good moisturizer with it, because the major drawback to all the retinol products is that they dry your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the major, HUGE problem with this product is that it makes me break out.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, the bottle was not even clean!</li>
            <li> love the feel on my skin, but haven&#x27;t really used it long enoguh to see real results as far as reducing fine lines yet.</li>
            <li> I gave this one a try after seeing all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any positive improvement in the firmness of my cheeks or jawline, BUT~</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took so long to find a product that I love.</li>
            <li> It has definitely made my complexion look younger and more important, healthier.</li>
            <li> This cream is easily absorbed, and although I cannot compare it with many other skin creams, it seems to keep my skin well moisturized at night.  </li>
            <li> and you will love how your skin will stay moist for a long period of time.....</li>
            <li> The other nice thing, is when I do wear makeup (about twice a month), the make up goes on much, much nicer.</li>
            <li> First off, the fragrance IS very overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took so long to find a product that I love..  </li>
            <li> But most importantly, it caused nearly 100 closed comedones to break out all over my forehead, jaw, and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and as a swimmer and biker and marathon runner i have always strive to keep my skin well protected and healthy..</li>
            <li> so I give up, no more wasting my good earned money on non sense cream.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overwhelming and the results seem good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works as a sculpting cream, but it  does moisten the skin, goes on smoothly, and has a nice subtle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (it gets more necessary as you get older).  </li>
            <li> I love the results I&#x27;ve seen with this brand, especially since I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to perform any better than the other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I normally use it right before bed, with the serum.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30s and have decent skin, so I am not looking for miracles when it comes to wrinkles, but I do see better texture and a more even tone since I started using this a couple months ago.  </li>
            <li> The first night I used this, I woke up in the morning to distinctly lessened lines and soft dewy skin.</li>
            <li> I felt my skin very healthy after only 1 day, I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to run slightly dry, and more so in the winter months.</li>
            <li> but I could get over that if it wasn&#x27;t such a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> If this was a lotion, I would expect the scent to be strong, but for a facial cream, the scent is overpowering and feels like it belongs on the body, not on the face.</li>
            <li> It did give a descent result - but not a dramatic result.</li>
            <li> Oh, and as an aside, I wish my mother, who was a strong proponent of using moisturizer, had told me to put it on the Back of my neck, not just the front.  </li>
            <li> and I love every single product.</li>
            <li> product did nothing for my noticeable large pores</li>
            <li> It certainly does help your skin feel softer.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so thought it cleared up and wore newly purchased, never used hypoallergenic makeup and within 48 hours same experience.  </li>
            <li> Top was loose.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and many creams irritate my skin and leave my skin blotchy looking, but this cream has actually cleared up the blotchiness and has evened out my skin tone and improved the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to get fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Olay products continue to outshine many other products of higher prices.</li>
            <li> Her fine lines are starting to fade and her skin looks well moisturized.</li>
            <li> Same thing as the big box stores sell for a much better price!</li>
            <li> Recently, I have noticed some fine lines - particularly between my eyebrows (vertical lines!)  </li>
            <li> I am not a particular fan of a lot of Olay products, but the Regenerist line, I&#x27;ve always been pleased with their results.</li>
            <li> It definitely decreases the appearance of fine lines</li>
            <li> Limit  it to those facial wrinkles and you&#x27;ll be fine .</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin, so I was thrilled to have found a lotion that was this affordable and  VERY moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> This is a good daily face cream for the price - not to thick so that you can easily add your sunscreen without looking oily.</li>
            <li> My husband actually likes the scent (and he&#x27;s super picky!)</li>
            <li> This product is very amazing, eliminating all the stress related aging without weighing my skin down.</li>
            <li> In any case, a good product, when used with the overnight product, that really does leave your skin nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t have any unpleasant smell to it (as many similar products do).</li>
            <li> For my skin that&#x27;s seen too much sun, has large pores and some wrinkles?</li>
            <li> 28 and pretty much everyone I meet says I don&#x27;t look a day older than 21 tops.</li>
            <li> The only result was my face was very moisturized, but fine line around my forehead was still apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this to those are interested.</li>
            <li> The texture of this cream is great - doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy even though it is thick, and makes my skin feel very smooth,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer for years and years, and, while that&#x27;s wonderful for daily after shower moisturizing, I finally sighed and faced the inevitable ..</li>
            <li> good for very dry skin ONLY.</li>
            <li> chose to get the scented cream just because I enjoy a little scent to cosmetic products, but it is available in unscented.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to have good quality control that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even finished with my first jar and my skin looks radiant and feels soft !!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes, firms, and has a light scent which some people have complained about, but I find ok.  </li>
            <li> I have a huge red bump that appears to be formed from underneath and breakouts with pus on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> i have used olay regenerist micro sculpting creams for years works very well at keeping wrinkles away..</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for reading this.</li>
            <li> The smell is VERY noticeable, almost like a &#x27;suntan lotion&#x27; smell.  </li>
            <li> I really really like this Olay regenerist micro-sculpting cream.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really get that.</li>
            <li> I have found this is light enough to use in the morning before makeup and at night after cleansing.</li>
            <li> It really has improved the texture and smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It smooths wrinkles really well</li>
            <li> I continue to use the product just not as much alittle</li>
            <li> This product is produced and made by Proctor &amp; Gamble and works very well to sooth the skin</li>
            <li> I switched over because of all of the hype but haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference or improvement.  </li>
            <li> It smooths wrinkles really well</li>
            <li> : I really like the wash.</li>
            <li> It does have a very noticeable scent -</li>
            <li> This is the product I was very nervous about trying since it said nothing about being Non-Comedogenic.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a change...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a change...</li>
            <li> This product is reasonable priced and does what $100 products claim to do.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> And my mom use it , she loves it so much</li>
            <li> I really prefer all products I use too</li>
            <li> THANKS.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
            <li> I apply 2x a day, it&#x27;s not oily and leaves no oily residue and works very well with my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> My face is so much smoother and my skin just seems brighter than it used to be.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any real results and have used it for a month now.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this cream to anyone!</li>
            <li> So I bought a whole jar.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a bit overpowering, however, it moisturizes well and leaves skin feeling really silky.</li>
            <li> This really wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for me</li>
            <li> I like this product so much that I am thinking of signing up for the Subscribe &amp; Save program.    </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and was as described</li>
            <li> but when you are nearing 60 your face wants to take a swan dive to your feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason I took one star off is it contains too much fragrance,</li>
            <li> I’m still searching for something that will make a real difference.</li>
            <li> I like this cream, it really shows a lift of my face skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay products my whole life.</li>
            <li> I really like Regenerist.</li>
            <li> It has a very silky feeling going on</li>
            <li> Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream, I am very Impress, with how it looks on my face after I have applied it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily, but still retains my skin&#x27;s moisture (thanks to the glycerin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and fresh again.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I could almost immediately tell a difference in my skin texture where I applied it on my cheeks, they are so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream and hope I&#x27;m not deluding myself that it softens lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> If I haven&#x27;t used it for a day or two, I can absolutely tell.</li>
            <li> , when I woke up in the morning by the my skin was really oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very drying to the skin and leaves a sticky feeling to the skin.</li>
            <li> but I guess you really do have to be in your 40s for this product to work.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it from 30-60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I highly advise you buy from him!</li>
            <li> It really does take years off your skin</li>
            <li> Moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I feel this was very obtuse and misleading.</li>
            <li> This product really works to restore skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> Not a pimple my whole life until I tried this product.</li>
            <li> Very disheartening.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> and I believe in it so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN TONE,TEXTURE,AND FIRMNESS HAS REALLY IMPROVED SINCE USING.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> but I really like how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works in two days</li>
            <li> A friend of mine are jealous hahahaha, but i share a litle with her</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds .. cosmetic counter stuff to cheapo stuff, thinking none of it would make much of a difference except for moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is very competitive compared to Walmart or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like the Regenerist  micro-sculpting cream.</li>
            <li> My purchase was delivered on time and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> so i need as much protection on my face as i can get and</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that I actually like the light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I get compliments about my skin all the time thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very stressed out because of the loss of two family members in one year</li>
            <li> I really like this product too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it to much anymore</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but really the sculpture part...just did not see that</li>
            <li> It really hydrates your skin and does not irritate.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> Even my dermatologist recommends their products, much to my (and my wallet&#x27;s) delight.  </li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing for your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles (I bought this product off the adage</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how much smoother my skin looks and feels after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> Then I tried buying it from Amazon because the price was so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream</li>
            <li> Very irritated with this seller.</li>
            <li> this product has served this purpose very well over the years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li> so dont&#x27; know if it&#x27;s really a money saver.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Received it in a reasonable amount of time also.</li>
            <li> and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I think this product helps a LOT to smooth and mosturize my skin and keep me looking much younger.</li>
            <li> My hands are much softer and my age spots have diminished.</li>
            <li> A real deal for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who absolutely loves it &amp; will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> it just softens your whole face.</li>
            <li> and it really helps.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Very moisturous product.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have too much wrinkle</li>
            <li> and I absolutely need it before I apply my makeup, helps makeup apply without pulling your skin</li>
            <li> this does not smell or feel like an olay product and has done absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> i have always appreciated feeling like i could trust that</li>
            <li> gave it the two stars for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Skin much smoother-noticable difference in morning</li>
            <li> It lasted almost all winter (3 months) because it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover the face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want too much skin to peel off, and</li>
            <li> Face really looks firmer and silky after a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I had use this product for about a year now and the results are very visible.</li>
            <li> It comes very close to the results you will get from it.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really feel that this has helped me from getting wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing</li>
            <li> There was a partial plastic wrap on the bottle top.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t yet used this product as frequently/regularly as I eventually plan to.</li>
            <li> i feel uneasy using it as it may not be the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Product came fast &amp; since I have prime I didn&#x27;t pay for shipping .</li>
            <li> I assume it doesn&#x27;t really sink in .I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone else with this condition!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and find it really works for me.  </li>
            <li> and I put in on my neck and chest area daily for a smooth appearance.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any cream is a miracle time reversal, but I really do prefer this one.  </li>
            <li> I like the whole line of Olay products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much it &#x27;tightens&#x27; my skin</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not seeing much of the advertised effects of it...</li>
            <li> I have to say it does make the face/neck feel and look much &#x27;</li>
            <li> I wanted to puke the whole day, and I got a headache from the smell.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement after using a whole jar.  </li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s working after finishing the whole jar..</li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> SO, do I use it on my whole face and neck?</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> I look real.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have much hope for it..</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a 5 star if there is not that much silicon.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell how much I like it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> After using for a month straight I saw no change in the overal appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> the sagging around the jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;Since using the Olay Micro Sculpting I have noticed real improvements in days.  </li>
            <li> skin is much smoother and brighter.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This product works really well.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it much because of that.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really have any expectations that my wrinkles are going to</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> moisturizer which surpassed some of the very high-end products which sell for as&lt;br /&gt;much as $450.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> It was much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This cream is really the holy grail.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work as much as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Priced much lower than in stores.  </li>
            <li> Olay has so many types of moisture creams, but for mature skin I recommend this for a night time cream AND a daily moisture cream under makeup.</li>
            <li> My skin looked older,less firm, puffier and didn&#x27;t have that nice glow.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that i can buy such a good product with so low price.</li>
            <li> I have had several people recently comment on how nice my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I had some samples and after using them for nine days, I decided not to open it when if arrived because I think my Regenerist works far better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it once per day for about 6 months (enough to have just run out of my first jar) and it&#x27;s true that within 2-3 weeks, I had noticeably tighter skin.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty dry dehydrated face and can tell a huge difference with all of the Olay products.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and supple and I often hear I don&#x27;t look my age, so it must be doing something right.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice cream, however if your prone to breaking out easily, do not use this because this is what happened to  me</li>
            <li> The price is quite good comparing to other big brands.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item, particularly since it works well and is not expensive compared to many other face creams.</li>
            <li> My wife, Jan, has been using the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream for many years now and would not even consider using any other cream.</li>
            <li> Now, I have my favorite moisturizer delivered to my home every other month, and I never run out.  </li>
            <li> I just perfer the other line better, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> but you will come back to your $300 cream-since ITS WORTH IT!)))</li>
            <li> This is better than the other Regenerist products I use.</li>
            <li> I have used many other skin care products and never had this reaction before.</li>
            <li> There are other much better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li> Products sometimes work better when rotated with other products.</li>
            <li> I have other products from Olay that I love.  </li>
            <li> Great texture, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so originally i was a big fan of aveeno</li>
            <li> and I remember applying the beautiful pink fluid when I was tall enough to reach on tippy toe to reach for it on my Mom&#x27;s dresser!  </li>
            <li> I love this product of olay than any other...</li>
            <li> Use it with the serum and like it better tan other products on the market.</li>
            <li> This product does better than any other product I have tried.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles have disappear and my skin is smooth, soft, and dark circle free.</li>
            <li> i received this item initially wrapped in a cellophane, as opposed to receiving it brand new,meaning sealed &amp; stored in its original box.</li>
            <li> The first morning I woke up, my neck seemed to look a little better (this product promises firming by the 5th day).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It tried many other products - nothing came close to the Almay.  </li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream is the BEST money I&#x27;ve spent on new skincare product in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to think about what other options and alternatives are available to me, but right now this seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> Nice face cream but a little less perfume would be better.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy my moisturizers of the same amount about once a month, so that is great.</li>
            <li> I have had many positive comments and people always think I look younger than my actual age of 51.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried a large handful of various moisturizers, including some of Olay&#x27;s other items, and they were &#x27;okay&#x27;, but I noticed an almost IMMEDIATE difference when I tried this one!  </li>
            <li> And another thing, I only wear-it at special times, and  as a result</li>
            <li> But most likely its because at a certain age nothing in a jar is actually going to sculpt one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> During a recent special, I ordered a moisturizer that cost $89 a bottle.  </li>
            <li> live a pretty simple life: mostly organic, avoiding GMO when possible, hydrate well and exercise.  </li>
            <li> I am 35 with dry skin and some fine lines.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Olay, for helping those of us starting over in love get back on the scene with confidence.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid Olay user since my early 30s - about 28 years now.  </li>
            <li> I am 48 and a former sun worshiper, so I can also tell a good product that actually works from a lightweight that only someone under 25 would rave about.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the results this can provide on its own.  </li>
            <li> was not able to use on face.did make nice hand cream.</li>
            <li> This, combined with the overnight sculpting lotion, never fails to leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several years and find it as good as some of the more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> This product is hands down my favorite moisturizer out there</li>
            <li> This product is hands down my favorite moisturizer out there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather live with an \\&quot;un-firm\\&quot; jawline than drive him out of the room!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without Olay Regenerist cream!</li>
            <li> There was new puffiness UNDER the bags under my eyes, plus wrinkly sagging on my cheekbones that had never been there before!</li>
            <li> And my neck had NEW wrinkles on it!</li>
            <li> I saw less pores, a more polished look and a smoother wrinkle.  </li>
            <li> my skin is firmer,spots and wrinkles are less noticeable and have a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Some like more, some like less.</li>
            <li> I will most likely look for a different product.</li>
            <li> I can say for a fact that what you do in your youth determines how your skin looks when you get older.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night mainly.</li>
            <li> so their skin is different and that&#x27;s why they see quick results</li>
            <li> wanted to see if I could actually change the condition of my skin, and have skin that was permanently line free and soft.  </li>
            <li> did some more research to see if there is some way to actually change your skin so that it is younger looking permanently.  </li>
            <li> I have been religious about applying sunscreen everyday before I go outside as well as a good diet and enough exercise, which all help:)  </li>
            <li> Although the Olay website recommended the Total Effects line for my skin, I like the Regenerist line much better (after trying out the Total Effects).  </li>
            <li> The last jar came from a deep discount store and was $6.00 more not including taxes.  </li>
            <li> problem with silicone (and this product in particular) is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, only takes a tiny bit</li>
            <li> If anything I looked older because of patches of dryness.</li>
            <li> The cream texture is soft and smooth, and it stays the same on you face.</li>
            <li> In a short time it has helped me to have smooth and clear skin.</li>
            <li> I have never had any particular skin sensitivities before.</li>
            <li> I realize all skin types are different and interact differently with different products.l&#x27;pp  &amp;#34; I have always had good skin with the occasional blemish right before that time of the month.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice, but I could tell a difference the very first time that I applied it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very hydrating and keep the skin moist for a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;It works as a day cream as well, if I am not putting on extra sunscreen on top of that and just stay indoors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend only using it under your eyes and barely any anywhere else if you&#x27;re young, because this will caused me to have more breakouts.</li>
            <li> I only use it in the mornings and within a few days of the first use I saw nice improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have normal skin, it is good anywhere from 35 yrs old to late 40s into 50s.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything even those high priced named brands.....</li>
            <li> It is a very light scrub; without harsh scrubbing particles.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone ...</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> This is high quality cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller to all, Cheers 🍻 Bex</li>
            <li> High quality product well priced</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this moisturizer and I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> with high concentrations of all the nutrients Dr. Oz talked about.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recomend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> the s&amp;h on this one is particularly high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li> When I moved to the mountains, the dry air really seemed to take its toll on my skin (I was used to living in much more humid climates), so I changed from the Olay 7-in-1 Total Effects to this cream (between the dryness and aging, needed a little more help).  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea, sensitive skin with blackheads, large pores, oily skin.</li>
            <li> Clearly helps skin and refreshes it!!</li>
            <li> I mostly use the micro sculpting cream at night as it is a little heavier than the DNA Superstructure cream with sunscreen I use during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited for long term results!</li>
            <li> After work I washed my face and discovered many little hives on my cheeks that itched like there was no tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> Under my eyes looks better too, a little firmer</li>
            <li> Why do all these lesser costing products have sooo much perfume!?!</li>
            <li> so I use kojic soap to get rid of my pigmentation scars and sun tan and as this soap really makes my skin super dry</li>
            <li> In other reviews I&#x27;ve read, people have noted that it has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> A little about myself: I&#x27;m 40 and have recently (intentionally) lost over 30 pounds, have had a stressful last six months, and have an expressive face (I wrinkle my eyebrows a lot).</li>
            <li> really make a difference with my *old* skin.</li>
            <li> If they come out with a fragrance free version, I&#x27;ll be a lifelong user.</li>
            <li> I really like this product so far.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on my sensitive skin and wake up with refreshed skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not upset that Olay Regenerist did nothing to help the small fine lines I have since most products don&#x27;t do that at all, but the breakouts and dry patches, etc. is unacceptable and hopefully will go away.</li>
            <li> It works great, but was getting expensive.  </li>
            <li> It can really moisture my sensitive without feeling greasy, and it won’t leave any stains on the pillow.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 85-year old Mom, and she told me she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Will never stray again, which means a lot from someone who rarely purchases the same beauty product twice.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have pimple normally.</li>
            <li> Normally I prefer a retinol cream by Neutrogena</li>
            <li> Only laugh lines are allowed :</li>
            <li> I looked mostly at 5 star reviews and a few 4 star.  </li>
            <li> and I normally can not do this with</li>
            <li> The laugh lines on my face have been dramatically softened and my overall skin texture has improved dramatically as well.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles at this point, but I do have a few.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, I can tell how much better her skin looks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few night face creams from the drugstore, and this one is definitely my favorite -</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and always buy it from Amazon as the price is better than even my membership store.</li>
            <li> You get your moneys worth with this cream...bought for mom who is 55 and people cannot believe her age because her skin is smooth and soft with few lines.  </li>
            <li> The cream is thick and luxurious and smoothes on nicely</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about beauty products in general and even more when they claimed to help with wrinkles and un_even skin color; but I have to admitt my face returned to the way is used to be before pregnant, better</li>
            <li> many of wrinkles are gone on the test subject area!</li>
            <li> I now live in San Antonio and the moisture seems heavy at times but my neck and chest love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream after reading many very good reviews and was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Most of them make me break out, leave me to dry or oily, or simply don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So when I use the cream, I put it on my entire face and neck EXCEPT right under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I can say that after 35+ years of gazing at her angelic countenance, whatever she is doing, she&#x27;s doing it right, and this product has always been a requirement of her daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> This worked even better than the plain argan oil.</li>
            <li> Since Olay creams are sold for much less in many countries, it explains why this is available for so much less.</li>
            <li> After selling many different skin care lines for many years and experimenting with others I&#x27;ve learned not to try to do too much of a dramatic change to the skin at once and peel a lot of layers off.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, but, at the same time, is deeply penetrating and helps to replace the natural soft feel of a more youthful complexion.</li>
            <li> My sister absolutely raves about this product and said the same as many reviewers, that she read a consumer report that states that this product is better than the expensive products.      </li>
            <li> My mum has used this for a few years, and it works really well in reducing the fine lines.</li>
            <li> But I have to say, it does have pretty decent instant effects.  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but it is STRONG, so down to 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would smell like that yucky pink lotion my mom used in the 70s, but it is nothing like that at all, very light, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> After you apply it to your face for a while, your face will feel smooth and moist, not greasy and sticky like some other creams.</li>
            <li> My mother used the original pink Olay cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product with other two regenerist products: regenerist cream cleanser and regenesit serum fragance free day cream.</li>
            <li> They will swear it is only done when no other means available, but how is that true when other cosmetic companies DON&#x27;T test on animals?      </li>
            <li> And, naturally, I think it makes my skin look a little more perky.  </li>
            <li> (Would anybody like to buya new, unused, jar?)</li>
            <li> Well, I forgot i was trying a new product and reapplied it after</li>
            <li> I have been implicating some new exfoliation techniques though, which could be the source.</li>
            <li> I need a new one about every six months.</li>
            <li> I will report any new changes to my  skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a new product for me.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live with out this product for my skin</li>
            <li> All the magazines say a Micro-sculpting cream is the new &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; product</li>
            <li> (thank god I didn&#x27;t put any of it around my eyes since I didn&#x27;t trust a new product yet).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new jar today.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t swear to you that it gets rid of wrinkles, but I can tell you that it helps to prevent new ones from daring to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also noticed new clogged pores resulting in white-headed milia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have moved on to try a new product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t nearly as pronounced and my smile lines don&#x27;t appear as deeply ridged.  </li>
            <li> My make-up rides on top of the products with absolutely no problem (Estee Lauder Double Wear)</li>
            <li> People who don&#x27;t know how old I am are always surprised to find out my real age.</li>
            <li> I have sun damaged skin on my neck from too much sun worship as a teen and this product really improved the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I use mainly unscented products, I was also surprised by the strength of the scent.  </li>
            <li> would love to find a commercial cream with proven ingredients that just sinks in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to my Olay 7-in-One Fragrance Free Moisturizer, which has kept my wrinkles from increasing for two years, and makes my older wrinkles look less obvious, and my foundation goes on smoothly and without getting into creases.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING THIS FOR A LONG, LONG - LOVE IT</li>
            <li> before long I did not know what my skin really needed!!.</li>
            <li> It has a heavenly texture, subtle, but very nice smell and has maintained my facial skin to the point most people find it hard to believe I am 59.</li>
            <li> If perfumes generally do not bother you than you&#x27;ll likely be fine with it.     </li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and use this as a night cream.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Thank you very much, will definitely buy from you again.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this cream is a life saver.</li>
            <li> I believe this happens when a product gets very old.</li>
            <li> HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li> it made my skin feel very soft and somewhat firmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and velvety on my skin, I also like the scent it has nothing chemically.</li>
            <li> Its a very rich, thick cream that feels like it really moisturizes without leaving residue nor an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I have better results with plain old coconut oil and using baking soda to wash my face.</li>
            <li> this time, it&#x27;s in a plain collapsible RED box, the kind you buy at a craft store,and the jar still wrapped in cellophane.</li>
            <li> I use very little moisturizer now because my skin is so much more supple after using the Regenerist.</li>
            <li> You only need a little of this cream so it should last a good while.</li>
            <li> At first, I also had some trouble with a breakout after using it, but this passed quickly once my skin adjusted.</li>
            <li> Olay offers other good skin creams for much less than this one, I&#x27;ll stick to those.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 47, very fair skin, only a few small wrinkles, or I guess they&#x27;re called \\&quot;laugh lines\\&quot;--except who actually laughs at getting wrinkles?--not prone to blemishs/acne etc.</li>
            <li> I had done\\&quot; because my skin was so clear!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hispanic, dark hair, light skin and in my 30s.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;m not sure this cream is any better than Regenerist Nightly Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The first night I used it I felt quite a bit of stinging on my face, but I left it on.</li>
            <li> and I usually do not have any acne.</li>
            <li> If you have the same skin type, be aware of it.</li>
            <li> and of course as many of you I was attracted to the recent ads, claiming that Regenerist is better than all expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I apply this product daily, then apply a thin layer of Olay Night Recovery Cream on top to keep my skin moist and comfortable all day.  </li>
            <li> I have used Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream for a few years and most people are surprised to find out how old I am.</li>
            <li> I like this product, usually use this at night before going to bed and thinks it helps to make my skin look better.</li>
            <li> Try another cream; this one is cheap but not worth it.</li>
            <li> or I should say young!</li>
            <li> My mom swore by oil of Olay and when she passed at 87years young her skin was glowing !</li>
            <li> It took me a long time of trying different skincare products and different combinations of things, and I&#x27;ve finally found my personal routine - and it works great.  </li>
            <li> The Mary Kay product and this product are the exact same price...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed in the month since I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer that my fine lines appear less visible.</li>
            <li> I am 41 and began a consistent face moisturizing regime about ten years ago.  </li>
            <li> that has natural plant oils (9!)</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product, I woke up the next morning with milia dotting my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> and first came upon this one at a Sam&#x27;s Club when I actually had the money to buy it.</li>
            <li> i love olay products and usually can see and feel a difference within days.</li>
            <li> , My skin is so soft!.</li>
            <li> All my lines in my face are softened up so much you can barely tell they are there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar of this and the serum which goes on first.</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels after using this cream for the past month.</li>
            <li> It helps in many ways that are unbelievable.</li>
            <li> noticeable results pretty quickly on regular skin, non-oily, non-dry..</li>
            <li> I tried many other face creams and I always go back to this product.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines were finer and less noticable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use it now, although I&#x27;m very careful to use the cream only at night and another, noncollagenic moisturizer by day.  </li>
            <li> The perfume is a little too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> These past few years, however,  I noticed that my &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; were becoming deeper and my smile lines seemed more etched into my face with dry ridges.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It may work for the older ladies who seek younger looking skin or even people my age who have drier skin than I who are looking to prevent aging skin, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly scented and initially soothing, this cream can also be put on over other (at least partially absorbed) skin products.  </li>
            <li> It does plump up my facial lines and wrinkles, and minimizes them better than any other drugstore wrinkle cream I have used so far.</li>
            <li> While my skin was soft, I was still experiencing break outs, so I searched for a new option.</li>
            <li> my skin looks refreshed new and young again.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a moisturizer for a long time, this was right under my nose</li>
            <li> I would like to have the crows feet disappear (especially since they are very light as is) and have the  lines around my mouth and forehead become less visible.</li>
            <li> I never would have purchased an Oil of Olay product from a drugstore, but due to the positive feedback I saw on the Amazon website, I took a chance, and I&#x27;m not sorry.</li>
            <li> Most cleansers make my skin break out(same with moisturizers too), but this whole line of products are strong enough to keep my skin looking young and fresh, without it being heavy or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are completely gone, the deeper lines are not as long or as deep, and are almost unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> The first few days were fine and all of a sudden my face had a reaction.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine what it will look like after continual usage and will come back for and update when I am done with a full jar.  </li>
            <li> It is not very thick or oily so it can be used for both day and night use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product -- especially when the company offers a very generous rebate.  </li>
            <li> tried this product after using a similar product from Mary Kay, hands down Olay is better.  </li>
            <li> I was using another product which worked fine but was a little pricey</li>
            <li> if this is a fake product or what the problem is but about 10 minutes after I applied this moisturizer bought from Amazon, my face turned bright red and started feeling hot, burning, and itching.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned above - I get very nervous using new products and start in baby steps.</li>
            <li> First application, I noticed a slight tingly sensation and thought it was because the lotion was working (also the scent is pretty over-powering) ...</li>
            <li> so if your looking for something that will help firm and minimize wrinkles and not harsh on the skin and easy to find ...</li>
            <li> It does have a semi-heavy scent blast that hits you when you put the first smear on, but it is not overwhelming and it seems to disipate quickly.  </li>
            <li> Over the last 40 yrs I&#x27;ve been  a Revlon wholesale rep, an individual Mary Kay rep, and a long-ago Olay loyal -- they all have comparable products to this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Suitable for everyday use for normal, dry, and combination skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent: I&#x27;m very particular about the way products smell, especially when I put them on my face.</li>
            <li> and I have a few fine lines under my eyes and one on my forehead.</li>
            <li> My large pores around my nose are smaller too.</li>
            <li> (They can only sell up to a certain strength without a prescription.)</li>
            <li> A tube packaging it not at flashy chic looking but very sound at keeping the product fresh.</li>
            <li> Her face is a little sensitive, so she tried a lot of cream, which doesn&#x27;t fit her.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to say that about my skin since it tends to look dull and lifeless.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it seems to leave a weird sticky film that just sits on top of your skin, which I didn&#x27;t particularly like but was willing to put up with.</li>
            <li> After reading so many great reviews and a few bad ones, I wanted to give this cream a try and see how it worked for me.  </li>
            <li> and my younger loveO wants to keep me looking and feeling young.</li>
            <li> I stopped using both; let my face clear and began again with just the cream.</li>
            <li> So, I stopped using the cream; let my face clear and started using the serum (alone).</li>
            <li> So, I stopped using the cream; let my face clear and started using the serum (alone).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;n in my early 20s and only ever get maybe 3 zits at a time on my face, so this was extremely unusual for me.</li>
            <li> &quot; It has been nearly one month since I began using this product</li>
            <li> My skin is a bit sensitive and I have had acne.  </li>
            <li> I think that maybe this product is not for those with sensitive skin or are/have been prone to break outs.  </li>
            <li> Replaced it with Olay Pro-X which does a better job...at least for me.</li>
            <li> think my skin had to cycle through and turnover old cells (and purge itself of oil and debris)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to fragrances</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> and it still leaves my skin looking and feeling soft with out the allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> The cream is not for sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with this cream at all.  </li>
            <li> I am 18 and bought this cream to start preventing aging early on.</li>
            <li> Too busy fighting acne flair ups.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It also really irritated my eyes especially at night time.</li>
            <li> I always woke up with sensitive eyes and crusties.</li>
            <li> Can you say \\&quot;Class Action</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t smoke, no heavy drinking and  </li>
            <li> if you are sensitive to scents you will want to pass this product up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 54 year old woman and my skin is so soft, firm and wrinkle free from using this cream.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  </li>
            <li> I have always looked young for my age</li>
            <li> Face feels so soft.</li>
            <li> (silky soft).  </li>
            <li> it leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily/acne/breakout prone skin and this product</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> yes I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s but from reading those comments</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, so I got a pigmentation spots:    </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and I use this twice a day.</li>
            <li> Im 36y old and</li>
            <li> I am so surprised to see the results and quality for product.</li>
            <li> my skin is sensitive and acne prone and this cream doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li> not for teens or early twenties...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 and refusing to grow old gracefully.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 20s</li>
            <li> far as improving wrinkles, I cannot comment on that for I do not have any.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have no reaction to this project.</li>
            <li> I also broke out from this product but my skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it to my daughter and niece who are in their early 20&#x27;s and early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Only been using this product for about 2 weeks, but it is very moisturizing, and does seem to somewhat &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; my face temporarily.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be sensitive to face creams.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars only because it did provide some moisture and didn&#x27;t break me out as much as some products have.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for all women, start young and keep the skin young.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years, I am 70 years old, and people ask me &amp;#34;why don&#x27;t you have any wrinkles?  </li>
            <li> It reduces a lot the signs of age, I higly recommend to everybody over 40 years old</li>
            <li> I found an all natural vegan product that I now use faithfully.</li>
            <li> I really do feel like I see a difference in my skin tone and evenness when I use this, but it has a tendency to leave a white residue after awhile.  </li>
            <li> I have lightly oily skin, and this cream is still not too heavy.</li>
            <li> It is SO silky and soft.</li>
            <li> But the Mary Kay has a whole 3 oz&#x27;s where as this only has 1.7 oz&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product if you think your skin is the slightest bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> People think that my 50 year old son is my husband.  </li>
            <li> Those products aren&#x27;t nearly as fragrant as the Micro cream.  </li>
            <li> Might work for people that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy moisturizer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that it does a lot as far as &amp;#34;sculpting&amp;#34; is concerned .</li>
            <li> My face is so soft in the mornings.</li>
            <li> But my skin is a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> It works so well on my 50+ skin and makes it feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> This cream leaves my skin soft and fills out wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who wants younger skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin to the point where the majority of products do not work for me in drug stores</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive combination 20-something year old skin</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The chapter on skin was enlightening - our skin needs basicvitamins (A, B, C, E), omega 3&#x27;s and fatty acids to keep it healthy and build the collagen and elastin that keep it firm and young looking.  </li>
            <li> If you have oily or sensitive skin, beware.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or too light.</li>
            <li> But as far as it working, no.</li>
            <li> and I use it 2X&#x27;s a day, but as far as any difference when I look in the mirror, not seeing that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just too old ??</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the old label to confirm it</li>
            <li> IT MAKES MY SKIN SO SOFT  </li>
            <li> As far as the regenerating and micro-sculpting goes will have to use it longer.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and not oily</li>
            <li> You should think twice about using this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the affect.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels much smoother and younger than before.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, but I haven&#x27;t had any problem after finishing almost one jar.</li>
            <li> and most people think I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to spend much money on facial creams...</li>
            <li> Arrived early.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and does not cause problems with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m too young for this stuff .i</li>
            <li> Recommended by an old lady with wrinkles....</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels much smoother and younger than before.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old</li>
            <li> At age 75 it makes my face feel young and is definetly softening.</li>
            <li> But so far, when I use this I encounter no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying these old favorites on my neck, which I&#x27;d never thought of doing.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the price.</li>
            <li> I often get comments about how clear and soft my skin appears.</li>
            <li> I even have my 30 yr old daughter using it.</li>
            <li> Never too young to start taking care of your face.</li>
            <li> Within a week of using this skin on my cheek bones developed cracks and started flaking.</li>
            <li> In winter my face (especially cheek area) is much drier</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I am early thirties and have used this product for about a month.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit 35 is not that young anymore.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
            <li> For a guy in his early 40, this face cream works</li>
            <li> This cream kept my face soft and hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so was worried about break outs, but had no problems at all.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the nicer face creams that Olay offers.</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen any noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel old.</li>
            <li> Recently, I developed a sensitivity to the product and had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair-skinned 51 year old Arizona native that spends a lot of time outdoors</li>
            <li> I am probably just sensitive to something in this cream</li>
            <li> but the money spent is WELL worth it.</li>
            <li> Apparently the formula for the exact same product varies depending on the manufacturing location.</li>
            <li> It was as good as expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and always had a problem with choosing the right moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Now my old standby doesn&#x27;t even work right, it feels different, smells different and also bothers my skin now so something has changed with it.</li>
            <li> Skin feels softer, less dry, and I swear it gets rid of fine wrinkles, just as it said it would (I never believe advertising, but this seems to work!).</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this product I felt a little tingling which I read is normal.</li>
            <li> like I have you will find Olay Regenerist in the top 10 of all other moisturizers along with the most expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Truly a let down, especially with the really strong scent for a cream.</li>
            <li> Although it made my skin feel smooth after I use it I get the same result with other products.</li>
            <li> believe this cream holds its own against the other face products that I use, which include the Victoria Principal line, the Olay line, and the Seacret line (in the malls, from the Dead Sea).</li>
            <li> but inside the jar was half full.</li>
            <li> This (and the other Olay products) seem to be worth your time and money.  </li>
            <li> This (and the other Olay products) seem to be worth your time and money.  </li>
            <li> I have forehead wrinkles and they are significantly reduced after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say whether it&#x27;s effective because I found the scent so strong and so irritating</li>
            <li> Most of my new friend thought I was only in the late forties.</li>
            <li> I have been using this around my eyes for months and not one small difference to the fine wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in the fine lines or elasticity but will continue to apply this morning and night because I trust Olay with my skin care.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and think it is better and less expensive than many brands.</li>
            <li> I was pretty sad when I thought that I would have to give up one of my favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I need more skin damage to actually see a change</li>
            <li> I feel that I don&#x27;t look much older than I did five or ten years ago.  </li>
            <li> I was only recently introduced to this product (am still finishing up my first jar).  </li>
            <li> This is the third or fourth jar that I have had, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it from Amazon, and Amazon&#x27;s price is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product many times in the past from local stores.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m signing up for the S&amp;S on amazon - which makes it super affordable and less than 20 buck for a cream that outperforms the ones sold at my counter</li>
            <li> I have used Olay products for years &amp;amp; recently started using this particular product when Olay discontiinued the Divinity line.  </li>
            <li> I have used Regenerist in the past and it made my skin blemish free and soft.  </li>
            <li> I definitely plan to continue using this product and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I  am a big fan of the Regenerist line and highly recommend Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend that you use the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash, as aforementioned.  </li>
            <li> would not buy this product again, very disappointed,didn&#x27;t live up to what was expected of this product, what was advertised</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my skin feel much less dry and much more soft!  </li>
            <li> , I noticed a major break out over my nose on my chin, even on my cheeks!  </li>
            <li> I have used everything from super expensive to cheap.</li>
            <li> someone puts in a scathing review against a product based on their own ill-health or over-sensitivity, ignore it!</li>
            <li> The scent is like a cheap drier sheet, I just couldn&#x27;t get past it.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole Regenerist system not that long ago but immediately returned it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth, and I think its claim to firm up saggy skin is at least partially justified.</li>
            <li> My budding wrinkles have already started fading away while my skin in general has evened out in color...</li>
            <li> Usually just a skin pH balancer, sun screen and/or light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I will say though, at first the Micro Sculpting Cream can seem a bit greasy but its really not.</li>
            <li> It took me three weeks to get back to my normal skin after I stopped using this cream.</li>
            <li> After using it a couple of times, I realized that it wasn&#x27;t much different than my normal 7 in 1 moisturizer..</li>
            <li> I think it has a nice, but faint fragrance, and since I am not able to tolerate SPF around the eyes and am also sensitive to many types of facial sunscreen, I appreciate that I can put my SPF where i want.</li>
            <li> (after always using my old standby Olay regular for sensitive skin that&#x27;s been around forever --which, also seems to have changed now!).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
            <li> Just within a week my skin was back to normal.</li>
            <li> After washing my face felt squeaky clean but not dry or tight.</li>
            <li> I am 28 and don&#x27;t have real signs of aging besides some faint smile lines and forehead crinkles, but prevention is the key, right!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very moisturizing but a little much for the summer.</li>
            <li> but I found other more natural creams that work and don&#x27;t include the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results: I can&#x27;t say that it has actually prevented any wrinkles, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I live in a desert climate and it&#x27;s moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> Great to use year round; enough to keep skin hydrated in the dry winter and not too heavy in the sticky summer</li>
            <li> Just work it in to your skin gently and let it dry.</li>
            <li> It really helps dry skin.</li>
            <li> It was for my wife - I am simply here to let you know that this was MUCH cheaper than at my local stores.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the anti-aging properties of this product as I have been using it for only 3 days and in my late twenties I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles to complain about.</li>
            <li> After using, our skin are not dry and feel soft and tendered.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be worth the price for less than $20.</li>
            <li> and I find it to be as good, if not better, than the Orlane products I was buying for the past 25 years.  </li>
            <li> I use Shiseido Future Solution LX Night Cream ($220) and this cream does not even come close to what it claims (as good as $500 creams), it can&#x27;t even match Shiseido&#x27;s which is 1/2 as expensive.</li>
            <li> Also, after the third straight night I applied, my skin became really sensitive to the product causing redness as well as minor breakouts</li>
            <li> but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> Product caused major acne in all areas</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to my old lightweight night moisturizer from Neutrogena Naturals, and both of these things (thank goodness!)</li>
            <li> The Microsculpting Cream is a rich cream that doesn&#x27;t go on heavy, but has just enough moisturization for my combination skin without being too much or leaving my skin too dry.  </li>
            <li> Since I have a mild case of rosacea, I put a thin layer of Finacea lotion (from my dermatologist) on first, then the Regenerist Cream.  </li>
            <li> This did nothing for me, I have dry skin and have to moisturize several times a day, this dried out my skin even more and did nothing for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other brands, but keep coming back to this  as it firms my jawline and decreases my laugh lines.</li>
            <li> Used it every morning and night before going to bed, and by the time I was starting my 2nd bottle, I was getting compliments from friends and colleagues regarding how vibrant my face</li>
            <li> I have tried other moisturizers and come right back to Olay Regenerist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and it works as well as the high priced facial creams.</li>
            <li> You need just a little bit to cover your whole face and it does last the whole day.  </li>
            <li> Seems all the Oil of Olay line works well fro me generally.</li>
            <li> Generally I like the Olay Regenerist line.</li>
            <li> but I generally use it alone.  </li>
            <li> Well...the only reason for me to write this review- just to make clear to High-end users-</li>
            <li> So I am a no fuss, barely any product girl who is 26.  </li>
            <li> am looking for results, not fluff.</li>
            <li> EVERY time I am using it, my skin breaks in bumps, next morning it feel very greasy and definitely not refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to make my story short-</li>
            <li> I am only mentioning it because I understand that some people are sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly 50 and my facial lines were getting too noticeable.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to something in it.  </li>
            <li> I mainly got this because I&#x27;ve had dry skin this winter, saw this as a Lightning Deal, and figured I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> I will probably stick with Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive daily moisturizing cream, since it worked well and did not irritate my face.</li>
            <li> I am 60 and the firmness of my jawline was starting to grow soft.</li>
            <li> Apparently that&#x27;s not me.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and this product has definitely improved my skin and I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> it was this product causing the sudden acne all over my face, and it completely wreaked havoc on my skin.</li>
            <li> it was the #1 anti aging cream and now in my early forties, I&#x27;m looking into different formulas to help with cellular turnover and wrinkle prevention.</li>
            <li> The shine is back, feels soft, and all that flakiness, blemish is gone.</li>
            <li> My skin looks nowhere near my actual age.  </li>
            <li> It smoothed my skin overnight, left it silky and soft.</li>
            <li> The product I received was different in texture, consistency and fragrance and the packaging was different from what I normally purchase in stores.</li>
            <li> I like this, it is thick and smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use allot and rub the serum into where the wrinkles are the most pronounced and then thinly apply the cream all over.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a creamy compound and goes on to your skin silky smooth, not greasy or too thick.</li>
            <li> But out of frustration thinking it would get better it just got worse.</li>
            <li> I think the aloe in it has helped calm my skin down and it doesn&#x27;t look as red as it used to.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has noticeable wrinkles or fine lines, dark blemishes or circles due to aging skin.</li>
            <li> When we at  [...] read in Consumer Reports that Olay&#x27;s new line of products was one of only two which actually reduced the appearance of wrinkles, our jaws hit the floor and we raced to the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to decide between this and some other high end products (estee lauder, clinique), but so far this is working for me</li>
            <li> What it finally came down to was something that was adequately moisturizing but not greasy, and above all, non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> It has the right balance of moisture without feeling too greasy or heavy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> While laying in a hospital bed for a month, my skin dried out and I really looked ten years older.</li>
            <li> I am currently serving in Afghanistan and the climate here is pretty extreme.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to spread around your face with a small amount so that it isn&#x27;t greasy and you don&#x27;t waste it.  </li>
            <li> Signing up for automatic shipments saves you money and very convenient that can&#x27;t be beat in any other venue.</li>
            <li> Wash face (nose area) lightly for 10-15 seconds with a 1\\&quot; sponge and a very small amount of Dove moisturizing soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to put too much on my face due to perfumes being added to product.  </li>
            <li> I like other Olay products, but this one will be trashed...or given away to whomever wants it.</li>
            <li> I like that it is not expensive (which I have tried many expensive creams with not much difference).</li>
            <li> it is equally  high quality and effective when compared to the very expensive creams at the beauty shops and at the  dermatologist office</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and this seems to help.</li>
            <li> I live in a tropical climate so my skin isn&#x27;t terribly dry to begin with</li>
            <li> It does moisturize well...and the areas look better with use, but nothing dramatic.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get dry and oily at the same time on different areas of my face and this really helps balance it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about Olay is the fact that they are highly fragranced and that really seems to irritate my sensitive acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I normally have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I usually am allergic to most facial creams, cheap ones expensive ones</li>
            <li> It was after one of my annual 12+ hours non-stop flights that normally made me look at least 5 years older thanks to the dry air and lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> It thick and applies easily and keeps my skin hydrated for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed my complexion looks brighter and lots of my dark spots from acne and sun damage are gone or very faded.</li>
            <li> I still like it over some other brands I tried lately, but I started looking again because this cream seem to have a lot more silicon in it now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product that I trust, especially for my sensitive skin, but over the years, when the economy occasionally took a toll on our purse strings, I found that I would use the product super-sparingly to make it last longer.  </li>
            <li> but I notice small wrinkles around my eyes (crows feet) and what I would call creases around my mouth (laugh lines?) and a line that goes across my forehead (an expression line).</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see what a week&#x27;s worth of use will do.</li>
            <li> I, like many other reports here, got bad breakouts mostly in the form of closed pimples that don&#x27;t come to a head or go away, milia, dark spots, and puffy eyes (pretty low away from the eyes</li>
            <li> My face felt a little red and irritated for the first week</li>
            <li> IN FACT I&#x27;VE HAD MORE LITTLE BREAKOUT PATCHES THEN USUAL.  </li>
            <li> I no longer see them for this particular product, or the coupons I do see have to be combined with an Olay product I&#x27;m not interested in.</li>
            <li> Try googling \\&quot;steroids\\&quot; to see if you would want the potential side effects of a destroyed immune system, potential emotional breakdown, ER admissions, gaining 65 lbs and a whole menu of lifelong complications.  </li>
            <li> This is alright if you&#x27;re on  a budget when comparing other high costing creams.</li>
            <li> And besides that you are not paying the high prices that come with other creams.</li>
            <li> and I remember looking in the mirror and was shocked to notice that my skin looked great than it had in a long time.</li>
            <li> This cream really helps me around the eyes, I&#x27;m much less wrinkled than my peers.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eye was always so dry and sensitive in the winter before I started using Olay.</li>
            <li> Real improvements typically take time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may just be me,but I didn&#x27;t understand why it was soo much cheaper,as I paid less than 12.00</li>
            <li> I read a book by Dr. Oz that talks about what your body needs to stay young as long as possible.</li>
            <li> After several months of using both together along with the retinol products (not every day!), I noticed that lines were almost gone, and now, after a year, I barely have any lines on my forehead or around my eyes - even when I miss my daily skin</li>
            <li> Since this is a time sensitive product -- I haven&#x27;t had it or used it long enough to share results.  </li>
            <li> I use the Watts Beauty first, and then apply this Oil of Olay cream a few minutes later.  </li>
            <li> My skin is starting to have the smooth, even texture it used to have and those little wrinkles seem to be less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have a dry skin and a little bit sensitive, but this bottle really surprises me.</li>
            <li> Once I purchased this cream which happened to be in the winter, my sore red sensitive dry skin immediately felt saturated with moisture without any stinging or acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> For reference: I&#x27;m 30, have VERY OILY skin, with no significant aging yet.</li>
            <li> It may be a little too creamy for oily skin tones or if your living in really humid climates.</li>
            <li> I like a little scent but not this much.  </li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in this product vs. the other anti wrinkle creams I have purchased in the past for a much cheaper cost.</li>
            <li> food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very careful with trying out new products on my face.</li>
            <li> I do not believe Olay can make a bad product I use a lot of their line,it feels so good on your skin</li>
            <li> This product has helped so much to literally reduce considerably the negative affects of my condition.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell right now.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference in fine lines, I&#x27;ve been using the product daily for two months.</li>
            <li> The scent, while noticeable is not that strong and usually goes away after a few minutes.    </li>
            <li> I use it every night before going to bed and my skin is just as soft as it was when I used other high end creams (but I&#x27;m spending about half the price!).&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more blotchy skin or old old acne scars!</li>
            <li> When you get to a &#x27;certain age&#x27;, every little bit helps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old with extremely oily/acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> At 49 yrs old, I still use it rotating it with some other products like Aveeno with shitake mushroom extract.  </li>
            <li> This product along with all the other Olay products I have bought went directly in the trash.</li>
            <li> After one week of use I developed itchiness on the forehead and jawline down to my neck, later I had red patches in those areas.  </li>
            <li> This is a little out of my normal price range, but I have to continue to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it really is doing any &amp;#34;micro sculpting&amp;#34; but people usually think I am about 10 years younger than my real age. . .</li>
            <li> Like so many, I have tried countless creams and serums only to find I&#x27;ve wasted money again on wishful thinking and broken promises.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to not hear the doctor say &amp;#34;Vitamin E&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Vitamin A&amp;#34; or something super expensive.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no worse than I usually have.</li>
            <li> The swelling and dark circles under our eyes nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li> I always trusted Amazon, but now after ordering 2 Olay Regenerist Creams....2 because there was a rebate form at the bottom of the same Amazon page, I received the creams strangely wrapped in bubble wrap and tossed into an envelope.  </li>
            <li> I haven’t been using this long enough to attest to its wrinkle-reducing properties.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was far too oily for my taste and it always dried and left a white smear of cream, which was embarrassing and unsightly.</li>
            <li> like this isn&#x27;t a long lasting product.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars for its moisturizing effect on your skin, but I take a 1/2 star off because the effects don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Strangely, I find the Olay Total Effects creams</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not old enough to use micro sculpting creams, but just wanted some lift on my chin area.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, and you wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchased it.  </li>
            <li> just too many different creams, lotions and potions and a lot of them don&#x27;t have SPF in it, you&#x27;re not sure whether you should use it as night, day or inbetween treatment just confusing!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts and the few I had have gone.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t too bad, the overall texture of the cream was nice as well.</li>
            <li> I was always suffering with dry and red skin in the winter and then oily skin in the summer.  </li>
            <li> After trying this moisturizer I threw away my half used, old one.  </li>
            <li> My skin is no longer dry, flaky and red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several face creams both expensive and cheap.  </li>
            <li> like above my cheek-- since I kept it away from my eyes) and dry patches, along with a lot of redness in the nasolabial fold.</li>
            <li> Can be slightly sting for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, the last jar (unscented) caused stubborn dry patches, clogged pores and breakouts.</li>
            <li> If I forget to use it a couple nights, my skin feels dry and gets flaky, so it&#x27;s definitely doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife, unfortunately the sender shipped the cheaper fragrance free regenerist product at the same price.</li>
            <li> However, I do not feel that it&#x27;s hydrating enough for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I applied this cream and next morning i got dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li> After you washing off with facial soap, skin still feels moist and soft and stay moist for a few days even without using it.</li>
            <li> I tried a $60 face cream before this, but couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, so I only used it for a couple weeks - complete waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product… I have tried expensive ones with no much change, but this cream works</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I feel it keeps my skin soft and younger looking.</li>
            <li> or you are to old to bother, that is probably not true.  </li>
            <li> or you are to old to bother, that is probably not true.  </li>
            <li> encourage you to exercise caution when using this moisturizer, as apparently this has happened to other women as well.</li>
            <li> and I usually have fragrance allergies!), not too light or heavy.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I think I&#x27;m doing my jawline harm, and now my neck is starting to get loose.</li>
            <li> inside looks like it&#x27;s been opened as the inner cap was loose.</li>
            <li> It just makes me feel so tight, soft and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those who are just starting a nightly moisturizer routine, this cream may be better than the less expensive Nightly Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I use several different day creams that have sunscreen, including other Olay Regenerist creams.  </li>
            <li> I could not open jar due to packaging at Big Box Store to determine perfumed or not.  </li>
            <li> I would say this is a decent moisturizer but not sure this cream is doing anything to my face at all.</li>
            <li> I have always (since i was 13 yrs old with dry skin) used Olay products and switched to Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream when I hit the half century mark.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will hold up to summer heat, but have high hopes.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully there is hardly a scent, very neutral feel and smell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone would put dirty fingers in a jar of moisturizer, but ok...</li>
            <li> May sound silly</li>
            <li> I even had a couple of minor</li>
            <li> This will remain in my beauty regimen for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I went on a weekend getaway without the micro-sculpting cream and my skin did not feel nearly as refreshed or firm by the time I got home.</li>
            <li> I had long sensed that he was doing so ...</li>
            <li> I have been researching reviews for 2 long days</li>
            <li> The skin actually turned pink and wrinkly.  </li>
            <li> It took about 4 or 5 days of me putting Hydrocortizone cream under both eyes to finally get rid of the pink, wrinkly skin.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I can&#x27;t comment on its long term effects.  </li>
            <li> I use this product everynight and have been for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Imagine my disappointment when upon opening it, I saw cream that was yellow instead of the usual nice white color.</li>
            <li> I called back and was told Procyer and Gamble are not responsible for sales online and that factories may change location at any time.</li>
            <li> I just have to stop using it because of the heavy perfumes - if you are sensitive to that then DO NOT BUY IT.</li>
            <li> and I have used it and the night cream for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I bought some argan oil, and that&#x27;s when I started to see a change in my skin that lasts long term.  </li>
            <li> BESIDE THE NAME BEING TOO LONG</li>
            <li> In my younger days I lived at the beach and spent years and years in the sun</li>
            <li> A lot goes a long way, which means this lasts (for me anyway) about 3 months.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and it does everything it claims to do.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks I developed a swollen and irritated bottom lip.</li>
            <li> Not harsh on skinand no reactions from heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li> love the much less expensive price compared to drug store or even box stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I use a couple of other Olay products &amp; really like them.&lt;br /&gt;Problem with this product &amp; 1 other that I ordered is, they never arrived !!!</li>
            <li> and I could get past the new product&#x27;s impact on my skin</li>
            <li> Received the product very quick and much less expensive that buying locally.  </li>
            <li> Also, this cream has helped whenever I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, it appears to help prevent under-eye puffiness and fine lines that usually appear when one is exhausted.</li>
            <li> No offense, but the young whippersnappers haven&#x27;t had time to mess up their skin yet!  </li>
            <li> I usually use BB cream or foundation over it, now I could hardly get the cream absorbed enough even after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am experiencing menopause with extreme hot-flashes which has only compounded my oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> I chose to start using it only at night due to</li>
            <li> /&gt;However due to the scent I don&#x27;t feel like using it on regular basis, and will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that these other creams were like 4 to 5 times the price of this jar and they were smaller jars than this one!!  </li>
            <li> It does not feel like it&#x27;s going to rub off on the pillow when you hit the bed 5 minutes later like some other creams do.  </li>
            <li> But when I buy olay products I usually buy 4-7 different cream at the same time, but couldnt focus on using just one since I never fully see the result of one product ( maybe I&#x27;m not patient enough)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stuck with it for a while just to check the claims, and the places I put this look no different than the places I use other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I will be suggesting this to my daughters, as I have every other skincare I&#x27;ve discovered that ACTUALLY does what it says to do.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I try other face creams, but I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for several years and, while I&#x27;ve tried other brands/types of moisturizing cream, I return to this one.  </li>
            <li> I have used Olay products off and on since I can remember - starting with the pink one, of course!  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of skin care products lately and I am very skeptical about any new ones because I use most of them once and never open again.</li>
            <li> My skin is getting really dry in fall</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60+ with (of course) wrinkles and progressively dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I used this cream for two weeks and my skin got so dry that it began peeling off and felt leathery.</li>
            <li> I use it at night, and if I&#x27;m feeling dry, I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> But it helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin still feels dry</li>
            <li> Any dry patches I had before using this moisturizer are now gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product to the people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of nights, and like the way it helps my dry, 40-something skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps my dry skin moist, spreads well.  </li>
            <li> I have terribly dry skin in the winter and my friend raved about this.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have really dry skin this time of year</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like they dry flaking</li>
            <li> let it dry then put this on and let it soak in.</li>
            <li> Rinse and dry</li>
            <li> I have dry skin which is dryer during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I have seborrhoeic dermatitis and need a prescription lotion to keep the patches of dry skin on my face in check; however, this creme does wonders.</li>
            <li> Its definitely turned the clock back a few years.</li>
            <li> every one here is at least 35 year and over older than me</li>
            <li> Somewhat firmly rub a tiny drop of Almay milk plus Nourishing Facial Lotion into my skin, for 15 seconds, to help exfoliate and moisturize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product does what it say&#x27;s and will get rid of a double chin, as well as firm your entire face</li>
            <li> but it did not live up to&lt;br /&gt;its claim.</li>
            <li> Compared to other more expensive creams, this one beats them hands down in performance and price.</li>
            <li> The main reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it is a little heavy</li>
            <li> I mean, all these positive reviews couldn&#x27;t be wrong right?</li>
            <li> No more soft skin.  </li>
            <li> No magic, just soft skin.  </li>
            <li> She said that for $20, it was better than the very expensive skin creams.</li>
            <li> Within 1 week of using Regenerist, my pores became smaller, blackheads were disappearing and the rosacea calmed down.</li>
            <li> I typically apply it in the morning and occasionally at night.  </li>
            <li> Same product for less  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my slight lines seem to softening and the overall tone of my skin has been improving.</li>
            <li> I have not had any initial reaction or breakouts, if anything my clogged pores are less so.</li>
            <li> so started getting winkles and this cream is definitely helping to make it less visible.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that it won&#x27;t totally remove them, it just makes them less visible.</li>
            <li> The formula is a white cream, slight fragrance (which doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> As face creams go, this is a cut above anything else I have tried in the past, including some that have been several times the price of this one.</li>
            <li> I per used other reviews just now, and found other women have had the same skin issues I have.</li>
            <li> As the jar looked different from the usual Olay jar that I buy at the local drugstore, I read the label and found out the product was made in Thailand and distr.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry so after application of this cream my skin feels dry unlike other moistures I have used.</li>
            <li> Rub it on in small circles, like they suggest, and rub up (not down).</li>
            <li> Rub it on in small circles, like they suggest, and rub up (not down).</li>
            <li> I bought it because my skin is very dry, and with hopes on it improving the jaw area.</li>
            <li> and I have very dry and flakey skin.</li>
            <li> It helped with my very dry skin, plumping up my skin, so the lines weren&#x27;t as noticeable and made my skin softer.  </li>
            <li> My face is very dry and flakey.  </li>
            <li> The second night, the sensation was less and last night I felt little to no stinging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and have not had a single trace of redness!  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that the skin discolorations are faded to the point of only being slightly noticeable, and the small scar I have on my face from an accident you can barely see now.  </li>
            <li> and i only have to use a little bit of it for all day moisture.</li>
            <li> It made parts of my face too greasy and other parts dry and flaky and I saw no improvement with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> lots of other products claiming the same for a lot less money</li>
            <li> That is a lot to say, considering the fact that all these years before regenerist other creams would work for a few months and then my skin would stop responding to the cream (too dry, too oily or cause acne) or some creams would work only in the summer and would not in the winter....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for years and have always been happy but this item is awful.</li>
            <li> I have been mistaken for anywhere from early to late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have been using it since my early 20&#x27;s and am now in my late 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My skin is not very wrinkled for my age.</li>
            <li> plan was to try this line for a few months and then try something different, but with the results I&#x27;m getting I plan to stick with the Regenerist line.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday morning and night and definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> All their products have to be used daily or every few days, otherwise you lose your results.</li>
            <li> It came on time and in the packaging I expected.</li>
            <li> This products are not a real one.</li>
            <li> It will perk up your face for a couple of hours but dulls after you&#x27;ve been out and about for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> GOES ON, SINKS IN</li>
            <li> Then went back to trying it a few days ago and noticed a pimple here and there.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks later, I decided to try it again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a round a month.  </li>
            <li> and if i still dont see the expected results im going to ask for a refund.</li>
            <li> I started using this a few years back when I could no longer get my CHR.  </li>
            <li> Worse - after gently rubbing in, it rolls off like peeling skin.</li>
            <li> The results were always so-so and not really satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how it goes - I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks</li>
            <li> Its thick and heavy(I am going back to Total Effects for my moisturizer).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even particularly like it as a moisturizer because it&#x27;s slightly sticky, and too thick.</li>
            <li> Better slow than sorry.</li>
            <li> like other reviewers,  i am wondering if this is a fake, and also peeved when i realized i could have gotten the real deal substantially cheaper in my local grocery store...</li>
            <li> my younger looking skin is tougher to tame with those cream</li>
            <li> one is because I have sensitive skin and therefore break out when I put sunscreen on my face and other thick moisturizers</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the particular jar that I ordered on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> how it feels on my skin without that greasy wet oily sticky feel of some other brands that charge &#x27;an arm and a leg&#x27; for a jar.</li>
            <li> It worked for a long time, but lately it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d already been using the typical prescription acne topicals, but they only helped a little bit...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the little black dress of my facial cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m on my 6th jar of this stuff, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> little of this cream goes a long way but it won&#x27;t help your skin if it&#x27;s in a drawer and</li>
            <li> They have a lifelong customer here!</li>
            <li> I did not break up in blemishes like with some other creams that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I on the other hand don&#x27;t believe that.</li>
            <li> Well, I decided to try other brands since I felt</li>
            <li> That the other brands didn&#x27;t do for me once.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I also discovered that rubbing a small amount onto the tops of my hands makes them appear years younger!  </li>
            <li> My daily skin care regimen for the past 10 years has consisted of Danne Montague-King &amp; Estee Lauder products.  </li>
            <li> For the past year I&#x27;ve been using both the Regenerist micro-sculpting serum and the cream, twice daily, over my other regimen.  </li>
            <li> I use and like other Olay products.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it or anyone who spends hundreds and hundreds of dollars on those other face serums.</li>
            <li> The other day I saw hubby dear stealing some and applying on his face....and said, \\&quot;oh, it is just my after shave!\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I am an \\&quot;Olay\\&quot; fan anyway, but have also used some other products.  </li>
            <li> I can get it cheaper on Amazon than in other stores and it is delivered to my door.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are talking about when they say they don&#x27;t like the aroma.  </li>
            <li> Usually they say I look 10 years younger than I am.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that for any other product at any price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have fewer wrinkles, except due to the moisturizing effect that almost literally any lotion or moisturizer provides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this moisturizer ample tries!  </li>
            <li> I am now hesitant to even try any other Regenerist products.  </li>
            <li> I used it with a combination of other products.  </li>
            <li> I say this product doesn&#x27;t necessarily do what it says it will because for the past year, I have used Mary Kay</li>
            <li> I read on here that that happened to other people and it went away.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews about breakouts, I will stop using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used moisturizer of sorts for my skin since about age 12, but over the years I guess it&#x27;s become sensitized to anything other than what it&#x27;s used to.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s other complementing products.</li>
            <li> I also bought other olay products</li>
            <li> after two weeks I have notice an extreme difference.  </li>
            <li> One only requires a small amount for each application, and it is not oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Lancôme, Estee Lauder, Neutrogena and other Avon creams as well as others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;lesser\\&quot; products.  </li>
            <li> The price on Amazon beats all other stores around me.  </li>
            <li> This has never happened to me with any other product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After some time, I found myself avoiding this cream in favor of the other two on my bathroom stand.  </li>
            <li> I use other creams also like Roc at nighttime and the two work so well together.</li>
            <li> Any anti-aging product should contain some form of SPF as this is what damages the skin to begin with (other than the age).  </li>
            <li> It appears not to have vitamin E in it, too, since my face doesn&#x27;t get red, which it usually does upon getting any tocopheral on it.  </li>
            <li> I would not use any other face cream</li>
            <li> If you like other Olay products</li>
            <li> Tried other creams and always comeback to this.</li>
            <li> Of the three products in the package we bought, we found that the Eye Restoration worked extremely well after using it for three to four weeks.</li>
            <li> On the underside it says,made in china,as my other Olay products do not,beware</li>
            <li> I see no difference from any other product.</li>
            <li> a flimsy snap-cap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely grateful to have found this cream...</li>
            <li> me and some other women, skin broke out using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did not give it five stars due to the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> The product works well for about two weeks then starts to go south due to it being in a jar, rather than being in tube</li>
            <li> I like the texture and feel, not sure I look any younger</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any other product for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use a separate cream but other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other anti-aging items from luxury department store brands and I have to say I&#x27;ve seen this cream</li>
            <li> Also, I have been reading other reviews, ladies, my box said \\&quot;made in thailand, dist.</li>
            <li> Upon turning 50 last year, I started paying attention...and noticing little age spots, red,rough patches and even a few wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 32, but after a tough year I was definitely noticing some wrinkles etc.</li>
            <li> 15 minutes after applying a very minimal amount.  </li>
            <li> Over the last few months I began trying various creams to slow down Mother</li>
            <li> Seems to have evened skintone and eliminated a few chronic dry patches.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles had spread from just in the center of my neck to additional wrinkles slightly to the sides.</li>
            <li> I resorted to using Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief for my moisturizing needs and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> When this has happened to me in the past, I just wipe with astringent and it calms down the next day.  </li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t be able to use it at all, which is very disappointing for the price.</li>
            <li> not wear well underneath makeup unless you are careful to only use a very small amount ive noticed.</li>
            <li> non irritating , good base for makeup, I have dry skin</li>
            <li> directions are really hard to read on this 1.7 oz red jar</li>
            <li> By the second day I noticed little small pimples popping up on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> It was pretty bad that I needed some type of moisturizer to moisten my skin and counter the effects of constant shaving shaving.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was that after a day of wearing it, i broke out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its not worth it...</li>
            <li> applying sparingly is all you need to do (a small amount goes a long way).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for at least a month (in total time).</li>
            <li> I notice a lot of the negative reviews are from younger women who complain about it causing break-outs.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t have an SPF.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the ingredients ( I wish stuff that worked wasn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals) and the scent.</li>
            <li> Those 4 years have paid off big time, so if you think it is too late</li>
            <li> Those 4 years have paid off big time, so if you think it is too late</li>
            <li> The ONLY problem, at least for me, was that the cream irritated the skin under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Anxious to see long term results.</li>
            <li> Page small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way, and it worked well on my forehead</li>
            <li> I even took notice to dark blemishes on my face beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> This cruelty is not worth vanity.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have with it is that it does not come with SPF coverage.</li>
            <li> not worth the money  </li>
            <li> Well, at least I know and can move on to next product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The result was not worth the pain for me.</li>
            <li> I spent some time in tanning beds for a few summers when I was in college.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t irritating to my sensitive skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Was concerned the product itself might be outdated as far as shelf life</li>
            <li> Hate the price but love the cream.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time and just L O V E  it !!!!!</li>
            <li> That calmed down within 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I was about to plunk down $60 on a Clinique moisturizer when my bestie and I were in Target.</li>
            <li> In fact, I plan to try out some of the other products now that I&#x27;m into the skin care habit!</li>
            <li> Not like other creams that you feel little bumps after applying.</li>
            <li> Until today I felt extreme discomfort on my face!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not oily as some other products are, and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts what so ever!  </li>
            <li> With this, though it doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s specifically for dry skin, a small amount does the trick every time (I do use a Regenerist serum underneath, so that could be one reason it works so well).</li>
            <li> Olay Micro-Sculpting Cream is collagenic -- that is, it can block your pores -- so users may experience milia, those hard little white dots/deposits under the skin, or acne.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this product due to the heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> and it was almost half price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super hydrating</li>
            <li> I am always stocked as a bottle typically lasts me with one day use about 20 days.  </li>
            <li> Less wrinkles and firmer skin</li>
            <li> Then I take the base of my palm and rub firmly in an upward motion from under the jaw bone to just over the top of it.  </li>
            <li> However, after couple of days, I started noticing a discoloration (slightly darker than rest) of my skin on both sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything except the usual moisturizers, then I read about oil for skin care and found a long list of plant oils that have the vitamins and fatty acids</li>
            <li> I thought that I could find something comparable for less money.  </li>
            <li> Skin breathes less and the barrier blocks actives in the cream.</li>
            <li> Lines are less visible .</li>
            <li> This product has cleared up that damage in less than 2 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used Lamcome and Clinique products as well as Cetafil to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> I decided to leave my skin slightly damp before applying.</li>
            <li> It cost less here, than at&lt;br /&gt;Costco.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started getting some \\&quot;turkey sagging\\&quot; and since I already trusted my previous Olay face products, I decided to try this Serum and Cream for the neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do note that being a cream, it is slightly oily as compared to gels.</li>
            <li> I have not had issues with my skin since I was a teenager, some 50 odd years ago.</li>
            <li> I use proactive 3 step system, which could be slightly drying but works well for my acne, however this cream brings bak the moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, when I got them, the exfoliating face-wash was being sold with it for half off.  </li>
            <li> For the past 8 years, I have carefully used the this process, to keep it at bay (and any slight departure would always allow it to flare</li>
            <li> I ended up with my face a swollen itchy mess.  </li>
            <li> I just ran out of my first container of Regenerist about 1 week ago and my skin (especially under my eyes) is missing it like crazy already!</li>
            <li> It slowly works just takes a long time for results..</li>
            <li> I like the fact it does not make my skin itch or feel tight after it has been on for a while.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t it be in a air tight container?</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen, I use it at night and when I wake up my skin doesn&#x27;t feel so tight.</li>
            <li> My face appears dull and dry.</li>
            <li> My face was dull, dry and flaky, it has never been like that.</li>
            <li> I also tend to have severe dry patches that creep up, especially in the winter when the air is dry and cold.</li>
            <li> The two big reasons I just told you, other than that the tingling sensation mentioned by other reviewers is from the cream sucking all of the moisture out of your skin, and I mean all!!</li>
            <li> That was my first concern, since I saw an episode of Dr. Oz where experts stated that fragrance is very bad for your skin as it causes a breakdown of your collagen quicker, resulting in early aging.     </li>
            <li> I used this twice a day for 2 weeks, but switched to just using it at bedtime when my skin felt a little irritated.  </li>
            <li> Those little age spots have faded some, too - to the point</li>
            <li> Seems to lighten up those dark bags and the scar on my face too!  </li>
            <li> It did make my skin feel a little softer.</li>
            <li> and when I went to use it, it formed like little balls on my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and a little firmer when I use this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little spendier than I would probably spend on an over the counter skincare line</li>
            <li> I still use it when I need a little oomph, but use it for a day or two and then off.  </li>
            <li> I used it for 2 days and started getting little pimples on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for a little over a week</li>
            <li> Was bought as gift and was told by the recipient that it is not a original Olay product.</li>
            <li> I read up on a lot of customer reviews and did a little research.</li>
            <li> I order this cream to help my sagging skin, I have lost some weight and need a little pick me up here and there in the face area.</li>
            <li> as little as a month depending on your skin&#x27;s condition when you started.  </li>
            <li> I have used this cream since I turned 20 and it has worked a little for me</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get past the heavy, sharp scent.</li>
            <li> It is a little too heavy for me during the day under makeup.  </li>
            <li> I knew I was in trouble as soon as I opened it and went into sneezing spasms.  </li>
            <li> Noticeable difference using this product in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cake up on your skin or make it feel greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30s and have lived in the desert Southwest for five years; during that time I have noticed that my skin has aged significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since I had to keep the products - and it is far too expensive to throw away, I use it on my neck/jaw line and between my breasts (twice a day).</li>
            <li> Since I had to keep the products - and it is far too expensive to throw away, I use it on my neck/jaw line and between my breasts (twice a day).</li>
            <li> I noticed a result after a few uses.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist told me a few years ago to use Olay Regenerist moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have converted quite a few people.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday which dries out my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed I didn&#x27;t know because now I have a cupboard full of night stuff and nothing for the day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even notice a heavy fragrance until reading reviews, so that isn&#x27;t a deterrent for me.</li>
            <li> I have few wrinkles but</li>
            <li> On one hand it did help firm and uplift my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years</li>
            <li> it will be too heavy for you.</li>
            <li> gave it a 4 rating because I do not care for the heavy container and the lid...</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin hydrated without that heavy, my skin can&#x27;t breath feeling that some moisturizer leave you with.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few months and skin has drastically improved.  </li>
            <li> While somewhat moisturizing, it did nothing to firm my skin.</li>
            <li> and I notice a difference in my skin everyday.</li>
            <li> however it is heavy and just sits on your skin.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses I realized it was the moisturizer caking up...and leaving flakes all over my clothes and in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use on my face everyday for over 6 years</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing w/o being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few months now</li>
            <li> Here in Venezuela seems that this product is not available.</li>
            <li> No residue left behind, unlike some preparations that seem to curdle or something after applying it.</li>
            <li> However, after using RoC Retinol Correxion products for 2 months, it severely  dried out my skin and continued to do so.</li>
            <li> I am not one to use it everyday</li>
            <li> I can apply some before bedtime and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy</li>
            <li> In fact, it was starting to look worse, ruddy, dingy.  </li>
            <li> A few days in a row, then break for a day.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother trying this if you have adverse reactions to scents; it will be a waste of your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few days after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, be wary of trying the Regenerist Cream.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, it caused redness and irritation all over my face.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy, and I need to return it.</li>
            <li> but I do notice quite a difference when I use this cream for a few days.  </li>
            <li> that I didn&#x27;t want this smell on my face, but in order to avoid wrinkles I guess I can deal with the heavy stench.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve broken out several times since using this.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and night</li>
            <li> Its not fantastic under my eyes</li>
            <li> Not cheap,</li>
            <li> My friends all ask what is my secret to younger looking skin</li>
            <li> and I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I use obaji face wash, follow up with the green tree face mask then scrubbed that off with the revitalift scrub and face scrub</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizer for winter, but this was a waste of $$.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using the cream, and my skin cleared within a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believers that they work and</li>
            <li> Too heavy and sticky with a perfume like scent.  </li>
            <li> Liked the results until I noticed I was experiencing horrific reactions to my lip and eyebrow waxings.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy product</li>
            <li> think ill just stick to my natural products from now</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my skin, and it had a stinging effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years  now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this kind of cream, a night cream that wasn&#x27;t too heavy and didn&#x27;t smell horribly.</li>
            <li> I should have heeded all the other negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Not strong at all.</li>
            <li> I work part-time at a very expensive skincare counter - and I tried their most expensive cream,</li>
            <li> -)time to mess up their skin yet!  </li>
            <li> less expensive here than the local store.  </li>
            <li> I have a few small pimples on my face and neck</li>
            <li> Like they say, it goes beyond what the expensive products does at a portion of the cost, thus the evidence will be apparent when you look in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I think it does help slow down the aging of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my usual cream and when I saw the price with a coupon, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up as it was a few dollars than I would pay at my usual store.</li>
            <li> This is not a mild fragrance ( at least to my nose), but a pungent, cloying scent.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it!!  </li>
            <li> and trust me i used very little.</li>
            <li> I find it has very little</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually $3 off.</li>
            <li> end results of all my expensive facial product experiments?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done wasting money on expensive gimmick facial creams.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have enough budget for cream that are too expensive give this a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have allergic reactions to anything</li>
            <li> a week I began to have small pimples around my mouth and on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the expensive and drugstore skincare products and convinced that Olay products gives you the same results as the cosmetic counter brands.</li>
            <li> It cause my skin come out with a lot of small pimple with whitehead after 2 days of usage.</li>
            <li> I usually order my skincare online and don&#x27;t believe in drug store brands.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer a lot, not sure it firms anything up though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the small lines on my forehead between the eyes diminish.</li>
            <li> I have parched skin, and usually the thickest of hardcore moisturizers don&#x27;t even do the trick.</li>
            <li> The seemingly small amount lasted 6 months - even with both myself and my daughter using it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost like one of those expensive brand facial cream products.  </li>
            <li> but they say the usual.  </li>
            <li> They tell you to apply in small circular motions and avoid getting it into your eyes and to rinse with water if you do.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure how to rate this product because it has its pros and cons.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS ITEM IN THE PAST</li>
            <li> and I have no more dryness,dullness, flaky skin..</li>
            <li> and they either didn&#x27;t work as well, or for the money they were no better.  </li>
            <li> Usually purchase at Costco</li>
            <li> I usually dot it along my jawline.</li>
            <li> I also think this moisturizer is helping to lighten some past acne scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure...</li>
            <li> and it is one of the few moisturizers that stay put!</li>
            <li> The price is the same, but I am disappointed that Amazon.com would do such a thing.</li>
            <li> After a week, I got a few compliments on my complexion!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 2 years shy of the big 4-0!  Eeeeek!  </li>
            <li> No more switching around</li>
            <li> I looked past it after I used this product for a while.</li>
            <li> Cream was thicker then usual and did not smell like the Olay cream.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;dispenser&amp;#34; which is just a small jar.</li>
            <li> To heavy &amp; thick for my liking.</li>
            <li> but it works, usually takes two nights in a row to see a difference if I forget to use it for a bit.</li>
            <li> Opening the jar, I was disappointed and initially assumed Olay changed the formula since the cream is thinner and does not have the same smell.</li>
            <li> I am not sure my wrinkles have lessened</li>
            <li> Usually it is the phenols in perfume that have an affect on me.  </li>
            <li> would not recommend using this before make up, at least for me, it is too heavy to use under</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> I am just sticking to Dr Weils Mushroom products :/  </li>
            <li> I usually order 2 at a time.  </li>
            <li> I did have one break-out pimple, not sure if the product caused it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced that with other creams before so I am not sure what would cause it</li>
            <li> I noticed that after the 2 days of use, I had little red spots on my neck and just below which I thought was chicken pot or measles.  </li>
            <li> And I am very frugal and hate to waste anything.  </li>
            <li> Definitely one of the least expensive anti-aging creams that works well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Regenerist system immediately started burning horribly upon application and despite being on for only a couple minutes for me to reach water and wash it off I was left with intensely burned skin (think horrible sunburn after falling asleep in the sun) and even a few blisters in extra sensitive areas around my nose and cheekbones</li>
            <li> This cream is soothing, non-irritating despite having a bit of fragrance (hardly any).  </li>
            <li> The Oil of Olay Regenerist line would be hard to beat at any price.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s the cream</li>
            <li> Maybe it depends on your skin type, but this made my skin look hard and rugged looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hardly used any product in the month I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if it has changed the way my skin looks</li>
            <li> Smoother and no longer dull.</li>
            <li> My face also had a dull look that it didn&#x27;t have before.  </li>
            <li> for the price, hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I use this as a base before putting on my medication because my facial skin gets VERY dry and flakes (before using this product).</li>
            <li> I commonly get mistaken for 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a sucker born every minute, and I am one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am skincare fanatic.</li>
            <li> My daughter, in her late twenties, also uses it.</li>
            <li> (Duh.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for at least a year</li>
            <li> Okay products leave behind a residue thatis very annoying for me, so I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Another one for really cold weather is Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream.</li>
            <li> Give it a shot, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, at least you&#x27;re not out $50</li>
            <li> So at least I got her hooked on this.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped that my &amp;#34;Granny Wrinkles&amp;#34; would disappear or at least not stand out so much...but they still rise and shine at me in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of it and need to by at least once a month.</li>
            <li> Six months ago my wife and I tried Olay&#x27;s Eye Restoration Complex.</li>
            <li> i  complained to Amazon about it and seller sent me another one.</li>
            <li> a sticky feeling on the skin, at least until I get my makeup on over</li>
            <li> The cream was too thick and greasy, so I threw it away.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not too thick and it never breaks me out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and feels luxurious, and the moment you put it on, it smooths to perfection on your skin.</li>
            <li> It was too thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural born skeptic and hate to waste money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can feel a bit heavy for day time use, but not that bad when you carefully apply only a very thin layer.</li>
            <li> I am not talking about just on the T-zone, I mean every where.      </li>
            <li> No need to stray to other expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients, it is comparable to some very expensive anti-aging facial cream.</li>
            <li> If you seriously depend on the reviews, I would play close attention to them &amp; check their history.  </li>
            <li> Less expensive if you get it</li>
            <li> I bought this cream last week use it everyday, the scent is annoying and on day 5 gave me 4 zits.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, I&#x27;d recommend a less expensive moisturizer.</li>
            <li> the second application of this product I woke up the next day with horrible acne all over my cheeks and t zone.</li>
            <li> Lines have softened and those creepy ones by my mouth are become less noticable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am just sick of having to hunt down a seller and get the product at someone else convenience, when I can just go to Wal-Mart down the road and buy this product whenever I want.</li>
            <li> its just a little expensive for me.</li>
            <li> Well, 2 weeks later, here I am with still just as bad</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can say about this is that I wish they made it with SPF.</li>
            <li> Not a good reason for animal testing.</li>
            <li> this contains nylon-12 which is not good for the skin.</li>
            <li> Now, and for the past 6 years or so, I get a random pimple here</li>
            <li> Dumb me to buy without reviewing - just compulsive buying on my part.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the expensive ones and they were no better than this product.  </li>
            <li> but I am afraid to try any other of their moisturizers!!</li>
            <li> and it just got worse instead of</li>
            <li> - I was afraid it may be heavy and cause me to become oily.</li>
            <li> By using the subscription service, I save approximately $10 a jar.  </li>
            <li> am  not happy this advertisement took over the page I was looking at.</li>
            <li> so I can stay a head of the game when it comes to aging skin.</li>
            <li> It was too irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li> (I used it for approximately two weeks).</li>
            <li> This one was even worse (incidentally , did NOT say &amp;#34;made in Thailand&amp;#34; on jar)</li>
            <li> All we are doing with this product is rubbing chemicals and unhealthy toxins into our skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t make my acne worse either.</li>
            <li> worse, some cream spit out from one of the bottle, and all over the plastic wrap.  </li>
            <li> I WILL CONTINUE TO USE UNLESS SOMETHING GETS WORSE.</li>
            <li> It did firm up my skin, but made my face feel numb and tingling.</li>
            <li> 36- Used it until the jar was empty and did not notice any differences :(</li>
            <li> It was getting too expensive for me to budget with the prices in stores though.</li>
            <li> Can never go wrong with an oil of Olay product</li>
            <li> but again...much too expensive to throw away, so I&#x27;ll use it in these areas until it is gone.</li>
            <li> but again...much too expensive to throw away, so I&#x27;ll use it in these areas until it is gone.</li>
            <li> Before I am using expensive products but it doesnt help to erase wrinkles</li>
            <li> GEt this cream once and you will never rethink the slightly expensive price after using it once.</li>
            <li> even close to expensive creams..</li>
            <li> It made me ill.  </li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re looking for a product that minimizes them, sadly this isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong trying out this product.  </li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s fake product using olay packaging</li>
            <li> I began thinking this moisturizer may be a fake or &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I believe this is a knockoff and have notified Olay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sorry</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford the expensive creams.  </li>
            <li> Does as well of expensive creams.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this creme is just another chemical-laden drugstore product now.</li>
            <li> I grew up using Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s face creams, but it was just getting too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive products that are $200 per jar that do not work as well as this one does.</li>
            <li> and I am sad about this.</li>
            <li> I used it over the course of several weeks and it is without a doubt the worst product I have ever put on</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream.</li>
            <li> When I try to change my skin is not happy!</li>
            <li> It could be someone get the used bottle and put in some fake cream and sell them...</li>
            <li> By the third morning, my skin looked awful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, though, Almay stopped making the &#x27;milk</li>
            <li> It was so uncomfortable that I gave up on the cream.</li>
            <li> Complained to Olay and they sent me a coupon for one Olay Regenerist :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed with my Olay regenerist cream finding that it wasn&#x27;t making my skin feel as moist or glowy as it used nor softening lines as well when I came across the negative review.  </li>
            <li> I hated the smell and it dried my skin.  </li>
            <li> It just seems dangerous to me, and I&#x27;ve seen some really frightening results.</li>
            <li> Gave me horrific headaches due to the chemical makeup of this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using it twice my face broke out really badly all over.</li>
            <li> I sort of like the scent, however, I am unhappy that there is one.</li>
            <li> and I am unhappy with what I have found.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate to find a solution so started to try baby lotion, vaseline, aquaphor, etc to mosturize my face since my face moisturizer wasnt working at all.</li>
            <li> I was aghast.</li>
            <li> Made my face all greasy and just nasty after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid there is no help for me.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as I had used oil of olay moisturizer in the past with no issues.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> I litterly got addicted to this cream!!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Claims of micro-sculpting properties may be exaggerated!</li>
            <li> The one I received was scented and I am mad about that.</li>
            <li> Maybe since I received it they changed the formula but it has a very faint fragrance that I like a lot.</li>
            <li> even the very expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> This was listed with some very expensive night creams.  </li>
            <li> Worse, the smell is so sickening taht</li>
            <li> it also made me break out so badly.</li>
            <li> I reported this bad experience to Olay and they are refunding my money via one of their company-issued debit cards.</li>
            <li> Also, I was shocked to read that some thought this product made their skin too oily.</li>
            <li> I had my thyroid removed and was dreading an ugly scar across the front of my neck.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed in its performance for reducing the appearance of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Never seem to be disappointed with Olay products.</li>
            <li> Real or fake</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product from Olay.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> have these creepy lines between my mouth and cheeks and they are awful when seen in daylight.  </li>
            <li> This was a very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> The olive oil base also wrecks makeup.  </li>
            <li> I hate them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looked like I had gotten a bad sunburn!</li>
            <li> I also have always hated to sit in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I deviated in any way, or if I got too stressed out, or if my fingers were oily and I touched my nose, it would get very bad.  </li>
            <li> I have now stopped using the cream :( and now need to figure out what I should do to get rid of the discoloration!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received this product.</li>
            <li> , Olay, a division of Proctor and Gamble, is still testing its products on animals, which we know causes them terrible suffering.</li>
            <li> Product is awful.</li>
            <li> I broke out terribly using this cream.</li>
            <li> But after a day of using all over my face I got horrific acne.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>
            <li> Awful price</li>
            <li> This cream caused me to breakout horribly.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used everything from super expensive to cheap. I always come back to this. I commonly get mistaken for 30&#x27;s and I am 42. When I put it on I di it in an upward motion. It has the directions in the package. Also Amazon has the best prices, and usually there is a coupon so make sure you look under the price, it will say clip coupon. It&#x27;s usually $3 off. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working or not :P</li>
            <li> I purchased two jars ofr Regenerist online.  It&#x27;s hard to say whether it&#x27;s effective because I found the scent so strong and so irritating, that I have only used it a handful of times. This is not a mild fragrance ( at least to my nose), but a pungent, cloying scent.  (Would anybody like to buya new, unused, jar?)</li>
            <li> Every bit as great as what we have bought at local drug stores, only the savings is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time. Even in summer. Very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all goodamazingly smooth</li>
            <li> Gift for lover, she loves very much</li>
            <li> Always use this product. I look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> You get your moneys worth with this cream...bought for mom who is 55 and people cannot believe her age because her skin is smooth and soft with few lines.  Now she is a faithful buyer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for years, love the way it makes my skin feel.  Got it for a great price here, better than at Costco.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. My skin is looking younger, so I&#x27;m tols. I can&#x27;t believe it took so long to find a product that I love. I will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know this product, bought it for my mother.&lt;br /&gt;I think she likes it, so it&#x27;s okay, i guess.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
            <li> I love this product I would give more stars if there were more. i have used olay regenerist micro sculpting creams for years works very well at keeping wrinkles away.. the price is excellent will definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a sucker born every minute, and I am one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La Mer?  Yep, I bought that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chanticaille?  Yep, guilty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philosophy?  Yep, there&#x27;s hope in my jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skinceuticals?  Yep, that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive salon facials?  Yep, I did those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end results of all my expensive facial product experiments?  Nothing earth-shattering.  If I&#x27;m being honest, I liked the La Mer, but I like the Olay Regenerist just as much, and it&#x27;s waaaaay cheaper.  This is a really good moisturizer, and the best I&#x27;ve ever found at this price point.  It won&#x27;t perform miracles, but then again, what does?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this.  It&#x27;s my go-to in the winter months when my skin is drier.  I&#x27;m done wasting money on expensive gimmick facial creams.</li>
            <li> I had run out of this and bought the drug store brand.  By the time I got this from Amazon,  and started up again, I could definitely tell the difference.</li>
            <li> good for very dry skin ONLY.</li>
            <li> This product is very good on your face, feels nice and refreshing, I use it twice a day, morning and night, I totally recommend this item to everybody.</li>
            <li> Love all things &#x27;Olay&amp;#34;...this cream is especially good on my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area, but a great night cream, full face as well.</li>
            <li> FYI for those of you that don&#x27;t know, Olay, a division of Proctor and Gamble, is still testing its products on animals, which we know causes them terrible suffering. Please take this into consideration when you decide what product to buy and what kind of company you want to support. PETA has a list online of all the companies that test and do not test on animals and there are so many wonderful,natural products out there to choose from that don&#x27;t come to us at another creature&#x27;s expense. Thanks so much for reading this.</li>
            <li> Why oh why can&#x27;t they make these products unscented?  I knew I was in trouble as soon as I opened it and went into sneezing spasms.  The smell is VERY noticeable, almost like a &#x27;suntan lotion&#x27; smell.  And when it&#x27;s on your face, you will smell it ALL day.  I probably won&#x27;t be able to use it at all, which is very disappointing for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I love how it feels, how it smells, and the difference it&#x27;s made in my skin.  I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I tell myself, \\&quot;Patience! Wrinkles weren&#x27;t created overnight.\\&quot; It has been nearly one month since I began using this product and I can definitely see improvement in the texture of my skin. My skin stays hydrated and deep wrinkles are softening. As I continue to apply twice a day, I expect the wrinkles will soften even more. An excellent addition to quality skin care.</li>
            <li> After reading so many great reviews and a few bad ones, I wanted to give this cream a try and see how it worked for me.  Its a very rich, thick cream that feels like it really moisturizes without leaving residue nor an oily feeling. IT does have a strong perfume smell which is not bad nor too overpowering.  My only complaint was that after a day of wearing it, i broke out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hispanic, dark hair, light skin and in my 30s.  My skin is a bit sensitive and I have had acne.  Now, and for the past 6 years or so, I get a random pimple here and there but nothing major.  I do break out when I try new products that aggravate my skin, but that is more like a rash than acne. I think this is what happened when I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wearking it about 24-36 hours my face broke out into a dozen or so red bumps and another dozen or so mini pimples. Not regular pimples just tiny tiny whiteheads? When this has happened to me in the past, I just wipe with astringent and it calms down the next day.  Well, I forgot i was trying a new product and reapplied it after and it just got worse instead of better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend used it and her skin was fine but she has never had any skin problems. I think that maybe this product is not for those with sensitive skin or are/have been prone to break outs.  I am sure that those that aren&#x27;t may benefit.  I know my friend benefitted when I told her she could keep it.  She loved the perfume smell. :)</li>
            <li> Texture not as smooth as I like. Nice light scent. Price is right</li>
            <li> This is one of the best skin care products I have ever used. I saw results almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This micro-sculpting cream is amazing!  I have had large pores and redness my whole life and this cream has changed the texture of my skin!  My pores are shrinking and my face is smoother and younger looking.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  Finally a product that actually works!</li>
            <li> Product is awful. Doesn&#x27;t fully absorb into your skin, just sits on top so when it dries, you can rub it off into rubbery flakes. It&#x27;s gross. It also made my skin break out. I gave it my best shot, but threw it out. Especially after noticing it contains cancer causing chemicals. No thank you!!</li>
            <li> Replaced it with Olay Pro-X which does a better job...at least for me.</li>
            <li> CREATED TOO MANY BREAKOUTS IN MY FACE AFTER 3 DAYS OF USE. NEVER EVER AGAIN!!![[ASIN:B0012J30LY Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, 1.7 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> This is an \\&quot;OLD\\&quot; best of the best!  I use this cream every morning and in the afternoon sometimes for a quick pick me up.  Does not bother sensitive skin and feels great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told time and again that moisturizing is one of the keys, not to just healthy skin in general, but also in fighting acne.  Since I was about 13, I&#x27;ve battled moderate acne.  I turned 38 6 months ago and I STILL battled it.  I&#x27;d already been using the typical prescription acne topicals, but they only helped a little bit... I just couldn&#x27;t get a hold on this problem.  Then, in February of this year (2011), I was told of deal on this product if you subscribe.  I&#x27;d tried a large handful of various moisturizers, including some of Olay&#x27;s other items, and they were &#x27;okay&#x27;, but I noticed an almost IMMEDIATE difference when I tried this one!  All I can say is WOW!  I&#x27;m fairly confident that my face is smoother and softer now than it was when I was a baby!  :)  This stuff is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold, platinum, AND silver!  Subscriber for life!</li>
            <li> I really really like this Olay regenerist micro-sculpting cream. It was getting too expensive for me to budget with the prices in stores though. I was pretty sad when I thought that I would have to give up one of my favorite beauty products. Luckily I decided to look them up on amazon and was able to find a price that reasonably fits into my budget. This is a great product and I am happy to be able to continue using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 32, but after a tough year I was definitely noticing some wrinkles etc. Noticeable difference using this product in just a few weeks. Its definitely turned the clock back a few years.</li>
            <li> I loved it enough to give it as a gift to my dear sweet mother. (Got it as a gift, myself). Buy a woman something she wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy herself ;) feels good on and I appreciate the call to take care of and pamper my aging face - pushing thirty now and my younger loveO wants to keep me looking and feeling young.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer! Seen in reviews that people think that it has a really strong smell but I didn&#x27;t really get that. There was a bit of a fragrance but I thought it was nice. My skin is getting really dry in fall but now it feels moisturized and refreshed after application, this moisture lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best facial cream I have ever used. The only thing that beats it for anti-aging that I have tried is my nightly retinol. I have gotten more compliments on my skin since using this Olay cream than I ever did before. I have been using it since it first came out and am never without a jar of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this cream a fair shot, 4 months now and see no real difference in my skin. Not sure if I need more skin damage to actually see a change but I was expecting so much more! It didn&#x27;t make me break out or make my skin oilier, it pretty much did nothing more than moisturize. It smells nice and applies smoothly but not much more than that. For reference: I&#x27;m 30, have VERY OILY skin, with no significant aging yet. Olay offers other good skin creams for much less than this one, I&#x27;ll stick to those.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two months.  I typically apply it in the morning and occasionally at night.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement of fine lines around my eyes.  I do like the feel of the product and haven&#x27;t had any skin reactions to it but I&#x27;m disappointed in its performance for reducing the appearance of wrinkles.  I will most likely look for a different product.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on smoothly and absorbs easily, but the fragrance is too strong for me. So strong, in fact, that it made my husband&#x27;s nose and eyes sting. (Not what I&#x27;d like to happen when we kiss goodnight!) I&#x27;d rather live with an \\&quot;un-firm\\&quot; jawline than drive him out of the room!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice, but I could tell a difference the very first time that I applied it. My face felt firmer instantly, especially around the jaw line where I needed it the most. Hopefully it will only get better the longer that I use it. It also has a mild pleasant smell, not to strong at all.</li>
            <li> My face felt a little red and irritated for the first week I used this. I even had a couple of minor breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stuck with it, like I read on a beauty website, and I&#x27;m happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is smoother. The sensitivity is gone and I&#x27;m not experiencing any more breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my skin had to cycle through and turnover old cells (and purge itself of oil and debris)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once that was done, it looks great. Honestly one of the best OTC creams I&#x27;ve used. I also use Retin-a (for wrinkle prevention) and find this to be a great night cream on the days I don&#x27;t use the Retin-a.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of skin care products lately and I am very skeptical about any new ones because I use most of them once and never open again. Most of them make me break out, leave me to dry or oily, or simply don&#x27;t work. I gave this one a try after seeing all of the positive reviews. My skin is sensitive to fragrances and I did not have a problem with this one. I have found this is light enough to use in the morning before makeup and at night after cleansing. It really has improved the texture and smoothness of my skin. It also has minimized my combination skin \\&quot;freakouts\\&quot;. I tend to get dry and oily at the same time on different areas of my face and this really helps balance it. It doesn&#x27;t cake up on your skin or make it feel greasy and heavy. This will remain in my beauty regimen for a long time to come. To anyone who is on the fence about trying it, just try it once and you will love it too!</li>
            <li> love the much less expensive price compared to drug store or even box stores.  Same product for less  Always a plus</li>
            <li> Great product good price</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of weeks now. I notice a definite difference in the texture of my skin. I love the fact that it&#x27;s very hydrating without that greasy feeling. I use very little moisturizer now because my skin is so much more supple after using the Regenerist. I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous creams over the years...this is my favorite.  Feerls great and moisturizes well, especialy note a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes.  Does not leave a greasy feel which can be a problem under makeup.  Absorbs in nicely.  Seems to have evened skintone and eliminated a few chronic dry patches. Great choice for overall moisturizer/wrinkle reducer.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time and just L O V E  it !!!!!</li>
            <li> I only use Olay facial products. This one just doesn&#x27;t seem to do what the others do. In fact I&#x27;ve had breakouts since I started using it. I&#x27;ve gone back to the regular moisturizer. The seller was great though!</li>
            <li> I sort of like the scent, however, I am unhappy that there is one. I had a blemish that I had self-irritated and when I applied the cream, there was a stinging that I blamed on the scent.  I don&#x27;t think that face anything should have added scents. It does go on nicely and makes my skin feel soft. I am 28 and don&#x27;t have real signs of aging besides some faint smile lines and forehead crinkles, but prevention is the key, right! I have noticed that my slight lines seem to softening and the overall tone of my skin has been improving. I have been implicating some new exfoliation techniques though, which could be the source. I can say that I have also used Prevera cream and I really like it. I was sold by the advertising of Regenerist and will finish the product I have but, will be returning to Prevera. BTW, I never felt that stinging, which I mentioned before, with Prevera makes it seem like a more gentle product.</li>
            <li> Makes my face brighter</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some time and have found that my skin stays in pretty good shape.  I feel that I don&#x27;t look much older than I did five or ten years ago.  My skin is not very wrinkled for my age.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have enough budget for cream that are too expensive give this a try. I did notice that my skin have improved while using the cream definitely a must try.</li>
            <li> Can sometimes leave your face with white residue. Otherwise skin looks so much better sijnce I started using.</li>
            <li> The product feels good on my skin, altho I can&#x27;t see a big difference,,, will keep using it because of the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin, so I was thrilled to have found a lotion that was this affordable and  VERY moisturizing.  It goes on smooth and you won&#x27;t need to use a make-up primer if you use this product.   Now the major, HUGE problem with this product is that it makes me break out.  Every time I put it on, I wake up with itchy skin or red dots.  I am not talking about just on the T-zone, I mean every where.      First application, I noticed a slight tingly sensation and thought it was because the lotion was working (also the scent is pretty over-powering) ... However, gradually over the weeks, I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 weeks now, I noticed a major break out over my nose on my chin, even on my cheeks!  I stopped using this and the break outs went away...so if you&#x27;re reading this review, be advised that no, this product isn&#x27;t a miracle lotion....you get what you pay for.         So what if its super moisturizing..... your face will have so many red dots and bumps, its not worth it...ew!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use this product - reason: They test it on animals. I didn&#x27;t realize Olay still abuses animals for their beauty products. Not a good reason for animal testing.</li>
            <li> Price and delivery were too good. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything even those high priced named brands..... this is by far the best. A very noticeable improvement of my jawline!  My skin feels great! I swear by it! I will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> For the price this product is an excellent choice. It smooths wrinkles really well and I was pleased with that. I&#x27;m sure there are products that do an even better job but they wil be at much higher price. If staying on a budjet is important to you than this is produnt for you.</li>
            <li> I love this Cream just give it a shot, and you will love it too I&#x27;ll promise</li>
            <li> I think this poduct is great.  I love the way my skin feels and look.  Someone complimented me on my skin and ask me if I am using anything.  Says my face looks smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> This product did not agree with me.  I ended up with my face a swollen itchy mess.  I contacted Olay and they graciously gave me coupons for another product.  I hope I have better luck.  I don&#x27;t usually have allergic reactions to anything but this was the exception.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years as my night cream and I love it!  It makes my skin feel very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now. I was alternating the use of this Olay product with a more expensive skin cream for awhile. Now I just use the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream. I like the way it is absorbed into my skin so that when I put light powder on my face there is no greasy residue left to interact with the powder. I&#x27;m 61 and have always been a minimalist with make-up. I used to find coupons for Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream fairly regularly in flyers in the newspaper. I no longer see them for this particular product, or the coupons I do see have to be combined with an Olay product I&#x27;m not interested in. Finding it online saved me some money, and the delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and find it a great value for the money.  It has kept my aging skin fairly wrinkle-free.</li>
            <li> the regenerist is pretty good i do see a difference</li>
            <li> I USE IT AT NIGHT...MAKES ME SKIN SO SMOOTH..GREAT PRODUCT..BE NICE IF THEY COULD UNISEX-UP THE SCENT A BIT BUT ITS OK..STILL AWESOME FOR A VALUE TERRIFIC PRODUCT LINE. GO REGENERIST!!</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past when I lived in the desert and it was great. I now live in San Antonio and the moisture seems heavy at times but my neck and chest love it. I continue to use the product just not as much alittle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When we at  [...] read in Consumer Reports that Olay&#x27;s new line of products was one of only two which actually reduced the appearance of wrinkles, our jaws hit the floor and we raced to the drugstore.  Most of us are die-hard users of expensive products including Estee Lauder and Clinique.  Surely, the more expensive the product, the better -- right?    Wrong! Olay blew us away almost immediately.  It significantly reduced the appearance of wrinkles and increased the &#x27;freshness&#x27; of our skin. Our only wish is that Olay came out with a product with retin-A and hydroquinone (a skin lightener), but it&#x27;s sure to be in stores soon.    Thanks, Olay, for helping those of us starting over in love get back on the scene with confidence.</li>
            <li> I notice when I do not use this product.  My face appears dull and dry.</li>
            <li> Have been using for years in conjunction with the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum and have had great results.</li>
            <li> This product is produced and made by Proctor &amp; Gamble and works very well to sooth the skin and I have noticed a difference in my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> So I am a no fuss, barely any product girl who is 26.  I started to notice some fine lines on my forehead from squinting and furrowing my brow, too much stress in my life.  I just received this product in the mail and have noticed after applying the cream only twice, the lines have almost disappeared and my skin feels softer and healthier.  I will continue to use this twice a day and recommend you give it a try!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I am in my late 30s and have lived in the desert Southwest for five years; during that time I have noticed that my skin has aged significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product at night only. After two days I started to notice a difference and after three the change was striking. My skin is much smoother and more radiant.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT I&#x27;VE USED, SINCE STRIVECTIN D CHANGED ITS FORMULA</li>
            <li> I preface this review by saying that I&#x27;ve been using night cream for years and have fairly good skin (except for the areas around my eyes).  That said, I&#x27;m not sure this cream is any better than Regenerist Nightly Moisturizer.  I switched over because of all of the hype but haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference or improvement.  For those who are just starting a nightly moisturizer routine, this cream may be better than the less expensive Nightly Moisturizer.  But, I think I&#x27;ll switch back.  Both products are excellent.</li>
            <li> Bought it because it was recommended by Good Housekeeping together with other products to minimize wrinkles.  I&#x27;m sure Olay Regenerist Microsculpting cream gave me the allergic reaction even tho it does not have fragrance listed in the ingredients. Applying it only on my forehead up to the eyebrows to refine the wrinkles and along my jaw as stated in the jar.  After one week of use I developed itchiness on the forehead and jawline down to my neck, later I had red patches in those areas.  The forehead got better after one week but my jaw and neck allergies turned into red swelts and thickening and made my neck wrinkly.  This is the 3rd week of my allergic reaction and I have not been sleeping good because it is at night when it itches most.  None of the OTC corticosteroids have helped.  Complained to Olay and they sent me a coupon for one Olay Regenerist :(  Seeing a dermatologist this week.</li>
            <li> Can never go wrong with an oil of Olay product</li>
            <li> I use this cream all the time and I love it. Itkeeps my skin looking great. It keeps my skin feeling soft. I only use it at night and am very satisfied with the product.Olay has a great variety of wonderful products for people of all ages.</li>
            <li> I have combo/acne-prone skin, and have tried many moisturizers over the years.  NONE have been able to both keep my skin well hydrated and not cause more breakouts, until I found this gem.  Such a great product for a great price.  Will never stray again, which means a lot from someone who rarely purchases the same beauty product twice.  I think I&#x27;m on my 6th jar of this stuff, and a little goes a long way.  Great to use year round; enough to keep skin hydrated in the dry winter and not too heavy in the sticky summer - just perfect.  Even better/cheaper with the subscribe-and-save option on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year..in conjunction with the serum.my skin feels great..I have noticed firmer skin..</li>
            <li> Olay has always been an excellent choice for its kind of price. It smooths wrinkles really well and I was pleased with the result. I&#x27;m know that there are a lot of products that do a better job and have better ingredients but they will be triple the price. If you are staying on a budjet then this is product for you.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by describing my skin, issues, and desired effects and what I have experienced so far. I am 44 years of age with fair skin that would be classified as combination which is both sensitive and adult acne prone (I take an antibiotic twice a day to keep it under control). I am experiencing menopause with extreme hot-flashes which has only compounded my oily T-zone. I am told by people that \\&quot;I look good for my age\\&quot; (30&#x27;s rather than 40&#x27;s) but I notice small wrinkles around my eyes (crows feet) and what I would call creases around my mouth (laugh lines?) and a line that goes across my forehead (an expression line). I would like to have the crows feet disappear (especially since they are very light as is) and have the  lines around my mouth and forehead become less visible. As for what I have experienced so far-&lt;br /&gt;1. Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub: I really like the wash. It is a gel type wash not creamy. It is a very light scrub; without harsh scrubbing particles. It does have a very noticeable scent - I like that it isn&#x27;t medicinal but almost perfume like. After washing my face felt squeaky clean but not dry or tight. What I liked the best is it did not leave the feeling that I have oil or lotion on after I wash.&lt;br /&gt;2. Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream: This is the product I was very nervous about trying since it said nothing about being Non-Comedogenic. I have been using it sparingly and only at night. I chose to start using it only at night due to it being a cream - I was afraid it may be heavy and cause me to become oily. Neither has been the case. It goes on smooth and applying sparingly is all you need to do (a small amount goes a long way). I can&#x27;t say I have seen any results with my wrinkles as of yet (I have only used it 3 nights) but I have noticed a change in the softness of my skin and appearance of brightness; It felt wonderful on my skin from the first moment I applied it. It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth. The first night I used it I felt quite a bit of stinging on my face, but I left it on. The second night, the sensation was less and last night I felt little to no stinging. I have noticed my skin is a bit raw/sensitive feeling (I notice it mostly during exercising/sweating) or if I use a wash cloth across my face in the morning, but I hope this will cease with continued use. There isn&#x27;t any redness or visible signs of irritation. I can&#x27;t be sure as of yet but I think my complexion is clearing...I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts and the few I had have gone. It too has a noticeable fragrance, but again I rather like the scent and it goes away rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3. Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum: I was most excited to try this product since it says \\&quot;Dermatologically  Tested, Non Comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), Fast- Absorbing and Non Greasy. Suitable for everyday use for normal, dry, and combination skin\\&quot;. Plus it boasts results in just \\&quot;after 5 days\\&quot;. I could just copy and paste what I wrote above with the exception - I have been using this product during the day. As I mentioned above - I get very nervous using new products and start in baby steps. I plan to begin using as the directions instruct and apply these 2 products together; first applying the serum and topping off with the cream. The serum also leaves your skin feeling silky with no oily feeling at all. These products soak in instantly and you feel the results the moment you apply it. Now, lets hope to see results with the lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give it a month - and I&#x27;ll let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok - it is now March and I&#x27;ve tried the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for at least a month (in total time). When I first began using it on my face, I used it a week or so before adding the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum. After using the 2 products for aprox. a week I began to have small pimples around my mouth and on my cheeks. I stopped using both; let my face clear and began again with just the cream. After aprox. a week or so the breakouts started again. So, I stopped using the cream; let my face clear and started using the serum (alone). Again- my face broke out. By the time I figured out the products wouldn&#x27;t work for me....I missed the return window. Since I had to keep the products - and it is far too expensive to throw away, I use it on my neck/jaw line and between my breasts (twice a day). I haven&#x27;t really seen a change...but again...much too expensive to throw away, so I&#x27;ll use it in these areas until it is gone. It does moisturize well...and the areas look better with use, but nothing dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Since I did want to find something that wouldn&#x27;t break my face out and would help reverse time - I bought a facial cream and under eye cream by Patricia Wexler(Bath and Body Works) - LOVE it! NO breakouts...and most importantly it&#x27;s WORKING!! Intensive Night Reversal and Repair Cream &amp; the Intensive 3 in 1 Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensative/acne prone skin these Olay products may not be for you.x. a week or so the breakouts started again. So, I stopped using the cream; let my face clear and started using the serum (alone). Again- my face broke out. By the time I figured out the products wouldn&#x27;t work for me....I missed the return window.

If you have sensative/acne prone skin these Olay products may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products and when I viewed the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream, I saw where I could have discounts.  Amazon will mail it to me at the time interval I requested!  I just love Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for over 2 years, it has virtually changed my life.  I was always suffering with dry and red skin in the winter and then oily skin in the summer.  Once I purchased this cream which happened to be in the winter, my sore red sensitive dry skin immediately felt saturated with moisture without any stinging or acne breakouts.  I immediately felt happy and relieved to have found a cream that worked so well.  I continued to use this cream for months and began noticing my skin was softer and smoother as well, I was so happy to stop stressing my skin out with products that irritated and stung my skin.  I thought when summer came I would have to switch creams but it turns out that this cream was fine for me in the summer as well.  I found that I only use it at night and in the morning I use the Olay with SPF in the day.  In the winter I use this cream both at night and in the morning over my SPF.  It truly works for me.  I am 46 and still occasionally get carded, no lie!  I also wanted to add that I have purchased generic versions of the microsculpting cream and once I read that the ingredients are the same I felt confident to try them, and all the generic versions I have tried work equally as good.  I believe it is the ingredients of course being identical to olays version.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, has done wonders for my skin! Shipping was fast and packaging good, very pleased overall. Am glad I signed up for Amazon&#x27;s standing order program.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the expensive and drugstore skincare products and convinced that Olay products gives you the same results as the cosmetic counter brands. This is a great moisturizer at a great value! I have very sensitive skin and use this as a night cream. It makes my skin look better and even toned after applying! I paired this with the regenerist cleanser and get superior results.</li>
            <li> Olay has so many types of moisture creams, but for mature skin I recommend this for a night time cream AND a daily moisture cream under makeup. I find a remarkable difference in my skin since I have been using this product!</li>
            <li> I used this twice a day for 2 weeks, but switched to just using it at bedtime when my skin felt a little irritated.  After 2 weeks of use, my co-workers were asking me \\&quot;what I had done\\&quot; because my skin was so clear!    I hope they never stop making this product.  They have a lifelong customer here!</li>
            <li> This is my second or third jar of the Micro-Sculpting cream and I find it to be as good, if not better, than the Orlane products I was buying for the past 25 years.  Not only have I saved money, but my skin looks really good.  I never would have purchased an Oil of Olay product from a drugstore, but due to the positive feedback I saw on the Amazon website, I took a chance, and I&#x27;m not sorry.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it works for me. My skin is brighter, more moisturized and smoother. I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference in fine lines, I&#x27;ve been using the product daily for two months. However, I will continue to use the product because it is the only moisturizer that noticeably lasts all day, all night, AND I my friends continue to make comments on how good my skin looks. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very fast service, and I Love this product.  I have \\&quot;grown\\&quot; up with Olay and I won&#x27;t be without this product.</li>
            <li> Amazon you are the best it is amazing that you have everything a consumer needs for their shopping from the comfort of their homes and receiving your products is fast.  The only thing that I go to the store for now is for food everything else I order from you.  I just love shopping with you. THE BEST</li>
            <li> Package arrived damage. I had to run to walmart to purchase a replacement.This was a waist of time and money! A refund would be nice.</li>
            <li> This is literally one of the best skin care products I have ever used! I know some on here have talked about how the scent of this product is too much, but I personally *love* it. Also, I was shocked to read that some thought this product made their skin too oily. I too have oily skin, especially in the summer; however, I have learned over the years (FYI: I&#x27;m only 30, LOL) how to use best use moisturizers and other beauty products. First of all, one of the number one mistakes most women make is that they put moisturizer ALL over their face and nine times out of ten, you don&#x27;t need to do that! Also, it&#x27;s all about selecting the right type of moisturizer for your face - if a heavier cream like this one is making your skin \\&quot;too oily,\\&quot; then drop down to a lotion or serum that doesn&#x27;t have as many moisturizing agents in it, and that may work better for your skin type. Another tip with using this product: try using this cream on your feet after a pedicure - it will make your feet look and feel SO GOOD. I know it&#x27;s not \\&quot;intended\\&quot; for this use, but I tried it on a whim and it worked very well... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Who says that you have to break the bank to get a great face moisturizer??  This product is reasonable priced and does what $100 products claim to do.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as yummy as Lancome products but for 1/3 of the price, I can forgo the \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; scent.  That being said, Oil of Olay smells just fine and works great!</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is one of my favorite facial creams. I&#x27;m never without a jar of Regenerist. It is lightweight, but, at the same time, is deeply penetrating and helps to replace the natural soft feel of a more youthful complexion. I&#x27;ve tried many other product lines over the years, but Olay always seems to produce a great cream or lotion that equals skin care product lines that are many times more expensive.  I&#x27;m also impressed that, while this Micro-Sculpting Cream keeps my skin soft and supple, it never leaves a greasy or oily feeling. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe there are any miracles in face creams, despite what the marketers would like us to believe.  At 62, I swear I have tried everything in the department stores, including Creme de la Mer, and most of what is in the drugstore.  What it finally came down to was something that was adequately moisturizing but not greasy, and above all, non-irritating.  My favorite daily moisturizer is the Regenerist Serum without fragrance, and I use this one at night because it is heavier and a good moisturizer for the night.  This cream is soothing, non-irritating despite having a bit of fragrance (hardly any).  I&#x27;m quite pleased with it, and will buy it again.  Is it as good as a $150 face cream?  I&#x27;d say yes, it is.  Olay also makes many of the big department store brands, by the way.  I&#x27;ve bought Lancome, Lauder, Chanel, Clinique, many others, and with many I had skin irritations, couldn&#x27;t use them and returned them.      So this cream meets my criteria for a good face cream and the price is right!  I use the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush at night, followed by this cream and my skin looks great, I don&#x27;t know of anything better than this cream and you certainly don&#x27;t need to spend more.  As for the \\&quot;micro-sculpting\\&quot; aspect of it...don&#x27;t believe it.  If you want to improve your skin, use Retin A, good sunscreen, moderate your drinking of alcohol, don&#x27;t smoke, and take good care of your skin by cleansing it properly and moisturizing when necessary (it gets more necessary as you get older).  I can say for a fact that what you do in your youth determines how your skin looks when you get older.  If you severely damage your skin, there are no miracle creams out there, don&#x27;t get fooled into believing that.</li>
            <li> My skin is ok with most of the face cream. I don&#x27;t have pimple normally. But after us this cream it make me break out a lot. It cause my skin come out with a lot of small pimple with whitehead after 2 days of usage.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream makes my skin smooth and diminished my age spot and lessen wrinkles. Before I am using expensive products but it doesnt help to erase wrinkles but when I started using this product I noticed some improvement on my skin.On my age of 79 sometimes they thought I am only 68 and its a compliment and I appreciate it. So I recommend this product to my friends to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream.  It feels good going on.  Very smooth and silky.  Very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;If the product did all it claims I would definitely give it 5 stars and be happy to pay the cost, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for results, not fluff.</li>
            <li> I am skincare fanatic. I usually order my skincare online and don&#x27;t believe in drug store brands. I purchased this on clearance after Christmas. I was surprised by the effectiveness of this product. It leaves skin soft, smooth, and refreshed.  I havent&#x27; bought another one since I am back to ordering my skincare products. But I highly recommend this to those are interested.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong, so if you cannot handle scented lotion, do not purchase this. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin. After using the product, my skin started breaking out and I usually do not have any acne.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer a lot, not sure it firms anything up though.  Also use the Daily Regenerating Serum and the two together really make a difference with my *old* skin.</li>
            <li> very good product! I use it as night moisturizer, I love it   And my mom use it , she loves it so much</li>
            <li> I usually am allergic to most facial creams, cheap ones expensive ones but I have been using this product for about 5 years now and it still leaves my skin looking and feeling soft with out the allergic reaction.  It also has a pleasant sent.</li>
            <li> Over the last few months I began trying various creams to slow down Mother Nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw a coupon for Olay Regenerist in a local Costco I decided to give it a try. The cream feels pleasant as you put on, and the skin feels nice after the cream is on. It is absorbed quickly. I did not break up in blemishes like with some other creams that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it has a pretty strong scent. I really prefer all products I use too be unscented, especially if I have to use them before going to bed where the smell rubs off on the pillow and keeps me awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However due to the scent I don&#x27;t feel like using it on regular basis, and will not be buying it again. Olay, please make an unscented version of this scream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> This is one of my cosmetic staples.  It is an effective moisturizer and does reduce the appearance of wrinkles and loose skin.  The price from Amazon is the best that I have found.</li>
            <li> The cream is not for sensitive skin at all. If you have the same skin type, be aware of it. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife, Jan, has been using the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream for many years now and would not even consider using any other cream. Also, Jan recommends this cream to her friends and family without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND EAST PRODUCT IT IS OF THE BEST THING AND IT LEAVES THE SKIN HYDRATED AND SMOOTH. THANKS. ILOVE OLAY !!!!</li>
            <li> I always trusted Amazon, but now after ordering 2 Olay Regenerist Creams....2 because there was a rebate form at the bottom of the same Amazon page, I received the creams strangely wrapped in bubble wrap and tossed into an envelope.  They were NOT in their boxes...no directions...no UPC codes.  It made me feel that they were refilled...but with what?    After calling the company, I find out they are \\&quot;bulk\\&quot; shipments and not eligible for any rebates as indicated on Amazon and if I don&#x27;t want them I need to pay all shipping charges.  So now I ended up with a lot more of this product than I wanted, no rebate and very distrustful of Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> I am soo happy with this miracle cream! I noticed a result after a few uses. Makes my skin feel refreshed. I will buy over and over again! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Good price for this product.  It is important to be sure that when ordering face cream (or anything else) that the seal is not broken when it arrives.  That happened to me once for this product and I had to throw it away.  This time it was no problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different skin care products over the past 35 years or so and this one is the absolute best thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. I will never buy or even bother trying another facial moisturizer again (unless they stop making this one).</li>
            <li> I have been an avid Olay user since my early 30s - about 28 years now.  It&#x27;s a product that I trust, especially for my sensitive skin, but over the years, when the economy occasionally took a toll on our purse strings, I found that I would use the product super-sparingly to make it last longer.  Imagine how delighted I was when I discovered the subscription price on Amazon.com.  What a savings!  Now, I have my favorite moisturizer delivered to my home every other month, and I never run out.  By using the subscription service, I save approximately $10 a jar.  I highly recommend any of the Olay products, but especially the Regenerist line; and, I also recommend using the subscription service for even more savings!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer and wrinkle delayer.</li>
            <li> I have to admit - I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product. I have rosacea, sensitive skin with blackheads, large pores, oily skin. I was buying a $100 cream just for the rosacea which had marginal results. Within 1 week of using Regenerist, my pores became smaller, blackheads were disappearing and the rosacea calmed down. It doesn&#x27;t cure rosacea but it cools it off and reduces my redness. It has definitely made my complexion look younger and more important, healthier. Breakouts cleared up too!. I started using it on my neck and decolletage - I had ruddy skin on my upper chest. That calmed down within 48 hours. It&#x27;s a great product, highly affordable. I apply 2x a day, it&#x27;s not oily and leaves no oily residue and works very well with my mineral makeup. I can&#x27;t praise it enough.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a couple of years; good texture and you don&#x27;t need too much. I use it at night mainly.</li>
            <li> Just love this Olay moisturizer.  I&#x27;m 60+ with (of course) wrinkles and progressively dry skin.  I use this each night and my face feels supple and smooth.  And, naturally, I think it makes my skin look a little more perky.  Haven&#x27;t done any &amp;#34;before and after&amp;#34; photos, but, whether I do or don&#x27;t look better -- I FEEL better.  I&#x27;m on Amazon&#x27;s regular delivery program for this cream.  Strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is a terrific product.  I only gave it 4 stars, as I like my Olay Pro-X products better.  This is a good cream, it does work, but I perfer my Pro-X.  I&#x27;m almost 50 years of age, and I feel this product is for an age group of around 35 to 45 years of age...just my opinion though.  It is a good product, and you wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchased it.  I just perfer the other line better, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile and was pleased with it. Ordering from Amazon through the subscription plan, is a great convenience. No hunting for it and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It is my new favorite night cream.  My skin is very sensitive and many creams irritate my skin and leave my skin blotchy looking, but this cream has actually cleared up the blotchiness and has evened out my skin tone and improved the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this product, and the matching serum, for about 3-4 months now...and I love it. Before I was using Olay Total Effects(which is WONDERFUL), but decided to try the next anti aging product up, and that was this product. I have this product, the serum, the deep hydration regenerating cream, and the facial scrub. I love all the products except the regenerating cream. Its thick and heavy(I am going back to Total Effects for my moisturizer). But this Micro Sculpting cream and the serum are just amazing. I love it. The Micro Sculpting makes my skin soft, and most of all it gives it a beautiful glow. I normally use it right before bed, with the serum. But if there&#x27;s a day I don&#x27;t want to wear foundation, or I&#x27;m having a particularly good \\&quot;skin day\\&quot; then I use this right out of the shower because it minimizes my need for foundation. Its really just a good product. And importantly, the facial scrub that goes with it too is worth a check out. Most cleansers make my skin break out(same with moisturizers too), but this whole line of products are strong enough to keep my skin looking young and fresh, without it being heavy or irritating my skin. I will say though, at first the Micro Sculpting Cream can seem a bit greasy but its really not. Just work it in to your skin gently and let it dry. It only feels \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; the first minute or so, but I consider it more of a hydrated glow. Which I like. So definitely if you are on a budget and have sensitive skin, this is a GREAT option. I ONLY use Olay products, and have been since I was 21. Now I&#x27;m about to turn 28 and pretty much everyone I meet says I don&#x27;t look a day older than 21 tops. And I have two kids at home! This product is very amazing, eliminating all the stress related aging without weighing my skin down.</li>
            <li> I have tried many expensive skin creams, including La Mer (which costs a fortune), La Prairie, etc. A dermatologist told me a few years ago to use Olay Regenerist moisturizer. She said that for $20, it was better than the very expensive skin creams. I had used that for years, then this summer saw an article in Vanity Fair magazine about this product (Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream) as one of the four best beauty products. I tried a jar and love it. I use it every day. My sons (in their 20s are very choosy about their skin creams and spend much more than I) and they have tried this and like it too. I use it in the daytime (even though it has no SPF). It feels very creamy when applied, but absorbs quickly. It really makes my 66-year old skin look lovely. The price here on Amazon is the best I have seen. I have converted quite a few people. Definitely an outstanding skin cream and amazing value!</li>
            <li> I love using this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product along with Olay&#x27;s Night Time Moisturizer and have been using both as instructed.  It hasn&#x27;t been quite a week yet since using both products, but to me my skin looks better. I haven&#x27;t noticed any results with reducing fine lines yet, but I&#x27;m hoping for the best.  If not, I still love Olay products anyway and will continue to purchase them. I also use the Olay facial cleanser in the morning. I don&#x27;t like to use soap on my face because it dries my fair skin out. The cleanser is a great product, as well.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a softer scent.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0012J30LY Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, 1.7 Ounce]].  I have been using this item for the last two years as a night cream.  It is very easy to spread around your face with a small amount so that it isn&#x27;t greasy and you don&#x27;t waste it.  I have read many recommending reviews about the cream and I agree with them. It has kept my skin from getting more wrinkles (As I am rather senior) and very smooth.  I use several different day creams that have sunscreen, including other Olay Regenerist creams.  I highly recommend this item, particularly since it works well and is not expensive compared to many other face creams.</li>
            <li> I purchased \\&quot;Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream\\&quot; as a gift to my mother-in-law, and she liked it very much.  Her face is a little sensitive, so she tried a lot of cream, which doesn&#x27;t fit her.  When she tried Olay, it works so well to her.</li>
            <li> This cream is absolutely amazing.  My face is so much smoother and my skin just seems brighter than it used to be.  Also, I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive skin - I have to watch what moisturizers and makeup I use or I may break out.  I had no trouble with this cream at all.  I definitely plan to continue using this product and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> GEt this cream once and you will never rethink the slightly expensive price after using it once.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it proves to be worth. I dont have any wrinkles and my age doesnt show. Most of my new friend thought I was only in the late forties.</li>
            <li> I like this, it is thick and smooth and not greasy. I haven&#x27;t seen any real results and have used it for a month now. But will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Oh, I love this cream!!  It smells divine, not overpowering, but very soft.... and goes on creamy smooth. It takes about 5-10 minutes to fully absorb into my skin and it makes my skin feel great. I can use it day or night. I can put my makeup on soon after I apply the cream and it makes my skin a creamy-soft palette for my makeup. I would highly recommend this cream to anyone!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife after she had heard rave reviews about it. After using it,she swore she would never use anything else on her skin. As particular as she is about her face cream, it must be great. I will continue to order it for her.</li>
            <li> The seller service was excellent, but I did not like the product (no fault of the seller).  The cream was too thick and greasy, so I threw it away.</li>
            <li> It slowly works just takes a long time for results..</li>
            <li> Well...the only reason for me to write this review- just to make clear to High-end users- THIS CREAM IS NOT! even close to expensive creams..I have been using LaMer (my favorite), Arden, Lancome (Absolute is the best in that line), Chanel, Pevonia( for sensetive skin) and of course as many of you I was attracted to the recent ads, claiming that Regenerist is better than all expensive brands. Oh my...))) trust me, if your skin tried the BEST- it will NOT accept an imitation.I gave Regenerist 3 weeks of try- every...EVERY time I am using it, my skin breaks in bumps, next morning it feel very greasy and definitely not refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to make my story short- you can try it ( 20 dollars not such a big loss) but you will come back to your $300 cream-since ITS WORTH IT!)))</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream is a great moisturizer! In other reviews I&#x27;ve read, people have noted that it has a strong smell. I on the other hand don&#x27;t believe that. Maybe since I received it they changed the formula but it has a very faint fragrance that I like a lot. I am 18 and bought this cream to start preventing aging early on. My skin feels moisturized and refreshed after application. Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream keeps my face moisturized throughout the day!</li>
            <li> I like the cream and it works okay (if you apply it regularly) but I just do not like the scent.  The perfume is a little too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> The only moisturiser I like to use is OLAY Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. Best price I&#x27;ve ever paid. It was on Amazon.com  Thank you</li>
            <li> not only does the cream just linger on the surface of your face, but it also got all over my pillow. and trust me i used very little. it also made me break out so badly. through my teens i was fortunate enough to seldom break out but ever since i started using this product i had more pimples on my face than ever. i decided to perhaps give it some time but after about 1 month of usage i threw it away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old with extremely oily/acne prone skin.  Too busy fighting acne flair ups. I noticed the, once-was-a-fine line between my eyebrows. Looked more noticeable even without a facial expression. I noticed makeup would settle in that line. So I decided to start using an anti-aging cream or wrinkle eraser.  I came across a sample of micro - sculpting cream at Rite Aid. I applied it before applying my makeup. I went out that night and I remember looking in the mirror and was shocked to notice that my skin looked great than it had in a long time. I saw less pores, a more polished look and a smoother wrinkle.  So I bought a whole jar.  But this time I didn&#x27;t get the same results.  Well, I decided to try other brands since I felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting the result I first got with the micro- sculpting cream sample. So I thought, after I stopped, I could tell that it WAS giving me more of a youthful feel and look. That the other brands didn&#x27;t do for me once.  For my skin type. So i switched back, I still get oily at the end of the day, I don&#x27;t break out though,  feels like it&#x27;s working and It&#x27;s one of those creams that my face needs. Because nothing feels the same.  I&#x27;m still in search for something better....this is my number one for now.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS GREAT!!I have been using gthis for months now and I love it!I am looking forward to purchaseing more</li>
            <li> I have used many of the Olay products and had settled into the Regenerist ones for most of my skincare (love the night firming cream), but got this in my Christmas stocking and have left the rest of my daytime Regenerist lotions and serums by the wayside! (still using the night firming cream with the Micro Sculpting Cream during the day)  The texture of this cream is great - doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy even though it is thick, and makes my skin feel very smooth, a perfect foundation for makeup.  I am in my late 30s and have decent skin, so I am not looking for miracles when it comes to wrinkles, but I do see better texture and a more even tone since I started using this a couple months ago.  Not sure if it will hold up to summer heat, but have high hopes.  If it does get heavy feeling in summer I will switch back to the regenerist serum or the lotion (the one with the SFP and Self Tanner is great!)</li>
            <li> Have used this for several years now. Clearly helps skin and refreshes it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it one start for smelling nice and one star for not giving me pimples.  Other than that I do not feel that it is moisturizing or makes my skin look any different whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It is a very effective moisturizer, not greasy, no odor.  But as for the firming benefits....that I didn&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for this cream! It feels so silky &amp; powdery when touched. I have never found something like this that felt so good on my face.</li>
            <li> After trying this moisturizer I threw away my half used, old one.  And I am very frugal and hate to waste anything.  This one goes on so smoothly.  And a little goes a long way.  My skin feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay. I personally didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in this product vs. the other anti wrinkle creams I have purchased in the past for a much cheaper cost. It also really irritated my eyes especially at night time. I always woke up with sensitive eyes and crusties. I have never experienced that with other creams before so I am not sure what would cause it and I don&#x27;t have any allergies. Overall its probably a good cream, just not for me.</li>
            <li> For the money, this skin cream is the best that I&#x27;ve tried. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many. The Oil of Olay Regenerist line would be hard to beat at any price. It&#x27;s effective, but gentle, at the same time.</li>
            <li> I broke out terribly using this cream. I had red and white bumps on my face, especially on the areas that I applied a generous amount to. The first few days were fine and all of a sudden my face had a reaction. The smell wasn&#x27;t too bad, the overall texture of the cream was nice as well. It didn&#x27;t work, but I was able to get a full refund for the product so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times.  It is reasonably priced and does as good as any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to replace Merle Norman and decided to try Olay.  I could not be more pleased with how this cream glides on and how smooth and refreshed my skin looks and feels.  I also discovered that rubbing a small amount onto the tops of my hands makes them appear years younger!  I apply this product daily, then apply a thin layer of Olay Night Recovery Cream on top to keep my skin moist and comfortable all day.  I am sensitive to many products and fragrances and have had no issues with this cream.  Great product!</li>
            <li> love the cream, lasts forever</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit overpowering, however, it moisturizes well and leaves skin feeling really silky. Here is the list of ingredients for those who are mindful of parabens or just want to see if it contains anything their skin might be sensetive to. Ingredients:water,glycerine,isohexadecane,niacinamide,isopropyl isostearate,aluminum starch octenylsuccinate,nylon-12,dimethicone, tocopheryl acetate, panthenol,sodium hyaluronate,palmitoyl pentapeptide-4,carnosine,camellia sinensis leaf extract,aloe barbadensis leaf,soluble collagen,elastin,allantoin,stearyl alcohol,polyethylene,cetyl alcohol,sodium acrylates copolymer,behenyl alcohol,benzyl alcohol,caprylic/capric triglyceride,polyacrylamide,dimethiconol,peg-100 stearate,stearic acid,disodium edta,cetearyl glucoside,cetearyl alcohol,citric acid,c12-13 pareth-3,laureth-7,c13-14 isoparaffin, sodium hydroxide,ammonium polyacrylate,phenoxyethanol,sorbic acid,butylparaben,ethylparaben,isobutylparaben,methylparaben,propylparaben,sodium benzoate,mica,tin oxide,titanium dioxide,fragarance.</li>
            <li> I think that this works great on my skin!  I really like this cream!</li>
            <li> This is a great night creme or day if your skin is dry like mine. It helps my skin look moist and my makeup to go on better. My husband always tells me I smell good after I put it on. Nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for shopping on amozan, and every thing was in good order and at the time  went excepted,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products for many years; and, this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this one.  I&#x27;ve noticed a firmer, more \\&quot;sculpted\\&quot; appearance to my face having used this product for quite some time.  It&#x27;s not something that works overnight; however, with regular use, I do think it delivers on its promises.</li>
            <li> Wish i had experienced the acne breakouts that others complain about.  Used the product and that night could not sleep because i was burning and this was after washing it off right away! The burning lasted a couple of days; the swelling and red about a week.  Ok, so thought it cleared up and wore newly purchased, never used hypoallergenic makeup and within 48 hours same experience.  Saw dr. and was given a steriod shot.  Steriod shot does not work so now i&#x27;m on steroids(the pills).  Try googling \\&quot;steroids\\&quot; to see if you would want the potential side effects of a destroyed immune system, potential emotional breakdown, ER admissions, gaining 65 lbs and a whole menu of lifelong complications.  Am collecting all dr. reports, bills, pharmacy, loss of wage, etc.  Can you say \\&quot;Class Action Suit\\&quot;.  Any joiners?  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily on my face, I can put my makeup on right away or go to bed.  I&#x27;ve noticed the small lines on my forehead between the eyes diminish.</li>
            <li> This cream is a good choice and Amazon has a great price.  I have used Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream for a few years and most people are surprised to find out how old I am.</li>
            <li> Received the product very quick and much less expensive that buying locally.  Very pleased.  Have been using it for over a year and love the way it feels on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63; most people think I&#x27;m 45.  We don&#x27;t smoke, no heavy drinking and  live a pretty simple life: mostly organic, avoiding GMO when possible, hydrate well and exercise.  My daily skin care regimen for the past 10 years has consisted of Danne Montague-King &amp; Estee Lauder products.  Prior to that I used Mary Kay.  My current products work well for me.  As we all know beauty is in the eye of the beholder ... but it also comes as a part of your genetic background and/or through consistent healthy living practices.  I&#x27;ve never been that concerned.  These past few years, however,  I noticed that my &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; were becoming deeper and my smile lines seemed more etched into my face with dry ridges.  This really wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for me but they were beginning to give me the appearance of a frown.  For the past year I&#x27;ve been using both the Regenerist micro-sculpting serum and the cream, twice daily, over my other regimen.  I don&#x27;t use allot and rub the serum into where the wrinkles are the most pronounced and then thinly apply the cream all over.  My &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t nearly as pronounced and my smile lines don&#x27;t appear as deeply ridged.  My make-up rides on top of the products with absolutely no problem (Estee Lauder Double Wear) and I have a youthful, silky glow.  No break-outs, no pimples, no redness and I don&#x27;t smell anything.  I&#x27;m sure as I advance in years I&#x27;ll have to think about what other options and alternatives are available to me, but right now this seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> I am sold on this product.  I use it every morning and most nights.  A little goes a long way, and I feel it keeps my skin soft and younger looking. My daughter, in her late twenties, also uses it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream on Amazon and wanted to use it for some time before giving it rating. I have been using it for about 6 months and I have to say that this is great facial cream. After you apply it to your face for a while, your face will feel smooth and moist, not greasy and sticky like some other creams. I normally have very dry skin but this cream gives good moisture to the skin. After you washing off with facial soap, skin still feels moist and soft and stay moist for a few days even without using it. My skin is smooth and even tone although it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove wrinkles and fine lines. But I don&#x27;t think any topical cream can do that despite all the advertisement and claims.</li>
            <li> I inherited great skin from my mother and have been rather lax about taking care of it for most of my adult life.  Upon turning 50 last year, I started paying attention...and noticing little age spots, red,rough patches and even a few wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.  Uh-oh...should have been paying attention to this all along!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading tons of reviews for various product lines, I decided to try Olay&#x27;s Regenerist products.  I&#x27;ve been using the foaming cleanser for about 4 months and this cream and the night cream for over 2 months now.  I use them religiously - morning and evening - as I have all those years of neglect to make up for.  My skin is starting to have the smooth, even texture it used to have and those little wrinkles seem to be less noticeable.  Those little age spots have faded some, too - to the point my husband said something about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this line to just anyone.  I notice a lot of the negative reviews are from younger women who complain about it causing break-outs.  It is perfect for my 50 year-old dry skin, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan was to try this line for a few months and then try something different, but with the results I&#x27;m getting I plan to stick with the Regenerist line.  In fact, I plan to try out some of the other products now that I&#x27;m into the skin care habit!</li>
            <li> No doubt this is my best facial product,  l have used it for years and will still keep using it...excellent immediate results.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday which dries out my face (yes I&#x27;m a dude).  It was pretty bad that I needed some type of moisturizer to moisten my skin and counter the effects of constant shaving shaving.  I initially tried regular lotion but found that it sometimes stung when I applied it to my face and it caused me to break out.  My wife suggested to try her night cream, the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream.  This cream actually worked and alleviated my problem of dryness caused by shaving.  I apply it before bed and i did notice that my skin feels better in the morning.  I also started shaving my head with a razor and I also use this cream to moisturize my scalp.  I can&#x27;t comment about the disappearance of fines lines or anything since I am still in my 20&#x27;s, but I can attest to it&#x27;s moisturizing effectiveness.    It does a noticeable smell which I actually like.  I am only mentioning it because I understand that some people are sensitive to scents.  The scent, while noticeable is not that strong and usually goes away after a few minutes.    I started using the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream so much that my wife suggested I purchase my own.  I find that the cream is cheaper on amazon versus stores such as Walmart.  It even goes on sale occasionally which makes the price even better.  I like this product so much that I am thinking of signing up for the Subscribe &amp; Save program.    This cream is great, even for guys...</li>
            <li> I was only recently introduced to this product (am still finishing up my first jar).  Each time that I use it, I am more and more amazed at how smooth and soft my skin feels.  The lines appear to be minimized and the color appears to be much more healthy and glowing.  I highly recommend this product -- especially when the company offers a very generous rebate.  In all honesty, I am not sure that I would be willing to pay full retail no matter how good a product is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this kind of cream, a night cream that wasn&#x27;t too heavy and didn&#x27;t smell horribly. This cream smells great and works perfectly. After the first night of usage, my skin was kind of flaking. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s dead skin falling off, or what it was, but after the second night, my skin felt and looked wonderful. My sister now uses it nightly. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this product due to the heavy perfume. It made me ill.  Thankfully Amazon refunded my  money.    if you are sensitive to scents you will want to pass this product up.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for two weeks and my skin got so dry that it began peeling off and felt leathery. My skin is usually healthy. It took me three weeks to get back to my normal skin after I stopped using this cream. The claim they made is definitely bogus. Olay used to be at least ok until they keep coming out with so many lines of products. It&#x27;s hard to have good quality control that way.</li>
            <li> great product for the price. I feel like it makes my skin look and feel smooth with a natural glow. Definitely one of the least expensive anti-aging creams that works well. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Update: nowhere on this package does it say Night Cream. I didn&#x27;t know this was a night cream until I saw a magazine ad. I&#x27;m disappointed I didn&#x27;t know because now I have a cupboard full of night stuff and nothing for the day. The only downside to buying Olay products is the lack of directions for use across the board. I think they need to update their packaging to include some directions.    I don&#x27;t have problem skin, and I&#x27;ve always taken good care of it. So, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve gone from non-existent skin care to trying a product and seeing great results. However, since switching to the Olay brand, I&#x27;ve noticed simply fantastic results. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, and this product helps reduce the onslaught of tiny wrinkles and age spots that have started to invade my face. I have parched skin, and usually the thickest of hardcore moisturizers don&#x27;t even do the trick. With this, though it doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s specifically for dry skin, a small amount does the trick every time (I do use a Regenerist serum underneath, so that could be one reason it works so well). I didn&#x27;t even notice a heavy fragrance until reading reviews, so that isn&#x27;t a deterrent for me. I love how soft and smooth my skin feels. I look radiant even sans makeup. I&#x27;ve never been able to say that about my skin since it tends to look dull and lifeless.     My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t have an SPF. That&#x27;s a real downer for me since I have extremely fair skin and absolutely have to wear sunscreen when I leave my house. And, with my skin looking refreshed and dewy, I can go without foundation more often. I do not like having to swap it out with another moisturizer that has an SPF on the days I forgo makeup. But then, this is my first time using the Olay brand, so who knows, maybe there is a great moisturizer in this line that has SPF.     Overall, even without the SPF, I recommend this. I love the results I&#x27;ve seen with this brand, especially since I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to perform any better than the other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love this Olay Regenerist product so much that I have mine on set and save so I&#x27;m never without it. I&#x27;m a 54 year old woman and my skin is so soft, firm and wrinkle free from using this cream. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends in the makeup  business and they love this product as well.</li>
            <li> Speedy service from Amazon and I just love this product. Thank you very much, will definitely buy from you again.</li>
            <li> I recently saw a dermatologist who told me that this is the best product out there.....it is equally  high quality and effective when compared to the very expensive creams at the beauty shops and at the  dermatologist office</li>
            <li> This is better than the other Regenerist products I use.</li>
            <li> I got this because I had to switch up a lot of my normal products when I became pregnant. I had heard this was safe for pregnancy and wrote Olay who assured me that all of their products are safe for pregnant women to use. The texture is nice and it does help moisturize and doesn&#x27;t seem to break me out. Normally I prefer a retinol cream by Neutrogena but I can&#x27;t use retinol products while pregnant. This has been a nice substitution. I will probably switch back once I am able but for now it was nice to find something that is safe to use, helps with my dry skin and is effective.</li>
            <li> This is my first use of this product. I use and like other Olay products. I have used it for the required 5 days and while no miracles yet, I have hope my jawline will be returned to it&#x27;s former glory. (!)</li>
            <li> The first night I used this, I woke up in the morning to distinctly lessened lines and soft dewy skin. I use it at night sometimes and under sunscreen in the daytime. I&#x27;m nearly 50 and my facial lines were getting too noticeable. It has helped reverse the wrinkles by about 15 years.Love it!</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews and I wanted to see if it works.  I like it so far.  Not greasy, absorbs so I can wear it under makeup and has helped some with the fine lines.  I will keep using it and see where it goes from there.</li>
            <li> I just ran out of my first container of Regenerist about 1 week ago and my skin (especially under my eyes) is missing it like crazy already! The seemingly small amount lasted 6 months - even with both myself and my daughter using it. (She&#x27;s only 13, but had been using it as an eye makeup remover, so I&#x27;ll be hiding my next container from her.) I am 48 and a former sun worshiper, so I can also tell a good product that actually works from a lightweight that only someone under 25 would rave about. At any rate, this stuff has been a mini miracle worker for me and I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone ... especially those over 40 who cannot afford to experiment with a bunch of more expensive alternatives that may not even work as well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and was as described</li>
            <li> I found this product to OK for it&#x27;s sole purpose. My draw back it that it after applying on my skin it tends to rub into white balls after drying.</li>
            <li> This cream, used together with the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum, is really working, better than products costing three times as much!  My 50+ yo skin is feeling and looking smoother and the crows feet around my eyes have noticeably diminished.  I will definitely keep using these Olay Regenerist line products.</li>
            <li> I have always looked young for my age but when you are nearing 60 your face wants to take a swan dive to your feet. After reading a fair few reviews I made my purchase and used the Olay Micro-Sculpting Cream twice a day. It is a nice cream, a bit heavy but not bad. The scent is acceptable, not overly perfumed or chemical. My skin felt nice and I didn&#x27;t break out, huge for me as my skin is normally very touchy. After running out I didn&#x27;t think it was great enough to purchase again. After a week or so, that is when I noticed the difference. My skin looked older,less firm, puffier and didn&#x27;t have that nice glow. Now, I won&#x27;t be without it....ever. It saw me beautifully through 2 week in the desert and if I could get it piped into my home, I would bathe in it too.  Good job Olay and Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, I also have the 3 point daily treatment cream, same problem.  So can&#x27;t say at this point that I&#x27;m too excited with these products.  It just wont rub in it leaves white residue on sides of my face.  Problem with Olay is they have just too many different creams, lotions and potions and a lot of them don&#x27;t have SPF in it, you&#x27;re not sure whether you should use it as night, day or inbetween treatment just confusing!</li>
            <li> To oily. And makes my skin sting</li>
            <li> I love the texture, smell and the way it works.  it&#x27;s almost like one of those expensive brand facial cream products.  I will definitely re-order from olay.</li>
            <li> I am 25, sometimes I get fine lines on my forehead from stress or making faces while applying makeup (it comes and goes), and I get puffy bags under my eyes, but mostly I was looking for something to firm my cheek and jawline area to appear more youthful (I&#x27;m a very cheeky person! :P) I was using regenerist night firming cream before and loved it, but wanted something with a bit more oomph? ...Well okay, for firming, this is not it. I have not noticed any positive improvement in the firmness of my cheeks or jawline, BUT~ it really does make a lovely moisturizer. I have no fine lines on my forehead, my puffy eyes are gone, my skin seems brighter and has a nice youthful glow (under the eyes too!) I&#x27;ve also been using it on my neck and its making wrinkles disappear there too :) I will look for something else to add to my beauty regimen for firming my face, but I will keep using this as a moisturizer, I really like it, and I think it smells pretty!</li>
            <li> always use this  love it</li>
            <li> I will never buy any product of any kind that contains an animal product or that has been tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I am  not happy this advertisement took over the page I was looking at.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product before I saw it on Amazon.com. I got the best price and best deal here.  This cream is easily absorbed, and although I cannot compare it with many other skin creams, it seems to keep my skin well moisturized at night.  I do not use it during the day as recommended as it does not have an SPF.</li>
            <li> Great for combination skin type. I use a mix of Estee Lauder, Clinique, and SK-II skin care products plus this face cream, if I can only have one item, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t remember exactly when and how I started using this cream, but I remember the day when I knew it was &#x27;the one&#x27;. It was after one of my annual 12+ hours non-stop flights that normally made me look at least 5 years older thanks to the dry air and lack of sleep. During that flight I washed my face with just water then put on a good amount of this cream and repeated for another time. When I arrived at the destination and saw myself in a restroom mirror I couldn&#x27;t believe my tired and blood-shot eyes that my face looked so smooth and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can feel a bit heavy for day time use, but not that bad when you carefully apply only a very thin layer. I&#x27;ve been using it as a night cream and cannot be happier with the result.</li>
            <li> I have been using Clinique skincare for years. I use the 3-step, which gets a lot of haters, but it keeps my skin clear which is amazing since I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and reactions to stuff. I did notice that the DDML was just not enough moisture for me. I also wanted to start using something more anti-aging since I just turned 40. I was about to plunk down $60 on a Clinique moisturizer when my bestie and I were in Target. She swears by this cream, so in order to save some bucks I bought it. I am SO GLAD that I did! My face is more hydrated, more toned, it&#x27;s tightened yet more hydrated than its been in ages. My redness and scars are evened out more already in just one week. I have not had any initial reaction or breakouts, if anything my clogged pores are less so. My large pores around my nose are smaller too. I dislike the fragrance, but for this sort of performance, I will put up with it. If they come out with a fragrance free version, I&#x27;ll be a lifelong user. By the way, I don&#x27;t care about sticking a finger in the jar, after all, I wash my hands, then my face, so it&#x27;s clean fingers going in there anyway. I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone would put dirty fingers in a jar of moisturizer, but ok...</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, it hydrates well, it&#x27;s not too thick and it never breaks me out. The only negative is the ingredients ( I wish stuff that worked wasn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals) and the scent. It&#x27;s very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the age defying properties, I don&#x27;t think it actually does anything for the skin except moisturize and keep the complexion looking nice. I have few wrinkles but the lines on my forehead seem to remain despite using this product for a year consecutively. So, great moisturizer- that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Product caused major acne in all areas I used it! I have used many other skin care products and never had this reaction before. would not recommend this for others.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 6 months, after moving over from the Olay Night Recovery Cream (which I liked, but wasn&#x27;t available at the time). I read a review before I started using the micro-sculpting cream that a woman had acne trouble after using it, but most reviews were good so I gave it a shot. I love the results. At first, I also had some trouble with a breakout after using it, but this passed quickly once my skin adjusted. I liked the way it left my face feeling moisturized, but not greasy. I still use acne control face wash, and am prone to breakouts and over-drying, so a good moisturizer is necessary for my skin. Eventually, I started mixing it with my daily moisturizer in order to get the best of both worlds (SPF 30 and moisture) during the winter months. This is now the only way I use moisturizer (the micro-sculpting cream paired with the SPF 30/tint oil-free one) and it works wonderfully! I went on a weekend getaway without the micro-sculpting cream and my skin did not feel nearly as refreshed or firm by the time I got home. If only I can get Olay to make this same cream with SPF 30 and tint, I&#x27;ll be set!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it or anyone who spends hundreds and hundreds of dollars on those other face serums. Try this! It works great! After my first application I could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased one last year, she liked it a lot. This is definitely a great new year gift for her!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for the last 3 years now.....and have not once felt the need to change the cream in my 3 years of using it!!  That is a lot to say, considering the fact that all these years before regenerist other creams would work for a few months and then my skin would stop responding to the cream (too dry, too oily or cause acne) or some creams would work only in the summer and would not in the winter....before long I did not know what my skin really needed!!. Not to mention that these other creams were like 4 to 5 times the price of this jar and they were smaller jars than this one!!  Since regenerist....my skin looks great, I now know what my skin type is, it feels good every single day on my face anytime of the year and not to mention the price........this is the best of the best creams at the best price.  Please.....Olay, never take this cream off the shelf or make any changes to the composition of this cream....it will devastate me!! The other day I saw hubby dear stealing some and applying on his face....and said, \\&quot;oh, it is just my after shave!\\&quot;.  I just nodded and walked away :)!!  I had long sensed that he was doing so ...his skin looked so much better not to mention how quickly my jar was approaching the bottom!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Use it everyday morning and night and definitely see a difference. Face feels so soft. Will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I don&#x27;t think I look my age.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce the puffiness under my eyes and smells nice. Love how it feels on and how my makeup goes on so easily over it. I only use it in the mornings and within a few days of the first use I saw nice improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients, it is comparable to some very expensive anti-aging facial cream. The reason I took one star off is it contains too much fragrance, next time I&#x27;ll try the one without fragrance.</li>
            <li> I tried this one while hiding out from the world in Crisfield, Maryland for the Christmas-New Year holiday season with my relatives.  I like it a lot!  I am an \\&quot;Olay\\&quot; fan anyway, but have also used some other products.  I heard on the TV that the Olay Regenerist line was \\&quot;the best\\&quot; or something like that, so here is my story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice creamy texture.  It goes on your face smooth and it just really feels good going on.  It does have a semi-heavy scent blast that hits you when you put the first smear on, but it is not overwhelming and it seems to disipate quickly.  My preference would be to have it without the scent.  The cream just feels really good going on your face, kind of like putting your face on a cool satin pillow.  The cream soaks in really nice too.  It does not feel like it&#x27;s going to rub off on the pillow when you hit the bed 5 minutes later like some other creams do.  It also does not feel sticky like some creams do.  After 4 days use on my face and neck, morning and evening, my face and neck feel really nice and soft (silky soft).  I would think (based on my initial results) that this cream would have really nice results when used over an extended period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this cream holds its own against the other face products that I use, which include the Victoria Principal line, the Olay line, and the Seacret line (in the malls, from the Dead Sea). (I switch around between the products.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are really hard to read on this 1.7 oz red jar but they say the usual.  They tell you to apply in small circular motions and avoid getting it into your eyes and to rinse with water if you do. (Duh.  A no-brainer.) It also suggests that you focus on areas like the brow and jaw line.  Olay is a Proctor and Gamble product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is also important to tell you that I am NOT one of those 25 year olds who has young skin anyway and is trying to tell you how beautiful my skin is. LOL.  No offense, but the young whippersnappers haven&#x27;t had time to mess up their skin yet!  I am 60 years old and am very pleased with my skin.  It is equally important to tell you that I did nothing special to my skin until about 4 years ago when I began a regular face cream routine.  Those 4 years have paid off big time, so if you think it is too late or you are to old to bother, that is probably not true.  I have had plenty of compliments on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, I recommend a good quality face cream, before bed and upon waking.  This (and the other Olay products) seem to be worth your time and money.  When you do your face, include your neck too.  It shows.  Rub it on in small circles, like they suggest, and rub up (not down). Ohhhh, might I also suggest no frowning.  Only laugh lines are allowed :-)time to mess up their skin yet!

            <li> I have used for three weeks now.  I do see firming, but, doesn&#x27;t do well under foundation.  I use more at night.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd jar. No complains, it works fine as discribed on the package.</li>
            <li> I  love this stuff. It&#x27;s so great. It mosturizes well and makes your skin feel so good. No greasey or cakey, just right.</li>
            <li> I felt my skin very healthy after only 1 day, I totally recommend this product. Before trying Olay I was a fan of Anew from Avon, but this one is way better! I&#x27;m happy with the results and I will definitely try more Olay products.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure how to rate this product because it has its pros and cons. On one hand it did help firm and uplift my skin. But after a day of using all over my face I got horrific acne. So I say if you have acne issues this product is not! I repeat not for you! If you do not have such issues though, I&#x27;d say this was a great product to use for firming your skin as for wrinkles? Not a chance. I have been using this around my eyes for months and not one small difference to the fine wrinkles around my eyes. So overall great for firming skin if you are not acne prone, but ineffective for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After using this item for 2-3 weeks I saw a noticable difference in my face around my nose and neck areas.  Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent night moisturizer.  Non-greasy.  Leaves skin feeling nice.</li>
            <li> i always recamend olay products. it leaves my skin soft. it is a very good moisturizer leaving me with younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I can no longer trust reviews from this website.  I have been researching reviews for 2 long days and I am unhappy with what I have found.  I looked mostly at 5 star reviews and a few 4 star.  I find the history for these &#x27;reviewers&#x27; suspect.  They apparently buy every product on the market and they are extremely easy to impress.  Either that or they have set their bar very low.  If you seriously depend on the reviews, I would play close attention to them &amp; check their history.  Good Luck.</li>
            <li> I use the cleansing Regenerist system and I love it, especially the night cream. Something in this Micro-Sculpting cream makes my face very red and irritated looking so I had to quit using it on my face. Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to something in it.  On the good note, I love to use it on my neck. It doesn&#x27;t irritate it and it seems to really help with the sagging! If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin it will probably work great for you.</li>
            <li> I like this product, usually use this at night before going to bed and thinks it helps to make my skin look better. It definitely moisturizes my skin and feels softer.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the night repair cream, and I am very pleased with Olay that it gives me the moisture and softness that my dry skin needed. I am now an Olay addict. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Have used this before.....less expensive here than the local store.  Feels good and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims to do. I like the way my face looks, and feels. I will never put anything else on my face,</li>
            <li> Didn’t change my skin in the slightest not even moisturizing. I’m still searching for something that will make a real difference. Probably never find it though.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  I use Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream day and night.  Very light, not greasy.  You should try it!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY moisturizer I can use that won&#x27;t break my skin out. I have naturally oily/acne/breakout prone skin and this product works for me without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this from Costco. I am 32 years old and I&#x27;m starting to get fine lines around my eyes. I was really excited to try this product because it was my first time buying an &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; cream. Unfortunately, after using it twice my face broke out really badly all over. I felt like a teenager all over again. I will be returning it. The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because I have sensitive skin and therefore break out when I put sunscreen on my face and other thick moisturizers so it&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s the cream or if it&#x27;s just me. I&#x27;d say if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and you aren&#x27;t prone to breakouts then go for it.</li>
            <li> This is a great face moisturizer.  I feel it minimizes lines on the face and neck, great for aging and lines.</li>
            <li> I us this product twice a day on sagging skin I love it it seems to be making a difference&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS ITEM IN THE PAST AND IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCAHSE THIS</li>
            <li> The ONLY problem, at least for me, was that the cream irritated the skin under my eyes.  The skin actually turned pink and wrinkly.  It took about 4 or 5 days of me putting Hydrocortizone cream under both eyes to finally get rid of the pink, wrinkly skin.  So when I use the cream, I put it on my entire face and neck EXCEPT right under my eyes.  Bummer though, because I wanted something I could use under my eyes which is an important area.</li>
            <li> Ok I wanted to try olay one more time, since I&#x27;ve spend thousands of dollar on their products but never really see what the hype is about. But when I buy olay products I usually buy 4-7 different cream at the same time, but couldnt focus on using just one since I never fully see the result of one product ( maybe I&#x27;m not patient enough) if I use a product for 3-4 days and I don&#x27;t see extrem results I don&#x27;t use them anymore lol yes I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s but from reading those comments every one here is at least 35 year and over older than me so their skin is different and that&#x27;s why they see quick results my younger looking skin is tougher to tame with those cream so I give up, no more wasting my good earned money on non sense cream.</li>
            <li> I like this cream, it really shows a lift of my face skin. my skin is smooth and silky after use.</li>
            <li> I compared the price in my local stores for this item and it was almost half price on Amazon. It came quickly. The cream feels real nice going on. It smells nice and my face feels good.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay products my whole life. My mother used the original pink Olay cream. I really like Regenerist. It does what it says it will, and my skin looks smooth and young.</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  It has a very silky feeling going on and my skin feels great.  I won&#x27;t mention product names but I like this SO much better than the last 2 moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried ... I&#x27;m staying with Regenerist!  Also a very reasonable price for the amount of product in this jar, and it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of product to do what you want it to.</li>
            <li> I wanted a moisturizer that also had a wrinkle-fighting ingredients in it.  I am in my 30&#x27;s and was looking for a prevention product as I am beginning to see fine lines in my forehead and around my mouth. I also didn&#x27;t want to spend over $100 on department store cream.  I really like this product so far.  It moisturizes, firms, and has a light scent which some people have complained about, but I find ok.  I like that I can get it cheaper on Amazon than in other stores and it is delivered to my door.  The company I ordered it from sent and delivered as promised.  I plan on ordering this cream from the same company again when I get low.  Love Olay products.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I do not use night creams, and I do not use this product regularly.  I use it as my Winter time  moisturizer when I go out at night.  I don&#x27;t use it during the day because it doesn&#x27;t have any SPF.  Therefore, I can&#x27;t comment on its long term effects.  But I have to say, it does have pretty decent instant effects.  It does plump up my facial lines and wrinkles, and minimizes them better than any other drugstore wrinkle cream I have used so far. (And I have tried several).  I will most likely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is a good daily face cream for the price - not to thick so that you can easily add your sunscreen without looking oily. Only thing I would advise is making sure you purchase the fragrance free version - which this was not.</li>
            <li> Ive used many products and this one feels the best. The smell is not overwhelming and the results seem good. Amazon has it pretty well priced and I think its a good deal overall.</li>
            <li> I love love love the way this makes my skin feel!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and I think it is great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it works. I have used Regenerist moisturizer for many years(when I could afford it)the price you had did help.</li>
            <li> I have been using oil of Olay products for years and I love every single product. The only thing is that they are kind of expensive-but worth it. I will be 57 on Friday and people say I don&#x27;t look my age. I say it&#x27;s because of oil of Olay!!! Thank you so much for a great product.</li>
            <li> THEY TEST ON ANIMALS. INGREDIENTS HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE CANCER.  The two big reasons I just told you, other than that the tingling sensation mentioned by other reviewers is from the cream sucking all of the moisture out of your skin, and I mean all!!</li>
            <li> woks great, and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin</li>
            <li> Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream, I am very Impress, with how it looks on my face after I have applied it on. I don&#x27;t wear make-up, therefore, Regenerist Micro Scu;ping Cream is the perfect cream for me. And another thing, I only wear-it at special times, and  as a result my face always looks fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I just love the way this makes my skin feel and look. Never seem to be disappointed with Olay products.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, so I got a pigmentation spots:    I believe it happened when I was wearing glasses at a day time when I walked under the sun.  At night I&#x27;ve noticed the brown spots of pigmentation, that took shape ) of my glasses.(looks like a shape of under glasses line).  Now I ve been trying to get rid of these spots and nothing helps.  It looks like this OLAY product does not control melanin balance for the skin.  My co-worker suggested for me to use \\&quot;Clean and Clear\\&quot; product to brighten my skin.  So, I just ordered them and it remains to be seen...  I would not recommend this to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for one week exactly. I like the fact it does not make my skin itch or feel tight after it has been on for a while. This product does not have a \\&quot;smell\\&quot; which is a deal breaker for me.  My skin feels soft and I use this twice a day.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product with other two regenerist products: regenerist cream cleanser and regenesit serum fragance free day cream. After 3 months of giving birth my face started to change I think because the water and weather here in tx and cause of the hormonal change as well. My face was dull, dry and flaky, it has never been like that. I was desperate to find a solution so started to try baby lotion, vaseline, aquaphor, etc to mosturize my face since my face moisturizer wasnt working at all. My sister sent me an amazon gift card for mothers day so I decided to buy the 3 products since they say it helps to regenerate the skin cells and the microsculpting helps with firmness, elasticity, wrinkles and even your skin tone I said to myself i will give it a try. I started only a month ago and I have no more dryness,dullness, flaky skin..my skin is firmer,spots and wrinkles are less noticeable and have a healthy glow. I am very skeptical about beauty products in general and even more when they claimed to help with wrinkles and un_even skin color; but I have to admitt my face returned to the way is used to be before pregnant, better yet my skin glows, and I look younger than before. Im 36y old and people always think Im 25y so I always take care of my face so they keep on thinking that...these products have helped me a lot</li>
            <li> I received a small sample of this cream when it first came out when I was in my mid 20&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I spent some time in tanning beds for a few summers when I was in college. I started noticing fine lines around my eyes and deepening smile lines when I was about 24. I started looking for a good anti-aging cream as a preemptive measure against wrinkles before it&#x27;s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: I&#x27;m very particular about the way products smell, especially when I put them on my face. This one has a pleasant scent that&#x27;s not too strong and doesn&#x27;t linger, much better than the elmers glue or plastic like smell of unscented lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: It has a light, silky feel on my skin. It&#x27;s not oily, but still retains my skin&#x27;s moisture (thanks to the glycerin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value: I&#x27;m pretty frugal and normally wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $10 for skin cream, but my experience with it has been pleasant and it only costs about $5-6/month. I tried a $60 face cream before this, but couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, so I only used it for a couple weeks - complete waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I can&#x27;t say that it has actually prevented any wrinkles, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones since I started using it. It retains my skin&#x27;s moisture all year, so I don&#x27;t have to switch from a lighter cream in the summer to a heavier one in the winter. The advertising is very appealing and I believe that it&#x27;s a better moisturizer than the $150 creams (I would never pay that much to find out). I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a better anti-aging cream than others, but keeping your skin moisturized is the easiest defense against aging.</li>
            <li> Have used it for several years. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Less expensive if you get it&lt;br /&gt;on autoship. I need a new one about every six months. It&#x27;s the best (and best price)&lt;br /&gt;than all the others from fancy stores and spas that I&#x27;ve tried. They now make an&lt;br /&gt;unscented one, but I like the fragrance. I use it at night, and if I&#x27;m feeling dry, I&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;use it again in the AM as a day cream. One jar and you&#x27;ll be hooked too...</li>
            <li> I am so surprised to see the results and quality for product. My skin is clear and fresh again.   I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would have been better than what it was. I have went through 4 bottles of this and I have not seen a change so I quit using it</li>
            <li> Always a good product. Used for many years.</li>
            <li> I litterly got addicted to this cream!!</li>
            <li> WOULD NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE FOR MY BEAUTY PROGRAM AND WHAT A GREAT PRICE FOR THIS HIGH QUALITY ITEM  RECOMMEND TO ALL</li>
            <li> I have acne scars and sun tan in my face and hands. so I use kojic soap to get rid of my pigmentation scars and sun tan and as this soap really makes my skin super dry, I started using olay regenerist cream for about a week now and my skin is well moisturized and even more as  I am in my mid 30&#x27;s so started getting winkles and this cream is definitely helping to make it less visible. my skin is sensitive and acne prone and this cream doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li> I mostly use the micro sculpting cream at night as it is a little heavier than the DNA Superstructure cream with sunscreen I use during the day. The Micro Sculpting Cream is moisturizing without being heavy and has a pleasant, light scent.I  am a big fan of the Regenerist line and highly recommend Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li> I haven’t been using this long enough to attest to its wrinkle-reducing properties.&lt;br /&gt;However, I could almost immediately tell a difference in my skin texture where I applied it on my cheeks, they are so much softer and smoother. Even my not-too-observant husband remarked on it! I was afraid it would smell like that yucky pink lotion my mom used in the 70s, but it is nothing like that at all, very light, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> i use it because it works</li>
            <li> I really like this cream and hope I&#x27;m not deluding myself that it softens lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Regenerist is an OK choice for an inexpensive cream.  I haven&#x27;t seen any increase in my skin&#x27;s texture or firmness over use with time though. I found that it does work better when mixed with a drop or two of Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum--but then any cream&#x27;s benefits would be boosted from this addition.. Bottom line:  There are other much better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have been super happy with it since day 1. There is a noticeable difference right away and even more so over time. If I haven&#x27;t used it for a day or two, I can absolutely tell. No one ever guesses even close to My actual age.  :-)</li>
            <li> This cream really helps me around the eyes, I&#x27;m much less wrinkled than my peers. I&#x27;ve just started applying it to my entire face as an aftershave balm. This is high quality cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that this works better than $150.00 creams so I decided to give it a try.  I like it a lot.  I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are talking about when they say they don&#x27;t like the aroma.  I find it has very little, it&#x27;s not a bad scent and I can&#x27;t smell anything while I&#x27;m wearing it.  I had to put my nose to the jar to smell anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good cream if you have sensitive or combination skin....or dry skin. if it is oily all over...it will be too heavy for you. not for teens or early twenties... its good for more mature skin and you will love how your skin will stay moist for a long period of time.....I use it all over my face even around my eyes and I normally can not do this with just any face product cause it will sting and burn my eyes.....not this one! I am  impressed!!! so if your looking for something that will help firm and minimize wrinkles and not harsh on the skin and easy to find ...this is it!!I gave it a 4 rating because I do not care for the heavy container and the lid...but product inside is really good!</li>
            <li> Initially put off by price but wish I&#x27;d tried sooner - would have saved money from trying products that don&#x27;t work.  With this, skin showed almost immediate improvement - even more with time.  Pleasantly scented and initially soothing, this cream can also be put on over other (at least partially absorbed) skin products.  Great results - Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Arrived in two days.  I use this as part of my Olay day.  It is fresh and clean, not greasy, to the touch and leaves a smooth surface to apply make up.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Like so many, I have tried countless creams and serums only to find I&#x27;ve wasted money again on wishful thinking and broken promises.  After reading all the positive reviews, I bought my first jar of Regenerist.  Been using it faithfully morning and night for about a month and I&#x27;m in love with this stuff!  I&#x27;m 53 and refusing to grow old gracefully.  The laugh lines on my face have been dramatically softened and my overall skin texture has improved dramatically as well.  I&#x27;m a now a believer and a forever customer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product without thinking about who the intended audience was to be directed at. I am in my early 20s and I bought this product as preventative so I can stay a head of the game when it comes to aging skin. It&#x27;s great, but my skin is already oily as it is. I used this product as a night cream and I applied it at night, when I woke up in the morning by the my skin was really oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did nothing for my noticeable large pores so if you&#x27;re looking for a product that minimizes them, sadly this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work for the older ladies who seek younger looking skin or even people my age who have drier skin than I who are looking to prevent aging skin, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me. Also, after the third straight night I applied, my skin became really sensitive to the product causing redness as well as minor breakouts so I had to cut back on the usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as improving wrinkles, I cannot comment on that for I do not have any. I was using this product as a preventative.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream last week use it everyday, the scent is annoying and on day 5 gave me 4 zits.  Will continue to use until finishes.  I will report any new changes to my  skin.  I bought it because my skin is very dry, and with hopes on it improving the jaw area.</li>
            <li> This product is a great deal for the price.  I believe it works as well as much more expensive department store products that make the same claims.  I have sensitive skin and rosacea, so was pleased when I found something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks but I can already see a difference in my skin. The B3 in this product is what I needed! This product works much better than the last cream I tried. I&#x27;m excited for long term results!</li>
            <li> I have always used this product.</li>
            <li> I was using this cream for over a year, bought it several times, &amp; over time I started to realize that it actually made my skin DRIER.  Didn&#x27;t fully realize it until I stopped using it &amp; switched to something else.  Try another cream; this one is cheap but not worth it.</li>
            <li> it burned my skin had to wash it off immediately</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have no reaction to this project.</li>
            <li> I love it and so does my FWB!  Seems to lighten up those dark bags and the scar on my face too!  A+++++ 5 GOLD STARS!</li>
            <li> Close to 5-star, if it exceeded the competition. Over the last 40 yrs I&#x27;ve been  a Revlon wholesale rep, an individual Mary Kay rep, and a long-ago Olay loyal -- they all have comparable products to this moisturizer.  But this one feels good, absorbs quickly, does a great moisturizing job (even through bouts of tanning).  After using it now for 4 years, I really believe through Amazon&#x27;s pricing, this is one of the best values on a great product, especially factoring in time saved using their Subscribe &amp; Save plan.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. Very drying to the skin and leaves a sticky feeling to the skin. I also broke out from this product but my skin is extremely sensitive. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon!!</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist cream is a wonderful, light feeling moisturizer that I use both day and night.  It leaves my skin hydrated without that heavy, my skin can&#x27;t breath feeling that some moisturizer leave you with.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is just your run of the mill moisturizer. It&#x27;s what I use when I run out of my good stuff. It does the trick, but would not use it regularly. It&#x27;s not super hydrating and I have very dry and flakey skin.</li>
            <li> It really helps dry skin. It made my skin feel smooth. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I thought it had retinol in it because that is what I was searching for in Amazon...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very moisturizing but a little much for the summer. it made my skin much smoother for sure. best cream i had in a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old.... or I should say young! People who don&#x27;t know how old I am are always surprised to find out my real age. Usually they say I look 10 years younger than I am. I have always (since i was 13 yrs old with dry skin) used Olay products and switched to Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream when I hit the half century mark. Makes my skin feel great although it is not a cosmetic surgeon in a jar. Not sure I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in the fine lines or elasticity but will continue to apply this morning and night because I trust Olay with my skin care.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product love how you can subscribe and get even a better deal this is a very good product will continue to have it automatically sent to my home with is great price and quick service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream for years. It has a heavenly texture, subtle, but very nice smell and has maintained my facial skin to the point most people find it hard to believe I am 59. I&#x27;ve given it to my daughter and niece who are in their early 20&#x27;s and early 30&#x27;s. They both love it and neither of them noticed much a fragrance to it. They just love the texture and fell and how well it maintains their facial youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When someone puts in a scathing review against a product based on their own ill-health or over-sensitivity, ignore it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in April. I&#x27;ve seen it advertised on TV so I wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I use a couple of other Olay products &amp; really like them.&lt;br /&gt;Problem with this product &amp; 1 other that I ordered is, they never arrived !!!&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for a refund now....</li>
            <li> Works better than more expemnsive ones. Olay&#x27;s products are far better for you and your pocket book. Have been using them for some time now and found this to be true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed no change in my skin. I have better results with plain old coconut oil and using baking soda to wash my face. It didn&#x27;t make my face break out so that was good. My face did feel moisturized. My biggest annoyance is that there must be a mask like film because it flakes up my bb cream. It&#x27;s fine if I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, but I can not put it under makeup or I look like my skin is pealing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking younger already. This cream smells nice and goes on smooth. Isn&#x27;t oily either and feels very light weight.</li>
            <li> This product was far too oily for my taste and it always dried and left a white smear of cream, which was embarrassing and unsightly. I&#x27;m 24 and was trying to get a bump ahead of the competition when it comes to skincare but I guess you really do have to be in your 40s for this product to work.</li>
            <li> Having white skin that just doesn&#x27;t handle the sun well I started using the Olay Regenerist line a year or so ago. It has really lessened the crows feet around the eyes and makes my skin feel great. It isn&#x27;t an instant fix but you will def notice the moisture level in your face right away.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I get the same results as I do on products that costs hundreds.</li>
            <li> WIfe loves this product. Also bought the All Day Moisturizer with this and she loves that as well. She said this was a very good price. I have no idea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even finished with my first jar and my skin looks radiant and feels soft !! My mom swore by oil of Olay and when she passed at 87years young her skin was glowing !give it a try what have u got to lose :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few months and skin has drastically improved.  My whole family uses it from 30-60&#x27;s.  Great for anyone.</li>
            <li> Only been using this product for about 2 weeks, but it is very moisturizing, and does seem to somewhat &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; my face temporarily. Anxious to see long term results.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but I don&#x27;t see any difference at all. It isn&#x27;t irritating to my sensitive skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the scent.  Too strong.</li>
            <li> they promise on the commercials that you will see results in 5 days and it&#x27;s true. I can&#x27;t say that for any other product at any price</li>
            <li> This does not make me look like Brad Pitt - But it helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without Olay Regenerist cream! I have very sensitive skin, and this cream is a life saver. The skin around my eye was always so dry and sensitive in the winter before I started using Olay. Page small amount goes a long way. One jar lasts 3 months, if you use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Just love this product.</li>
            <li> Smells way too strong for me. It&#x27;s a little thick but I could get over that if it wasn&#x27;t such a strong fragrance. Wish it came in unsented.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be sensitive to face creams. I have combination skin so this one is too rich to apply to my nose.</li>
            <li> I use this product everynight and have been for a long time.  It give the skin a nice feeling not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife via the subscribe and save plan here at Amazon. This product is good, subscribe and save is good, Amazon rocks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that after 35+ years of gazing at her angelic countenance, whatever she is doing, she&#x27;s doing it right, and this product has always been a requirement of her daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years and I am very satisfied with it. My skin is no longer dry, flaky and red. I have had many positive comments and people always think I look younger than my actual age of 51.</li>
            <li> I really like the product. The pot of Olay is very tiny. I will cancel my reoccuring order. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> While somewhat moisturizing, it did nothing to firm my skin. I used it nightly, after washing my face, toning, then using the serum in the same line. After a month, there was no difference. I switched to organic sweet almond oil, and saw more results from it in just three days. I have just ordered frankincense essential oil, as well as an immortelle blend that I plan to add to the SAO. I&#x27;ve heard of much better results going this route than to keep using these supposed miracle creams. I gave it three stars only because it did provide some moisture and didn&#x27;t break me out as much as some products have. The shipping time was adequate.</li>
            <li> This is alright if you&#x27;re on  a budget when comparing other high costing creams. I like the Pro-x  hydra firming cream better than this one but this one is still pretty good. Pro-x results are sooner than this product. All their products have to be used daily or every few days, otherwise you lose your results. They do work though! I have a pretty dry dehydrated face and can tell a huge difference with all of the Olay products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for four years.  I remember that my lines around my eyes and mouth greatly reduced within weeks, and it has stayed very minimal ever since.  No one ever guesses I am in my mid-thirties.  Also, it makes my face feel very smooth and not oily.  I recommend this to anyone in their 30s.</li>
            <li> Having been buying this for my mom for years. She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this!!!  Well worth the money. Skin feels softer, less dry, and I swear it gets rid of fine wrinkles, just as it said it would (I never believe advertising, but this seems to work!). Feels nice and light on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream at night for several years. It goes on very easily and has no fragrance.  I am 69 years old and people often ask me what I do to keep my skin looking so nice.  In addition to Olay moisturizers I do my best to avoid having the sun shine on my face.</li>
            <li> Give the gift of wife, like, we can see reduce wrinkles, perfect products ~</li>
            <li> This is as the reviews suggest a really good cream. It thick and applies easily and keeps my skin hydrated for a long time. It may be a little too creamy for oily skin tones or if your living in really humid climates. The package arrived on time and nicely wrapped up so a trustworthy seller.</li>
            <li> This works Great would buy again.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Microsculpting Cream does what it is advertised to do.  This is the third or fourth jar that I have had, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it from Amazon, and Amazon&#x27;s price is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive facial creams and lotions and they either didn&#x27;t work as well, or for the money they were no better.  The Microsculpting Cream is a rich cream that doesn&#x27;t go on heavy, but has just enough moisturization for my combination skin without being too much or leaving my skin too dry.  The best feature of the cream, for me at least, is its sculpting ability, especially around the jawline.  After a couple of weeks of use, I can always see my jawline tighten up enough that it&#x27;s noticeable.  At 66, that&#x27;s definitely worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose to get the scented cream just because I enjoy a little scent to cosmetic products, but it is available in unscented.  It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot for one use, so this lasts a good while. Since I have a mild case of rosacea, I put a thin layer of Finacea lotion (from my dermatologist) on first, then the Regenerist Cream.  It&#x27;s good for the neck, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream reduces the look of up to 10 years of wrinkles in just 4 weeks&amp;#34;... or so says the copy in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles at this point, but I do have a few. I mainly got this because I&#x27;ve had dry skin this winter, saw this as a Lightning Deal, and figured I&#x27;d try it. I don&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;ve stuck with it for a while just to check the claims, and the places I put this look no different than the places I use other moisturizer. I don&#x27;t look 10 years younger. I don&#x27;t have fewer wrinkles, except due to the moisturizing effect that almost literally any lotion or moisturizer provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this really would work for you, or maybe you&#x27;d be so filled with happiness endorphins after applying it that you literally begin aging in reverse. If so, good for you. If you&#x27;re like me, I&#x27;d recommend a less expensive moisturizer.</li>
            <li> prodcut is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the seller was so sweet too! I highly advise you buy from him! wonderful product and wonderful serice, what more could I say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is also great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> this is fantastic.  It really does take years off your skin</li>
            <li> My skin looks great. I see a noticable improvement in the softness and smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Moisturizes very well.  Not sure if it really is doing any &amp;#34;micro sculpting&amp;#34; but people usually think I am about 10 years younger than my real age. . .</li>
            <li> This is an okay product.  I used this product for at least a year and I did not see the results as describe on the package.  The only result was my face was very moisturized, but fine line around my forehead was still apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not accidentally keep this product open over night because it will turn to gum paste, which wncorage me not to purchase this product in the furure.</li>
            <li> I used to be an Elizabeth Arden woman---then financial reality hit and I shopped and switched to Olay...and ever since my 40&#x27;s (I&#x27;m now 56) I&#x27;ve used some advance version of Olay.... and I love their products, and particularly this and I DO use it along with a night treatment of Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Night Recovery Cream.&lt;br /&gt;Once on skin is noticeably smoother...and I&#x27;d say over the years, the product has reduced the onset, or depth or increase of wrinkles... I have them, I do, but my skin is quite nice---sure some is genetic, but I do attribute, openly: THIS is MY reason. The other nice thing, is when I do wear makeup (about twice a month), the make up goes on much, much nicer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years and I love it! it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and I&#x27;ve never looked my age so I&#x27;m going to keep on using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  I haven&#x27;t found any better face cream.</li>
            <li> read Olay ad.  It&#x27;s not quite that good but it does make skin softer.  Don&#x27;t know yet how it will do.</li>
            <li> Maybe it depends on your skin type, but this made my skin look hard and rugged looking.  I have sensitive skin. I regret that I purchased it</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  You need just a little bit to cover your whole face and it does last the whole day.  Have ordered my second jar already and am definitely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several face creams both expensive and cheap.  The Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is a great face cream that is wonderful for everyday use.  It moisturizes without feeling greasy.  The only thing I would change about it if I could would be an added sunscreen.  Of course, that would probably change the feel of the face cream.  It goes on smoothly and leaves no greasy residue.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> been using this for years and it is a good product.  If you have normal skin, it is good anywhere from 35 yrs old to late 40s into 50s.  At 49 yrs old, I still use it rotating it with some other products like Aveeno with shitake mushroom extract.  I like the Olay and Aveeno products.  Clinique products are also part of the rotation.  I do not believe that a woman needs to use the same product every day.  Products sometimes work better when rotated with other products.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels once applied.</li>
            <li> I use this product each evening before I go to bed.  It definitely makes my skin feel much less dry and much more soft!  I use it on my face, chest and neck.  I am always stocked as a bottle typically lasts me with one day use about 20 days.  Less wrinkles and firmer skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products over the years, and this one is the most effective I have used!  And it is one of the cheapest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is tighter and more lifted.  You can&#x27;t go wrong trying out this product.  I would Go For It!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months.  This is the best price I have seen for it.  It came on time and in the packaging I expected.</li>
            <li> my one and only cream that I use11111</li>
            <li> Lovely cream,  it&#x27;s doing what it says it does,  I&#x27;m  sure I&#x27;m  looking younger. Lol 😁 great stuff. I highly recommend this seller to all, Cheers 🍻 Bex</li>
            <li> This purchase was at the request of my sister who enjoys the product.  Olay products continue to outshine many other products of higher prices.</li>
            <li> This stuff breaks out my skin I see no visible difference maybe it&#x27;s fake product using olay packaging Idk I can&#x27;t call it.</li>
            <li> This stuff has rejuvenated my skin since my heart attack. While laying in a hospital bed for a month, my skin dried out and I really looked ten years older. I read about this in Domino magazine, tried it and POW!! my skin is nw smooth and nearly wrinkle-less. I recommend it for all women, start young and keep the skin young. i am 67 and my skin says &amp;#34;45&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This products are not a real one. I made amistake order to many of them.</li>
            <li> Usually purchase at Costco but they were out. This is actually the same price if I purchased a two-pack there, so this is a great alternative to have. Quick shipping, no complaints.</li>
            <li> great stuff used it for years...everyone says I have the clearest softest skin they have seen...love it...easy to use and melds with skin</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this cream in the mail and after using the one time applicator, I went out and bought a full jar. It made my skin feel very soft, and although I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, I like to go for the preventative route. After using it a couple of times, I realized that it wasn&#x27;t much different than my normal 7 in 1 moisturizer.. I f&#x27;eel like this isn&#x27;t a long lasting product. It will perk up your face for a couple of hours but dulls after you&#x27;ve been out and about for a couple of hours. I will use up this jar, but I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Nice to smooth on my face. I have used it for years. Saves me a trip to the store. I shall buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer for a very good price!</li>
            <li> She uses it daily and she says it does what it suppose to do. great price as compared to brick and mortar stores</li>
            <li> WHAT A GREAT PRICE FOR A CREAM THAT I LOVE!  GOES ON, SINKS IN AND FEELS TERRIFIC ON ONE&#x27;S SKIN.  THE STORES CHARGE A FORTUNE FOR THIS PRODUCT SO THIS IS A LIFE SAVER, OR PERHAPS A FACE SAVER, FOR ME.  THANX AMAZON FOR HELPING WITH MY BUDGET AND FOR YOUR SUPER FAST SERVICE.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the order process, and I really love the cream.  My skin seems to have a glow to it</li>
            <li> I did not think this product would work but it has to be one of the better products I have used.  A light fragrance makes it smell nice.  Just a dab is all you need to erase fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night, goes on smooth and has a soft pleasant scent. Gentle on my sensitive skin and wake up with refreshed skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommended and at a price less than Walmart.  Contains ingredients discussed on Dr Oz.  ggg ggg ggg</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Olay girl, always have been.  I love this cream.  Feels like silk on my skin and i like the light scent.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product many times in the past from local stores. The product itself is a very good one, and I like it very much. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the particular jar that I ordered on Amazon.com. I ordered from the seller on Amazon Marketplace that had the lowest price. It was a great bargain I thought. Imagine my disappointment when upon opening it, I saw cream that was yellow instead of the usual nice white color. I believe this happens when a product gets very old. I immediately threw it away. I guess it is true -- you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love this.Makes my face feel so much better as I use it on the go and at bed time....</li>
            <li> Immediate results. Olay products have proven again you don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune for a great product. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this product because the reviews were awesome.  It was too irritating to my skin.  It made my skin feel like it was on fire.</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing rough elbows, etc., but does not seem to do anything for my already smooth face, neck or chest areas insofar as wrinkles or tightening skin. Purchasing at Amazon convenient and price usually better than in stores.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this for a better price locally.  As to the effectiveness?  Beats me.  It was for my wife - I am simply here to let you know that this was MUCH cheaper than at my local stores.  She loves it, so I will continue to buy it for her here.</li>
            <li> What Can One Say About Face Cream? It&#x27;s smooth, not overly-scented. Affordable. I still don&#x27;t look 25. Nicer than L&#x27;Oreal. It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous face creams and serums hoping to get positive results.i purchased this cream because of the positive reviews on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I noticed a difference within a week. My skin looked smoother and the fine line were diminished. I highly recommend this product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Olay Regenerist!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, I am 70 years old, and people ask me &amp;#34;why don&#x27;t you have any wrinkles?  There isn&#x27;t a day I don&#x27;t go without &amp;#34;Olay&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing Olay on Amazon in the future.  It&#x27;s so quick and easy.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 years, and I absolutely love it.  I&#x27;m 33, and my skin never has looked better.  It took me a long time of trying different skincare products and different combinations of things, and I&#x27;ve finally found my personal routine - and it works great.  I do have some fine lines on my forehead, and those are almost completely gone and part of that I credit to this cream.  I use it every night.  I pair it with [[ASIN:B009CZR3Y0 Watts Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid / Vitamin C - Advanced Skin Repair Gel - 2oz]]- I use the Watts Beauty first, and then apply this Oil of Olay cream a few minutes later.  LOVE it!  I also recommend using [[ASIN:B000F63TW0 Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion &amp; Peel System 1 Kit]] once a week for optimum results.  I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with my skin right now!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, and Amazon always has the best price.  I am allergic to most creams around my eyes, but not Regenerist.  I think it has a nice, but faint fragrance, and since I am not able to tolerate SPF around the eyes and am also sensitive to many types of facial sunscreen, I appreciate that I can put my SPF where i want.</li>
            <li> very good product True to color and a very interesting good product within week the first a significant  sign that it is working. Great producl&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzn.V.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Compared to other more expensive creams, this one beats them hands down in performance and price. Incredible results. My skin never looked and felt so good!</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way, and it worked well on my forehead; however, it irritated my nose and cheeks. I did not notice any difference with fine lines on my face/forehead, so I cannot attest to this product&#x27;s claim (I used it for approximately two weeks). I will probably stick with Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive daily moisturizing cream, since it worked well and did not irritate my face.</li>
            <li> Before buying this I called Procter and Gamble to see where it was made. they said it was made in Puerto Rico. when I received it the package three days later from Amazon, it stated made in Thailand. I called back and was told Procyer and Gamble are not responsible for sales online and that factories may change location at any time. I feel this was very obtuse and misleading. They offered no accountability.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of olay products. It is the only brand i will use. it is the only creams that do not cause break-outs AND they work.</li>
            <li> This skin care cream is good to apply to your skin while you sleep and while you&#x27;re taking a shower in the morning. I like this cream because it has a smooth texture to the touch.</li>
            <li> This product definitely deserves a four star rating. I&#x27;ve been using this product for only a week and I notice a difference in my skin everyday. My wrinkles are starting to visibly disappear. My skins appears to be tighter and even. I even took notice to dark blemishes on my face beginning to fade. I gave this product a four star rating only because of the brief period I have been using it. I would recommend this product to anyone who has noticeable wrinkles or fine lines, dark blemishes or circles due to aging skin. This product really works to restore skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream after reading many very good reviews and was very disappointed.  The cream is thick and luxurious and smoothes on nicely however it is heavy and just sits on your skin.  When I went to apply makeup foundation after using the sculpting cream, it began to cake and peel.  At first I thought it was my skin peeling its top layer!  I thought this was part of the &amp;#34;sculpting&amp;#34; properties... After a few uses I realized it was the moisturizer caking up...and leaving flakes all over my clothes and in my hair.  I gave this moisturizer ample tries!  I agree with another reviewer - it clogged my pores and created a breakout.  Another reviewer reported ordering off Amazon and got a jar that said &amp;#34;made in Thailand&amp;#34;.  I noticed my jar I ordered also was &amp;#34;made in Thailand&amp;#34;.  I began thinking this moisturizer may be a fake or &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;  SO I went to CVS and bought another jar!!!  This one was even worse (incidentally , did NOT say &amp;#34;made in Thailand&amp;#34; on jar) so there went my &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; theory.  This moisturizer feels great to the touch but does not absorb into skin - sits on top and clogs pores and in fact, made my skin feel dry.  I now am stuck with 2 almost full jars of this stuff that I will not use - largely because I had faith in the good reviews.  I am now hesitant to even try any other Regenerist products.  I do use the cleanser and like that alot but I am afraid to try any other of their moisturizers!!</li>
            <li> I can definitely&lt;br /&gt;see a difference</li>
            <li> I use on my face everyday for over 6 years and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else leaves my face filling fresh not greasy</li>
            <li> I chose 3 stars only because there is no cream in the world that can make wrinkles go away and this one not either. But, it leaves a nice feeling on the skin after application.</li>
            <li> I like the cream.  I am not sure of the results this can provide on its own.  I used it with a combination of other products.  I love the fragrance of the cream and was great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am 35 with dry skin and some fine lines. It doesn&#x27;t seem to soak into my skin. My skin still feels dry but if I try to use more, it balls up. I will continue to use it because of the cost and I don&#x27;t have the receipt. But I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I have never had breakouts. Not a pimple my whole life until I tried this product. I followed the directions as stated, and gave it time to see if it would work and I could get past the new product&#x27;s impact on my skin (after always using my old standby Olay regular for sensitive skin that&#x27;s been around forever --which, also seems to have changed now!). I, like many other reports here, got bad breakouts mostly in the form of closed pimples that don&#x27;t come to a head or go away, milia, dark spots, and puffy eyes (pretty low away from the eyes --more like above my cheek-- since I kept it away from my eyes) and dry patches, along with a lot of redness in the nasolabial fold. I really have always trusted Olay and have used their products for 35 years or more. Now my old standby doesn&#x27;t even work right, it feels different, smells different and also bothers my skin now so something has changed with it. I think I will need to try Aveeno. I&#x27;m not upset that Olay Regenerist did nothing to help the small fine lines I have since most products don&#x27;t do that at all, but the breakouts and dry patches, etc. is unacceptable and hopefully will go away. I&#x27;ve not used this product for over a month now and I am still suffering the consequences. I am lucky that I have always had good skin, but now I do not. Very disheartening.</li>
            <li> I have used Regenerist Micro Ssculpting for more than 3 years . It reduces a lot the signs of age, I higly recommend to everybody over 40 years old</li>
            <li> High quality product well priced</li>
            <li> I used it for 6 months now. so far so good. it smoothen my skin. my skin looks radiant. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spending a fortune on face creams and anti-aging products, and they don&#x27;t work. This product did absolutely nothing for me. It did make my skin feel a little softer. All we are doing with this product is rubbing chemicals and unhealthy toxins into our skin. I found an all natural vegan product that I now use faithfully. This product along with all the other Olay products I have bought went directly in the trash. I saw amazing results the next day from this new product I found and I am now helping promote it because it WORKS and I believe in it so much. Please stop wasting your money on these Olay products and others like them.</li>
            <li> I really do feel like I see a difference in my skin tone and evenness when I use this, but it has a tendency to leave a white residue after awhile.  Because of this, I feel like I can only use it at night, not in the morning after a shower.</li>
            <li> This is the best night cream on the market! It works&lt;br /&gt;Better than the Department store creams that cost $100.00 are more! I use it every night and recommend everyone to use it!  It  It is so important to use a good cream on your face and this \\&quot;One\\&quot; is the best and it really works!! You can buy it at a great price! You can find it anywhere and if you need it and can&#x27;t get out you can buy it on \\&quot;Amazon.com\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Joyce A Byrd</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this night cream for years, and love how rich but not greasy it is.  I can tell a difference in my skin when I use it, and when I forget to.  I have lightly oily skin, and this cream is still not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go ahead and give this 3 stars because most qualities in this product stand out and are really great.. If I could give it 3 1/2 that might be more suitable. I don&#x27;t think this product does what it is initially supposed to do, which is lift, sculpt, and revitalize the face. However, my skin feels WONDERFUL after using it. It is SO silky and soft. And a lot of people complain about the scent, but I think the scent is very refreshing and kind of cucumbery. Not strong at all. I say this product doesn&#x27;t necessarily do what it says it will because for the past year, I have used Mary Kay TimeWise Age Fighting Moisturizer, I would apply it daily and every time I would apply it I&#x27;d raise my eye brows, lower them, and smile because even after lowering my eye brows, there were no visible wrinkles and that made me very happy. I am just sick of having to hunt down a seller and get the product at someone else convenience, when I can just go to Wal-Mart down the road and buy this product whenever I want. The Mary Kay product and this product are the exact same price... But the Mary Kay has a whole 3 oz&#x27;s where as this only has 1.7 oz&#x27;s! Although my skin feels softer and more hydrated than it did with Mary Kay, it doesn&#x27;t do what I wanted to do, and that&#x27;s the whole reason I bought it. I think I will just go back to waiting on Mary kay sellers..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Honestly, my skin is not that sensitive. The most acne I have ever had in my life was maybe 3 pimples on my chin at a time. NEVER have I ever got acne on my cheeks or t-zone until now. the second application of this product I woke up the next day with horrible acne all over my cheeks and t zone. I read on here that that happened to other people and it went away. Well, 2 weeks later, here I am with still just as bad (subsiding since I quit using it 3 days ago) acne. It&#x27;s embarrassing. Do not buy this product if you think your skin is the slightest bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning.  People think that my 50 year old son is my husband.  I guess that says it all!  LOL</li>
            <li> Here is the thing, you get what you pay for. Not a terrible product. I just found that spending more money on higher end products made a HUGE difference in my skin right away.&lt;br /&gt;I am comparing apples to oranges, but if you can afford a better product use it. But this one is good for its price point.</li>
            <li> This is a new product for me. After almost three weeks of use, I find nice improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product… I have tried expensive ones with no much change, but this cream works well I am 39!</li>
            <li> I have used this products for years. The product I received was different in texture, consistency and fragrance and the packaging was different from what I normally purchase in stores. It is seems to be a counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve just started using this and so far it seems really great. The cream is lightweight and has a lot of elasticity to it. Skin feels very smooth and soft. Does not feel like it is tightening the skin though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for three weeks every night at bedtime and my skin looks amazing! I have had lots of comments on how good my skin looks and I have noticed my complexion looks brighter and lots of my dark spots from acne and sun damage are gone or very faded.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites!  I have it on auto-ship.  It is moisturizing w/o being too heavy.  I do break out from time to time and I can still use it at night. Great price too!!</li>
            <li> I read in the ad that buy 3, get 1 free. That did not happen but I do like the product anyway.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best moisturizing cream ever! I noticed the difference from the first application. Believe me I tried many, many brands including expensive cream with all the bells and whistles and this Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is by far producing the best results ever. It also has a very pleasant fragrence. I just bought my second jar and I promised myself I will never be without it again.  I also bought Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion treatment. I love this product too. It leaves my skin so radiant and fresh looking. It has the most pleasing orange scent. I love this line of Olay. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream after seeing the commercial about it being better than creams that cost $350.  I have been using it for months on my jawline only. (I use the ProX for the rest of my face and neck.) I am 60 and the firmness of my jawline was starting to grow soft. This cream REALLY and TRULY made a difference!!  I usually dot it along my jawline. Then I take the base of my palm and rub firmly in an upward motion from under the jaw bone to just over the top of it.  This cream is amazing as it really did \\&quot;resculpt\\&quot; my jaw line.  I will never be without this cream.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to give it a try for a couple of months.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I went on Amazon to read the reviews on this product.  My sister absolutely raves about this product and said the same as many reviewers, that she read a consumer report that states that this product is better than the expensive products.      First off, the fragrance IS very overpowering.  That was my first concern, since I saw an episode of Dr. Oz where experts stated that fragrance is very bad for your skin as it causes a breakdown of your collagen quicker, resulting in early aging.     Secondly, it caused me to breakout on my forehead, chin and upper lip.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the Micro-Sculpting cream that caused it since it wasn&#x27;t a major breakout.  I&#x27;d wake up with a pimple on my chin and upper lip.  Then maybe a couple of days later, I&#x27;d get one on my forehead.      I stopped using after 2 weeks.  Then went back to trying it a few days ago and noticed a pimple here and there.  After reading other reviews about breakouts, I will stop using this product.  I have other products from Olay that I love.  Those products aren&#x27;t nearly as fragrant as the Micro cream.  Maybe there&#x27;s a correlation between the strong fragrance and the breakout on sensitive skin.     Lastly, the pros about this product is that it does feel great on the skin, hydrates and goes on silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live with out this product for my skin</li>
            <li> My Mother thinks it is the best of O&#x27;Lay</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CREAM. I USE IT DAY AND NIGHT WITH THE OLAY MICRO SCULPTING SERUM. THEY ARE MADE TO WORK TOGETHER. MY SKIN TONE,TEXTURE,AND FIRMNESS HAS REALLY IMPROVED SINCE USING.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few months now and I love it.  My skin has never looked better.  I recommend this cream to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I bought it to give it to my wife as a gift for the mother´s day. She uses it every day</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received this product. There were several differences from the same item I bought retail.. It did not have the logo Olay imbedded into the lid. The front label of the container was totally different, it did not include the (tm) next to the words&amp;#34; micro-sculpting cream&amp;#34;. The original Olay product is made by P &amp; G in Cincinnati OH, this product is labeled, made in Thailand. Lot# is imbedded on the one I purchased retail and a label was used on this one, finally, cream is thinner and had a different scent that the one I purchased retail.  Needless to say I believe this is a knockoff and have notified Olay. I would recommend that Amazon check this vendor out and question the products being supplied to Amazon&#x27;s customers. I&#x27;m just sorry I can&#x27;t get my money back. Will only by this product retail in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the best ever! I use it faithfully morning and night! I know it helps when I get those nice compliments from friends.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night cream. The product is not greasy nor feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; on my skin. Does not stain pillowcases or leave a film. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Have used this for quite some time. Love it. Nice to get at a good cost.....always a very good thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 and tried this because Oprah recommended it in her top 10 anti-aging moisturizers.  Smells great.  Feels semi-light. Used it for 3 days and broke out like a teenager.  My face was so shiny at work the first day, I almost didn&#x27;t recognize myself.  I don&#x27;t have oily skin.  Might work for people that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  Apparently that&#x27;s not me.  Very happy to pay half the price with Amazon than the store!  I just can&#x27;t use it.  Went back to Garnier Skin Care Renew with spf 28.  Cheaper product. Has spf.  Never breaks me out.</li>
            <li> Great smell seemed to be exactly what I expected couldn&#x27;t be done better. Amazons great delivery services and returning policies easy to find and easy to use</li>
            <li> Great product for minimizing pores and evening skin.</li>
            <li> I also love it and the price through your site.  Kathie</li>
            <li> Okay products leave behind a residue thatis very annoying for me, so I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Best cream I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried many!  Keeps my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my new skin cream and when I went to use it, it formed like little balls on my face.  I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I use this product to moisturizes my face at night. I think it does help slow down the aging of my skin. I love its silky texture, and my husband loves its very subtle and beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Regenerist Mico-Sculpting Cream for about a month and so far I&#x27;m really loving it. It&#x27;s one of my favorite skincare products next to Philosophy Purity cleanser and Clarisonic. My only complaint about Olay is the fact that they are highly fragranced and that really seems to irritate my sensitive acne-prone skin. So when I purchased this I decided to get both this and the fragrance free version to see which one I liked best. I started using the fragranced version first. It has a light, pleasing scent which isn&#x27;t bothersome to me and it goes away within 30 minutes. I&#x27;m almost 32 and I have a few fine lines under my eyes and one on my forehead. I&#x27;ve noticed in the month since I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer that my fine lines appear less visible. Keep in mind that it won&#x27;t totally remove them, it just makes them less visible. My skin feels smoother and a little firmer when I use this moisturizer. I can tell the difference if I skip a day of using it. I also think this moisturizer is helping to lighten some past acne scars. There is mica in this moisturizer (which creates a shimmering effect) and that has given my skin a nice glow. This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t make my acne worse either. I have a few small pimples on my face and neck but it&#x27;s no worse than I usually have. I think it&#x27;s actually helping to heal the pimples faster and not leaving more acne marks. I think the aloe in it has helped calm my skin down and it doesn&#x27;t look as red as it used to. It&#x27;s not a heavy moisturizer so it&#x27;s perfect for any time of the year. Any dry patches I had before using this moisturizer are now gone. A little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve hardly used any product in the month I&#x27;ve had it. I usually only use this at night but you could use this day or night just make sure you use an SPF. I highly recommend this moisturizer and I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again. The only bad thing I can say about this is that I wish they made it with SPF. Check Amazon often for coupon codes and use the Subscribe &amp; Save option to save money. It&#x27;s definitely cheaper than in the store.e the Subscribe &amp; Save option to save money. It&#x27;s definitely cheaper than in the store.</li>
            <li> Goes on and makes your skin feel awesome.  However, it is not a miracle in a jar.  You will not suddenly appear 25 again</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now. It is very creamy yet does not leave an oily feeling on my face which I love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;is great as a moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t find that it does a lot as far as &amp;#34;sculpting&amp;#34; is concerned . But most likely its because at a certain age nothing in a jar is actually going to sculpt one&#x27;s face.  That being said, I&#x27;ve used it for several years and not found anything that works better.  Its smells nice, feels good on the skin (not heavy or greasy) and sinks in pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. All the magazines say a Micro-sculpting cream is the new &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; product so I wanted to try it. It&#x27;s hard to say if it has changed the way my skin looks but I really like how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> very strong scent. was not able to use on face.did make nice hand cream.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and texture of this cream.  I use this in the morning under my make-up, and it seems like my skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay products for over 30 years.  This is one of their best.  I can&#x27;t afford the expensive creams.  This is the next best thing.  It has great reviews from those who study skin results.  I often get compliments about not looking my age.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works in two days many of wrinkles are gone on the test subject area! Pretty cool, I am impressed</li>
            <li> This is a great cream to use。The price is not expensive also, used in the face is not greasy, very comfortable. I think, this is a very suitable for the ordinary people of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I use this at night although I prefer the serum&#x27;s texture better. This however gives my face the extra moisture I need. My face is so soft in the mornings. I love the Olay Regenerist line of fragrance free products. No need to stray to other expensive ones. They really don&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> I used Georgette Klinger&#x27;s products for 25 years until someone bought the company and bankrupt it. I learned that great products melt into your skin and leave no residue. This is one of the better I&#x27;ve found in my 6 year quest to replace Klinger.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a moisturizer for a long time, this was right under my nose and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint!  It was cheaper buying on Amazon than in Wal-Mart.  You won&#x27;t regret the purchase.  I was knew I wanted it when it was shown on the Today Show!</li>
            <li> I used moisturizing serum and lotion before I put this cream on.  But I ended up getting eczema.  Now I&#x27;m using something else.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product to the people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> very smooth on skin but to much perfume for facecream nor recomeded for peaple that has allergies or dont like perfume</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Regenerist Products - I switched to the ProX line, but went back to the regenerist after about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I am 68 so I don&#x27;t expect miracles anymore!  But, this cream makes my face feel smooth and comfortable, it smells nice, goes on easily.  For the price, it is better than many others I have tried....even the very expensive ones.  It softens the lines and wrinkles.  If it made them disappear, I would have given it all five stars!  Getting it on \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; makes it convenient and a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Here in Venezuela seems that this product is not available. A friend of mine are jealous hahahaha, but i share a litle with her</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream is the BEST money I&#x27;ve spent on new skincare product in a long, long time. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds .. cosmetic counter stuff to cheapo stuff, thinking none of it would make much of a difference except for moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer for years and years, and, while that&#x27;s wonderful for daily after shower moisturizing, I finally sighed and faced the inevitable .. I needed something more, since I&#x27;m now 51. I&#x27;ve always used moisturizer of sorts for my skin since about age 12, but over the years I guess it&#x27;s become sensitized to anything other than what it&#x27;s used to. My best friend suggested I try Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Intesives line, but it smells so heinous, and the serum is an unfamiliar goopy mess when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Olay Regenerist. I ADORE this cream. It&#x27;s thick and feels luxurious, and the moment you put it on, it smooths to perfection on your skin. No residue left behind, unlike some preparations that seem to curdle or something after applying it. My skin feels wonderful after applying. The scent is light, not overpowering. I can use this before I go to bed at night and not fear that my linens are stained. I also use this on the back of my hands before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little spendier than I would probably spend on an over the counter skincare line but the money spent is WELL worth it. I will be suggesting this to my daughters, as I have every other skincare I&#x27;ve discovered that ACTUALLY does what it says to do.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of nights, and like the way it helps my dry, 40-something skin. I just have to stop using it because of the heavy perfumes - if you are sensitive to that then DO NOT BUY IT. If perfumes generally do not bother you than you&#x27;ll likely be fine with it.     I am moving onto the Olay&#x27;s Regenerist night cream, which an Olay rep said will have a milder smell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the anti-aging properties of this product as I have been using it for only 3 days and in my late twenties I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles to complain about. However, after using RoC Retinol Correxion products for 2 months, it severely  dried out my skin and continued to do so. I couldn&#x27;t believe that only after 1 day of using the Micro-Scultping Cream my skin was so much better and after 3 days it&#x27;s back to normal. It&#x27;s the BEST MOISTURIZER I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope the success continues and am optimistic for the cream to refine some loss of elasticity in my cheeks. I&#x27;ve taken pictures of my face so that in a couple months I can compare the results. Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> Great product and is the best skin cream that competes easily with the higher cost brands.  Signing up for automatic shipments saves you money and very convenient that can&#x27;t be beat in any other venue. I am not disappointed and plan to continue using Regenerist with it&#x27;s other complementing products.</li>
            <li> My skin love this product and I am waaaaay over 2l...I signed up for the monthly delivery. I have been in three states this year and no one can beat Amazons price! maggiemay</li>
            <li> Sometimes I try other face creams, but I always come back to this one. Great texture, a little goes a long way. Does it&#x27;s job. I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Keeps my dry skin moist, spreads well.  Does as well of expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Regenerist products because I have sensitive skin and it is very gentle on my face.  The price is very competitive compared to Walmart or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything for me after I used for 30days</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I am 60 years old and most people think I look like I am 40. I have been using the priduct for several years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for repair and really does the work. But my skin is a bit sensitive. Using only twice a week now. Can be slightly sting for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Real or fake I&#x27;m not sure...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom as a gift. It was on sale, a price I could not resist. She&#x27;s been using it diligently, day and night. I can tell the difference in her skin. Within a few days, I can tell how much better her skin looks. Her fine lines are starting to fade and her skin looks well moisturized. I will continue to purchase this for her.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good, basic moisturizer. Not a fan of the cloying floral smell, or the jar.  Would prefer a pump, so the germs from fingers don&#x27;t get mixed in my face cream. Claims of micro-sculpting properties may be exaggerated!</li>
            <li> I have used this night cream for many years and love it. Another one for really cold weather is Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream. Anyone who is concerned with aging skin needs to try these.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like the Regenerist  micro-sculpting cream. I was given a sample when purchasing another product. The scent is like a cheap drier sheet, I just couldn&#x27;t get past it. It may or may not actually work but the scent is stinky. I do not understand putting scent in a beauty product unless they are are trying to cover up some vile smelling ingredient.</li>
            <li> After washing my face with Olay Total Effects cleanser I use Olay Regenerist&lt;br /&gt;You have to use both One to wash your face and this as a night Cream.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you will like it</li>
            <li> My purchase was delivered on time and was packaged very well. You only need a little of this cream so it should last a good while. I have noticed that my makeup goes on easier and smoother as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this night moisturizer for years and see no reason to switch to another product.  It seems to work well and is rich but not greasy.  It has never caused my  skin to break out either.  I have tried more pricey products in the past, but now basically stick with Olay night and day moisturizers and am pleased.</li>
            <li> always like and enjoy ant oil of olay product.  I have used them since I was 16 yrs old and think that&#x27;s why my skin looks good</li>
            <li> I like Clinique, but I thought I&#x27;d try this. I couldn&#x27;t tell any improvement. I realize that you have to keep using, but the expense steered me back to Clinique.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m moisturized but never break out from it and it is one of the few moisturizers that stay put! It doesn&#x27;t pill up and leave chunks of tiny moisturizer eggs all over my face when I layer concealer/foundation/etc on it</li>
            <li> so originally i was a big fan of aveeno but it still wasnt keeping my skin moisturized for the entire day. Oil of Olay is amazing! feels great on my skin and i only have to use a little bit of it for all day moisture. I work outside in construction so i need as much protection on my face as i can get and this is better than aveeno moisturizer for me by faaaar! will definately re purchase!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. My skin is looking younger, so I&#x27;m told! I can&#x27;t believe it took so long to find a product that I love..  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this makes my skin feel. It&#x27;s also very creamy mixture which is nice. Great product - must try!</li>
            <li> Use it every single night and love it!</li>
            <li> I used this creme for years and it was perfect for my sensitive skin until recently. It was as good as expensive department store brands. However, the last jar (unscented) caused stubborn dry patches, clogged pores and breakouts. No more soft skin.  The creme&#x27;s texture wasn&#x27;t as fine either. Luckily, I kept the box it came in.  Checked the ingredients. Gone is the marine protein. Added are cheap fillers like olive oil and nylon. The olive oil base also wrecks makeup.  Sadly, this creme is just another chemical-laden drugstore product now. My local Walgreens sells it for $32.99.  I reported this bad experience to Olay and they are refunding my money via one of their company-issued debit cards. Now I have to go through the hassle of finding a reasonably priced replacement for the original great product.</li>
            <li> I grew up using Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s face creams, but it was just getting too expensive. While my skin was soft, I was still experiencing break outs, so I searched for a new option. After trying many high end creams, I gave Olay Regenerist a shot...I mean, all these positive reviews couldn&#x27;t be wrong right? Nope. I&#x27;ve now been using the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for about 3 years and love it. I use it every night before going to bed and my skin is just as soft as it was when I used other high end creams (but I&#x27;m spending about half the price!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a creamy compound and goes on to your skin silky smooth, not greasy or too thick. I&#x27;ve tried both the versions (with and without fragrance) and I&#x27;ve found that I actually like the light fragrance. My husband actually likes the scent (and he&#x27;s super picky!) as well. If I forget to use it a couple nights, my skin feels dry and gets flaky, so it&#x27;s definitely doing it&#x27;s job. Not to mention, my skin doesn&#x27;t break out as often! Win-Win-Win. Give it a shot, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, at least you&#x27;re not out $50+.</li>
            <li> love this so far, esp the price!!!! it was 25-$30 elsewhere. im becoming an Amazon addict. i have prime membership so shipping is free. well worth it, esp seeing as i cant stop shopping!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered for my mom, and it was just what she wanted. she really loved it!!</li>
            <li> I get compliments about my skin all the time thanks to this product. Most of the people who compliment me are yound women in their early 20&#x27;s who are very beautiful. They keep asking me what I use. I rarely get three hours of sleep and I&#x27;m very stressed out because of the loss of two family members in one year but you wouldn&#x27;t know this by looking at my skin; it seems to be glowing all the time. I also apply Loreal skin genesis religiously every night, but I attribute my great skin to olay regenerist. I&#x27;m 38 by the way so great skin is does not come easy at this stage.</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 of the Olay Regenerist serum products and both are excellent, including this one. I have sun damaged skin on my neck from too much sun worship as a teen and this product really improved the look of my skin. People are complementing me on my great skin since I started this product....it looks more luminous and refined compared to before. I have tried expensive products that are $200 per jar that do not work as well as this one does. I noticed a difference in about 2 weeks. I use it every day and night as well. I am 60 years old and this product has definitely improved my skin and I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE REGENERIST LINE.  THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT IRRITATE MY SKIN.  I DO NOTICE A DIFFERENCE IN THE FIRMNESS OF MY SKIN WHEN USING PRODUCT :) I QUESTION THE SAFETY OF THE PRODUCT, THOUGH, BECAUSE IT IS MADE IN A COUNTRY THAT IS TOXIC AND POLLUTED.  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN UNTIL I AM SURE OF THE QUALITY OF THE INGREDIENTS AND SAFETY OF THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I just got my second jar and I promised myself I will not let myself run out. I also bought other olay products but I like this one best for skin treatmentsw. I really like this product too. It leaves my skin so smooth and fresh looking. It has the most pleasing orange scent. I love this line of Olay. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it! This has to be the best moisturizing cream ever! I noticed the difference from the first application. I used to have chronic dryness but not when I use olay,.   I tried many, many brands including expensive cream with all the hype and this Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is by far producing the best results for me. It also has a very pleasant smell that is not too strong.</li>
            <li> Love Olay, pkg&#x27;d well.</li>
            <li> smells nice but only good for night time.  it leaves a film so for morning uses, your foundation will flake off.</li>
            <li> Awful price but I like it!</li>
            <li> Works great, especially around chin and neck area.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Few creams actually do what they claim, but this one hydrates and I can actually see softening of&lt;br /&gt;fine lines.</li>
            <li> It is a nice cream, however if your prone to breaking out easily, do not use this because this is what happened to  me&lt;br /&gt;so I don&#x27;t use it to much anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for several years and love the effect that it has on my skin.  It&#x27;s softer and seems to make my skin have a glow.&lt;br /&gt;I love the whole line of Regenerist products.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been amazing!  after two weeks I have notice an extreme difference.  It is light and feels great on my skin.  I also am exceptionally happy about the light scent.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it is okay.  I am not one to use it everyday so I now have a stockpile of the cream.  I did get a compliment that I have great skin the other day. but no idea it it was this.  I am a smoker and this is all I use, if I remember to put it on, so  at 46 I guess that bodes well for the product.</li>
            <li> I  have been looking for a good moisturizer this seems to do the trick goes on easy not greasy feels good will buy again</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful as well as the night cream.  Olay knows how to do it right.  It works so well on my 50+ skin and makes it feel so soft.  Would purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price! Arrived when promised and packaged well! Same thing as the big box stores sell for a much better price!</li>
            <li> This cream leaves my skin soft and fills out wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks and have seen results.  I would reccommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this texture of cream. Does it have Peptides?  Nope-  I was mis-lead on my Bing search for peptide cream.&lt;br /&gt;Live and learn.  It was an inexpensive mistake.</li>
            <li> I like this because it is not greasy.  It goes on smoothly and I apply more during the day.  It feels good under my makeup mornings and nights.  I live in a dry climate and this seems to help.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this product I felt a little tingling which I read is normal. The second time I used it my face itched. I applied in the morning after washing my face. After work I washed my face and discovered many little hives on my cheeks that itched like there was no tomorrow.  Sorry to say I won&#x27;t be able to continue to use on my face. It is a thick cream which I like and smells great.  I will keep the jar and use on my legs and arms to see if it will do anything to improve the skin on my body. Who knows, maybe it will take away the flab on my arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products all my life, they are all good, but this product keeps my dry skin feeling moisturized and feeling soft. I like that I can apply some before bedtime and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy and I love that my crows feet are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best skin care products I&#x27;ve ever used and I recommend it to anyone who wants younger skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 3-4 weeks.  My skin does look better but not remarkably different.  Good enough that I will buy again AND it does make it feel nice as does their &amp;#34;&amp;#34;Total effects 7 in 1 cream &amp;#34;UNDER my foundation</li>
            <li> I have been meaning to try this Olay product ever since [[ASIN:B001THPA1C Good Housekeeping (1-year auto-renewal)]] tested it, and said it was better than a $500 cream they also tested.  Well, either they changed the ingredients in this product, or I don&#x27;t have the same skin type the testers had, because this cream did nothing but make my skin look duller.  It was too thick.  Now, on to [[ASIN:B00I073WLE Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, 1.7 Ounce]] for two months . . . .</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry skin in the winter and my friend raved about this.  She gave it five stars.  I gave it three.  I also gave her the jar after one use.  I hated the smell and it dried my skin.  Not what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> I love how nice and smooth this goes on to the skin on my neck.  I also use the cream on the top of my hands as that get quite dry.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with how this moisturizes my skin in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I would not mind paying the higher price but after a year of usage I do not notice any different in skin correction.&lt;br /&gt;It is great moisture creme esp for sensitive skin but really the sculpture part...just did not see that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the micro-sculpting effects, but I use this cream as a night moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It is very hydrating and keep the skin moist for a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;It works as a day cream as well, if I am not putting on extra sunscreen on top of that and just stay indoors.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a perfect moisturizer for all purposes at my age (25+) and at very decent price.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using the product until I find a better substitute.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It really hydrates your skin and does not irritate. I use subscribe and save and get a great price. I can&#x27;t beat the price at any of the local stores.</li>
            <li> Fast service. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Always arrives on time. Best possible price.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay for years.  Their skin care products keep my skin moisturized and protected without causing breakouts.  Even my dermatologist recommends their products, much to my (and my wallet&#x27;s) delight.  When I moved to the mountains, the dry air really seemed to take its toll on my skin (I was used to living in much more humid climates), so I changed from the Olay 7-in-1 Total Effects to this cream (between the dryness and aging, needed a little more help).  I think my skin looks as good as or maybe even better than when I moved here 2 1/2 years ago.  The fine lines and areas of dryness I was starting to see are gone, my skin feels smooth and healthy, and I am very happy with the results.  I will say that you should still use some sunscreen after applying this - both my foundation and BB cream both have sunscreen, so whichever I use, I am protected - the 7-in-1 had sunscreen built in, I don&#x27;t believe that this does.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years and feel that my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly! And was an amazing price!</li>
            <li> I bought the whole Regenerist system not that long ago but immediately returned it. I have extremely sensitive skin to the point where the majority of products do not work for me in drug stores but I was recommended to try it. Unfortunately the Regenerist system immediately started burning horribly upon application and despite being on for only a couple minutes for me to reach water and wash it off I was left with intensely burned skin (think horrible sunburn after falling asleep in the sun) and even a few blisters in extra sensitive areas around my nose and cheekbones (thank god I didn&#x27;t put any of it around my eyes since I didn&#x27;t trust a new product yet). I have extremely sensitive combination 20-something year old skin and I have NEVER had such a severe reaction to anything like this set of skin care products. Aloe was the only thing that could soothe this burn that lasted a couple days. I wish I had taken photos to strengthen my warning to sensitives!</li>
            <li> I am in my 40s, my skin is sensitive and though the occurrences have greatly reduced do have a tendency to break out if I eat junk food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very careful with trying out new products on my face. But I was very optimistic after reading so many positive reviews and I bought this product. After application, I sensed a tightening of the skin and I felt even more optimistic. However, after couple of days, I started noticing a discoloration (slightly darker than rest) of my skin on both sides of my mouth. After about a week of application, it grew even darker and more noticeable. I have now stopped using the cream :( and now need to figure out what I should do to get rid of the discoloration!</li>
            <li> Have used this cream for about a year and notice a difference in increased lines when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisture and the price is great.  The fast delivery makes it convenient and saves me from using more gas in my car.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product and can wear it in the day and at night. It has the most amazing silky texture, too. One only requires a small amount for each application, and it is not oily. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> The product is adequate for my skin and I have used it and the night cream for a long time.  Also, I like the price I can get is for at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing with it what it says to do with it, but nothing is getting better. In fact, I think I&#x27;m doing my jawline harm, and now my neck is starting to get loose. Does not seem to be a good product...same ole stuff.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling greasy and unclean. Does absolutely nothing for your skin. I&#x27;m disappointed in this product from Olay.</li>
            <li> Love this for my face. Have used for 4 years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for several years and, while I&#x27;ve tried other brands/types of moisturizing cream, I return to this one.  It has the right balance of moisture without feeling too greasy or heavy on my skin.  It leaves my skin soft and supple and I often hear I don&#x27;t look my age, so it must be doing something right.  I like to use it at night before bedtime and also mix it with Retin-A on the evenings I use that to act as a buffer and reduce irritation from the retinoid.  My mother is 90 and has been using Olay for many years and her skin looks wonderful.  I trust the Olay brand and use several items in their lineup.</li>
            <li> My mom is kind of old-school.  She washes her face and puts face cream on day and night.  That&#x27;s it.  No fancy serums, no makeup, no extra effort.  She &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t have time for it&amp;#34;.  So at least I got her hooked on this.  Have seen visible improvement in her aging skin.  With coupons and Subscribe &amp; Save, definitely affordable.  Quality ingredients.  Not as high-level as P&amp;G SK-II but more economical version with some of the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> This Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream is not the product I wanted on my recurring list.  I had arranged for another Olay product.  Amazon.com discontinured sending that and offered the Micro-sculpting Cream.  I agreed, but I find it thicker and not as pleasant to use.  The price is the same, but I am disappointed that Amazon.com would do such a thing.</li>
            <li> I am 41 and began a consistent face moisturizing regime about ten years ago.  I have bounced around between expensive department store products and generic drugstore products for the better part of these years.  Until about five months ago.  I was given a jar of this cream by my mother-in-law.  It is the peas to my carrots, the honey to my tea.  I feel like the heavens opened up.  I am on my third jar and would not even consider switching to another brand again.  I must say that I only use this cream at night.  It is a little too heavy for me during the day under makeup.  So I use a Dermalogica product with SPF in the mornings.  But my face is smooth every day, even in winter.  It spreads beautifully and does not feel greasy or filmy.  Please don&#x27;t change a thing OofO!</li>
            <li> I discovered I am allergic to this product and I am sad about this.</li>
            <li> It is the best for a reason!  Just makes my skin feel wonderful</li>
            <li> After Avon discontinued my favorite All-in-one cream, I&#x27;ve been trying so many creams.  I&#x27;ve tried Lancôme, Estee Lauder, Neutrogena and other Avon creams as well as others.  None of them did a thing for my skin.  In fact, it was starting to look worse, ruddy, dingy.  I was about to give up and just use a cheap all-purpose moisturizer.  Why put chemicals on your face if they aren&#x27;t working and why pay all that money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a last ditch effort, I bought some of this Olay Regenerist.  Within 2 days, I noticed my face looking brighter.  The patchy color of my face was evening out and my skin looked clearer.  After a week, I got a few compliments on my complexion!  Under my eyes looks better too, a little firmer (I&#x27;m 46).  My face feels so soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot.  It smooths on nicely, so one 20.00 bottle should last a while.  It does have a fresh scent that I like, but I noticed they have unscented if you need that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had tried this first.  I just thought it couldn&#x27;t possibly work as well as a 75.00 cream.  Well, it works BETTER.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and always had a problem with choosing the right moisturizer. Since  I found OLAY I never look back. I have been using it for a couple of years.  It&#x27;s great for my skin so smooth and moist. Now my husband is also started using it and loves it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles (I bought this product off the adage \\&quot;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure), so I can&#x27;t really say how it works on that front.  I guess we&#x27;ll find out in 10 years.  If nothing else, it has a wonderfully creamy smooth feel and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Olay is made by Proctor and Gamble, a company that still tests on animals even when it is NOT required by law.  They will swear it is only done when no other means available, but how is that true when other cosmetic companies DON&#x27;T test on animals?      This cruelty is not worth vanity.  I&#x27;ll stick with Avon or Almay, honest companies that don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li> This Olay product is a great moisturizer.  It helped with my very dry skin, plumping up my skin, so the lines weren&#x27;t as noticeable and made my skin softer.  It feels wonderful on your skin, absorbs well, and it isn&#x27;t greasy.  My favorite.  I give it 5 stars for its moisturizing effect on your skin, but I take a 1/2 star off because the effects don&#x27;t last long.  I look great and refreshed for awhile, but eventually, as with all moisturizers, the fine lines and dryness come back.  I also tend to have severe dry patches that creep up, especially in the winter when the air is dry and cold. This improves them tremendously, but hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of them.  To be fair, I did not find anything in the drugstore that would actually \\&quot;cure\\&quot; my skin, but this moisturizer comes the closest.  It&#x27;s the best moisturizer and lasts the longest of all the moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to see if I could actually change the condition of my skin, and have skin that was permanently line free and soft.  I won&#x27;t go into all of my trials and errors, here are some of the things I found effective so you can avoid my guinea pig routine.  For reducing lines, the best product was [[ASIN:B00027DMI8 RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream, 1-Ounce]].  I would give it 5 stars, but it is STRONG, so down to 4 stars.  It says to use it every day, but trust me, don&#x27;t, it can burn your skin.  A few days in a row, then break for a day.  I still use it when I need a little oomph, but use it for a day or two and then off.  If you want to get rid of wrinkles, this will do the job.  You need a good moisturizer with it, because the major drawback to all the retinol products is that they dry your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some more research to see if there is some way to actually change your skin so that it is younger looking permanently.  I read a book by Dr. Oz that talks about what your body needs to stay young as long as possible. The chapter on skin was enlightening - our skin needs basicvitamins (A, B, C, E), omega 3&#x27;s and fatty acids to keep it healthy and build the collagen and elastin that keep it firm and young looking.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything except the usual moisturizers, then I read about oil for skin care and found a long list of plant oils that have the vitamins and fatty acids Dr. Oz said were important.  I bought some argan oil, and that&#x27;s when I started to see a change in my skin that lasts long term.  I looked for some products that would give me more of the vitamins, etc. and found [[ASIN:B00BD822BI Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment - Intensive Anti Aging, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]] that has natural plant oils (9!) with high concentrations of all the nutrients Dr. Oz talked about.  This worked even better than the plain argan oil. Amazing.  Using the cream with the Olay gave me both the immediate effects of a great moisturizer and long term change.  After several months, even if I missed a day or two with my skincare routine, my skin was still softer, and with fewer lines.  Fine lines are completely gone, the deeper lines are not as long or as deep, and are almost unnoticeable.  I also noticed that the skin discolorations are faded to the point of only being slightly noticeable, and the small scar I have on my face from an accident you can barely see now.  After several months of using both together along with the retinol products (not every day!), I noticed that lines were almost gone, and now, after a year, I barely have any lines on my forehead or around my eyes - even when I miss my daily skin routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to report that after sticking with these products, that my skin is now, in my early 50&#x27;s, younger looking and softer than when I was in my 40&#x27;s.  When people guess my age, the guess is 38-40, which I happily take.  And I am always being asked what I do to have my skin look this good.  I recommend the combination of all three.</li>
            <li> Olay Micro-Sculpting Cream is collagenic -- that is, it can block your pores -- so users may experience milia, those hard little white dots/deposits under the skin, or acne.  When I first tried this product, I woke up the next morning with milia dotting my cheeks.  I immediately stopped using the cream.  A few weeks later, I decided to try it again.  This time, it took three days for my skin to react.  I figured then that perhaps my skin just needed to get used to it, so I waited a while before starting up again.  And I was right.  I&#x27;m able to use it now, although I&#x27;m very careful to use the cream only at night and another, noncollagenic moisturizer by day.  I&#x27;m still undecided if I will continue once I run out.  My skin feels great in the morning, but I remain wary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I use mainly unscented products, I was also surprised by the strength of the scent.  My husband can tell I applied the cream from across the room.  But if you tend to use scents, you probably won&#x27;t find it overpowering.  Don&#x27;t even bother trying this if you have adverse reactions to scents; it will be a waste of your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because I read that it provides the best results for the least amount of money.  Although that may be the case, the drawbacks are something to consider as well.  I recommend buying the smallest jar you can when first trying this and see whether your skin can handle it.  I was able to sensitize my own skin, but you may not be able to.  If you have oily or sensitive skin, beware.  Otherwise, it should make your skin feel smooth and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> This is a little out of my normal price range, but I have to continue to purchase it.  I thought that I could find something comparable for less money.  NOT!  I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;lesser\\&quot; products.  They just don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t compare.  The Micro-Sculpting cream soaks in perfect and has a nice fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  The price on Amazon beats all other stores around me.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it from here.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizor for the price. It&#x27;s not too heavy or too light. It&#x27;s not greasy and keeps my face moisturized all day. I wish it had some spf in it, but for the price this is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes ok but its not a miracle in a jar by any means.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a jar of this at CVS after using Oil of Olay for years.  I use it exclusively at night, before bed, applying it on my neck, around my eyes and face. A little goes a long way and I can&#x27;t believe how much smoother my skin looks and feels after 6 months of use. Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> My review for this is the same as for the Regenerist Serum.  I have been using Oil of Olay for over 20 years.  It works great, but was getting expensive.  I put this on subscribe and save and it is a great deal that shows up at my door step.  Need I say more.</li>
            <li> Starting out, it had a cloying aroma which fades.although not as advertised (nothing is) it was adequate and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesitant to buy this in a jar. Shouldn&#x27;t it be in a air tight container?</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of olay but I didn&#x27;t like this product. I didn&#x27;t break out or have any allergic reactions or anything like that, and I actually like the smell.. But as far as it working, no. You might as well be putting regular lotion on your face. It made parts of my face too greasy and other parts dry and flaky and I saw no improvement with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I should have heeded all the other negative reviews. First let me say the I love Olay regenerist products and I have been using the moisturizer bought at retail stores for many years without a problem. Then I tried buying it from Amazon because the price was so much cheaper. I don&#x27;t know for sure if this is a fake product or what the problem is but about 10 minutes after I applied this moisturizer bought from Amazon, my face turned bright red and started feeling hot, burning, and itching. I had to go stick my face under and faucet and wash it off until the burning feeling subsided. It looked like I had gotten a bad sunburn! I immediately returned this defective product and went to the store and bought another bottle and have been using it without a problem. Still love Olay regenerist moisturizer just not from Amazon.</li>
            <li> thanks for asking, I bought the regenerist for my mother and she loves it, I&#x27;ve already ordered more so thanks again Greg</li>
            <li> great, I&#x27;ve used it for years with good results</li>
            <li> Love the silky feeling</li>
            <li> that was a great buy,and the  cream was great love it.</li>
            <li> A nice moisturizer and I use it 2X&#x27;s a day, but as far as any difference when I look in the mirror, not seeing that.  But&lt;br /&gt;maybe I&#x27;m just too old ??</li>
            <li> I found it to be just another nice moisturizing cream.  I had hoped that my &amp;#34;Granny Wrinkles&amp;#34; would disappear or at least not stand out so much...but they still rise and shine at me in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I got a mini jar of this as a free sample from my gym. I used it over the course of several weeks and it is without a doubt the worst product I have ever put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it seems to leave a weird sticky film that just sits on top of your skin, which I didn&#x27;t particularly like but was willing to put up with. But most importantly, it caused nearly 100 closed comedones to break out all over my forehead, jaw, and cheeks. I&#x27;n in my early 20s and only ever get maybe 3 zits at a time on my face, so this was extremely unusual for me. It took me awhile to figure out it was this product causing the sudden acne all over my face, and it completely wreaked havoc on my skin. A few days after I stopped using it. I noticed a great improvement in my skin, and now a week later I am almost fully back to normal. This has never happened to me with any other product.&lt;br /&gt;I encourage you to exercise caution when using this moisturizer, as apparently this has happened to other women as well.</li>
            <li> My wife still uses this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and think it is better and less expensive than many brands. ( and i have tried a lot of them). I love it. Seems all the Oil of Olay line works well fro me generally.</li>
            <li> Excellent as I have noticed my forehead lines are gone. Although those lines were not obvious. I am a 32 Asian woman and I will definitely keep using it. Yes,if this is your first time using it, breaks out may occur.</li>
            <li> Good stuff at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Just started using. Hard to tell right now.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and found it was cheaper than buying at any stores -- even Wal-Mart where everything is at a lower price.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, be wary of trying the Regenerist Cream.  After using it for a few days, it caused redness and irritation all over my face.</li>
            <li> I wish I tried this sooner!  I have used Olay products off and on since I can remember - starting with the pink one, of course!  My Mom used it and I remember applying the beautiful pink fluid when I was tall enough to reach on tippy toe to reach for it on my Mom&#x27;s dresser!  I have been mistaken for anywhere from early to late 20&#x27;s and I&#x27;m 2 years shy of the big 4-0!  Eeeeek!  I have been religious about applying sunscreen everyday before I go outside as well as a good diet and enough exercise, which all help:)  Recently, I have noticed some fine lines - particularly between my eyebrows (vertical lines!)  I switched from Olay to more natural products, and now that I think about it - that&#x27;s when I started noticing these lines appearing!  No bueno.  I ran out and purchased some Regenerist as I have heard such amazing reviews from women who use this product.  I have to say - I love it too!  I only just started using it, and my skin looks more plump and fresh. I can only imagine what it will look like after continual usage and will come back for and update when I am done with a full jar.  I work part-time at a very expensive skincare counter - and I tried their most expensive cream, nope.  Not worth it!!  Sticking with this product and Olay forever!  No more switching around and I can&#x27;t wait to add the serum to my routine next:)    The formula is a white cream, slight fragrance (which doesn&#x27;t bother me and I usually have fragrance allergies!), not too light or heavy.  It leaves my skin dewy and fresh but not oily!  I like how you can use this morning and night (but in the morning - I will always top it with a sunscreen!) and just a dab will do ya.  It&#x27;s not the cheapest and actually pricey for a drugstore brand.  However, I&#x27;m signing up for the S&amp;S on amazon - which makes it super affordable and less than 20 buck for a cream that outperforms the ones sold at my counter (anti-aging starts at around 100 and all the way up to 360 a jar!)  Although the Olay website recommended the Total Effects line for my skin, I like the Regenerist line much better (after trying out the Total Effects).  No matter what your age or skin concerns, Olay has something for every woman.  And with Amazon, the prices are a lot less than the drugstores and delivered to your doorstep:)  LOVE!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, but forget sculpting!  After 3 weeks use, you are supposed to see results of sculpting, but&lt;br /&gt;I only allowed  myself to be fooled. It does feel good on the skin and does moisturize, and has a very slight&lt;br /&gt;scent, very, very, I should say, because I would have liked a little more. Some like more, some like less., anyway&lt;br /&gt;all in all, it is good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical. Hands down the best skin cream I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m converted.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream - it is so silky and smells wonderful.  Would highly recommend at a good price also.</li>
            <li> I apply every day and see a noticeable difference in my skin.  Smoother and no longer dull. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years now and always get compliments on my skin.  I use it sparingly because of the cost, but it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Writing for my wife as she uses this.  The last jar came from a deep discount store and was $6.00 more not including taxes.  My wife swears by this product and I agree that it has made a difference in her skin tone.</li>
            <li> Maybe at my age I need a stronger moisturizer.</li>
            <li> No. It did not meet my expectations  I expect Procter and gamble products to come from the U S not Thailand. Very irritated with this seller.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and as a swimmer and biker and marathon runner i have always strive to keep my skin well protected and healthy..this product has served this purpose very well over the years.Highly recomend</li>
            <li> my mothers gift and she loves it</li>
            <li> I take a lot of pride in my appearance. I have used all sorts of creams for my face but the one I always go back to is Olay. I have been using it since my early 20&#x27;s and am now in my late 50&#x27;s. If you do the research like I have you will find Olay Regenerist in the top 10 of all other moisturizers along with the most expensive ones. No one believes I&#x27;m my age and even had people want to see my drivers license to prove it. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I can&#x27;t live without it. This is a 5 star plus rating for me. Try it and see the difference it makes.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  Does not remove fine lines.  Moisturizes just as effectively as cheaper options.  Leaves a film on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using  Olay Regenerist for quite a while. When I try to change my skin is not happy! So I go back using it.&lt;br /&gt;And even twice a day without make up it gives you a beautiful skin! And I am over 65!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer for the colder/winter season. The cream keeps my skin silkly smooth and soft. This my third purchase</li>
            <li> LOVE OLAY PRODUCTS!  THEY ARE A GOOD VALUE AND WORK AS WELL OR BETTER THAN THE HIGHEND PRICEY CREAMS.</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipped on time</li>
            <li> i love this stuff because it really work on my skin, also glad i don&#x27;t have to run to store to buy</li>
            <li> this is my favorite moisturizer. I swear I can tell a difference in my skin quality after only a week of using if I try something else.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cream.  My face stays moist all day and night.  Softens the look of wrinkles. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Awesome hydration.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 2007 and something might have changed in the formula. I was pretty sure I had chosen this particular cream because it didn&#x27;t have much silicone in it. I don&#x27;t have the old label to confirm it so I&#x27;ll just focus on the present: It definitely has a lot as of this writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a problem not just with this cream but with most face creams/anti aging products these days. They care more about the customer having an instant experience rather than a real improvement. Real improvements typically take time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with silicone (and this product in particular) is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. It pills, especially after applying makeup. Creates solid residue that rubs off. I gave a jar of this to a friend and the same happened for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B. Silicone forms a barrier on top of the skin. Skin breathes less and the barrier blocks actives in the cream. So creams with silicone are probably just a cosmetic and not a transformational treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to find a commercial cream with proven ingredients that just sinks in. If I need silicone, I&#x27;ll buy a primer made specifically for that purpose.</li>
            <li> BESIDE THE NAME BEING TOO LONG I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  IT MAKES MY SKIN SO SOFT  MY MAKE UP JUST GUIDES ON!&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN SO THIS WAS A REAL FIND FOR ME!  lOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Seems to moisturize well but after using 2 jars I have a lot of clogged pores and blackheads. I don&#x27;t really care for the smell. I&#x27;ve been using Kiehls products for years and was trying to save some money. Price is right but goes much faster than my jar of Kiehls so dont&#x27; know if it&#x27;s really a money saver. I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> great price.  no shipping charge.  I love the product</li>
            <li> After using daily for weeks, saw no difference.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles of Olay regenerist microsculpting cream from HBC DEPOT, Amazon.  They came in a bubble envelope.  The problem is they don&#x27;t even have the original paper package as you see in the drug stores.  They were wrap with plastic. I highly doubted its authentic now.  It could be someone get the used bottle and put in some fake cream and sell them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, some cream spit out from one of the bottle, and all over the plastic wrap.  It&#x27;s messy, and I need to return it.</li>
            <li> Im not one to religiously moisturize my face....I live in a tropical climate so my skin isn&#x27;t terribly dry to begin with but I do notice quite a difference when I use this cream for a few days.  I have forehead wrinkles and they are significantly reduced after a few uses.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO BE OKAY, BUT I DO NOT SEE ANY GREAT IMPROVEMENT WITH MY SKIN YET. IN FACT I&#x27;VE HAD MORE LITTLE BREAKOUT PATCHES THEN USUAL.  BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T HURT OR BURN OR ITCH.  SO THATS A PLUS. I WILL CONTINUE TO USE UNLESS SOMETHING GETS WORSE. THANKS</li>
            <li> Got this when it was a good price. Love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> didnt see any reduction in wrinkles.  Good moisturizer, but did not work well for night cream.  Have been using it for about 3 weeks.  Maybe it will show some results before it is all gone??</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I googled, &#x27;best night creams&#x27;.  This was listed with some very expensive night creams.  I tried it and it rivals what I used to get from Lancome.  It also has no scent, which I appreciate.  I now get it through subscribe and save for a really great price.</li>
            <li> I was using another product which worked fine but was a little pricey so I checked into this.  I read many positive reviews so I purchase it.  I used it for 2 days and started getting little pimples on my face.  The directions indicated that you should also use on your neck which I did.  While I felt no itching I noticed that after the 2 days of use, I had little red spots on my neck and just below which I thought was chicken pot or measles.  I stopped using it immediately and all has cleared up, with the exceptions the blemishes from the pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this product and this was such a great price on here. Received it in a reasonable amount of time also. Was concerned the product itself might be outdated as far as shelf life but it wasn&#x27;t. Very pleased</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer  but I wish it contained a sunscreen. It works well on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy feel afterwards. It&#x27;s easy to apply makeup over it. It has a nice feel to it when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;because it doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen, I use it at night and when I wake up my skin doesn&#x27;t feel so tight. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in wrinkles, but I don&#x27;t worry about that kind of thing. I don&#x27;t see stains on my pillowcase, which makes me very happy to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for 2 years now...i guess i have the fragrant free because it has no smell...and i use it before make up..as moisturizer..and it works real good!</li>
            <li> This cream may perform as claimed, or not. It spreads well but I can&#x27;t get past the heavy, sharp scent.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely brighter and more even and my eyes look more widen by this product.  I gave this a 4 only because I get some breakouts here and there.  I would definitely recommend this product.  It was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product, feels great.</li>
            <li> I really love the texture of this product. My friends have tried it and told me nothing but amazing things about it. So I thought I would go out and get some myself. I waited until the store was having a sale and purchased it. My skin felt amazing as soon as I put it on. Olay makes great products and this product does not disappoint. The cream feels really smooth and nice on your face as you put it on. There are some creams out there that feel like sandpaper on your face and it was a nice surprise to find this wasn’t one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did not like about it was the smell. It was a very strong scent that I had to have very close to my nose and it definitely stood out to me that I didn&#x27;t want this smell on my face, but in order to avoid wrinkles I guess I can deal with the heavy stench. I looked past it after I used this product for a while. I have to say, this is a must buy! You will not be disappointed! Good luck to you all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Olay Lover, so when I saw this product I had to try it.  Once again, I am a happy girl! The texture is non-greasy, light and makes my skin luminous.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product after using a similar product from Mary Kay, hands down Olay is better.  I saw zero difference from using MK for 2 months, but within 5 days I could already see and feel the difference with Olay! This is a great product to add to your anti-aging arsenal.</li>
            <li> this cream is really good. its just a little expensive for me. I use a lot of it and need to by at least once a month.</li>
            <li> I have a dry skin and a little bit sensitive, but this bottle really surprises me. It can really moisture my sensitive without feeling greasy, and it won’t leave any stains on the pillow. It just makes me feel so tight, soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have some lines, but this one just feels like plumping up my skin, now my lines are slighter then before. Besides this moisturizer is in reasonable price, but come with amazing result, highly recommended to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just to be fair, I don’t like the smell, but I would give it a 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have used Oil of Olay products for&lt;br /&gt; 42 years.  Love them!!!</li>
            <li> This product works wOnders!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for two years. Nothing works better.</li>
            <li> Hi my name is Barb. Just bought and tried this cream. My skin is dry so after application of this cream my skin feels dry unlike other moistures I have used. Should I apply a creamier moisturizer over this? May sound silly but that&#x27;s it. Please advise. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Without doubt! This is my &amp;#34;Go To&amp;#34;  product and has been for years! Read unbiased reviews, ranked #1. And comparibale to 100.00 &amp; over products!</li>
            <li> I like this product.Its light and absorb quickly and make my skin look softer.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.  I am currently serving in Afghanistan and the climate here is pretty extreme.  My skin always looks amazing.  I like the fragrence free one, but I have used both.  I am 335 and my skin has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;Use it night and day.  The only complaint that I have with it is that it does not come with SPF coverage.</li>
            <li> This product is hands down my favorite moisturizer out there and it is reasonably priced. I have combined it with [[ASIN:B00ITXVZK4 RenuvaDerm - Anti-Aging Skin Serum!]] The combination of these products has given me amazing results, highly recommended</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer...absorbs into skin very well. Not greasy at all. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay products for years &amp;amp; recently started using this particular product when Olay discontiinued the Divinity line.  I will continue to use Regenerist Micro-Scultping Cream.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Have been using it for three years.  Can tell a difference in my skin and depth of wrinkles, etc.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this cream and needed a night creme. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The Regenerist Micro-Scullpting Cream is a really good bargain.  I have used it for several years and am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> perfect and excellent product and service from this seller ..</li>
            <li> Jar came unsealed.  Top was loose.  Cream was thicker then usual and did not smell like the Olay cream.</li>
            <li> I recommend this moisturizer. It absorbs well, no greasy feeling. As far as the regenerating and micro-sculpting goes will have to use it longer. I can say it gives a nice tiny tingle, which makes my face feel like its been cleaned and moisturized and refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;I like it and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The company sent a very nice package and it was delivered the day they said, great job, thank you.</li>
            <li> I totally love OlAY REGENERIST micro-sculpting cream. I keep trying other brands, but keep coming back to this  as it firms my jawline and decreases my laugh lines. I will stay with oil of olay from  now on. Give it a month, it works wonders!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few night face creams from the drugstore, and this one is definitely my favorite - it&#x27;s rich and super-moisturizing, and it&#x27;s making a real difference to my face and neck. It makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth, and I think its claim to firm up saggy skin is at least partially justified. I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK as a cream, but I don&#x27;t see any visible results and it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.  Even an hour after application I feel like I have an extra layer on my skin.  After some time, I found myself avoiding this cream in favor of the other two on my bathroom stand.  I eventually tossed it, even though it was still 1/2 full.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea facial skin condition. I use this as a base before putting on my medication because my facial skin gets VERY dry and flakes (before using this product). This product has helped so much to literally reduce considerably the negative affects of my condition. I&#x27;m 51 with NO wrinkles. Not even when I squint. Nobody has been able to guess my age correctly. I think this product helps a LOT to smooth and mosturize my skin and keep me looking much younger. I love Olay products.</li>
            <li> The cream appears to have some firming BUT, I&#x27;m also using Retin-A at night so that could also account for some of the effects. The main reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it is a little heavy so I try to be sure not to apply too much. Also, it smells pretty strong although I see they now have an unscented version. For the price, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied though and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Since this is a time sensitive product -- I haven&#x27;t had it or used it long enough to share results.  It did arrive on time and was the full size it advertised.  The rest of the review will be done after the 90 days they say will improve my skin.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this product of olay than any other...it does a great job...have seen great results of my skin on my face..i like it alot..i ordered one more to my cousin and she loves it tooo....</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. I use it summer and winter to moisturize. It is non-greasy, but very effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to my mom, she likes it very much. She bought two bottles after it.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonble price.  I love Olay products.  They are a great bargain.  They are .  Yes they are.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 85-year old Mom, and she told me she really likes it. If I could attach a picture of Mom (which she might kill me for!), you would see that she has really nice skin! I read great reviews about this product in fashion magazines-it fits right up in the top 15-20 products of any and all very expensive products. I already bought another for myself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, and I notice zero change.  I don&#x27;t even particularly like it as a moisturizer because it&#x27;s slightly sticky, and too thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who comes up with the names for products, but you have to laugh at some of them. \\&quot;Micro-sculpting?\\&quot; If it is \\&quot;micro,\\&quot; what&#x27;s the point, as any firming would be nearly unnoticeable, lol. In any case, a good product, when used with the overnight product, that really does leave your skin nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t have any unpleasant smell to it (as many similar products do). If used as directed, a jar of this should last you 2-3 months (if you use it in the a.m. and p.m.). Generally I like the Olay Regenerist line. I am not a particular fan of a lot of Olay products, but the Regenerist line, I&#x27;ve always been pleased with their results. (I&#x27;m 47, very fair skin, only a few small wrinkles, or I guess they&#x27;re called \\&quot;laugh lines\\&quot;--except who actually laughs at getting wrinkles?--not prone to blemishs/acne etc. I use sunblock in the summer since I burn easily. My skin tends to run slightly dry, and more so in the winter months. This, combined with the overnight sculpting lotion, never fails to leave my skin soft. I definitely notice when I do NOT use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist for years and have recommended it to many friends and family members. It&#x27;s as advertised...I&#x27;ve gotten wonderful results and receive many compliments on my youthful skin even though I&#x27;m almost 67.</li>
            <li> This product can help me to solve all aging problem. I used to have a lot of line at my jaw and my forehead. Now it&#x27;s gone. thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use this all the time.  Makes my skin soft and not oily</li>
            <li> Been using this product for several years mow and always being told how nice my skin is and I am almost 60!</li>
            <li> heard great reviews about this product so I decided to try it.  When I first tried it I noticed that my face felt like it had a residue on it.  My face also had a dull look that it didn&#x27;t have before.  By the second day I noticed little small pimples popping up on my face and neck. You should think twice about using this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so smooth and bright . Lines are less visible . Easy to apply . Do not left skin feeling greasy . Great product .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years and I love it for the price. I live in a desert climate and it&#x27;s moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> Olay products all seem to work well. We&#x27;re just glad we can get this delivered on a recurring schedule.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a decent moisturizer but not sure this cream is doing anything to my face at all. Haven&#x27;t notice anything at all.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever!!</li>
            <li> I returned this after a week.  I didn&#x27;t care for the smell and upon closer inspection of the label, found there are chemicals that I am trying to avoid.  It probably works just fine but I found other more natural creams that work and don&#x27;t include the harsh chemicals. Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment is the one I tried after this and I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  I have been using it for years and will continue to use it.  Regenerist products are great!</li>
            <li> First off, let me say I am not in any way benefitting from this review.....&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at the results.  A little about myself: I&#x27;m 40 and have recently (intentionally) lost over 30 pounds, have had a stressful last six months, and have an expressive face (I wrinkle my eyebrows a lot). So I started to notice creases above my eyebrows.  Stress, weight loss, and my continued eye wrinkling started to show. Ugh.  I can&#x27;t afford medical intervention, but knew that I needed to do something. Just like everyone else ... I had seen the Olay commercials. I&#x27;m a natural born skeptic and hate to waste money.  $20-- ok, worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the cream (light, non greasy, lovely) one night before bed. The forehead creases are noticeably diminished after only one day&#x27;s use. I looked more rested and fresh faced.  I was completely surprised. I am anxious to see what a week&#x27;s worth of use will do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a round a month.  I like the feel of it and it&#x27;s not greasy feeling! It&#x27;s probably just as good as the department store creams. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very rich and creamy, moisturizing. that&#x27;s nice. But I&#x27;ve broken out several times since using this. Also, I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;dispenser&amp;#34; which is just a small jar. Not sanitary to dip your finger in the pot every time. Won&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;But - I did read that Olay is reformulating the Regenerist brand so I&#x27;ll be watching that.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and am pleased with it.  Use it with the serum and like it better tan other products on the market.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well and isn&#x27;t oily.  I use this on my hands and face.  My hands are much softer and my age spots have diminished.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this like I should but I occasuonally get a sll rash on my face, within 2-3 days of using the rash is gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for 2 years now. I use it nightly, but 2-3 X a week I add OLAY REGENERIS SERUM over it at night.. In the morning I use OLAY DAILY MOISTURIZER. In my younger days I lived at the beach and spent years and years in the sun so I did have a significant amount of sun damage on my face. This product has cleared up that damage in less than 2 years. IT&#x27;S FANTASTIC. I NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT !!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the winter.</li>
            <li> I do not know, smells nicely. I am still waiting for the results. After one month all the wrinkles in its place,</li>
            <li> I have paid four times as much for creams that do&#x27;t do any better than this.  A real deal for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and if she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy. Happy Wife, Happy Life!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!  I got the wrinkle cream also and this is by far my favorite.  I use other creams also like Roc at nighttime and the two work so well together.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a couple of years and like it.</li>
            <li> They did change the ingredients... The trick now is to blot it into the skin, and never rub. It&#x27;s kept my hereditary forehead lines at bay for the five years I&#x27;ve been using it (&amp;#34;knock on wood&amp;#34;; I hope I never get them). Worth the price even after the ingredient change.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re probably wasting your time and money.</li>
            <li> by far my favorite beauty product</li>
            <li> To heavy &amp; thick for my liking. I have a friend who absolutely loves it &amp; will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and night it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. I&#x27;m 50 but look 35 it just softens your whole face.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream at CVS to try a different one. I was really surprised by the affect. My skin looks and feels much smoother and younger than before. My skin is sensitive, but I haven&#x27;t had any problem after finishing almost one jar. I ordered a new jar today.</li>
            <li> Nice face cream but a little less perfume would be better.  I like a little scent but not this much.  Why do all these lesser costing products have sooo much perfume!?!</li>
            <li> This works well.  I have received a lot of compliment s since using this.  I have noticed that my lines and wrinkles are smaller, and my skin is clearer</li>
            <li> Love this cream! My skin looks great, and you don&#x27;t need to apply much! A lot goes a long way, which means this lasts (for me anyway) about 3 months. I usually buy my moisturizers of the same amount about once a month, so that is great. It also absorbs very quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy. I have been looking for this for a long time!</li>
            <li> I use this under my eyes and I&#x27;m 23, I have been using it for a year now and it really helps. I would recommend only using it under your eyes and barely any anywhere else if you&#x27;re young, because this will caused me to have more breakouts. Its not fantastic under my eyes but it works, usually takes two nights in a row to see a difference if I forget to use it for a bit. I think there&#x27;s probably better stuff for your under eyes though.</li>
            <li> It really works. My skin is clearer and brighter.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I would do without this product. I have been a regular user for about three years now.</li>
            <li> Very moisturous product.My mother is 65 years old, she and I love it. After using, our skin are not dry and feel soft and tendered. We don&#x27;t have too much wrinkle but we guess this product is good to prevent.</li>
            <li> I am not giving this product any rating except for one star because I am actually writing to get the opinion of the Olay consultant (I noticed their comments on this site)on why doesn&#x27;t this product contain any sun block protection.  Any anti-aging product should contain some form of SPF as this is what damages the skin to begin with (other than the age).  Please respond.</li>
            <li> If you use this cream twice a day, the jar will last you almost 3 months (I proved it by writing the date I opened the new jar), combining the cream with the serum works even BETTER but I generally use it alone.  I have been using Regenerist Sculpting Cream for the last 3 years, twice a day, in the morning before I apply my makeup and at night after I take my make up off and my face loves it.....I&#x27;m almost 45 and most people think I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s, I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought other creams that cost 3x more, but I didn&#x27;t not see huge difference, so I&#x27;ll stick to my Regenerist that costs under $20 bucks and save my money.  I can&#x27;t swear to you that it gets rid of wrinkles, but I can tell you that it helps to prevent new ones from daring to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I even have my brother-in-law using it.</li>
            <li> My mum has used this for a few years, and it works really well in reducing the fine lines. Not cheap, but it seems to be worth the price for less than $20.</li>
            <li> I Like this cream! I tried one and then decided to buy another one. works pretty well. price relatively cheap , but quality is very good.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying. I&#x27;ve never been one to spend much money on facial creams...and first came upon this one at a Sam&#x27;s Club when I actually had the money to buy it. Since then, I&#x27;ve gotten hooked on it!</li>
            <li> I usually love Olay products and this has not disappointed me.  It feels so good going on and I can tell some difference in my skin already;  I tend to have really dry skin this time of year and I feel like it helps.</li>
            <li> I love this product in fact I do not believe Olay can make a bad product I use a lot of their line,it feels so good on your skin</li>
            <li> I had used this before and was happy to find it at a good price on Amazon.  I think it does help - certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt!  When you get to a &#x27;certain age&#x27;, every little bit helps!</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it every day.</li>
            <li> Opening the jar, I was disappointed and initially assumed Olay changed the formula since the cream is thinner and does not have the same smell. Upon further investigation, this product was obviously manufactured at Procter &amp; Gamble’s plant in Bangkok, Thailand. Apparently the formula for the exact same product varies depending on the manufacturing location. Since Olay creams are sold for much less in many countries, it explains why this is available for so much less.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream on my face and neck for several years and love it. I like the light scent, and I believe it keeps my skin firm and bright!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife, unfortunately the sender shipped the cheaper fragrance free regenerist product at the same price. The fragrance free formula also made my wife&#x27;s face break out. This was a very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 years.  I am 64 years old and my dermatologist told me last week that I have wonderful skin for my age.  what more could I ask for.</li>
            <li> Like I said in my last review Love, Love, Love this product have used it since it came out and will continue to use it, i hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Good deal！The cream is worth the price and performs well in moisturizing. I like the smell. Although it may be too sweet to somebody.</li>
            <li> I saw the ad from Olay claiming that this cream was as good as $500 creams, so I went and purchased one. But the scent is truly way too strong. It smells like I&#x27;m putting on perfume! I use Shiseido Future Solution LX Night Cream ($220) and this cream does not even come close to what it claims (as good as $500 creams), it can&#x27;t even match Shiseido&#x27;s which is 1/2 as expensive. Truly a let down, especially with the really strong scent for a cream. If this was a lotion, I would expect the scent to be strong, but for a facial cream, the scent is overpowering and feels like it belongs on the body, not on the face. It makes the cream feel very cheap and substandard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the most expensive moisturizers on my face for years but I always come back to Olay Regenerist. At night I add a peas size amount of retinol with the Regenerist and rub on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price! Have been using for years and love it !!!</li>
            <li> I tried this because I read it was the #1 anti aging cream and now in my early forties, I&#x27;m looking into different formulas to help with cellular turnover and wrinkle prevention. I had previously used Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream with good results. I realize all skin types are different and interact differently with different products.l&#x27;pp  &amp;#34; I have always had good skin with the occasional blemish right before that time of the month. My skin has always been flawless and I modeled when I was younger. I&#x27;ve previously used Lamcome and Clinique products as well as Cetafil to cleanse my face. This cream caused me to breakout horribly. I have a huge red bump that appears to be formed from underneath and breakouts with pus on my forehead and cheeks. Not realizing this was causing it I continued to wash my face and use it at night until I realized that this is the only different thing I had done or used.</li>
            <li> Arrived early. The price was the cheapest I spent so far. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for maybe 10 yrs. I thought SAM&#x27;s Club has the best deal. They run out of it so I was surprised that Amazon was shipping it for free and has special $3.00 discount on top of it. Best purchase I ever had.</li>
            <li> Review by Tom&#x27;s wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell &amp; texture of this cream. However, I do not feel that it&#x27;s hydrating enough for my dry skin. Maybe I should use it with the Regenerist serum. Strangely, I find the Olay Total Effects creams more hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update: From 3 stars to 4 stars. I&#x27;ve been using this for approx. 2 weeks every evening now. Originally, I didn&#x27;t think this cream was that great. I decided to leave my skin slightly damp before applying. I find this makes the product go on more smoothly. So, now my skin feels more hydrated. :)</li>
            <li> This is my usual cream and when I saw the price with a coupon, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up as it was a few dollars than I would pay at my usual store.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year. I am pleased with the results. No magic, just soft skin.  I use it as a night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product does better than any other product I have tried.  It is unscented which is great since we have a perfume sensitivity issue in our home.  Does all it states and more!</li>
            <li> My wife had been using this for quite sometime now (this was a gift purchase for her). She looks young &amp; beautiful, which is the end result, right??</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and does not cause problems with my sensitive skin.  I like that it does not have sunscreen (though others may not) because you can use it around your eyes without worry.  It definitely decreases the appearance of fine lines and I believe it also firms as well.  Very reasonably priced at most retailers with coupons available- even through Amazon!  I really like the jar because it makes it very easy to get every drop out- but just know if you travel alot it is going to add weight because it is made of glass.</li>
            <li> well.is not working one me .may i&#x27;m too young for this stuff .i won&#x27;t buy it again ever .bye .</li>
            <li> This cream work a great for face and neck compares to the more expensive ones. Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Since this product is fulfilled by Amazon, I know I am getting a great product at a great price. As a prime member shipping is no problem.</li>
            <li> I like this product and have re-purchased it.  It feels very pleasant on the skin, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels silky and smooth and foundation goes on well afterwards.</li>
            <li> This cream is really nice!  It is light, absorbs quickly, leaving a smooth feel to the skin and no stickiness.  It also lasts all day.  It appears not to have vitamin E in it, too, since my face doesn&#x27;t get red, which it usually does upon getting any tocopheral on it.  Recommended by an old lady with wrinkles....imagine what it can do for someone with nice skin!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great price and product :)</li>
            <li> I love this, been using it for years now.. I am 60, and my skin still looks nice.</li>
            <li> Use all the time, silky smooth, not heavy, smells nice, and much better price than in stores.</li>
            <li> I have noticed in the last week that this product works and it works well! My budding wrinkles have already started fading away while my skin in general has evened out in color... No more blotchy skin or old old acne scars! Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, only takes a tiny bit and I absolutely need it before I apply my makeup, helps makeup apply without pulling your skin, it don&#x27;t cause caking, and it helps it glide across your silky smooth skin. My friends all ask what is my secret to younger looking skin and I tell them Olay Regenerist is. I won&#x27;t get dressed with out this!</li>
            <li> I just find out that this olay product is made in Thailand, I will wonder that the quality of this cream might not be the same good as though t made in usa</li>
            <li> Love this product so expensive in the shop&#x27;s I new Amazon would do one better price wise will certainly be ordering plenty more well done.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and always buy it from Amazon as the price is better than even my membership store.</li>
            <li> i love olay products and usually can see and feel a difference within days. this does not smell or feel like an olay product and has done absolutely nothing for my skin. like other reviewers,  i am wondering if this is a fake, and also peeved when i realized i could have gotten the real deal substantially cheaper in my local grocery store...the s&amp;h on this one is particularly high. im going to give it another day or two and if i still dont see the expected results im going to ask for a refund. i have always appreciated feeling like i could trust that im getting what i was supposed to with Amazon,  but this product makes me wonder...gave it the two stars for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service from the company</li>
            <li> This cream adds a glow while diminishing flaws that come with age and it works quickly. I noticed a difference within days.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I&#x27;ve using up the last of the Neutrogena i have but I&#x27;ve been wanting to use this and you couldn&#x27;t beat this deal especially with the extra coupon.</li>
            <li> Good to use, and the customer services is also very kind</li>
            <li> I like this, it cheap and it moisturizes well. However, it has no vit c, or hyaluronic acid, etc, so I use the skingenixx night serum  [[ASIN:B00VSL3390 Skingenixx Advanced Age-Reversing Night Time Skin Serum]] with it every night and I have been very happy with the both of them.</li>
            <li> My go to face cream for years. It has a light, pleasing scent and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Also use their cleanser. I am a loyal Olay customer.</li>
            <li> They are not counterfeits but more like an inferior product. I just found out awhile ago and it&#x27;s notorious when you buy it online in places like Amazon. If you look at some of the pictures especially the one with the label in the back, it will say made in Thailand. The one shown in the picture is how it&#x27;s suppose to be with the top lid being with the OLAY name on top. The front of it is also different and the color of the jar and smell of the cream is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many many people are buying it without knowing this. Just hopefully you didn&#x27;t buy it for a loved one as a present and them finding out why it&#x27;s not working very well. The one made in the USA is good.</li>
            <li> i have been using this since 2009 after my friend&#x27;s suggestion. Very nice product; keeps my skin nice and soft! I am also very happy with the service i get from amozon with my 3 months supply orders.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels much smoother and younger than before. Great product, face always look refreshing. Product came well packed and arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> GReat product- I use it at night. Feels great going on and lasts all night. Skin much smoother-noticable difference in morning</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Smells and feels great!  I will be back to buy more!! My skin is so very happy now!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is getting good reviews. I am 50 years old and I feel like I wasted my money. This did nothing for me, I have dry skin and have to moisturize several times a day, this dried out my skin even more and did nothing for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. (Olay&#x27;s new professional products line is really very good.) It lasted almost all winter (3 months) because it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover the face. It did give a descent result - but not a dramatic result. If you are looking for a dramatic change in the surface of your skin it would be best to go with a prescription product. (They can only sell up to a certain strength without a prescription.) I don&#x27;t like Retin A. I don&#x27;t want too much skin to peel off, and I don&#x27;t like they dry flaking it can cause. After selling many different skin care lines for many years and experimenting with others I&#x27;ve learned not to try to do too much of a dramatic change to the skin at once and peel a lot of layers off. Better slow than sorry. We only get one face. So, I don&#x27;t want to peel my skin off eliminating too many layers at a time. It just seems dangerous to me, and I&#x27;ve seen some really frightening results. (I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, but when I&#x27;ve seen others try to peel many layers off at once it looks as if they will scar.) I also think micro-dermabrasion hurts, but that is just me. I&#x27;ve only done it one time.</li>
            <li> This cream is great. I have used it for several years and find it as good as some of the more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> Very effective and quick acting. Face really looks firmer and silky after a week&#x27;s use. I had use this product for about a year now and the results are very visible.</li>
            <li> I love this product and was not going to get it, sure am glad that I changed my mind, My skin is so soft!.</li>
            <li> At age 75 it makes my face feel young and is definetly softening.I would not use any other face cream</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizers you will ever find at this price point. I have used it for years and love the difference it makes in my skin. I can tell the difference when I run out!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for a little over a week and my skin feels amazing .. I am not sure my wrinkles have lessened but my skin feels great .</li>
            <li> Works to help keep good skin and very comfortable to wear. Can&#x27;t beat the quality and price! I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best over the counter cream I&#x27;ve found on the market. I bought mine at walgreens for 29.99 so its cheaper on Amazon. Within 24 hrs of use I see a huge difference in my face. I use obaji face wash, follow up with the green tree face mask then scrubbed that off with the revitalift scrub and face scrub let it dry then put this on and let it soak in. Worked wonders over night. All my lines in my face are softened up so much you can barely tell they are there. I look about 10 years younger. This stuff soaks into the skin and puffs it up. I&#x27;ll continue to buy it...I love it. I was considering juvederm but this will save me from having to bother with spending all that money. It comes very close to the results you will get from it. You just have to use it daily.</li>
            <li> Not certain that this night cream is the best out there, but for the price it is certainly a fine option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having no sensitivity reaction, the cream goes on nicely without a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to work in moisturing my face and neck and both skin areas feel firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a repeat purchase, first time on Amazon, good price and delivery.</li>
            <li> Lip Stick is very moist and easy to put on. I&#x27;ve been using the Olay moisturizer for several years and love it.</li>
            <li> This year I had my 71st Birthday. I am still youthful because of Olay.  So easy now to pick up my iPad and place my order. So much cheaper at Amazon. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am surprised that i can buy such a good product with so low price. It really makes my face firm. Talk about sculpting? not very obviously until now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works as a sculpting cream, but it  does moisten the skin, goes on smoothly, and has a nice subtle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a few years, and though I just turned 80, my skin looks pretty good.  It cost less here, than at&lt;br /&gt;Costco.  I didn&#x27;t give it five stars, because of the sculpting claim.</li>
            <li> I do not like this at all.  I was looking for a moisturizer for winter, but this was a waste of $$.  The smell is overpowering and it feels like I am just slathering my face with chemicals.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> Not for people over 70, I don&#x27;t think there is anything out there for old people, might be great for young people.</li>
            <li> I really feel that this has helped me from getting wrinkles.  I am in my thirties and I have used this product for about three years.  If you like other Olay products (I love the Microgenerist), Olay sometimes has a rebate (a good one) for spending $50 on their products.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it has no sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Best cream for my dry aging skin.  Tried other creams and always comeback to this. Very moisturizing and I love the scent.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> First of all, The bottle came without a box. There was a partial plastic wrap on the bottle top. Secondly, the bottle was not even clean! I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> i just got it will give update in one week</li>
            <li> I did not like this cream because I did not see any improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it was greasy.  I had high hopes for this but it did not live up to&lt;br /&gt;its claim.</li>
            <li> I have had several people recently comment on how nice my skin looks. Having suffered sun damage over the years I am pleased with how nice my skin  looks. I really really think this product has a lot to do with my good skin. I am 70 + and feel and look a lot younger.</li>
            <li> I started using this a few years back when I could no longer get my CHR.  It is very smooth and creamy. It has a light, pleasant scent.  It works just as good as the CHR which cost almost 2x the price of this one.</li>
            <li> I noticed results right away as advertised, not face lift changes but complimentary and i felt confident the product works. It did not leave my face feeling oily or sticky, and i am still seeing results weeks later. my skin looks refreshed new and young again.</li>
            <li> Six months ago my wife and I tried Olay&#x27;s Eye Restoration Complex. It was part of a package of three Olay products designed to combat aging (wrinkles, under eye &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34;, age lines). We are both in our mid sixties and healthy. Of the three products in the package we bought, we found that the Eye Restoration worked extremely well after using it for three to four weeks. The swelling and dark circles under our eyes nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li> It is not your $100 cream, but it is not bad for the price.  I use it for my morning routine, and it keep my skin moisture for couple of hours, and I apply some more in the afternoon.  Overall, it is a good cream for the price</li>
            <li> Has kept my face soft, smooth and moist - keeps those wrinkles at bay.  Been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> totally amazing product at an even more amazing price. my first time buying beauty products online and I am more than satisfied. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. I will continue to purchase here.</li>
            <li> bought for wifey, she is happy now.</li>
            <li> It may just be me,but I didn&#x27;t understand why it was soo much cheaper,as I paid less than 12.00 the jar is same size,it says Olay onunderside,but didn&#x27;t seem to work as well,and I have used this product for years. On the underside it says,made in china,as my other Olay products do not,beware</li>
            <li> This product really works. It does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do. My wrinkles have disappear and my skin is smooth, soft, and dark circle free. The seller was great and the product came faster than expected. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t yet used this product as frequently/regularly as I eventually plan to. But so far, when I use this I encounter no problems whatsoever. My face feels fresh and looks better when I get up in the morning 9I use this product as a night cream to apply when I go to bed). I feel fine about this product I just need to buckle down and use it more often.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Great Price</li>
            <li> i received this item initially wrapped in a cellophane, as opposed to receiving it brand new,meaning sealed &amp; stored in its original box. the jar does say Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream though. but inside the jar was half full. i  complained to Amazon about it and seller sent me another one. this time, it&#x27;s in a plain collapsible RED box, the kind you buy at a craft store,and the jar still wrapped in cellophane. inside looks like it&#x27;s been opened as the inner cap was loose. i feel uneasy using it as it may not be the real stuff. please, please. refund my money! if they want their stuff back, send me a prepaid envelope or something. if not, i&#x27;ll throw it away.</li>
            <li> Hate the price but love the cream.</li>
            <li> (This review includes what happened with Regenerist micro-sculpting Serum, because the instructions say to use them together for best results.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was satisfied with Olay 7-in-One anti-aging moisturizer for my face, so I tried the Regenerist Serum first on my neck, and as recommended, used the Olay Micro-Sculpting Moisture Cream afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started getting some \\&quot;turkey sagging\\&quot; and since I already trusted my previous Olay face products, I decided to try this Serum and Cream for the neck. The first morning I woke up, my neck seemed to look a little better (this product promises firming by the 5th day). So I used it on my face too. By the third morning, my skin looked awful. There was new puffiness UNDER the bags under my eyes, plus wrinkly sagging on my cheekbones that had never been there before! I looked like E.T. the Extra-terrestrial (movie)! And my neck had NEW wrinkles on it! The wrinkles had spread from just in the center of my neck to additional wrinkles slightly to the sides. I said to myself, this has to be something else... but by the 7th morning it was undeniable and even more prominent than the 3rd morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Moisturizer, applied after the Serum, stays sticky all night, and when I tried wearing it in the morning, my foundation wouldn&#x27;t spread well over this greasy substance. I also noticed new clogged pores resulting in white-headed milia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to my Olay 7-in-One Fragrance Free Moisturizer, which has kept my wrinkles from increasing for two years, and makes my older wrinkles look less obvious, and my foundation goes on smoothly and without getting into creases. I use it in the daytime. I&#x27;ve gone back to my old lightweight night moisturizer from Neutrogena Naturals, and both of these things (thank goodness!) brought my skin back to where it was before. I&#x27;ll be trying these old favorites on my neck, which I&#x27;d never thought of doing. And I&#x27;ll be happier with how I look!</li>
            <li> it is too oily for me</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is a happy medium between not too thick and not too light. Thankfully there is hardly a scent, very neutral feel and smell.</li>
            <li> Great formula with a pleasant scent, moisturizes well and leaves your skin feeling smooth.  I use this daily as a night cream since it doesn&#x27;t contain SPF.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  Nice, premium packaging.</li>
            <li> I use this daily at night. Great compliment to Olay Regenerist Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Soaks right in...not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the scentless version.</li>
            <li> Love anything for Olay, have nothing but results on all their products.  The price is fair, much cheaper than some of those high end products you buy from Macy&#x27;s, Dillard&#x27;s, Saks etc...  Product came fast &amp; since I have prime I didn&#x27;t pay for shipping .</li>
            <li> Been using for years!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time. I was surprised at the price. Will be purchasing again. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar of this and the serum which goes on first. I see no difference from any other product. Worse - after gently rubbing in, it rolls off like peeling skin. I assume it doesn&#x27;t really sink in .I&#x27;ve switched to Olay Regenerating Serum and Regenerist Deep Hydration Cream Moisturizer in AM and for bedtime, Regenerating Night Recovery Cream moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t believe that any lotion can &amp;#34;sculpt&amp;#34; one&#x27;s jawline or face. We always want to believe the hype.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It feels so light, but works so well!</li>
            <li> Always go back to this . . . much better than the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Was bought as gift and was told by the recipient that it is not a original Olay product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 6 years.  I am 70+ and my skin is very smooth.  I often get comments about how clear and soft my skin appears.</li>
            <li> This is the best Olay cream I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve used a few!( I haven;t tried the Pro line, but if this keeps working as well as it is...I probably won&#x27;t either!) Great for fading forehead lines, and good for firming the jawline too.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff. I think she puts it on her ice cream or something. Goes through it like water.</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels after using this cream for the past month. My face feels regenerated. I even have my 30 yr old daughter using it. Never too young to start taking care of your face.</li>
            <li> Good price &amp; wonderful product!</li>
            <li> this cream will peel your skin in one day. I applied this cream and next morning i got dry patches on my face. this contains nylon-12 which is not good for the skin. This is going back to amazon.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this product so I decided to try it.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell but I love the feel on my skin and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is *AMAZING* if you suffer from seborrheic dermatitis!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled (massively) with it (redness on the sides of my nose) for 12 years now.  For the past 8 years, I have carefully used the this process, to keep it at bay (and any slight departure would always allow it to flare up!):&lt;br /&gt;  1. Wash face (nose area) lightly for 10-15 seconds with a 1\\&quot; sponge and a very small amount of Dove moisturizing soap.&lt;br /&gt;  2. Rinse and dry *quickly*&lt;br /&gt;  3. Somewhat firmly rub a tiny drop of Almay milk plus Nourishing Facial Lotion into my skin, for 15 seconds, to help exfoliate and moisturize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I deviated in any way, or if I got too stressed out, or if my fingers were oily and I touched my nose, it would get very bad.  But I could manage, most of the time.  Unfortunately, though, Almay stopped making the &#x27;milk plus&#x27; lotion several years ago, and my last bottle was running out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tried many other products - nothing came close to the Almay.  But then I found this - Olay Regenerish micro-sculpting cream (at Costco).  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and have not had a single trace of redness!  I am blown away; nothing has ever worked so well.  It&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t have the condition anymore.  Not only that, but I love the smell of the cream, and I like the fact that the container fully seals (...the Almay stuff has a flimsy snap-cap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely grateful to have found this cream... it is, hands down, the best product I have ever used to treat my seborrheic dermatitis.  I highly recommend it for anyone else with this condition!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream thinking it will be able to moisturize my skin while providing anti-age benefit. But I found it to be too strong for my skin. Within a week of using this skin on my cheek bones developed cracks and started flaking. If anything I looked older because of patches of dryness. I stopped using this cream and my skin started healing. I started the use again and same issue. It was so uncomfortable that I gave up on the cream. I resorted to using Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief for my moisturizing needs and it works wonders. Just within a week my skin was back to normal. The shine is back, feels soft, and all that flakiness, blemish is gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to put too much on my face due to perfumes being added to product.  Usually just a skin pH balancer, sun screen and/or light moisturizer. I could not open jar due to packaging at Big Box Store to determine perfumed or not.  It came in a package with the micro-sculpting serum.  Neither container has the ingredients listed on them.  Dumb me to buy without reviewing - just compulsive buying on my part.  Wish I could wear it, and I am sure store would take back, even without the packaging.  Products give me a head ache 15 minutes after applying a very minimal amount.  Heavier perfume smell with cream vs serum, but both have perfume.  Usually it is the phenols in perfume that have an affect on me.  I like other Olay products, but this one will be trashed...or given away to whomever wants it.</li>
            <li> I am probably into my 6th or 7th bottle already (as at 04/2014)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite trying multiple brands, the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream has remained my favourite moisturiser. Used it every morning and night before going to bed, and by the time I was starting my 2nd bottle, I was getting compliments from friends and colleagues regarding how vibrant my face looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, according to Olay&#x27;s website, it is claimed that the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream moisturisers better than $200 luxury moisturisers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a fragrance free version - [[ASIN:B007M81B4M Olay Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Fragrance Free 1.7 Oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that being a cream, it is slightly oily as compared to gels. Nevertheless never had any breakouts on this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This now forms part of my daily face care routine&lt;br /&gt;Wash - [[ASIN:B00CYA5E1O Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System, 1-Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;Toner - [[ASIN:B00CHHJX0M Simple Soothing Facial Toner, 6.7 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;Serum - [[ASIN:B0081NLR0K Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum Fragrance Free 1.7 Fl Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;Moisturiser - [[ASIN:B0012J30LY Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, 1.7 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> As face creams go, this is a cut above anything else I have tried in the past, including some that have been several times the price of this one. After just three weeks of use, I can already feel the firming effects on my jaw line.</li>
            <li> Heavy and moisturizing cream that is good to use at night time.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend using this before make up, at least for me, it is too heavy to use under make up.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scent is way too strong.  But, it did improve my skin the next morning when used at night time.&lt;br /&gt;Good results for the price but I hope it was more midly scented..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and find it really works for me.  I like the convenience and cost savings when ordering on line.</li>
            <li> More hep and no results....not worth the money  lots of other products claiming the same for a lot less money</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cream, light, moisturizes, does not weigh down face. Have experienced very nice results using this face cream</li>
            <li> Better than most department store creams!  Plesant scent and feels fabulous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice cream. I probably will buy again it made my skin feel very soft and somewhat firmer. I gave one to a sister of mine.</li>
            <li> love the feel on my skin, but haven&#x27;t really used it long enoguh to see real results as far as reducing fine lines yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and it does everything it claims to do.  Would continue to order.</li>
            <li> This was recommended as one of the top ten skin products in 2009, and I started using it at that time. I found it was a good skin cream, but my more expensive face cream was much better. I am not a fan of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On recommendations of friends I tried the skin cream again, and within a week I found my skin breaking out at my chin line. I have not had issues with my skin since I was a teenager, some 50 odd years ago. I was aghast. I stopped using the cream, and my skin cleared within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must add that my daughter uses Olay Regenerist Cream, and she loves it. So, who knows what the problem is with my use. I per used other reviews just now, and found other women have had the same skin issues I have. My advice would be for every woman to try it for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Easy To Use&lt;br /&gt;Improves Skin Texture on most women&lt;br /&gt;Minimizes Wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable Results&lt;br /&gt;Soothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;For me and some other women, skin broke out using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended For Me. Recommended For My Daughter.  prisrob 01-18-14</li>
            <li> my skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily with most skincare products but not this one. did not give it five stars due to the way it feels on my skin. my face feels like i am wearing a mask.</li>
            <li> Cheaper to add it to your cart on Amazon than buying in the stores.  I love the silky texture of this cream and I put in on my neck and chest area daily for a smooth appearance.  I don&#x27;t think any cream is a miracle time reversal, but I really do prefer this one.  I like the whole line of Olay products.</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s newer product lines are great. Their stuff might be over the counter but they class of the packaging combined with the backed science of their innovative products is really impressive and would not surprise me if it was on par with medical grade stuff. This does everything is says it does and nothing that it doesn&#x27;t. Looks great in my cabinet. Makes me feel like a lady. It&#x27;s like the little black dress of my facial cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I use it after a shower and before bed. My skin feels soft and the fine lines that I had, have appeared to have gone away.</li>
            <li> I use this awesome moisturizer every day.  In winter my face (especially cheek area) is much drier so I need a heavier daytime moisturizer.  This makes my skin feel great, but isn&#x27;t oily.  Makeup goes on well over it.  Love the smell and texture.  Some days I can feel my skin say, &amp;#34;thanks&amp;#34;, after putting it on.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this product. My skin definitely feels softer. I am starting to break out so I&#x27;m wondering if I should just use it as a night cream and use something else under makeup.</li>
            <li> I am early thirties and have used this product for about a month.  I love it!  I can&#x27;t say how much it &#x27;tightens&#x27; my skin but it definitely moisturizes well and gives my face a healthy, youthful glow.  Just applying it, with its smooth texture and mild, clean scent, makes me feel rejuvenated.  Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Switched from aveeno to this bc of the good reviews and boy am I glad I did. After two weeks of using it my skin is glowing and it&#x27;s so soft and smooth. Deff a good product.</li>
            <li> I do like this product. However, I&#x27;m not seeing much of the advertised effects of it...I have to say it does make the face/neck feel and look much &#x27;softer&#x27;..of course I still have a good 3/4 of a jar left, so maybe time will make more of a difference..try it, is all I can say.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I got this. I&#x27;m not old enough to use micro sculpting creams, but just wanted some lift on my chin area. This didn&#x27;t help. Worse, the smell is so sickening taht I wanted to puke the whole day, and I got a headache from the smell. Lucky are those who can bear the over powering smell.</li>
            <li> This cream is a very good moisturizer. I put it on before night and wake up with a baby face!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Best purchase ever. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. I totally recommend this item.  HIGH QUALITY AND GOOD PRICE!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for the past 4 years. It worked for a long time, but lately it&#x27;s just not the same. I have to admit 35 is not that young anymore. I might need the next version of this cream for \\&quot;more mature\\&quot; skins. Olay is a wonderful brand. Love it.</li>
            <li> love it...works fast and makes my skin very smooth</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.  It&#x27;s nice but I was hoping to see results and I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement after using a whole jar.  I have moved on to try a new product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the whole regenerist line of products. I&#x27;m a firm believers that they work and my skin is better now than it was 10 years ago!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  Like it and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin which is dryer during the winter months.  This does not offer enough moisturizing for my needs.</li>
            <li> used this product for years. Excellent moisturizing for dry skin</li>
            <li> Always have this it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good wrinkle cream.  I have noticed a difference in just a couple of weeks.  I like that it is not expensive (which I have tried many expensive creams with not much difference). Just a little goes a long way.  I would recommend this product to a friend(s). Shipping and packaging great!</li>
            <li> This product works better than others costing 4 or 5 times higher.  Great bargain on Amazon!</li>
            <li> First of all my tub was made in Thailand not USA. After a few weeks I developed a swollen and irritated bottom lip. I stopped using the product and treated it with hydrocortisone and a non soap which cleared it up. I phoned Olay and they are sending a coupon to purchase another product. I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for years and have always been happy but this item is awful.</li>
            <li> Wonderful price on the daily deal&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The best! A wonderful item.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen any results but then I probably need more applications.</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist did not come in a box, a sticker was attached to the bottom of the jar. As the jar looked different from the usual Olay jar that I buy at the local drugstore, I read the label and found out the product was made in Thailand and distr. by Procter and Gamble...I was not advised that the product was made in Thailand. As it is to be a gift from me to another person, I still have not removed the white plastic security cover to find out if the product has the same fragrance and is the same cream I am accustomed to. What should I do? I cannot give it as a gift without a box, it does not appear to meet the standards of domestically purchased Olay products, returning it complicates my life at this time as I am going away on an extended vacation...maybe I should keep it for myself and use it as a body cream and never again order a discounted beauty product from Amazon?!!</li>
            <li> Gave this to my two daughters.  I should have kept for myself.  I have used Regenerist in the past and it made my skin blemish free and soft.  My daughters have beautiful skin and hope that the gift keeps their skin the ability to stay that way.</li>
            <li> I like the way this feels on my skin and I like the texture of it.  Olay has been around for years and although I don&#x27;t use all of their products, I do like this one.</li>
            <li> So far using for about a month, love the way it makes my face feel. I use proactive 3 step system, which could be slightly drying but works well for my acne, however this cream brings bak the moisture. My face feel smooth and soft. I was trying to decide between this and some other high end products (estee lauder, clinique), but so far this is working for me so I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li> What can you say about this product . I&#x27;m a guy and I love it . Keeps me looking years younger . because of the cost  this is not the stuff that you just put all over your body . Limit  it to those facial wrinkles and you&#x27;ll be fine . My  wife turned me on to this product when I kept wondering how she looked so good .</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of it. It&#x27;s very soft and velvety on my skin, I also like the scent it has nothing chemically. Although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s working after finishing the whole jar..</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful and proves to be as satisfactory as all Olay products that I frequently use.  Olay is such a great skin care company!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and it as good as anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  My daughter who just turned 26 asked me for a recommendation for moisturizer.  This was it.</li>
            <li> really gets rid of fine wrinkles you are asking for too many words for these reviews. Shorter is better. NO</li>
            <li> BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS AND  I LOVE IT. IT WORKS VERY WELL AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT. NEED I SAY MORE? RECOMMEND TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR AN ANTI AGE CREAM ;-)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. I was very happy to find that Amazon makes it so easy to purchase &amp; have it delivered to my home! It is a great product!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. Too heavy and sticky with a perfume like scent.  I tossed it. Was dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Being a person that wants to stay looking young, this is a great cream to use. The cream texture is soft and smooth, and it stays the same on you face. Not like other creams that you feel little bumps after applying. It helps in many ways that are unbelievable. In a short time it has helped me to have smooth and clear skin. The only issue I have with it is that after I apply it it leaves some residue that doesn&#x27;t work well with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that using this at night is the best solution, and using [[ASIN:B00I0N24TY this vitamin C serum]] in the morning before applying make-up is the best combo. Using both the Vitamin C before my make-up regimen, and Olay, I have started to see changes happen right away, just like the product says. People that know me have told me that my skin looks great, and ask me what have I done, or what I am using on my face. And I tell them that I am using Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone that wants to have smooth, clear skin and diminish wrinkle lines in your face. You will get what you pay for. And besides that you are not paying the high prices that come with other creams. But you are also using a cream that works for every part of your face. Not only that, but the cream doesn&#x27;t rub off onto your pillowcase, and cause stains which is a plus. As a woman having a smooth and clearer skin makes me extra happy, and Olay has helped me achieve that.</li>
            <li> Incredible product, good price, same at Walmart, but here you can use Amazon credit!!!!! I have been using this more than 4 years, and friend introduce me. I use it on my neck and chest, even with a turkey neck (like my mother in law used to said, she had) you can see a big improvement. Give it a try, you wont regret it!!!!</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference within 1 month! Nice feel, not greasy. Fine lines gone in 3-4 weeks. I Will reorder, definitely!</li>
            <li> For a guy in his early 40, this face cream works [update: this review is NOT for the Olay Miracle Boost] .......... well, kind of. I have been using Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Micro Sculpting creme for several years (off and on) and have always liked how WELL it hydrates my face [my main reason for using it] and that lovely soft dewy look it gives my skin. The product works well for about two weeks then starts to go south due to it being in a jar, rather than being in tube that is air sealed. It STILL works at hydrating but not so great at that dewy look due to air degrading the ingredients. A tube packaging it not at flashy chic looking but very sound at keeping the product fresh. However, I do like the blend of ingredients and how it feels on my skin without that greasy wet oily sticky feel of some other brands that charge &#x27;an arm and a leg&#x27; for a jar.</li>
            <li> Liked the results until I noticed I was experiencing horrific reactions to my lip and eyebrow waxings.  Somehow the wax or waxing did not go well with the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Creme.  I am keeping my waxings and eliminating the Creme.</li>
            <li> maybe it is just for women but I thought I would see if might help my wrinkles. I actually thought my face looked better after I stopped using it. Made my face all greasy and just nasty after a few weeks. Well, at least I know and can move on to next product.&lt;br /&gt;I did give it a 2 cause I have to be fair, might be made for women&#x27;s skin and works for them. Don&#x27;t think I actually ever read that it is for women and MEN.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels and the results is great.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very upset! I wanted to love this product... The first two days were wonderful and it made my skin look nice... Until today I felt extreme discomfort on my face! Bumps, redness, flakiness! I guess I&#x27;m allergic to this product. I am just sticking to Dr Weils Mushroom products :/  how can I post a pic of my face?</li>
            <li> I have to be honest... I don&#x27;t love this... I have been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I don&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin. It&#x27;s a heavy product and I feel a bit greasy for the first hour or so after putting in on. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> My face is very dry and flakey.  This cream kept my face soft and hydrated all day.  I did reapply around the mouth area at mid-day, but that was not really necessary.  I just did it because I wanted more hydration.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I noticed a difference in my forehead with the first application. My skin is noticeably smoother. You can&#x27;t beat the price and the smell is so delicious!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed with my Olay regenerist cream finding that it wasn&#x27;t making my skin feel as moist or glowy as it used nor softening lines as well when I came across the negative review.  I also bought it around 9 months ago.  I usually order 2 at a time.  But..She&#x27;s correct!  I looked at my jar and there&#x27;s a pasted label with a number on it. This isn&#x27;t the original Olay product!  Shame on you Amazon who I trust so much!  I used to love the cream so I&#x27;m going to buy it elsewhere making sure of the true label and ingredients like marine proteins!</li>
            <li> I would probably buy this product again...I can take it or leave it....But as far as stating that I was completely impressed, I was not..</li>
            <li> i saw this product in sth book about cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;They said this product can assist our face for great skin.&lt;br /&gt;i think it&#x27;s great.! i&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years and I love it.  I have tried other moisturizers and come right back to Olay Regenerist.  I would and do recommend this to my friends and family.  I even have my husband using it.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry, aging skin.you can see the difference soon.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I get compliments about my beautiful skin (I am 58 yrs old) and this is the only product I use on my face after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and feel, not sure I look any younger but I like the cream</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful.  It is not greasy, it smooths out lines and feels great on your face.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t that fond of the scent of this product. Outside of that I also didn&#x27;t think that it worked that well.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years and it is as advertised.  My skin in smoother and tighter as a result.</li>
            <li> I read up on a lot of customer reviews and did a little research. Out of all the rejuvenating creams on the market, this one had the most potential. I am in my mid-twenties, so wrinkles aren&#x27;t an issue (yet). I love how soft it makes my skin feel. I have a combination of oily and dry skin, and this cream does the job of perfectly moisturizing without a greasy feeling. Also, this cream has helped whenever I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, it appears to help prevent under-eye puffiness and fine lines that usually appear when one is exhausted.</li>
            <li> If you check my review of Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum, you will see that I truly believe that the combination of the two have helped to keep my sixty-four-year-old skin looking softer, less wrinkled and better than the skin of most women my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not conceited; I inherited my good skin from my mother.  I also have always hated to sit in the sun.  I do have sun damage but it&#x27;s mostly on the rest of my body because it came from my swimming; not my lying in the sun without sun protection.  My lovely face was protected because I used to swim underwater so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, I was a dubious purchaser of this Olay Regenerist line when it first came out and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it, all these years later.  Oh, and as an aside, I wish my mother, who was a strong proponent of using moisturizer, had told me to put it on the Back of my neck, not just the front.  If she had, I wouldn&#x27;t have to back out of rooms, as I do today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note:  I&#x27;m still looking for the absolutely perfect moisturizer, forgetting that I&#x27;m wearing it.  During a recent special, I ordered a moisturizer that cost $89 a bottle.  I had some samples and after using them for nine days, I decided not to open it when if arrived because I think my Regenerist works far better. Have I learned my lesson?  You bet I have!</li>
            <li> Brilliant cream..love it..</li>
            <li> I am 36- Used it until the jar was empty and did not notice any differences :(</li>
            <li> This product is hands down my favorite moisturizer out there and it is reasonably priced. I have combined it with both [[ASIN:B00JK5ZN76 Renuvaderm - The Most Complete Anti-Aging Skin Supplement!]] and [[ASIN:B00IT4POOG PhytoDerm - The Best 100% Pure Skin Restoring Anti-Aging Phytoceramides!]] as both have been featured on Dr. Oz as miracle supplements to help you look younger. The combination of these products has given me amazing results, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is another one of my favorite creams from Olay. It is not very thick or oily so it can be used for both day and night use. I am 67 and don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, but I can&#x27;t honestly say whether this is due to the use of Olay products for a number of years or heredity. I can say that I like most of the Olay products and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I always use this as part of my regimen, morning (before putting on my makeup) and night (after removing my makeup).  Will order more.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Have use it for years.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my Doctor believe it or not! I had my thyroid removed and was dreading an ugly scar across the front of my neck. I&#x27;m 54 but don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles or folds to hide my scar in yet! I was surprised to not hear the doctor say &amp;#34;Vitamin E&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Vitamin A&amp;#34; or something super expensive. Nope. Oil of Olay Regenerist Cream! I purchased it and slathered it on daily, two or three times, massaging it into my damaged skin. Six months later, no visible scar that anyone would notice, and when I point it out they ALL want to know what I put on my incision. SO, do I use it on my whole face and neck? For my skin that&#x27;s seen too much sun, has large pores and some wrinkles? Absolutely. Do I look like I&#x27;ve had a facelift? No. I look real. I look real good.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in 10 years!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product as it has a lot of good reviews and seems well loved. I have only been using it for several days now but I don&#x27;t have much hope for it..&lt;br /&gt;Does not wear well underneath makeup unless you are careful to only use a very small amount ive noticed. Probably going to reserve it for night time use from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Has a sticky feeling on the skin, at least until I get my makeup on over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have to mention the obvious perfumey fragrance it has. Pretty strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think ill just stick to my natural products from now as ive had better luck and they also feel better on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will give the Olay a month so it has a fair chance. I will fix my post if I change my mind.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I&#x27;ve been using it once per day for about 6 months (enough to have just run out of my first jar) and it&#x27;s true that within 2-3 weeks, I had noticeably tighter skin. I have sensitive skin, so was worried about break outs, but had no problems at all.  I&#x27;m just ordering my second jar!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted at a great price!</li>
            <li> I love this product. The lotion I received from this order was NOT the same as described. The smell of this face lotion is my favorite part and there was no smell and it was not the fragrance free. I double checked the order and the packaging. I got ripped off. Hope others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer...well priced and speedy delivery, Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I usually love Olay products, but I had to return this. Too heavy for my skin, and it had a stinging effect.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since 2009 and nothing could replace it. I still like it over some other brands I tried lately, but I started looking again because this cream seem to have a lot more silicon in it now. I usually use BB cream or foundation over it, now I could hardly get the cream absorbed enough even after 10 minutes. I really hope Olay would stick to the original formula! I&#x27;d give it a 5 star if there is not that much silicon.</li>
            <li> would not buy this product again, very disappointed,didn&#x27;t live up to what was expected of this product, what was advertised</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell how much I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for many years.  My skin looks nowhere near my actual age.  This is one of the nicer face creams that Olay offers.</li>
            <li> I order this cream to help my sagging skin, I have lost some weight and need a little pick me up here and there in the face area. I am aging gracefully but want my skin to look it&#x27;s best. I just received my package today, and put some of the product on, will let you know in a week or two how everything is working out with my skin. I am 70 years old and proud of growing to that age and many more, but sometimes we need just a little help. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month.  So far I have not seen any noticeable results.  However I have noticed that my face has more acne like blemishes in the areas I have applied the cream.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible moisturizing cream, leaving your skin feeling like velvet after its use, without being at all heavy. It says to use nights and mornings, and it really is worth using twice a day!</li>
            <li> non irritating , good base for makeup, I have dry skin and this keeps it comfortable all day</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Although it made my skin feel smooth after I use it I get the same result with other products. After using for a month straight I saw no change in the overal appearance of my skin. I used with regenerist anti aging cleanser and was hoping for better results.  I&#x27;m 32 years old. I won&#x27;t be buying more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love this product and all olay products! Not harsh on skinand no reactions from heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li> Good for my dry skin and keep the moisture in after putting my Hyaluronic acid. If you massage more, you can feel the skin is younger with shining. Also I don&#x27;t feel itchy or irritated for my allergic skin. The price is quite good comparing to other big brands.</li>
            <li> I have tried many creams over the years and keep going back to Olay.  But, I have not tried the Micro Sculpting cream until now.&lt;br /&gt;It is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;At 56, not only wrinkles but, sagging are big concerns.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the big deal creams from Lancome to Estee Lauder to others.  The results were always so-so and not really satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;I have these creepy lines between my mouth and cheeks and they are awful when seen in daylight.  Creams and makeup do not hide these and they are stubborn.  I hate them.&lt;br /&gt;Recently lines on the bridge of my nose and  around my eyes - even with using eye creams - are growing as well.&lt;br /&gt;And the sagging around the jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;Since using the Olay Micro Sculpting I have noticed real improvements in days.  Lines have softened and those creepy ones by my mouth are become less noticable.&lt;br /&gt;while I know I&#x27;ll never look like I did at 30. I just want to look better without alot of lines and sagging.&lt;br /&gt;This does it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is much smoother and brighter.  I love the way my skin is looking.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel self conscience now.  I don&#x27;t feel old.</li>
            <li> I used the Regenerist line for about 2 years. I used the serum and this cream nightly. I was delighted with the results, I definitely had fewer lines and purchased it at the warehouse club where it was a very good price. Recently, I developed a sensitivity to the product and had to stop using it. After I see a dermatologist, I&#x27;ll try to find something that works as well. I have never had any particular skin sensitivities before. I think this started after I got a rash following what I believe was a spider bite on my neck. I&#x27;m hoping I may be able to resume using the Microsculpting cream because it really worked. I&#x27;m a fair-skinned 51 year old Arizona native that spends a lot of time outdoors and I was always getting compliments on how great my skin looked. If you&#x27;re not prone to skin irritations, try it!</li>
            <li> Love it!! My Favorite Cream..Can not find it cheaper anywhere..Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Anyone who uses Olay products knows this is one of the best:)</li>
            <li> HAVE HAD THIS MANY TIMES AND REALLY LIKE IT, WILL BE ORDERING IT AGAIN.  YOU REQUIRE TOO MANY WORDS IN YOUR REVIEWS....</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My skin gets VERY dry in the winter months and this product keeps it looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li> Purchased multiple Olay products in the past and found them to be the best value and available when needed.</li>
            <li> I am 63 and believe Olay to be one of the best creams on the market.. smooth and creamy.. a rich alternative to the costly ones and does a better all-around job.. noticeable results pretty quickly on regular skin, non-oily, non-dry.. I use this one on my face regularly along with Olay Hydra-Firming cream on my neck. I did have one break-out pimple, not sure if the product caused it. I just discontinued using it til it went away.</li>
            <li> I tried many other face creams and I always go back to this product.  It works wonders, and is the best!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I don&#x27;t need any other product for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for 3 years.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.  It plumps up your skin and makes it feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> I am probably just sensitive to something in this cream but it makes me break out and my face red and irritated.  I will definitely not be buying it again...The moment I switch to a different cream like Origins, the problems subside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and it works as well as the high priced facial creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years  now. It keeps my skin moist from morning til night. Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the third jar of Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream I have purchased.  I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a moisturizing cream in the world that would make a person look younger but this one is on the top of my list.  I&#x27;ve tried the expensive ones and they were no better than this product.  I hightly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how it goes - I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks but Olay has always been a quality product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid there is no help for me.  This would probably help a younger woman.  It certainly does help your skin feel softer.  I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  feels like getting better smoothing and moisturizing skin, reducing sagging, giving more strength and vigor. I recommend it after seeing results.</li>
            <li> The one I received was scented and I am mad about that. I have not used it much because of that.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, and it is a good, all purpose moisturizer. It is unscented and a great moisturizer under foundation.</li>
            <li> Price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I think it&#x27;s the best reasonably priced moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I plan to continue to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time but wasn&#x27;t sure if it really worked. When I ran out awhile back I didn&#x27;t bother buying another jar. One morning I noticed that my chin area was saggy so I started to use this again. I&#x27;m still using it so I guess that about says it all.</li>
            <li> Good stuff at a good price, la la la la, the are making more use more letters in review, la la , now finished</li>
            <li> Big fan of this cream. Works for my skin. Makes it very smooth and alive after applying. for the price, hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a year.  I like it because it&#x27;s not greasy and it makes my skin feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;Does it help the wrinkles, I don&#x27;t know but I don&#x27;t really have any expectations that my wrinkles are going to&lt;br /&gt;go away.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have been using it for years.  It is not oily and is absorbed quickly into the skin.  Does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Great face lotion. Been using almost every day and notice a definite difference in being more soft, wrinkles stay the same (thus, 4 stars), complexion better, hydration better, don&#x27;t get in eyes as it stings, esp with contacts!!</li>
            <li> I appreciate the lower cost of this cream, which I like very much.  The added free 2 day shipping  with my Prime is great also.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I decided to try something new.  I just wanted to give Olay Regenerist a try.  You do feel like you are sculpting your face with this cream. I am 63 and at this age I know how important a moisturizer is.  I use it on my brow and jawline and around my eyelids and mouth.  I really like this cream, and I have tried more expensive creams which are not as good as this!  Give this a try, and see for yourself the creamy smooth results!</li>
            <li> Really good night cream.</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t ever buy this again. Makes more sense to buy something with a good retinol in it and I generally love Olay products but this one just doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pushing seventy and this is the best over-all cream that I have found for keeping my face looking as good as possible.  What I really notice is the smoothness and reduction of wrinkles, also it seems to lighten my face up giving me a healthy glow.  I use it daily both in the evenings and morning.  I do wish that it had a sun blocker so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use a separate cream but other than that, this is a miracle face cream.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, the BEST, most affordable moisturizer on the planet.  It works, no kidding.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of age, every woman (and man) needs this product for moisture, firming/lifting, and&lt;br /&gt;regeneration of skin cells.  When used daily (I use it at night) you can truly see the difference&lt;br /&gt;in as little as a month depending on your skin&#x27;s condition when you started.  I like to say to&lt;br /&gt;give a product 3 months of daily use (once a day-no exceptions) to see the best results.&lt;br /&gt;A little of this cream goes a long way but it won&#x27;t help your skin if it&#x27;s in a drawer and you&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t use it daily.  Good Housekeeping Institute, after extensive testing, rated this as the&lt;br /&gt;BEST moisturizer which surpassed some of the very high-end products which sell for as&lt;br /&gt;much as $450. for a 1-ounce jar.  Yes!  This cream comes in a lightly scented and an&lt;br /&gt;unscented version which my husband prefers.  Give this a try for 3-months and you&#x27;ll be hooked.&lt;br /&gt;Set it up on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save, one jar a month, and save money and you won&#x27;t run&lt;br /&gt;out of it.  I&#x27;d give this product 10-stars ********** if I could.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING THIS SINCE IT CAME IN THE MARKET.  BEEN USING THIS FOR A LONG, LONG - LOVE IT SO MUCH AND USE IT EVERY NIGHT AND MORNING!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a great product. I don&#x60;t  like the smell though. I will buy it again :).</li>
            <li> Perfect  thank you  A</li>
            <li> No change in fine lines</li>
            <li> Ended up throwing it away. It did firm up my skin, but made my face feel numb and tingling. Gave me horrific headaches due to the chemical makeup of this product. I tried it for a week and it took three days after stopping use to get rid of the headaches. I was very disappointed as I had used oil of olay moisturizer in the past with no issues. The result was not worth the pain for me.</li>
            <li> oh i didn’t see it was from tailand</li>
            <li> Great product that really does remove fine lines.</li>
            <li> Good coalition and price</li>
            <li> Love this. My skin has never felt better</li>
            <li> My favorite face moisturizer, Thank you so much :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and use it each morning, wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I have seborrhoeic dermatitis and need a prescription lotion to keep the patches of dry skin on my face in check; however, this creme does wonders. It smoothed my skin overnight, left it silky and soft. It was much better than I expected. I am 31, take good care of my skin and show almost no signs of aging, and will keep using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This cream is really the holy grail. I&#x27;ve used other anti-aging items from luxury department store brands and I have to say I&#x27;ve seen this cream the most helpful. I noticed my skin and lines were softer after 2-3 nights of continuous use. I wished I would have known about this sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is why is a pack of 2 more than 1? I definitely clicked my Amazon 1 click order to soon to realize. Also, I have been reading other reviews, ladies, my box said \\&quot;made in thailand, dist. by P &amp; G in OH....my results were still great. But I\\&quot;m definitely weary and will be going to my BBBeyond moving forward. Please let us know if made in Thailand/US made a diff for you!</li>
            <li> The product does what it say&#x27;s and will get rid of a double chin, as well as firm your entire face and it&#x27;s not oily as some other products are, and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts what so ever!  Like they say, it goes beyond what the expensive products does at a portion of the cost, thus the evidence will be apparent when you look in the mirror.  Give it a month if that.</li>
            <li> I am 37 and starting to get those fine laugh lines and \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot;.  I decided to give this a whirl.  While I like the unscented version better, the scented is still nice and not offensive; I have gotten creams in the past which are just too offensive and give me a headache.  My husband had commented on the earlier creams and for this one he hasn&#x27;t said a word! (Not to mention the earlier ones did not work though I cannot remember, for the life of me, what they were; obviously I was not impressed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scented version has a light, non-offensive odor.  The unscented version has no odor (imagine that).  Regardless, they both do reduce fine lines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using it for about a week (8 days maybe?) before I saw a difference.  My fine lines were finer and less noticable.  (Probably no one but I noticed them before I started using this but it made me feel better and that is the point, isn&#x27;t it?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, when I got them, the exfoliating face-wash was being sold with it for half off.  And that is also a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone with light crease lines and who wants to keep their skin rejuvenated! I also highly recommend that you use the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash, as aforementioned.  I will also review that!</li>
            <li> It is the best face cream on the market for me.  I&#x27;ve tried others and I have not found anything better.</li>
            <li> My mama likes it very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on and off for several years.  I always come back because, unlike many others, this is mild, gentle, smoothes in well, and really does help!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, works just as well for me as higher priced creams.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rated well also.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream since I turned 20 and it has worked a little for me but it doesn&#x27;t work as much as I thought it would be. The reason I say this is that my skin is sagging from using this product. I use to look much more younger and more vibrant before I started using this product. But out of frustration thinking it would get better it just got worse. I just finished my last cream bottle today and will be switching to another wrinkle cream. Sorry Olay if it doesn&#x27;t get better I may come back to you&lt;br /&gt;But probably not</li>
            <li> My mom wanted to try this so I gave it to her as a gift.  She loved it!  Priced much lower than in stores.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> I am always happy with Olay products.  I knew exactly what I was purchasing.  I know that most of my friends also use this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, I just shared with a friend and she loves it too!!</li>
            <li> Nice to get this without having to deal with the lines at Costco for a good value.  I love the way my skin feels when applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and I thought the cream was going be good for my face but it cause my face to break out . I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for younger people</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says it is good stuff. She now has ordered the product again.  I can see the difference.  ok</li>
