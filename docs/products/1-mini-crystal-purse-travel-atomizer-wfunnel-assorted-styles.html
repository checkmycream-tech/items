            <li>elegant looking too.</li>
            <li>I was immediately satisfied upon inspection.</li>
            <li>That is the only confining aspect that can be overlooked, but I like it because it makes the best fragrances seem even finer, it makes you cherish the fragrance more...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these for my nieces&#x27; Christmas stocking stuffers, and more for my coworkers.  </li>
            <li>Many people complain about the price, i am not one of those people, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I found out that the funnel works best if you lift it slightly above the atomizer bottle.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the scent</li>
            <li>Would recommend this item to anyone and will probably purchase more for myself as well as gifts for friends and family.</li>
            <li>; Works well, very happy with the purchase and overall transaction.</li>
            <li>I bought this atomizer because the pump on my favorite perfume broke.  </li>
            <li>They are rather stylish too.</li>
            <li>I was sure I was purchasing three - then it&#x27;s goof for the price.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leak and you can carry your favorite scent on vacation or in your purse.  </li>
            <li>I like using a spray so much better than a splash-on.  </li>
            <li>:-)&lt;br /&gt;Maybe with the funnel all you need it&#x27;s patience to pour into the bottle.</li>
            <li>I needed an atomizer which had a twist/screw off top.  </li>
            <li>It works and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I like it more than the metal ones.</li>
            <li>but I got it anyway because it was just too cute.</li>
            <li>Nice bottle &amp; the spray is perfect - works better than some other perfume bottles I have!</li>
            <li>the size is just right very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li>I was able to easily transfer that perfume into this bottle.</li>
            <li>They are just the right size too!!</li>
            <li>Now I use the fragance more often than when it was in its original container.</li>
            <li>It does not leak, and is easy to fill with the enclosed funnel.</li>
            <li>Come with two funnels that work fine as well.</li>
            <li>It is a fine mist so people are not overwhelmed by the Frebreze.</li>
            <li>These are the best little automizers i&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>Awesome little atomizer.</li>
            <li>I got two of these little atomizers and they are really great!</li>
            <li>so I ended up soaking my fingers with cologne when I filled the bottle.</li>
            <li>(6 filled it)  </li>
            <li>Cologne or perfumes will evaporate and I did not see any mention of this detail in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;Other available atomizers do cover this information.</li>
            <li>Being a smoker I like to lightly spray some Frebreze on my clothes before entering buildings.  </li>
            <li>The funnel is very useful.</li>
            <li>Bottles and  the funnel was very useful and it came in handy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This little travel atomizer is excellent for trips and for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li>I use these for all of my decants and recently purchased the crystal versions of this lines automizers for my own purse!</li>
            <li>However, given the super low cost and high functionality I remain very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast as my order arrived 4 days BEFORE the earliest estimated delivery date! :-)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size to carry in a wristlet or purse, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leak, sprays every time without issues, and</li>
            <li>it made her Christmas special since she had been checking stores for them and had not found them</li>
            <li>, the top does not screw on completely straight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine,  no leaks,  kinda pretty.  </li>
            <li>It looks very pretty though.</li>
            <li>These mini atomizers are easy to use and very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Cute, Sturdy, tight lid perfect for carrying a small amount of your favorite fragrance in your purse.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what they say they are!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking with the bottle full, the cologne should last a good month or longer depending on how much cologne you use.</li>
            <li>It really mists the liquid out, not just spitting out droplets like some cheap quality sprayers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I got this purse atomizer to use with a deluxe perfume sample I received with a recent purchase.</li>
            <li>The funnel definitely came in handy when I transferred bottles.</li>
            <li>I have carried this in my purse filled with my favorite perfume for several weeks now.</li>
            <li>The atomizer arrived in its expected time, it looks good and it works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The atomizer works well to dispense just the right amount of perfume.</li>
            <li>The spray is just right.</li>
            <li>This little thing is nice, but when I purchased it, nowhere on a site it didn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s just one funnel, NOT three!</li>
            <li>This is so great, especially the tiny funnel.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the inclusion of the miniature funnel as it made filling super</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, the bottles are cute but the only way to use them would be to keep them standing up right at all times.</li>
            <li>I was able to pull the perfume from my old bottle and put it right into the new atomizer with \\&quot;NO SPILLS\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>first glance</li>
            <li>This is such a cute atomizer.</li>
            <li>Cheap the silver part that is connected to the glass was not air tight neither was the top.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I filled it halfway and closed it securely.</li>
            <li>I quickly gave up on trying to use the cute little funnels that came with the atomizers.  </li>
            <li>The top has never come loose and nothing has ever leaked from the atomizer.      </li>
            <li>Nice little refillable perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>well--Cheesey--the whole thing--Cheesey.</li>
            <li>Sprays very well without clogging up.</li>
            <li>I am able to empty my cologne bottles into these and carry them with me anywhere.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very attractice tube, much better than the other options I&#x27;ve seen (that dont come with Prime shipping either)</li>
            <li>It is nice to have when traveling, but as a container to use around the home it is too small.</li>
            <li>Those with a white or clear gasket were better, but still considerably changed the scent.  </li>
            <li>Filling it (from a spray bottle was a snap) and it is small enough to carry in my purse but large enough to carry a good supply of perfume if I am traveling for a week or so!</li>
            <li>I was able to fill the bottle in less than a minute.</li>
            <li>it is a bit askew, and when I first put my perfume in it the scent changed a bit however this quickly faded.</li>
            <li>This is a nice smart looking little bottle, it actually has some weight to it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re hard to find in stores, so it&#x27;s nice that Amazon continues to stock them.</li>
            <li>A nice product to have when you need a little bit in another location, such as your car or RV.</li>
            <li>As usual with Amazon orders, fast and easy.</li>
            <li>product does everything it is supposed to, and I would recommend this if you have a small amount of expensive/fine fragrance that you want to savor and get the most out of, or any fragrance for that matter!&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>The bottle closes tightly, and the spray is a fine mist.</li>
            <li>The ad looked like you would get 4-5 atomizer bottles but only one was sent with a very hefty shipping fee for just one light little bottle.  </li>
            <li>Not only does the tube reach the very bottom of this inexpensive</li>
            <li>I just pour the perfume directly into the atomizer from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>even came with a cool little metal funnel.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty set of atomizers but not very useful for my essential oils because they are clear and not brown.  </li>
            <li>So I ditched the empty bottle and filled the second, same result</li>
            <li>This atomizer is exactly what I needed for a short or long trip.  </li>
            <li>My only critique is that I wish that the spray nozzle provided a finer mist rather than the very concentrated sprays I&#x27;ve been getting and the stream is crooked.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s useless, I have a stainless one that is much better.</li>
            <li>The containers don&#x27;t leak, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the nozzles clogging, and the bottles are small enough that you can easily pack them and not worry about space.</li>
            <li>The bottle is cute tough.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because the cologne bottle that I had was dropped and the push top was broken.  </li>
            <li>, the opening is big enough that you can spray your product directly into the bottle</li>
            <li>I does exactly what my husband wanted it to to which is to apply after shave without waste.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the glass being too thin and breaking easily.  </li>
            <li>When I aimed the nozzle on my wrist to spray for the first time it sprayed slightly left missing almost my entire wrist.   </li>
            <li>(My Current perfume has a weird nozzle so this was important to me).&lt;br /&gt;-I used this on a recent trip to New Orleans</li>

            <li> That is the only confining aspect that can be overlooked, but I like it because it makes the best fragrances seem even finer, it makes you cherish the fragrance more...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these for my nieces&#x27; Christmas stocking stuffers, and more for my coworkers.  </li>
            <li> Many people complain about the price, i am not one of those people, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I found out that the funnel works best if you lift it slightly above the atomizer bottle.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the scent</li>
            <li> Would recommend this item to anyone and will probably purchase more for myself as well as gifts for friends and family.</li>
            <li> ; Works well, very happy with the purchase and overall transaction.</li>
            <li> I bought this atomizer because the pump on my favorite perfume broke.  </li>
            <li> They are rather stylish too.</li>
            <li> I was sure I was purchasing three - then it&#x27;s goof for the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leak and you can carry your favorite scent on vacation or in your purse.  </li>
            <li> I like using a spray so much better than a splash-on.  </li>
            <li> :-)&lt;br /&gt;Maybe with the funnel all you need it&#x27;s patience to pour into the bottle.</li>
            <li> I needed an atomizer which had a twist/screw off top.  </li>
            <li> It works and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I like it more than the metal ones.</li>
            <li> but I got it anyway because it was just too cute.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle &amp; the spray is perfect - works better than some other perfume bottles I have!</li>
            <li> the size is just right very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> I was able to easily transfer that perfume into this bottle.</li>
            <li> They are just the right size too!!</li>
            <li> Now I use the fragance more often than when it was in its original container.</li>
            <li> It does not leak, and is easy to fill with the enclosed funnel.</li>
            <li> Come with two funnels that work fine as well.</li>
            <li> It is a fine mist so people are not overwhelmed by the Frebreze.</li>
            <li> These are the best little automizers i&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> Awesome little atomizer.</li>
            <li> I got two of these little atomizers and they are really great!</li>
            <li> so I ended up soaking my fingers with cologne when I filled the bottle.</li>
            <li> (6 filled it)  </li>
            <li> Cologne or perfumes will evaporate and I did not see any mention of this detail in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;Other available atomizers do cover this information.</li>
            <li> Being a smoker I like to lightly spray some Frebreze on my clothes before entering buildings.  </li>
            <li> The funnel is very useful.</li>
            <li> Bottles and  the funnel was very useful and it came in handy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This little travel atomizer is excellent for trips and for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li> I use these for all of my decants and recently purchased the crystal versions of this lines automizers for my own purse!</li>
            <li> However, given the super low cost and high functionality I remain very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast as my order arrived 4 days BEFORE the earliest estimated delivery date! :-)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size to carry in a wristlet or purse, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leak, sprays every time without issues, and</li>
            <li> it made her Christmas special since she had been checking stores for them and had not found them</li>
            <li> , the top does not screw on completely straight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine,  no leaks,  kinda pretty.  </li>
            <li> It looks very pretty though.</li>
            <li> These mini atomizers are easy to use and very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Cute, Sturdy, tight lid perfect for carrying a small amount of your favorite fragrance in your purse.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what they say they are!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking with the bottle full, the cologne should last a good month or longer depending on how much cologne you use.</li>
            <li> It really mists the liquid out, not just spitting out droplets like some cheap quality sprayers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I got this purse atomizer to use with a deluxe perfume sample I received with a recent purchase.</li>
            <li> The funnel definitely came in handy when I transferred bottles.</li>
            <li> I have carried this in my purse filled with my favorite perfume for several weeks now.</li>
            <li> The atomizer arrived in its expected time, it looks good and it works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The atomizer works well to dispense just the right amount of perfume.</li>
            <li> The spray is just right.</li>
            <li> This little thing is nice, but when I purchased it, nowhere on a site it didn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s just one funnel, NOT three!</li>
            <li> This is so great, especially the tiny funnel.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the inclusion of the miniature funnel as it made filling super</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, the bottles are cute but the only way to use them would be to keep them standing up right at all times.</li>
            <li> I was able to pull the perfume from my old bottle and put it right into the new atomizer with \\&quot;NO SPILLS\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> first glance</li>
            <li> This is such a cute atomizer.</li>
            <li> Cheap the silver part that is connected to the glass was not air tight neither was the top.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I filled it halfway and closed it securely.</li>
            <li> I quickly gave up on trying to use the cute little funnels that came with the atomizers.  </li>
            <li> The top has never come loose and nothing has ever leaked from the atomizer.      </li>
            <li> Nice little refillable perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> well--Cheesey--the whole thing--Cheesey.</li>
            <li> Sprays very well without clogging up.</li>
            <li> I am able to empty my cologne bottles into these and carry them with me anywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very attractice tube, much better than the other options I&#x27;ve seen (that dont come with Prime shipping either)</li>
            <li> It is nice to have when traveling, but as a container to use around the home it is too small.</li>
            <li> Those with a white or clear gasket were better, but still considerably changed the scent.  </li>
            <li> Filling it (from a spray bottle was a snap) and it is small enough to carry in my purse but large enough to carry a good supply of perfume if I am traveling for a week or so!</li>
            <li> I was able to fill the bottle in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> it is a bit askew, and when I first put my perfume in it the scent changed a bit however this quickly faded.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smart looking little bottle, it actually has some weight to it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re hard to find in stores, so it&#x27;s nice that Amazon continues to stock them.</li>
            <li> A nice product to have when you need a little bit in another location, such as your car or RV.</li>
            <li> As usual with Amazon orders, fast and easy.</li>
            <li> product does everything it is supposed to, and I would recommend this if you have a small amount of expensive/fine fragrance that you want to savor and get the most out of, or any fragrance for that matter!&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> The bottle closes tightly, and the spray is a fine mist.</li>
            <li> The ad looked like you would get 4-5 atomizer bottles but only one was sent with a very hefty shipping fee for just one light little bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not only does the tube reach the very bottom of this inexpensive</li>
            <li> I just pour the perfume directly into the atomizer from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> even came with a cool little metal funnel.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty set of atomizers but not very useful for my essential oils because they are clear and not brown.  </li>
            <li> So I ditched the empty bottle and filled the second, same result</li>
            <li> This atomizer is exactly what I needed for a short or long trip.  </li>
            <li> My only critique is that I wish that the spray nozzle provided a finer mist rather than the very concentrated sprays I&#x27;ve been getting and the stream is crooked.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useless, I have a stainless one that is much better.</li>
            <li> The containers don&#x27;t leak, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the nozzles clogging, and the bottles are small enough that you can easily pack them and not worry about space.</li>
            <li> The bottle is cute tough.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because the cologne bottle that I had was dropped and the push top was broken.  </li>
            <li> , the opening is big enough that you can spray your product directly into the bottle</li>
            <li> I does exactly what my husband wanted it to to which is to apply after shave without waste.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the glass being too thin and breaking easily.  </li>
            <li> When I aimed the nozzle on my wrist to spray for the first time it sprayed slightly left missing almost my entire wrist.   </li>
            <li> (My Current perfume has a weird nozzle so this was important to me).&lt;br /&gt;-I used this on a recent trip to New Orleans</li>
            <li> but I would still recommend using a toothpick or small narrow stick to guide fluid into the funnel to avoid spilling from pouring too fast and to keep what you&#x27;re pouring from spilling down the side of the original bottle you&#x27;re transferring from.  </li>
            <li> Although askew the top screws on tightly and does not leak the product(at least not for me...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that the essential oils should be stored and used in a brown colored glass and not clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My only minor complaint would be that the lid, which contains the atomizer, doesn&#x27;t screw on perfectly straight - so it appears slightly crooked.</li>
            <li> I ended up going to a \\&quot;&#x27;feed\\&quot; store and buying a syringe with a long needle.  </li>
            <li> if you bought it you got what you expected.</li>
            <li> It held up and did not leak at all as some other customers have posted.  </li>
            <li> This is not too small or too big.  </li>
            <li> There is no discernible evaporation (though of course there is some, just not a noticeable amount mentioned in other reviews), it doesn&#x27;t leak, and the atomizer disperses well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small enough that it isn&#x27;t a bother.</li>
            <li> When I arrived at the conference half of the product came out.  </li>
            <li> The cap grasps on tightly too.  </li>
            <li> First ill give the cons: the bottle feels like a really hard plastic instead of glass ( doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the opening of the funnel is too small</li>
            <li> I bought 7 little sample vials on ebay of a perfume I didn&#x27;t want to drop $100 on,  poured them all in here</li>
            <li> It comes with a little funnel, which is convenient.  </li>
            <li> I have 2 of these little things</li>
            <li> This little atomizer works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> This product is terrible , very quick evaportes, the perfume also leaked and messed up my purse, what a big disappointment, will not recommend and really regret buying it</li>
            <li> Stop working within few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Also like the other reviews say that funnel is not really effective for transferring perfume to the atomizer.  </li>
            <li> in mind that it is small.</li>
            <li> They are just too small to be practical.  </li>
            <li> In case I ended up spilling, I did check to see if a small kitchen funnel would work.</li>
            <li> and I have a tendency of keeping my bottles upright even on my purse, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever have the drama of having perfume leak all over.</li>
            <li> The funnels are VERY narrow</li>
            <li> Did not have choice of style, received least desirable.</li>
            <li> It does come with a very small funnel however i did not use it(don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Not good quality.  </li>
            <li> So it is NOT good for traveling eventhough</li>
            <li> What a waste of expensive perfume.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they&#x27;re unusable because they leak.</li>
            <li> The one you get will be random.</li>
            <li> The funnel that is mentioned is so small that it is worthless.  </li>
            <li> The bottle with a black gasket was the worst - the perfume smelled like rubber.  </li>
            <li> but I was too afraid to carry it with me out of fear of it exploding in my purse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this leaks and I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to choose perfumes for others -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a worthless product once that happens.</li>
            <li> Bad idea!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Spray is terrible and plastic funnel--</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect size just fill and use.</li>
            <li> Stop working within few weeks.  Not good quality.  It leaks and the pump stopped working.  The bottle is cute tough.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for money. A remarkable elegant looking, glass bottle atomizer for dispensing perfume/cologne for women or men. Portable on person, in car or for home use. Works great, funnel supplied is a great addition for easily topping up when needed. Buy now and be satisfied.</li>
            <li> excellent sprayer, cheap shipping and fast. even came with a cool little metal funnel. would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This bottle is perfect for traveling and a great product. Excellent value for the money and elegant looking too. I&#x27;m thinking with the bottle full, the cologne should last a good month or longer depending on how much cologne you use. My only complaint is the opening of the funnel is too small so I ended up soaking my fingers with cologne when I filled the bottle. Could be the sprayer on my larger bottle of cologne sprays a wider spray. I definately would purchase again. Please note that when I purchased my atomizer the seller was Cosmetic Solutions.</li>
            <li> The ad looked like you would get 4-5 atomizer bottles but only one was sent with a very hefty shipping fee for just one light little bottle.  It looks very pretty though.</li>
            <li> The bottle was smaller than what I thought it was going to be from the picture.  I bought this item because the cologne bottle that I had was dropped and the push top was broken.  I needed a container to put the cologne in for continued use.  The funnel that is mentioned is so small that it is worthless.  I fill the bottle with an eyedropper.  It is nice to have when traveling, but as a container to use around the home it is too small.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smart looking little bottle, it actually has some weight to it. I was concerned about the glass being too thin and breaking easily.  Great size for a purse. The funnel that comes with it is a joke !!!   I ended up going to a \\&quot;&#x27;feed\\&quot; store and buying a syringe with a long needle.  I was able to pull the perfume from my old bottle and put it right into the new atomizer with \\&quot;NO SPILLS\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Arrived in 2 days and well packaged. I does exactly what my husband wanted it to to which is to apply after shave without waste.</li>
            <li> Great size, perfect for any &amp;#34;to go&amp;#34; perfumes!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Its sturdy, well built, doesnt leak, and sprays a very fine mist.  The cap grasps on tightly too.  All in all, its a great purchase at a great price.</li>
            <li> This product has been a great buy! I was immediately satisfied upon inspection. Not only does the tube reach the very bottom of this inexpensive (but you could never tell from just looking) bottle, but the mist produced is very fine, indicating a good quality atomizer. It really mists the liquid out, not just spitting out droplets like some cheap quality sprayers.&lt;br /&gt;This product does everything it is supposed to, and I would recommend this if you have a small amount of expensive/fine fragrance that you want to savor and get the most out of, or any fragrance for that matter!&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that it is small. That is the only confining aspect that can be overlooked, but I like it because it makes the best fragrances seem even finer, it makes you cherish the fragrance more...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these for my nieces&#x27; Christmas stocking stuffers, and more for my coworkers.  Where else can you get a coworker gift for $3.40?!!  It&#x27;s impossible to choose perfumes for others - we all have our favorites.  This gift takes the guess work out of it!</li>
            <li> This atomizer is exactly what I needed for a short or long trip.  Perfect for my perfumes. fits nicely in my purse or luggage.</li>
            <li> I bought these to pour the contents of the mini cologne bottles I bought in a sample case. They work great. I wish you could choose the patterns on the bottles. Not too fancy. Effective.</li>
            <li> Received my order in great shape and quickly. They are perfect, and exactly what I wanted. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this leaks and I am really disappointed. The first time I used it, I filled it halfway and closed it securely. It leaked all over the purse.</li>
            <li> These are the best little automizers i&#x27;ve ever found. Many people complain about the price, i am not one of those people, you get what you pay for. I use these for all of my decants and recently purchased the crystal versions of this lines automizers for my own purse! I love that it comes with a funnel, very easy to use, do not leak/sturdy product with a nice, even spray.</li>
            <li> The atomizer works well to dispense just the right amount of perfume. It comes with a funnel to transfer the perfume. I found out that the funnel works best if you lift it slightly above the atomizer bottle. I was able to fill the bottle in less than a minute.

            <li> Cute, Sturdy, tight lid perfect for carrying a small amount of your favorite fragrance in your purse. Comes with funnel.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this product. I ordered a pair of these, and they work great, spray well, and do not leak. Come with two funnels that work fine as well. As usual with Amazon orders, fast and easy.</li>
            <li> These bottles are very nice looking, durable, and practical. I use them for traveling. The funnel is very useful. Great product!</li>
            <li> This perfume bottle is PERFECT!!! Just what I was looking for. I had a small bottle of perfume that I wanted the convience of a spray bottle and this item is exactly what I hoped for.  A couple reviews that I read before purchasing it said the funnel wasn&#x27;t good but I disagree. I found the bottle very easy to fill with the included funnel. Would recommend this item to anyone and will probably purchase more for myself as well as gifts for friends and family.</li>
            <li> A nice product to have when you need a little bit in another location, such as your car or RV.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister in law to use for hand sanitizer. She is always in meetings and needs something to use for hand sanitizer that is not so obvious. Works well for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these bottles to specifically use while traveling.  I packed it in my cosmetics bag and then stuffed the cosmetics bag into my luggage.  This bottle went from being tossed around at the Port of Orlando to being jumbled around onboard the ship.  It held up and did not leak at all as some other customers have posted.  This is great to use when you don&#x27;t want to take a full-size bottle of perfume with you.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good thing to have for travelling since i was going out of the country but it spilled everywhere. Cheap the silver part that is connected to the glass was not air tight neither was the top. get what u pay for bought another similar one wonder if i got a defective one or they are all like that I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> Awesome little atomizer. Perfect for my purse or briefcase (or for travel!); Works well, very happy with the purchase and overall transaction.</li>
            <li> This is great for anyone who makes their own perfumes.  It&#x27;s also excellent for taking your favorite scents with out when you travel.  The containers don&#x27;t leak, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the nozzles clogging, and the bottles are small enough that you can easily pack them and not worry about space.</li>
            <li> I bought this atomizer because the pump on my favorite perfume broke.  This atomizer works well for what I bought it for as it sprays my perfume well.  However since it is called a travel atomizer I decided to take it with me for a conference for work.  When I arrived at the conference half of the product came out.  So it is NOT good for traveling eventhough that is how it is marketed.  Also like the other reviews say that funnel is not really effective for transferring perfume to the atomizer.  This atomizer has resulted in me wasting a lot of product.  Since it still serves the purpose I bought it for which was just to have something to spray my perfume with I still give it 3 stars.  I will just have to figure out another way to transfer the product and unfortunately I wll not be able to carry the perfume with me on trips.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible , very quick evaportes, the perfume also leaked and messed up my purse, what a big disappointment, will not recommend and really regret buying it</li>
            <li> I bought these so I could keep my favorite perfume in my purse and these were nice looking. Unfortunately they&#x27;re unusable because they leak.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty set of atomizers but not very useful for my essential oils because they are clear and not brown.  I didn&#x27;t realize that the essential oils should be stored and used in a brown colored glass and not clear.</li>
            <li> This is not too small or too big.  It&#x27;s just the right size to carry in a wristlet or purse, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leak, sprays every time without issues, and the lid stays on good.  Nice little refillable perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> These mini atomizers are easy to use and very convenient.  The funnel makes refilling very easy.  The bottles fit great in every bag I have put them in.  They are rather stylish too. Thank you.</li>
            <li> After a day or so in these bottles, my perfume smelled different.  I think it was because of the type of rubber used for the leaf-proof gasket.  The bottle with a black gasket was the worst - the perfume smelled like rubber.  Those with a white or clear gasket were better, but still considerably changed the scent.  Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> if you bought it you got what you expected. It looks nice,first glance i thought it was plastic...its glass.</li>
            <li> Great travel size perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> Beautiful thank you!  Prompt Delivery!  Well Packed!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This is so great, especially the tiny funnel. It&#x27;s a very attractice tube, much better than the other options I&#x27;ve seen (that dont come with Prime shipping either)</li>
            <li> I bought two Kingsley Mini Crystal Purse Atomizer a couple of years ago.  They get used daily and continue to function without any problems.  I carry one in my purse.  The top has never come loose and nothing has ever leaked from the atomizer.      I quickly gave up on trying to use the cute little funnels that came with the atomizers.  They are just too small to be practical.  I just pour the perfume directly into the atomizer from the bottle.  In case I ended up spilling, I did check to see if a small kitchen funnel would work. It does.  However, since I&#x27;ve not been spilling when filling the atomizer, I haven&#x27;t bothered using it.    These are an excellent item at a great price.  They&#x27;re hard to find in stores, so it&#x27;s nice that Amazon continues to stock them.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an atomizer just like this for ever.  It is the perfect size.  Filling it (from a spray bottle was a snap) and it is small enough to carry in my purse but large enough to carry a good supply of perfume if I am traveling for a week or so!</li>
            <li> the size is just right very pleased with this purchase i will keep it in my purse every day thanks</li>
            <li> Very elegant way to carry fragrance. Sturdy glass; forget the funnel it&#x27;s useless, I have a stainless one that is much better. No worries.</li>
            <li> This little thing is nice, but when I purchased it, nowhere on a site it didn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s just one funnel, NOT three! I was sure I was purchasing three - then it&#x27;s goof for the price. But one? No. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for purse or home.  Shipping was super fast as my order arrived 4 days BEFORE the earliest estimated delivery date! :-)  Funnels are nice addition but I would still recommend using a toothpick or small narrow stick to guide fluid into the funnel to avoid spilling from pouring too fast and to keep what you&#x27;re pouring from spilling down the side of the original bottle you&#x27;re transferring from.  The funnels are VERY narrow so it takes some time but if you use the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; method it goes a lot faster.  The bottle are too cute and work great.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This is great for traveling with my favorite perfume in a size acceptable for airport security.  I always keep any liquid containers inside sealed plastic bags, but I have never noticed any spillage, the cap stays on quite well.  The spray is just right.</li>
            <li> Did not have choice of style, received least desirable. Misleading advertisement picture. Spray is terrible and plastic funnel--well--Cheesey--the whole thing--Cheesey.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume bottle. Even comes with a funnel. The one you get will be random. Well made for the very low price. Great buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine,  no leaks,  kinda pretty.  I bought 7 little sample vials on ebay of a perfume I didn&#x27;t want to drop $100 on,  poured them all in here (6 filled it)  and now I have my $100 perfume for a fraction of the cost.  Nice!</li>
            <li> Looks like a high-end perfume vile. It&#x27;s light weight, which is perfect for travel. It does not leak, and is easy to fill with the enclosed funnel.</li>
            <li> Great! Doesn&#x27;t leak and you can carry your favorite scent on vacation or in your purse.  Sprays very well without clogging up.</li>
            <li> Cologne or perfumes will evaporate and I did not see any mention of this detail in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;Other available atomizers do cover this information.</li>
            <li> I have carried this in my purse filled with my favorite perfume for several weeks now. There is no discernible evaporation (though of course there is some, just not a noticeable amount mentioned in other reviews), it doesn&#x27;t leak, and the atomizer disperses well. I appreciated the inclusion of the miniature funnel as it made filling super easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor complaint would be that the lid, which contains the atomizer, doesn&#x27;t screw on perfectly straight - so it appears slightly crooked. However, given the super low cost and high functionality I remain very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like using a spray so much better than a splash-on.  I am able to empty my cologne bottles into these and carry them with me anywhere.</li>
            <li> I like this atomizer.  It comes with a little funnel, which is convenient.  I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use the bottle, but I plan on it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for purse works well</li>
            <li> I ordered this atomizer after purchasing a refill bottle of Angel perfume from Amazon.  I didn&#x27;t realize the perfume didn&#x27;t come with a sprayer.  This is a perfect size to take your favorite perfume with you in your purse.  Seals well no problem with perfume leaking.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was nicer than I thought it would be. I also like that it came with a tiny funnel-which you will need to pour your fragrance. The bottle closes tightly, and the spray is a fine mist. If you use a body oil, you will have to dilute the oil with a bit of water for the sprayer to work well.</li>
            <li> Bottles and  the funnel was very useful and it came in handy.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t notice any leakage on the bottles and I check for the robber area where liquid would come out (the plastic around the neck of the bottle) and it is intact.&lt;br /&gt;I did order 6 bottles and I have a tendency of keeping my bottles upright even on my purse, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever have the drama of having perfume leak all over. :-)&lt;br /&gt;Maybe with the funnel all you need it&#x27;s patience to pour into the bottle.</li>
            <li> These are great to travel with your favorite fragrance, or to try out samples. Good seal, nice sprayer that gets to the bottom of the glass.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what they say they are! Great quality, shipped promptly and perfect for making your own fragrance from essential oils.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these for their stated purpose, to travel. Bad idea! Within one day almost the entire bottle had leaked in my bag. So I ditched the empty bottle and filled the second, same result and it continued with the third. What a waste of expensive perfume. It&#x27;s a shame, the bottles are cute but the only way to use them would be to keep them standing up right at all times. Definitely NOT for travel!</li>
            <li> I got two of these little atomizers and they are really great! I use them to put fragrance samples in that don&#x27;t already have a sprayer on it. They are the perfect size to store in your purse and they are super cute too!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.  The atomizer arrived in its expected time, it looks good and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;Surely my sister will like it too.</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these little things and I have to say I absolutely love them!!! I collect perfume samples as put them in them and they are perfect for that!! They are just the right size too!!</li>
            <li> This is just perfect to tuck into your handbag!  Love it!  Your perfume is always at your fingertips tucked away in your bag!</li>
            <li> I purchased this atomizer because the balloon pump on my vs perfume bottle broke.  I needed an atomizer which had a twist/screw off top.  This one was perfect and a great price, it even came with a teeny tiny funnel.  It works and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Just got it today.  Works GREAT! Holds just enough for a vacation or to take along in your purse. Nice bottle &amp; the spray is perfect - works better than some other perfume bottles I have!</li>
            <li> I loved this atomizer for about two months until it started leaking. It&#x27;s a worthless product once that happens. Perhaps I got a defective one.</li>
            <li> Shows 3 bottles, and a funnel. Ordered two of these. Received one bottle/funnel with each order! Deceptive, deceitful ad. A ripoff.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of perfume in a non-spray bottle. I was able to easily transfer that perfume into this bottle. It works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is such a cute atomizer. I like it more than the metal ones. It holds a good amount of perfume and doesn&#x27;t leak or drip in my purse.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i was needing, looks great and very easy to fill!!! Would recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li> This little atomizer works as advertised.  I use Frebreze in it.  Being a smoker I like to lightly spray some Frebreze on my clothes before entering buildings.  It is a fine mist so people are not overwhelmed by the Frebreze.</li>
            <li> Carol was thrilled with them it made her Christmas special since she had been checking stores for them and had not found them</li>
            <li> This little travel atomizer is excellent for trips and for quick touch-ups. The reviews I read were a bit mixed but I got it anyway because it was just too cute. First ill give the cons: the bottle feels like a really hard plastic instead of glass ( doesn&#x27;t bother me but it probably bugs some people), the top does not screw on completely straight it is a bit askew, and when I first put my perfume in it the scent changed a bit however this quickly faded. The Pros: Although askew the top screws on tightly and does not leak the product(at least not for me...some of the reviews I read said leakage was a problem), sprays as a mist, very stylish, the opening is big enough that you can spray your product directly into the bottle (My Current perfume has a weird nozzle so this was important to me).&lt;br /&gt;-I used this on a recent trip to New Orleans and it didn&#x27;t leak once i also use it when i go out and it&#x27;s small enough that it isn&#x27;t a bother. It does come with a very small funnel however i did not use it(don&#x27;t even no where it is).</li>
