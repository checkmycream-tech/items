            <li>I can tell you that I am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Has anyone experienced this?  </li>
            <li>It has been five days and nails still look good.  </li>
            <li>This is great nail polish, better than the gel process, dries in 8 minutes and immediately in sunlight.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these polishes!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I totally love this product !  </li>
            <li>You will love it !</li>
            <li>Gel polish has been the only thing that has worked for me, and honestly Shellac was not the brand that worked best.  </li>
            <li>I have to stay that the color went on very smooth</li>
            <li>however, i think it&#x27;s very important to note,</li>
            <li>Came off easily and had a nice sheen to it.</li>
            <li>thought I would give this a try since there were so many people it had worked for and</li>
            <li>While I love this product.....</li>
            <li>In my opinion it&#x27;s better than shellac.</li>
            <li>that I do most of the housework wearing gloves and put a lot of cream on my hands at night.</li>
            <li>bought top coat and polish.</li>
            <li>and I will but more colors.</li>
            <li>love the colors and it wears so well.  </li>
            <li>If you need to touch up just put on another coat of the top coat</li>
            <li>Easy to do and nice colors, rich colors.</li>
            <li>The top coat went on just as easily and the finish looks salon quality.  </li>
            <li>And they are true to their word, no chipping!  </li>
            <li>Easy removal with reg nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>was so excited about this product coming out...</li>
            <li>, I cook, I clean, I do laundry...</li>
            <li>and since then I&#x27;ve been using full size bottles at the salon</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>Super Quality.</li>
            <li>The Vinylux came very highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I guess it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>and it was suggested to get the Scrub Fresh which I did.  </li>
            <li>The color matches the shellac nicely and IF you cap it PROPERLY it works!</li>
            <li>Dries very fast and durable.</li>
            <li>I ordered this kit because I was trying Vinylux nail polish for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly the way I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li>so I am thinking that whether or not this polish has staying power is most likely going to depend on your body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re decision to purchase or not has to be on how willing you are to risk that you are wasting your money.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used this polish though, so I don&#x27;t know if it will stain my nails or not....</li>
            <li>Slightly better than regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li>The colors are pretty</li>
            <li>I did my manicure exactly as CND recommends.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I finally have an option you can do at home.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice but Lobster Roll and Pink Bikini take 3 coats to be opaque.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly purchase this product again</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t apply smooth and didn&#x27;t last as advertised.</li>
            <li>the light colors had no affect but the red ones just sunk into the nail bed.</li>
            <li>My nails are not very shiny after putting on polish and top coat.</li>
            <li>Also is maddening that this product is sort of marketed to the &amp;#34;non-professional&amp;#34;, but is only available at about 3x the price paid by the pros.</li>
            <li>The first coat goes on nicely but the polish tended to drag for me on the second coat.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Applied this product as directed, then did my normal routine.</li>
            <li>it comes right off like regular polish</li>
            <li>But now my nails are soft and shredding.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t ruin your natural nail by drying and cracking.</li>
            <li>Got a mani/pedi before vacation to beach and color faded and wore off after 3 days- much sooner than my regular polish/pedicures</li>
            <li>I am considering buying another bottle of the topcoat to see if it dries equally fast with regular polish, but I would not buy any colors again.</li>
            <li>That and the fast dry time are the only advantages though.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great way to try different colors before committing to the brand at a price that&#x27;s less expensive than one no-chip or gel manicure.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth a few extra dollars</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this polish but the results were not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>This polish does not peel as much as some other regular polishes I have tried.  </li>

            <li> i was struggling with nail damage after years of wearing shellac and other gel polishes.  </li>
            <li> Today is day 9 since I had my nails done with Dark Dahlia (I think that&#x27;s the color...</li>
            <li> The tips get a bit worn down but don&#x27;t chip.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my experience with this product is no different than if I were using regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have been a shellac fan for the past few years but with the release of Vinylux decided to try it at home and save some money.  </li>
            <li> anyway, it&#x27;s very dark purple/eggplant color) and they look like I had them done yesterday!</li>
            <li> I had to apply thick coats of the topcoat to even the surface of my nails.  </li>
            <li> I do not agree at all with the previous review !!!</li>
            <li> Worse condition than from shellack nails.</li>
            <li> experience may be different and I think it is a crap shoot.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this product-</li>
            <li> the one finger i did rather sloppily chipped after almost a week of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sorry-</li>
            <li> That stinks.</li>
            <li> In my case this isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> Have to review a polish and not the kit as this was sold out :(  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this kit because I was trying Vinylux nail polish for the first time.  I have to stay that the color went on very smooth but I definitely needed 2 coats of the pink color (pink bikini).  The top coat went on just as easily and the finish looks salon quality.  I think the mini bottles are a little small but it&#x27;s a great way to try different colors before committing to the brand at a price that&#x27;s less expensive than one no-chip or gel manicure.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these polishes!  And they are true to their word, no chipping!  Highly recommend this product.  I have been a shellac fan for the past few years but with the release of Vinylux decided to try it at home and save some money.  Best decision!</li>
            <li> Wore this polish for about two months. Stayed in well. But now my nails are soft and shredding. Worse condition than from shellack nails.</li>
            <li> Super Quality.The product is perfect. It works exactly the way I had hoped it would. I would certainly purchase this product again</li>
            <li> I can tell you that I am happy with the results.  i was struggling with nail damage after years of wearing shellac and other gel polishes.  This lasts a solid 7-10 days without chips.  The tips get a bit worn down but don&#x27;t chip.  it comes right off like regular polish and I&#x27;m not having any damage. I only used these little bottles once and since then I&#x27;ve been using full size bottles at the salon - I don&#x27;t think that makes a difference but thought  should mention it. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I see a lot of mixed reviews on this product so I am thinking that whether or not this polish has staying power is most likely going to depend on your body chemistry.  My nail beds are oily and I have always had a big problem with polish staying on even with a dehydrator.  Gel polish has been the only thing that has worked for me, and honestly Shellac was not the brand that worked best.  Shellac would stay on about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would give this a try since there were so many people it had worked for and one of the common complaints is that it drys out the nails too much.  In my case this isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing.  Unfortunately my experience with this product is no different than if I were using regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I painted my nails with the pink and it was chipped within two days, I redid my nails last night with the purple and I already have a chip on one of my nails. So for me this product does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your experience may be different and I think it is a crap shoot.  You&#x27;re decision to purchase or not has to be on how willing you are to risk that you are wasting your money.</li>
            <li> Be warned.  While I love this product.....the price is so inflated.  I can get the same sample kit from a local nail tech for $24. 00.</li>
            <li> This polish stays 7 days minimum. No chipping or pealing. I highly recommend this product. In my opinion it&#x27;s better than shellac. It doesn&#x27;t ruin your natural nail by drying and cracking. Easy removal with reg nail polish remover. I want every color!</li>
            <li> Applied this product as directed, then did my normal routine. My nails were chipped and the tips worn in 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> Today is day 9 since I had my nails done with Dark Dahlia (I think that&#x27;s the color...anyway, it&#x27;s very dark purple/eggplant color) and they look like I had them done yesterday! I am a housewife, I cook, I clean, I do laundry...however, i think it&#x27;s very important to note, that I do most of the housework wearing gloves and put a lot of cream on my hands at night. In any case, no nail polish ever lasted this long on me without chipping. I think I can stretch it to two weeks! This is the first time I used this polish though, so I don&#x27;t know if it will stain my nails or not....we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t apply smooth and didn&#x27;t last as advertised. Colors were not vibrant as you might expect. I will stick with OPI or gel polish.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as expected.  Slightly better than regular nail polish.  I guess it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I handle a lot of paperwork and this product does not hold up.  Even on the weekends it starts chipping away.  The colors are pretty but I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed !! This stuff peeled off with in hours. I went on line to see if I was doing anything wrong and it was suggested to get the Scrub Fresh which I did.  It only lasted maybe 28 hrs. after that.  Im still baffled. It advertises a weekly polish. The Vinylux came very highly recommended!! Could someone please help me figure this out.</li>
            <li> This is great nail polish, better than the gel process, dries in 8 minutes and immediately in sunlight.  Doesn&#x27;t chip for a week.  I can&#x27;t reccommend it enough.  Easy to do and nice colors, rich colors.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product- bought top coat and polish. Got a mani/pedi before vacation to beach and color faded and wore off after 3 days- much sooner than my regular polish/pedicures</li>
            <li> Great product!  I did my manicure exactly as CND recommends.  You can find information on both their web site and on you tube.  It has been five days and nails still look good.  I have been using Shellac for years.  I am glad I finally have an option you can do at home.</li>
            <li> was so excited about this product coming out...then when id given it a shot.. the color surprisingly stained the nail bed! the light colors had no affect but the red ones just sunk into the nail bed. has anyone had this problem?</li>
            <li> My nails are not very shiny after putting on polish and top coat. Has anyone experienced this?  Any suggestions? Also put on 1 or 2 coats of polish?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;m a teacher and my nails get trashed in a single day at work.  The polish does wear at the ends but it does not chip, crack, or peel off.  I think it is worth a few extra dollars and I will but more colors.</li>
            <li> Have to review a polish and not the kit as this was sold out :(  The color matches the shellac nicely and IF you cap it PROPERLY it works! Came off easily and had a nice sheen to it. the one finger i did rather sloppily chipped after almost a week of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the lady who was complaining about the price. Essie and OPI both run around $8-10 in the US and this is retailing around 9-10 which is comparable. WHY on earth would you complain that you are not getting the wholesale price without having a license?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry-I really wanted to love this product. But, after Shellac totally ruined my nails-peeling, etc,. I thought I&#x27;d give them a break and use Vinylux.  Not a plus-totally streaky and chips by the second day.  Also is maddening that this product is sort of marketed to the &amp;#34;non-professional&amp;#34;, but is only available at about 3x the price paid by the pros. That stinks.</li>
            <li> I do not agree at all with the previous review !!! I totally love this product !  I found that shellac did not stay on my nails but this does !  It has lasted a week for me without damaging my nails. It comes of with polish remover. My nail tech used it on me and I am buying it to use when I cannot get my nails done. You will love it !</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this polish but the results were not what I expected.  The colors are nice but Lobster Roll and Pink Bikini take 3 coats to be opaque.  The first coat goes on nicely but the polish tended to drag for me on the second coat.  I had to apply thick coats of the topcoat to even the surface of my nails.  The polish does dry thoroughly in less than 10 minutes as advertised.  However, it does not last a week.  I covered the tips of my nails with each coat, but noticed tip wear after only one day.  This polish does not peel as much as some other regular polishes I have tried.  That and the fast dry time are the only advantages though.  I am considering buying another bottle of the topcoat to see if it dries equally fast with regular polish, but I would not buy any colors again.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is awesome!  love the colors and it wears so well.  If you need to touch up just put on another coat of the top coat and you are good to go!  Dries very fast and durable.</li>
