            <li>I love the smell of this product, however the soap isnt as creamy as i thought it would be, but I am still satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>so that I really enjoy about it!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I got this</li>
            <li>but it does have an interesting lime soda scent.</li>
            <li>This body wash from Soap &amp; Glory is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is a very sweet lime smell.</li>
            <li>Light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>only wish the scent stayed throughout the day because it smells so good!</li>
            <li>I first viewed this product from a girl on YouTube, and since she was saying how Amazing the smell was and product</li>
            <li>Actually more sweet than lime.</li>
            <li>The smell is SO refreshing and your skin feels so smooth, clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly and I cannot believe it was available online and delivered from England.  </li>
            <li>Love all soap and glory body wash and the generous size of the bottles makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li>however I was really excited with Amazon</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought the whole line.</li>
            <li>The Sugar Crush scent (think key lime pie) is absolutely amazing, and I love using it for a quick perk me up in the mornings.</li>
            <li>Sweet and citrusy.</li>
            <li>Too sweet smelling for my taste I think,</li>
            <li>I thought that this product will smell sweet lime.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and way ahead of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally buying more!</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh limes and cream.  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of the creaming soda soft drink more than lime</li>
            <li>Soap and Glory is such a fun brand and their products are really effective as well.</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Leaves your body with a really soft and very clean feel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and smells so lovely!</li>
            <li>and you still get a rich full lather, which makes the product last longer!</li>
            <li>- it makes a great gift with a few other S&amp;G products in a little basket, also good stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and doesn&#x27;t feel oily like most over the counter stuff I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have lots of skin allergies and this product works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really foam up for me and if you like the smell of limes this is for you.</li>
            <li>Cleans skin well but doesn&#x27;t moisturize as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Soap and Glory products and really love the smells of them</li>
            <li>Has a great smell and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and dry after a shower.</li>
            <li>I bought it, as I expected long-lasting beautiful smell, but it is not a good choice for those, who prefer fresh, natural smells</li>
            <li>I guess I was just expecting a little more for the price – </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and clean and the scent is a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this smell its not too sweet and it leave just a hint of fragrance behind .</li>
            <li>It also leaves your skin very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is my shower gets long some days when I am too happy being soapy and dancing around in the shower.</li>
            <li>I did notice that it left my skin very soft!</li>
            <li>First citrusy product that works with my skin chemistry too and doesn&#x27;t smell bitter on me.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have lots of skin allergies and this product works very well for me.  It smells heavenly and I cannot believe it was available online and delivered from England.  Amazon you rock.  It was  less expensive than my local store and it cam eight to the door.</li>

            <li> I bought it, as I expected long-lasting beautiful smell, but it is not a good choice for those, who prefer fresh, natural smells</li>
            <li> Bought this hearing other people on the internet rave about it, definitely not as impressed as I thought I would be. I bought this a few years back and I just got done with the bottle... So that should tell you something. Too sweet smelling for my taste I think, but I&#x27;m sure others do love it. I&#x27;ve tried other Soap and Glory products and really love the smells of them but this one just didn&#x27;t quite do it for me.</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes lots of suds</li>
            <li> I feel thoroughly cleansed when I use this with my loofah. It makes my skin feel soft and clean and the scent is a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the scent stayed throughout the day because it smells so good!

            <li> I love this body wash! It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and smells so lovely! Reminds me of the creaming soda soft drink more than lime but it&#x27;s there as well! One thing is that i dont feel like the smell stays with me after i get out of the shower!</li>
            <li> I bought this as because I saw a little review on it by Zoella on YouTube. I like it but not all that crazy about it. It doesn&#x27;t really foam up for me and if you like the smell of limes this is for you. To me it smells like candy.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it! The smell is SO refreshing and your skin feels so smooth, clean and hydrated. You only have to use a small amount and you still get a rich full lather, which makes the product last longer!</li>
            <li> I have the body butter of this same sent so I just had to try the body wash. love it! I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I first viewed this product from a girl on YouTube, and since she was saying how Amazing the smell was and product i decided to give it a try. The smell is great I love a body wash that smells up my bathroom, i only wish the smell would stay on you after your shower. Leaves your body with a really soft and very clean feel. Over all this is a great product and i will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing!! It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and doesn&#x27;t feel oily like most over the counter stuff I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m totally buying more!</li>
            <li> I thought that this product will smell sweet lime. Actually more sweet than lime. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Perfect summer scent, its like a sugary margarita with a strong but realistic lime scent, very refreshing. First citrusy product that works with my skin chemistry too and doesn&#x27;t smell bitter on me. Love all soap and glory body wash and the generous size of the bottles makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li> soap and glory sugar crush freah and foamy body wash is amzing product,,i use every day,,and totally recommed this item.</li>
            <li> These are the best products ,make your skin feel just like a baby&#x27;s ,well it does for me....I suppose everyone&#x27;s different. Any how I love the scents of each of the products ! I especially love the lime in the body wash it just wakes you up in the morning and feels so good on your skin.</li>
            <li> This body wash from Soap &amp; Glory is pretty good. The Sugar Crush scent (think key lime pie) is absolutely amazing, and I love using it for a quick perk me up in the mornings. I also think putting it in a pump container is great because I can just pump some on my loofah ball in the shower super easily. I guess I was just expecting a little more for the price – I REALLY wanted the scent to last on my skin at least a little bit once I was out of the shower, which this does not, so that was a tad disappointing for me. Overall, I would still recommend this foamy soap just because the tasty lime fragrance is so addictive!</li>
            <li> Soap and Glory is such a fun brand and their products are really effective as well. I was so sad when Target stop selling this brand however I was really excited with Amazon started to sell it. Its worth every penny. I loved it so much I bought the whole line. I love this smell its not too sweet and it leave just a hint of fragrance behind . It also leaves your skin very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and dry after a shower. Foams up nicely too so you feel like you are getting a good wash!</li>
            <li> YUM! You cannot go wrong with this one. My only complaint is my shower gets long some days when I am too happy being soapy and dancing around in the shower. Not good for conservation of water, but the product ROCKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - it makes a great gift with a few other S&amp;G products in a little basket, also good stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product, however the soap isnt as creamy as i thought it would be, but I am still satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through YouTube, and as said below, everyone seemed to rave about it and the smell! When I opened it up to get a good smell of it, I was so so disappointed! It is a very sweet lime smell. I didn&#x27;t use this for a while just because I was so put off by the smell. When I finally began using it I did notice that it left my skin very soft! I use with a loofah... so that I really enjoy about it! The smell does not linger on my skin, which I am very okay with... the smell is growing on me, but I will say I will not be repurchasing. Only because of the smell though. I think it&#x27;s a good product, but not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I got this but it does have an interesting lime soda scent. Cleans skin well but doesn&#x27;t moisturize as much as I would like. Does provide alot of suds and bubbles though. Product arrived quickly and way ahead of time. I might not order this one again but might try some of their other products.</li>
