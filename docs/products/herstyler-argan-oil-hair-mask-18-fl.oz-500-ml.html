            <li>The Aragon Oil Hair Mask leaves my hair feeling fuller, more shiny and supple.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shinny and healthy</li>
            <li>I use Loreal sulfate free shampoo with this and then Herstyle hair serum to follow before any heat is applied to my hair!</li>

            <li>LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair full, and frizz free!!</li>
            <li>I love all the products from herstyler, they are fantastic and this one is not the exception; it makes my hair smooth, shiny and healthy and the price here in amazon is just amazing.</li>
            <li>a great low price too that was amazing.</li>
            <li>Not any more or less impressive that</li>
            <li>EASY did I mention EASY to unscew - doesn&#x27;t take a mans help to do it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and smooth in my hair and leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>I can say it made my hands super soft after applying it lol.</li>
            <li>This is way better and so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth, without the fly-aways.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and replenishing.</li>

            <li>My hair is so shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This made my hair soft, light and full of volume after one use, the smell is amazing and the flacking is disappeared as well!</li>
            <li>This product replaced the old product entitled &amp;#34;HerStyler nourishing and moisturizing hair mask.&amp;#34;  I loved the original formula</li>
            <li>Original packaging.</li>
            <li>It was not the original hair treatment.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have it in a bottle (which i had the first time i bought it) but the product itself is one of my favorite conditioners.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem like the original formula.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, my hairs is damaged by bleaching and i decided to try a new product since mine started to cause me flaking after years of continued use.</li>
            <li>Check out my full review at thehairgirlblog.wordpress.com</li>
            <li>My hair stylist had really noticed how healthy my hair had become since using this product.  </li>
            <li>Love using this a mask and placing a bag over my hair for as long as I am able.</li>
            <li>the first go around!</li>
            <li>Very hydrating and the huge jar lasts forever.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t as strong and it seems to dry out my hair more than hydrate it.</li>
            <li>Felt like it washed right out, no nutrients.</li>
            <li>Very easy to wash out without leaving any lasting &amp;#34;ick&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; in ones hair</li>
            <li>Women will stop me on the street to tell me how pretty my hair is.</li>
            <li>I recently fell in love with another Argan Oil Hair Mask, so when I came to Amazon to re-order, I decided to shop around and see if I could get another brand for cheaper.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft &amp; frizz free afterward.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>This product came and it was exactly what I was hoping for and</li>
            <li>I know that it has made my medium length somewhat frizzy hair smooth, soft, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Dispensing this product is kind of odd because its just in a large tub.</li>
            <li>Large quantity</li>
            <li>The tub is so large-</li>
            <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t get oily as fast now</li>
            <li>Two things I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>More so than other leading conditioners like K-pack and comparable products.  </li>
            <li>This product really works, leaves you your hair soft and smelling fierce.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve had to start over researching new products.</li>
            <li>LEAVES VERY SOFT</li>
            <li>I have never used Herstyler products prior, so I can&#x27;t say if it is or isn&#x27;t the same as the original formula, as others have stated.  </li>
            <li>I found HerStyler, which offers almost twice as much product for half the price - definitely was excited to see that!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will last 6 months on my long blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure if I left it on long enough (about 5 minutes) after reading the answers to questions, but I will leave an updated review after using it again for the recommended length of time.</li>
            <li>I purchased it earlier this year and it made my dyed blonde curly hair super hydrated and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I even put a bit on after my hair is dry and use as a leave-in conditioner and it soaks right in.</li>
            <li>I naturally have curly/ wavy hair which I always straighten because my curls basically turn to frizz.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>I get my hair weaved with bleach which can be very drying plus using a blow dryer and sometimes a flat iron</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell either, which was disappointing, as the other brand made my hair smell amazingly like chocolate!  </li>
            <li>Even when I blow dry it straight</li>
            <li>While it may not be expensive, it performs better than the pricey products!</li>
            <li>Its thick and silky, goes in smooth and leaves your hair smoother than heather on the hills of Scotland.</li>
            <li>and you pay a minimal amount for such a LARGE container.</li>
            <li>This new product with Argan oil darkened the color of my weaved blonde hair and makes my hair feel weighed down and not soft but more coarse and less manageable.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my thin old hair untangled and full bodied without being oily.  </li>
            <li>It does moisturize my hair, but I am not sure it&#x27;s any better than just using a plain ol&#x27; conditioner.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> If you use a flat iron or any tools that can dry your hair, this is a must to use once a month!</li>
            <li> There is a lot and it lasts a long time, seals well and doesn&#x27;t dry out in the container.</li>

            <li> This stuff has literally transformed my hair! I naturally have curly/ wavy hair which I always straighten because my curls basically turn to frizz. Not anymore. This condition leaves my hair so soft an shiny without the weight of a heavy residue. I use it with the her styler serum and I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how many people comment on my hair now. Women will stop me on the street to tell me how pretty my hair is. Even when I blow dry it straight it&#x27;s literally like silk! I will never not have this stuff!! ❤️❤️</li>
            <li> I love the smell and conditioning of this product. I made the mistake of sharing it and I need to get more.</li>
            <li> Not any more or less impressive that your standard leave-in conditioner.  Maybe I just haven&#x27;t used it enough of times.  It was OK.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Original packaging.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before.  It is amazing!  Excellent price and service from seller.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes my hair smooth, without the fly-aways. Works wonders when using a flatiron! Hair doesn&#x27;t get oily as fast now so I don&#x27;t have to wash it every single day. Wish I&#x27;d have bought more the first go around! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> The Aragon Oil Hair Mask leaves my hair feeling fuller, more shiny and supple.  More so than other leading conditioners like K-pack and comparable products.  You don&#x27;t need a lot.  I use it once a week and one jar lasts months and I have mid-back length hair.  If I go to the beach or swim in a chlorinated pool, I&#x27;ll use it after that just to show my hair a little extra TLC.</li>
            <li> I like the hair mask without organ oil, not this one!</li>
            <li> Great value. Large quantity and I&#x27;m sure it will last 6 months on my long blonde hair. Helps with frizz and split ends</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel very silky and it smells great!  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and manageable. Nothing I have tried before has come close to the results I get from this product.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and was a speedy transaction.</li>
            <li> Effective and affordable!</li>
            <li> Great items. Shipped at a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I recently fell in love with another Argan Oil Hair Mask, so when I came to Amazon to re-order, I decided to shop around and see if I could get another brand for cheaper.  I found HerStyler, which offers almost twice as much product for half the price - definitely was excited to see that!  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t come close to being comparable with the other brand.  It does moisturize my hair, but I am not sure it&#x27;s any better than just using a plain ol&#x27; conditioner.  It really doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell either, which was disappointing, as the other brand made my hair smell amazingly like chocolate!  I gave the jar to my friend after only using it twice, but she loves the stuff!</li>
            <li> Best mask I had tried . My hair is shinny and healthy</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I stumbled across end it on accident when it was call eveletric (I believe.. Don&#x27;t quote me. It was a similar name of not that) it&#x27;s safe to say I&#x27;m addicted! I love getting complimented on how hydrated my hair is by my stylist when it never use to be this great! And it lasts forever!! I use Loreal sulfate free shampoo with this and then Herstyle hair serum to follow before any heat is applied to my hair! 50 stars in my book!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing too radical or fancy after using it but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My hair is so soft &amp; frizz free afterward. It also helps keep my scalp from being dry &amp; itchy.</li>
            <li> I love all the products from herstyler, they are fantastic and this one is not the exception; it makes my hair smooth, shiny and healthy and the price here in amazon is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Love using this a mask and placing a bag over my hair for as long as I am able. It&#x27;s light and replenishing. Two things I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> This hair mask is fantastic!  I purchased it earlier this year and it made my dyed blonde curly hair super hydrated and manageable.  Then when I was visiting in Florida I gave it to my sister in law to keep and hadn’t been using it.  I noticed that my hair was drier than usual and very brittle.  I remembered that I hadn’t been using the Argan Oil Hair mask and immediately ordered it on Amazon again.  My hair is almost fully repaired after only 3 uses!  I Love this stuff and will not “forget” about it again!  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Check out my full review at thehairgirlblog.wordpress.com</li>
            <li> It was not the original hair treatment. Same bottle but different product. Scent and color of treatment was totallly different.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft! It doesn&#x27;t build up or weigh hair down.  Got this, the shampoo, and serum and they all work together great!</li>
            <li> I XOXOX.....this brand everything they sell is the BOMB! I&#x27;ve owned a Baby Curl flat iron and a few other things by this brand and it&#x27;s ALWAYS......been all GOOD!</li>
            <li> Grade A.&lt;br /&gt;Usability: Easy&lt;br /&gt;Length of time: 2- 3 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Container is pleasing&lt;br /&gt;Easy EASY did I mention EASY to unscew - doesn&#x27;t take a mans help to do it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. Its thick and silky, goes in smooth and leaves your hair smoother than heather on the hills of Scotland. It smells sweet, very nice but not perfumed. Very easy to wash out without leaving any lasting &amp;#34;ick&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; in ones hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry, hair. Used to use Kiehl&#x27;s mango deep condition hair masque for my everyday conditioner. This is way better and so much cheaper!! Best smell ever!!! Leaves my hair full, and frizz free!!</li>
            <li> Best treatment I&#x27;ve used on my hair...and I&#x27;ve tried many products. The serum is great, too and smells so nice.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  This product really works, leaves you your hair soft and smelling fierce.  Great price also and for some reason it straightens my naturally coiled hair, awesome.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Excellent product Love it!</li>
            <li> Love Argan Oil Hair Mask! Leaves my hair saft and shiny. I have natural curly hair. Smells good too! Try it!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Softens my hair and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Had received some with a styling iron a couple months ago and ran out.  Came to Amazon and found it here at a great price.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves your hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this hair mask. While it may not be expensive, it performs better than the pricey products!</li>
            <li> Dispensing this product is kind of odd because its just in a large tub. However, the product is a great deep conditioner, good smell and I even use it on my yorkie&#x27;s hair too. The tub is so large- I&#x27;ll probably not have to re-order for some time.</li>
            <li> I got it and it&#x27;s huge!! A lot of product and it should last me awhile. The only thing is that it kinda makes my hair a bit thin after I dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of my FAVORITE products. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. It feels my hair silky smooth and you pay a minimal amount for such a LARGE container. I wash my hair at least 3x&#x27;s a week and this jar last at the minimum up to 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> Leaves my thin old hair untangled and full bodied without being oily.  There is a lot and it lasts a long time, seals well and doesn&#x27;t dry out in the container.</li>
            <li> As a one time indulgence I had bought this at a Herstyler mall booth for 55 dollars and of course loved it so was beyond happy to see it sold here at such a great price. Very hydrating and the huge jar lasts forever. Makes my hair super soft and shiny. It also smells wonderful. To me 55 dollars is a lot but it did last 10 months (and I have long hair) making only about $5 a month but here for 10-12 dollars I cant pass it up.</li>
            <li> This product came and it was exactly what I was hoping for and a great low price too that was amazing. I love how my hair feels thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  My hair is so shiny and smooth.  I will be purchasing this product over and over!</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I use this, my hair feels gloriously silky. Other times it feels like I have straw for hair. Not sure why since I use the same shampoo and conditioner and the water type/quality is the same. But it smells delicious -- like coconuts or something tropical. It&#x27;s a gamble not knowing how your hair will react after using this but you get a ton of product in the jar, so if it doesn&#x27;t work on your hair you can use it as a shaving cream stand-in.</li>
            <li> Felt like it washed right out, no nutrients. Doesn&#x27;t smell very good. Kinda reminded me of play dough. I guess the best thing about it, is that it is ok for intended purposes.</li>
            <li> This product replaced the old product entitled &amp;#34;HerStyler nourishing and moisturizing hair mask.&amp;#34;  I loved the original formula and I&#x27;m so sad because I used it daily.  My hair stylist had really noticed how healthy my hair had become since using this product.  I get my hair weaved with bleach which can be very drying plus using a blow dryer and sometimes a flat iron and I wash my hair every day.  This new product with Argan oil darkened the color of my weaved blonde hair and makes my hair feel weighed down and not soft but more coarse and less manageable.  Now I&#x27;ve had to start over researching new products.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, awesome, and my hair loves it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I paid 10$ for this! This is amazing, my hairs is damaged by bleaching and i decided to try a new product since mine started to cause me flaking after years of continued use. This made my hair soft, light and full of volume after one use, the smell is amazing and the flacking is disappeared as well!</li>
            <li> I bought this for both my daughter and me. We had heard that Argon oil is the way to go to improve the overall health of your hair. So after reading lots of reviews on different products, I went with this one. It really works. My hair is softer when I use it. We both started off using it a couple of times a week as our hair was in pretty bad shape. Now we use it about once a week to maintain shine and softness. Great quantity for the price too.</li>
            <li> i use this stuff once or twice a week, with other shampoos and conditioners in between. It&#x27;s so soft and smooth in my hair and leaves my hair feeling great. the only downside is that it&#x27;s in this tub thing with a twist off lid that&#x27;s annoying to open and shut and dip my fingers in. I&#x27;d rather have it in a bottle (which i had the first time i bought it) but the product itself is one of my favorite conditioners.</li>
            <li> Smells awful and doesn&#x27;t make my hair soft</li>
            <li> Awesome Product and a must have!  If you use a flat iron or any tools that can dry your hair, this is a must to use once a month!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like the original formula. I ordered this to replace the HerStyler Argan Oil Hair Mask I bought at a mall kiosk about a year ago which I loved and made my hair silky smooth. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well with my hair. The scent isn&#x27;t as strong and it seems to dry out my hair more than hydrate it.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the very first time and my hair smells AMAZING! And while I can&#x27;t say if it made my hair that soft (cause it&#x27;s still wet) I can say it made my hands super soft after applying it lol. I&#x27;m not quite sure if I left it on long enough (about 5 minutes) after reading the answers to questions, but I will leave an updated review after using it again for the recommended length of time.</li>
            <li> I have never used Herstyler products prior, so I can&#x27;t say if it is or isn&#x27;t the same as the original formula, as others have stated.  I know that it has made my medium length somewhat frizzy hair smooth, soft, and shiny.  After using it a couple of times, I immediately purchased another jar. A little goes a long way for me.  I even put a bit on after my hair is dry and use as a leave-in conditioner and it soaks right in.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE WAY IT HYDRATES YOUR HAIR LEAVES VERY SOFT</li>
