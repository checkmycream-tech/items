    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Very very happy.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>so win for me!</li>
            <li>I am SO happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>If you are used to going to a treading salon and can handle the pain - this is a great alternative.  </li>
            <li>With the Tweezerman hair remover you do feel something, but the ouch is gone before you realize the hair was successfully removed.  </li>
            <li>In some spots where I hadn&#x27;t even noticed hair it felt like it was trying to rip my skin off (pleasant, no?)</li>
            <li>Good idea</li>
            <li>He thought it did a good job of removing hairs growing inside and along his ear lobes.</li>
            <li>you insist on trying this anyway, save your receipt, because there is a good chance you will dislike it.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li>It does not rely on good close up vision like tweezers do.</li>
            <li>Pain wise, it&#x27;s bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their tweezers however, are the best and they will resharpen them free for life (except for postage to send them in).</li>
            <li>My advice...save your money and invest in a good pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li>and I am very glad I got this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this as it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Well, that he liked.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this thing ROCKS.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of the Epilady (the coil type)</li>
            <li>2 stars because the tweezers that it comes with are quite nice.</li>
            <li>honestly it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the Tweezerman hair remover tool and the eyebrow tweezers and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>If you dont need to be fully hair free but are ok with shorter hairs, then it works great.</li>
            <li>The way I got it to work most effectively (and could feel the hairs pulled from my face) is to slide it up over the area with hair while twisting the silver rollers.</li>
            <li>This works okay on very fine hairs in the chin and lip area.  </li>
            <li>Also, I can&#x27;t see those fine hairs on my chinny chin chin, so this grabs them out!</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I tried, the one hair I wanted to remove just won&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>but with practice it&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li>I am not even sure why this was made.&lt;br /&gt;You roll it on your face, then twist and turn to remove hair.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Not in love.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the inexpensive bendy ones--you don&#x27;t have to do anything but twist in...</li>
            <li>It works both ways for me, but is more efficient when used the way they recommend, with the &amp;#34;flatter&amp;#34; side against your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-pulls most hairs out</li>
            <li>It works better than any pair of tweezers that I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the reviewer tried another one that was better or didn&#x27;t know how it works?</li>
            <li>I use Tweezerman  for years and the quality is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I also love that I can use this while watching TV or reading.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much spare time and this is a great time</li>
            <li>I like this Koch better than creams or waxes that can burn or harm your skin.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use Nair or a micro shaver if I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I love Tweezerman tweezers, but this item is a dud in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love their products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I would love it if it didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is ok for me.  </li>
            <li>I asked my friends to try it and they did not have any better luck than I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it one more attempt, and if I figure out the trick, I&#x27;ll update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to pull out fine hairs which you might not want pulled thus leading to thicker regrowth.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions which are very straightforward.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most comfortable but for covering a large area, it works great.  </li>
            <li>but if I just go in to my peach fuzz, it does a pretty good job at ripping them out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much happier with a good pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li>This is really cool!  </li>
            <li>I think many commenting that it doesn&#x27;t work are doing as I did originally.</li>
            <li>I believe some of the issues the other reviewer&#x27;s are having is how they are using it, it took some practice, but it works marvelously.</li>
            <li>This just sounded too good to be true, but it really works and so much better and faster than using tweezers.</li>
            <li>It also looked easy to use-</li>
            <li>’s easy to figure out though.</li>
            <li>Maybe this one is more stiff?&lt;br /&gt;It took a few minutes to figure out how it works, but once you get the idea it works wonderful.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use after you get the hang of using it.</li>
            <li>This is true for even more wiry hairs that should give it plenty to hold onto.</li>
            <li>I own two pair and other of their products that I&#x27;m quite happy with.</li>
            <li>One thing to be aware of, it works best when there are lots of hairs in the same area.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for removal of fine baby hairs on the chin and lip area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beyond that, it removes hair fine</li>
            <li>consuming (whilst an epilator can go through fairly quickly, this is much more tedious)&lt;br /&gt;-Does not pull all hairs out, and brakes some</li>
            <li>and it still didn&#x27;t get the light</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great because you can remove a lot of hair in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Fantastic</li>
            <li>Great for sides of face, chin, and upper lip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This looks cute and seems like a good idea, but ultimately just doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>I got excited about this product because there should be something like this on the market.</li>
            <li>I originally wanted to try it as A)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was worth it!</li>
            <li>I was originally dragging it downwards as it appeared to show on the instructions and wondered why it didn&#x27;t seem to catch any hairs</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really recommend this as an ideal form of hair removal, but if you&#x27;re willing to risk the same type of pain that an epilator gives you but where you do the work manually and have just slightly more control, eh maybe it&#x27;s for you.  </li>
            <li>assume because my hairs are light and fine, it might be better for someone with more coarse hairs.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a cool idea</li>
            <li>Just make sure the convex part of the bend is facing you (and the concave part is facing away).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>And yes, it stings, but it&#x27;s over with quickly with no residual stinging, burning, or redness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it here and there, but I cannot see this being anyone&#x27;s main form of hair removal.</li>
            <li>With this gadget, I can get rid of it all quickly.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s not 100% effective every single time, but it consistently works.</li>
            <li>It also removes the really fine, peach fuzz hair that is hard to see, and if you are a bit older and can’t see well up close any more, then this product is great.</li>
            <li>The device is very well made and the included instructions are easy to follow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little gadget.</li>
            <li>I did not find it to be effective on finer hair either, and it just doesn&#x27;t grab very short hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised so many people don&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a better one because my old one started rusting after a while.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to keep my lip hair free without having to spend ridiculous amounts of money having it waxed or dyed with smelly treatments.</li>
            <li>product works, but just not as good as other methods already on the market.</li>
            <li>This thing just glides right over it.</li>
            <li>Works well, just a twist of the wrists and hair comes right out.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t make the right preparations)</li>
            <li>So buyer beware, maybe this isn&#x27;t the right tool for you if you are like me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am much better with waxing apparently!</li>
            <li>But honsetly, you can remove more hair, more quickly, with plain tweezers.</li>
            <li>Other than price being in the high end for this product, I&#x27;m happy with the quality.</li>
            <li>husband refused to let me try rubbing this across his beard to see if it can pull out great patches of stubble, so I am not sure who in the world is the market for this.</li>
            <li>My most useful Christmas present this season, maybe ever.  </li>
            <li>For travelling very light, I would still bring just my tweezers, but this will be my go-to for keeping my chin and upper lip nude from now on!</li>
            <li>So, when I was offered the Twezzerman Smooth Finish Facial Hair Remover I was really excited to try</li>
            <li>This tool is essentially like tweezing many hairs at once.</li>
            <li>but I went over the area several more times</li>
            <li>(so it does work on them, even when it didn&#x27;t on my first try between my eyebrows).  </li>
            <li>This facial hair remover is an interesting design.</li>
            <li>with that in mind, it works exactly as said</li>
            <li>I would not pay more money for this - and I will probably buy an epilator later on.</li>
            <li>It hurt a lot at first</li>
            <li>Less effective for very fine facial hair.  </li>
            <li>then I pretty much just ran it over my face to see what happened.  </li>
            <li>It is a very imprecise way to remove many hairs, and it requires too much precision to remove one, whereas as tweezer takes a second.</li>
            <li>There were a few more coarse hairs that I ended up having to tackle on their own - but for a couple of minutes work - this device took care of all the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow!  Quick, easy to use, and relatively painless.  </li>
            <li>It was electric and it worked well, but it had large coils and was meant for longer hair, like on the legs.</li>
            <li>As a lady of &amp;#34;a certain age&amp;#34</li>
            <li>did some facial hair areas very quickly, without much pain or redness and my face was much smoother afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Looks like a mini medieval torture device but works very well to remove fine hairs around the chin and lip area.  </li>
            <li>I found that it got my fine blonde hairs really well.  </li>
            <li>So, I can only see myself using this to smooth the fine hair areas over the lip or between the eyebrows on an occasional basis.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this product much.</li>
            <li>Modern people need to avoid this.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product</li>
            <li>But it really is that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>for me very well</li>
            <li>and then it didn’t hurt as much.</li>
            <li>I kept seeing it at shopping channels but never believed it really works.</li>
            <li>I found it takes too much time.</li>
            <li>The tweezers they give you free with this contraption however, are not like those, or of the same quality.</li>
            <li>To use you simply center the top of coil on the area where you want to remove hair.  </li>
            <li>My face is so much smoother now.</li>
            <li>Absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and she really didn&#x27;t even want to take it out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is stainless steel</li>
            <li>I really like the design of this</li>
            <li>And although some reviewers were delighted to at least get a pair of Tweezerman brand tweezers, I was not.</li>
            <li>It does not grab thicker/stiffer hairs (the kind you can actually see), nor does it grab short hairs.  </li>
            <li>I had taken to tweezing the coarser hairs that I could grab and &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; the rest with an eyebrow tool, which worked ok, but the tweezing took a long time, and the shaved hairs would grow back quickly.</li>
            <li>I have found the best tweezers are flat edged, not angled, and are as narrow as possible at the edge.</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman is a unique tool for removing unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Neat idea, item work sort of well, but I still needed to clean but stray hairs with regular tweezers.</li>
            <li>It does pull hair, even fine hair, but you have to work the area for a long time.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and watched the video on this to make sure I was doing it right, and gave it several tries, thinking maybe it just required practice.</li>
            <li>Clever design.</li>
            <li>I actually found that twisting them the opposite way from the directions worked better for</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this because it says it removes the root of the hair and this keeps it from growing back as quickly, and sometimes not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(if I&#x27;m trying to get one particular hair out - it seems I can&#x27;t do it -</li>
            <li>Mostly tried it on various areas on and around the face and after two different sessions, would not use again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first few seconds - it is easy to get the hang of this design</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but I have a high tolerance to pain.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Later: Once again I tried to let remove my husband&#x27;s beard, and he said it pinched too much and unexpectedly, but to try it in his ears.</li>
            <li>I tried it on those fine little hairs that you get on the side of your face after a certain age, and</li>
            <li>It pulls them all out by the root, so I don&#x27;t expect they&#x27;ll grow back right away.</li>
            <li>Nothing more than a stiff spring with handles.</li>
            <li>I personally would not apply makeup right after using this.</li>
            <li>It works fine for the occasional stray hair if it&#x27;s fairly coarse hair like a whisker.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal done on my \\&quot;upper lip\\&quot;/mustache, so I don&#x27;t have a huge amount of hair there, but it still comes back a bit.</li>
            <li>, I guess it technically does remove most facial hair, but I had to go over these spots several times to get the majority of it, and overall it just wasn&#x27;t worth the agony of using this.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how well it would work if you had a lot of facial hair to contend with, but if you have finer hairs or moderate errant hairs, it is a lot more comfortable that waxing and the electric tweezers</li>
            <li>At first I thought it didn&#x27;t work, that it&#x27;s going back,</li>
            <li>At first I had the urge to let the unit roll up my face, but I finally figured out to just hold the spring thing against my face where the hair is, and twist the handles while holding the spring thing in place,  Eureka!  </li>
            <li>instructions are easy, but it takes a little practice to turn the handle areas while moving it about the face.</li>
            <li>It was incredibly painful, and inefficient because it seldom caught more than a hair or two each go-round, so it took a very long time to successfully pinch every hair off you.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, which has become more so over the last few years, making hair removal very tricky.</li>
            <li>It was able to get very few hairs</li>
            <li>When using it between my eyebrows there was one or two dark hairs with several more lighter and shorter hairs.  </li>
            <li>It is better than doing it at a beauty saloon, as it hurts less and achieves the same results!!</li>
            <li>It pulls out several hairs, but I believe once I use it more often it will be also less stinging.</li>
            <li>I do love the little extra eyebrow tweezers that came with it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much hairs on my upper lip, mostly on the chin and those are hard and wiry.</li>
            <li>As goes with any procedure of plucking hairs, it may be painful, more so in areas where you are more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;d find a few light hairs</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful that this tool would be the answer to my facial hair problems, but it is not the tool for me.</li>
            <li>If your sensitive to pain, this is probably not for you.</li>
            <li>It works very well for chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li>I got this because my old one broke.</li>
            <li>I, like many women have a few facial hairs that need removing.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman tweezers are the best around but this coil contraption is worthless.</li>
            <li>The feeling is very similar to going to a treading salon and the results seem to be very much the same.  </li>
            <li>I have PCOS and have both thick and very fine facial hair.</li>
            <li>It is fine for eliminating individual hairs if they are long enough to be grasped by the coils, but it can be tricky targeting them properly.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this over regular tweezers and certainly over those stinky creams or waxes.</li>
            <li>This is really a cool little grooming tool!</li>
            <li>I pinch and pull and fight to try and get ride of those pesky little hairs, with varying degrees of success..  </li>
            <li>It is a clever way to trick yourself into believing that facial hair will just disappear if you just twist the two bands above the handles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Forget this product just clearly is useless...check out the reviews on YouTube to confirm the above info.</li>
            <li>I have a real need for a product that will make it easier to remove facial hair, but this didn&#x27;t work for me, no matter how long I stood there spinning the knobs.</li>
            <li>and I barely felt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Follow the directions, you will be surprised how well the facial hair remover tool works.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it&#x27;s ouchy, but that&#x27;s to be expected, this is really just fancy tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item because it has hot pink (!) and made by a band I trust.</li>
            <li>I tried to remove the fine hair above my lip, but only a few hairs caught after twisting the handles several times in both directions.</li>
            <li>kinda hard to figure out, but is kinda fun, if you like that sorta thing!</li>
            <li>You manually rotate the coils by twisting little dials on the handles right above the colored part.</li>
            <li>It picked up the few dark hair fairly easily</li>
            <li>I generally use tweezers and they always come back.</li>
            <li>I had to turn it a few different ways before I really got the hang of it - but twisting the coils is a much easier and much less eye-watering way to remove unwanted</li>

            <li> and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Very very happy.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> so win for me!</li>
            <li> I am SO happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> If you are used to going to a treading salon and can handle the pain - this is a great alternative.  </li>
            <li> With the Tweezerman hair remover you do feel something, but the ouch is gone before you realize the hair was successfully removed.  </li>
            <li> In some spots where I hadn&#x27;t even noticed hair it felt like it was trying to rip my skin off (pleasant, no?)</li>
            <li> Good idea</li>
            <li> He thought it did a good job of removing hairs growing inside and along his ear lobes.</li>
            <li> you insist on trying this anyway, save your receipt, because there is a good chance you will dislike it.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li> It does not rely on good close up vision like tweezers do.</li>
            <li> Pain wise, it&#x27;s bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their tweezers however, are the best and they will resharpen them free for life (except for postage to send them in).</li>
            <li> My advice...save your money and invest in a good pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> and I am very glad I got this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this as it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Well, that he liked.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this thing ROCKS.</li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of the Epilady (the coil type)</li>
            <li> 2 stars because the tweezers that it comes with are quite nice.</li>
            <li> honestly it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Tweezerman hair remover tool and the eyebrow tweezers and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> If you dont need to be fully hair free but are ok with shorter hairs, then it works great.</li>
            <li> The way I got it to work most effectively (and could feel the hairs pulled from my face) is to slide it up over the area with hair while twisting the silver rollers.</li>
            <li> This works okay on very fine hairs in the chin and lip area.  </li>
            <li> Also, I can&#x27;t see those fine hairs on my chinny chin chin, so this grabs them out!</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I tried, the one hair I wanted to remove just won&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> but with practice it&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li> I am not even sure why this was made.&lt;br /&gt;You roll it on your face, then twist and turn to remove hair.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Not in love.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the inexpensive bendy ones--you don&#x27;t have to do anything but twist in...</li>
            <li> It works both ways for me, but is more efficient when used the way they recommend, with the &amp;#34;flatter&amp;#34; side against your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-pulls most hairs out</li>
            <li> It works better than any pair of tweezers that I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the reviewer tried another one that was better or didn&#x27;t know how it works?</li>
            <li> I use Tweezerman  for years and the quality is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I also love that I can use this while watching TV or reading.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much spare time and this is a great time</li>
            <li> I like this Koch better than creams or waxes that can burn or harm your skin.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use Nair or a micro shaver if I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman tweezers, but this item is a dud in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love their products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I would love it if it didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is ok for me.  </li>
            <li> I asked my friends to try it and they did not have any better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it one more attempt, and if I figure out the trick, I&#x27;ll update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to pull out fine hairs which you might not want pulled thus leading to thicker regrowth.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions which are very straightforward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most comfortable but for covering a large area, it works great.  </li>
            <li> but if I just go in to my peach fuzz, it does a pretty good job at ripping them out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much happier with a good pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> This is really cool!  </li>
            <li> I think many commenting that it doesn&#x27;t work are doing as I did originally.</li>
            <li> I believe some of the issues the other reviewer&#x27;s are having is how they are using it, it took some practice, but it works marvelously.</li>
            <li> This just sounded too good to be true, but it really works and so much better and faster than using tweezers.</li>
            <li> It also looked easy to use-</li>
            <li> ’s easy to figure out though.</li>
            <li> Maybe this one is more stiff?&lt;br /&gt;It took a few minutes to figure out how it works, but once you get the idea it works wonderful.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use after you get the hang of using it.</li>
            <li> This is true for even more wiry hairs that should give it plenty to hold onto.</li>
            <li> I own two pair and other of their products that I&#x27;m quite happy with.</li>
            <li> One thing to be aware of, it works best when there are lots of hairs in the same area.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for removal of fine baby hairs on the chin and lip area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beyond that, it removes hair fine</li>
            <li> consuming (whilst an epilator can go through fairly quickly, this is much more tedious)&lt;br /&gt;-Does not pull all hairs out, and brakes some</li>
            <li> and it still didn&#x27;t get the light</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great because you can remove a lot of hair in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic</li>
            <li> Great for sides of face, chin, and upper lip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This looks cute and seems like a good idea, but ultimately just doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I got excited about this product because there should be something like this on the market.</li>
            <li> I originally wanted to try it as A)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was worth it!</li>
            <li> I was originally dragging it downwards as it appeared to show on the instructions and wondered why it didn&#x27;t seem to catch any hairs</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really recommend this as an ideal form of hair removal, but if you&#x27;re willing to risk the same type of pain that an epilator gives you but where you do the work manually and have just slightly more control, eh maybe it&#x27;s for you.  </li>
            <li> assume because my hairs are light and fine, it might be better for someone with more coarse hairs.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a cool idea</li>
            <li> Just make sure the convex part of the bend is facing you (and the concave part is facing away).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> And yes, it stings, but it&#x27;s over with quickly with no residual stinging, burning, or redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it here and there, but I cannot see this being anyone&#x27;s main form of hair removal.</li>
            <li> With this gadget, I can get rid of it all quickly.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s not 100% effective every single time, but it consistently works.</li>
            <li> It also removes the really fine, peach fuzz hair that is hard to see, and if you are a bit older and can’t see well up close any more, then this product is great.</li>
            <li> The device is very well made and the included instructions are easy to follow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great little gadget.</li>
            <li> I did not find it to be effective on finer hair either, and it just doesn&#x27;t grab very short hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised so many people don&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a better one because my old one started rusting after a while.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to keep my lip hair free without having to spend ridiculous amounts of money having it waxed or dyed with smelly treatments.</li>
            <li> product works, but just not as good as other methods already on the market.</li>
            <li> This thing just glides right over it.</li>
            <li> Works well, just a twist of the wrists and hair comes right out.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t make the right preparations)</li>
            <li> So buyer beware, maybe this isn&#x27;t the right tool for you if you are like me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am much better with waxing apparently!</li>
            <li> But honsetly, you can remove more hair, more quickly, with plain tweezers.</li>
            <li> Other than price being in the high end for this product, I&#x27;m happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> husband refused to let me try rubbing this across his beard to see if it can pull out great patches of stubble, so I am not sure who in the world is the market for this.</li>
            <li> My most useful Christmas present this season, maybe ever.  </li>
            <li> For travelling very light, I would still bring just my tweezers, but this will be my go-to for keeping my chin and upper lip nude from now on!</li>
            <li> So, when I was offered the Twezzerman Smooth Finish Facial Hair Remover I was really excited to try</li>
            <li> This tool is essentially like tweezing many hairs at once.</li>
            <li> but I went over the area several more times</li>
            <li> (so it does work on them, even when it didn&#x27;t on my first try between my eyebrows).  </li>
            <li> This facial hair remover is an interesting design.</li>
            <li> with that in mind, it works exactly as said</li>
            <li> I would not pay more money for this - and I will probably buy an epilator later on.</li>
            <li> It hurt a lot at first</li>
            <li> Less effective for very fine facial hair.  </li>
            <li> then I pretty much just ran it over my face to see what happened.  </li>
            <li> It is a very imprecise way to remove many hairs, and it requires too much precision to remove one, whereas as tweezer takes a second.</li>
            <li> There were a few more coarse hairs that I ended up having to tackle on their own - but for a couple of minutes work - this device took care of all the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow!  Quick, easy to use, and relatively painless.  </li>
            <li> It was electric and it worked well, but it had large coils and was meant for longer hair, like on the legs.</li>
            <li> As a lady of &amp;#34;a certain age&amp;#34</li>
            <li> did some facial hair areas very quickly, without much pain or redness and my face was much smoother afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Looks like a mini medieval torture device but works very well to remove fine hairs around the chin and lip area.  </li>
            <li> I found that it got my fine blonde hairs really well.  </li>
            <li> So, I can only see myself using this to smooth the fine hair areas over the lip or between the eyebrows on an occasional basis.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product much.</li>
            <li> Modern people need to avoid this.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product</li>
            <li> But it really is that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> for me very well</li>
            <li> and then it didn’t hurt as much.</li>
            <li> I kept seeing it at shopping channels but never believed it really works.</li>
            <li> I found it takes too much time.</li>
            <li> The tweezers they give you free with this contraption however, are not like those, or of the same quality.</li>
            <li> To use you simply center the top of coil on the area where you want to remove hair.  </li>
            <li> My face is so much smoother now.</li>
            <li> Absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> and she really didn&#x27;t even want to take it out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is stainless steel</li>
            <li> I really like the design of this</li>
            <li> And although some reviewers were delighted to at least get a pair of Tweezerman brand tweezers, I was not.</li>
            <li> It does not grab thicker/stiffer hairs (the kind you can actually see), nor does it grab short hairs.  </li>
            <li> I had taken to tweezing the coarser hairs that I could grab and &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; the rest with an eyebrow tool, which worked ok, but the tweezing took a long time, and the shaved hairs would grow back quickly.</li>
            <li> I have found the best tweezers are flat edged, not angled, and are as narrow as possible at the edge.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman is a unique tool for removing unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Neat idea, item work sort of well, but I still needed to clean but stray hairs with regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> It does pull hair, even fine hair, but you have to work the area for a long time.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and watched the video on this to make sure I was doing it right, and gave it several tries, thinking maybe it just required practice.</li>
            <li> Clever design.</li>
            <li> I actually found that twisting them the opposite way from the directions worked better for</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because it says it removes the root of the hair and this keeps it from growing back as quickly, and sometimes not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (if I&#x27;m trying to get one particular hair out - it seems I can&#x27;t do it -</li>
            <li> Mostly tried it on various areas on and around the face and after two different sessions, would not use again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first few seconds - it is easy to get the hang of this design</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but I have a high tolerance to pain.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Later: Once again I tried to let remove my husband&#x27;s beard, and he said it pinched too much and unexpectedly, but to try it in his ears.</li>
            <li> I tried it on those fine little hairs that you get on the side of your face after a certain age, and</li>
            <li> It pulls them all out by the root, so I don&#x27;t expect they&#x27;ll grow back right away.</li>
            <li> Nothing more than a stiff spring with handles.</li>
            <li> I personally would not apply makeup right after using this.</li>
            <li> It works fine for the occasional stray hair if it&#x27;s fairly coarse hair like a whisker.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal done on my \\&quot;upper lip\\&quot;/mustache, so I don&#x27;t have a huge amount of hair there, but it still comes back a bit.</li>
            <li> , I guess it technically does remove most facial hair, but I had to go over these spots several times to get the majority of it, and overall it just wasn&#x27;t worth the agony of using this.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it would work if you had a lot of facial hair to contend with, but if you have finer hairs or moderate errant hairs, it is a lot more comfortable that waxing and the electric tweezers</li>
            <li> At first I thought it didn&#x27;t work, that it&#x27;s going back,</li>
            <li> At first I had the urge to let the unit roll up my face, but I finally figured out to just hold the spring thing against my face where the hair is, and twist the handles while holding the spring thing in place,  Eureka!  </li>
            <li> instructions are easy, but it takes a little practice to turn the handle areas while moving it about the face.</li>
            <li> It was incredibly painful, and inefficient because it seldom caught more than a hair or two each go-round, so it took a very long time to successfully pinch every hair off you.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, which has become more so over the last few years, making hair removal very tricky.</li>
            <li> It was able to get very few hairs</li>
            <li> When using it between my eyebrows there was one or two dark hairs with several more lighter and shorter hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is better than doing it at a beauty saloon, as it hurts less and achieves the same results!!</li>
            <li> It pulls out several hairs, but I believe once I use it more often it will be also less stinging.</li>
            <li> I do love the little extra eyebrow tweezers that came with it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much hairs on my upper lip, mostly on the chin and those are hard and wiry.</li>
            <li> As goes with any procedure of plucking hairs, it may be painful, more so in areas where you are more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;d find a few light hairs</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful that this tool would be the answer to my facial hair problems, but it is not the tool for me.</li>
            <li> If your sensitive to pain, this is probably not for you.</li>
            <li> It works very well for chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li> I got this because my old one broke.</li>
            <li> I, like many women have a few facial hairs that need removing.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman tweezers are the best around but this coil contraption is worthless.</li>
            <li> The feeling is very similar to going to a treading salon and the results seem to be very much the same.  </li>
            <li> I have PCOS and have both thick and very fine facial hair.</li>
            <li> It is fine for eliminating individual hairs if they are long enough to be grasped by the coils, but it can be tricky targeting them properly.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this over regular tweezers and certainly over those stinky creams or waxes.</li>
            <li> This is really a cool little grooming tool!</li>
            <li> I pinch and pull and fight to try and get ride of those pesky little hairs, with varying degrees of success..  </li>
            <li> It is a clever way to trick yourself into believing that facial hair will just disappear if you just twist the two bands above the handles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Forget this product just clearly is useless...check out the reviews on YouTube to confirm the above info.</li>
            <li> I have a real need for a product that will make it easier to remove facial hair, but this didn&#x27;t work for me, no matter how long I stood there spinning the knobs.</li>
            <li> and I barely felt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Follow the directions, you will be surprised how well the facial hair remover tool works.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it&#x27;s ouchy, but that&#x27;s to be expected, this is really just fancy tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item because it has hot pink (!) and made by a band I trust.</li>
            <li> I tried to remove the fine hair above my lip, but only a few hairs caught after twisting the handles several times in both directions.</li>
            <li> kinda hard to figure out, but is kinda fun, if you like that sorta thing!</li>
            <li> You manually rotate the coils by twisting little dials on the handles right above the colored part.</li>
            <li> It picked up the few dark hair fairly easily</li>
            <li> I generally use tweezers and they always come back.</li>
            <li> I had to turn it a few different ways before I really got the hang of it - but twisting the coils is a much easier and much less eye-watering way to remove unwanted</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will continue to use or only on certain areas where regrowth is not noticeable.</li>
            <li> The build is solid, and the instructions easy enough to follow, but about 80% of my attempts to use it failed to grab any hairs at all.</li>
            <li> It is actually about 4 ½ inches long.</li>
            <li> found it most useful for removing very thin hair (&amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;) on the sides of my face, but removing my upper lip hair and hair under my chin was absurdly painful.</li>
            <li> I am at the age where little whiskers [soft and not-so-soft] occasionally crop up on my chin and throat.</li>
            <li> that Tweezerman had a big HUGE FAIL on their hands with this...</li>
            <li> This is unit is extremely painful to use and only moderately effective.  </li>
            <li> so long as you follow the steps shown.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t do it for a long time, but I can sit in front of the TV and use it without a mirror.</li>
            <li> And even though this device is not advertised to do so, I would like to point out that you should not even try removing other bodily hair with this; longer hair just gets tangled in the coils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised about the poor reviews so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this device if you have a few stray hairs (punishment for a woman living long enough!).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a little bit of dark hair on my upper lip, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different ways of dealing with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use, although the instructions were a little vague.</li>
            <li> No it did not live up to my expectations and what it&#x27;s write up claims!</li>
            <li> My skin did get a little red but went away after 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> And if you try this and find that it&#x27;s not so bad to use, well, more power to you then?</li>
            <li> This was probably more painful than just pulling them out one by one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you are immediately mentally prepared for the pinch</li>
            <li> Not really much else to say, it just works.</li>
            <li> It stings when you pull but that&#x27;s expected of a tweezer.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived with pink handles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every day for the last 2 weeks to pull out a few stubborn chin hairs and just can&#x27;t get it to grab anything.</li>
            <li> For me it has not really pulled hairs out but rather tears them off and makes them shorter.  </li>
            <li> I would not use if I only had a few stray hairs here and there.</li>
            <li> Somehow the coils manage to extract hairs a bit less painfully than when I pluck with a tweezers (I love my Rubis slant tweezer).</li>
            <li> They are almost impossible to find in stores, so the few I have come across, I guard like precious diamonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pair that comes with this device are like any other tweezers, no complaints.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure that it actually does what I was hoping it would do.</li>
            <li> It’s coils are small and is meant for finer facial hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it several times over the past two weeks and</li>
            <li> but I dont think any &amp;#34;easier&amp;#34; than other methods,</li>
            <li> Once I got it down, I found it rather painful plus it left behind many of my facial hairs.</li>
            <li> However, I had a hard time removing facial hair with this remover.  </li>
            <li> and it is not worth the $$$.  </li>
            <li> not worth the $$$ and 3)</li>
            <li> not worth the money...</li>
            <li> It comes with a regular tweezer (slanted edge).&lt;br /&gt;The directions were a bit confusing.</li>
            <li> tool is  simple to use, but not effective.</li>
            <li> This little device is amazing for removing unwanted hair - but beware it is painful!  </li>
            <li> You basically grab onto the metal cylenders below the spring and twist them to roll up or down your face.</li>
            <li> I attempted it for about fifteen minutes before I broke down and threw it</li>
            <li> Other times it would be pulling off quite a few hairs</li>
            <li> It oddly came with a pair of tweezers, which makes me think why?</li>
            <li> It took me like a half hour to figure this thing out.</li>
            <li> Slight, but a mustache, never the less.  </li>
            <li> This is a bit difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t seem well suited to clearing larger areas such as over the lip and between the brows.</li>
            <li> Cannot get it to even grab hair much less remove it.  </li>
            <li> A serious downside is that it will not grab stubby short regrowth which could be seen and felt.</li>
            <li> Typically, I get my face threaded and pluck in between my monthly threading session.</li>
            <li> The other one is a little cheaper, but this one comes with little tweezers and it&#x27;s from Tweezerman!</li>
            <li> and I sometimes use that for little chin hairs</li>
            <li> me tweezers are all the same (unless they&#x27;re made of really weak flimsy materials).  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get rid of my tweezers, but this is a neat little hair remover.</li>
            <li> I was trying to bend the little arm things in to make it work.</li>
            <li> Just lay it on your face and roll it as you twist the little things with the arrows on them.</li>
            <li> You lay the coil against your skin and twist the little metal handles.  </li>
            <li> [A little ouch would be in order here]  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice, but once you feel the little &#x27;tug&amp;#34; from a hair you pull it away from your face, the root and all are removed.</li>
            <li> For now, thumbs down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid $25 for their high end tweezers to remove chin hair and eyebrow hair, so I am disappointed to have to give them a low rating.</li>
            <li> painful and still on the fence as to how useful this is....</li>
            <li> This is that, only worse.</li>
            <li> judge harshly for hair removal tools, as in</li>
            <li> I feel like I just wasted $20.</li>
            <li> This product did a poor job of removing facial hair around lip and chin...</li>
            <li> I thought it was small, the size of an average pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> It also trapped the hairs and yanked them out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It will pull out eyelashes if used on eyebrows and there is no fine tuning with this.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed as I love Tweezerman products normally and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Twisting the handles while holding against the area to remove the hair, the stiff spring rolls and grabs the hairs and pulls them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is faster than plucking and less painful than plucking or waxing larger areas such as the mustache.  </li>
            <li> With tweezers I keep missing hairs and usually don&#x27;t see it to I sit in the car and look in the rear mirror.</li>
            <li> So, I take my tweezers and start to pluck those little suckers.  </li>
            <li> Very little practice is required to become efficient in removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Why did they think their device would fail often enough that you would still need tweezers?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was me, or the product.  </li>
            <li> There is a small learning curve as with any device.</li>
            <li> Btw, it comes with a mini plastic tweezerman tweezer, useless, not the same quality as the metal ones.  </li>
            <li> There is a very subtle shape to the &amp;#34;business&amp;#34; end of the device, and there are very small directional arrows on the metal sleeves above the colored handles.</li>
            <li> This coil design makes for tweezing hairs in sensitive areas much less painful.  </li>
            <li> It pulls hair out at the root and is less painful and irritating than waxing, and FOR SURE less painful than plucking.</li>
            <li> it will merely cut them off leaving a small bit of hair or fail  to get some hairs completely.  </li>
            <li> It is a lot less painful than individually tweezing the hairs.  </li>
            <li> gadget is hard to use.</li>
            <li> Hard time using, may be me, but won&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> At $20 I figured it would be a huge savings, if I didn&#x27;t have to do the threading anymore (as well as suffer the horrible breakouts that follow).</li>
            <li> It is definitely not as effective as my epilator.&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to reach areas (neck/bottom of jaw)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward to handle while twisting the coils and does not have a &#x27;flat side&#x27; as the instructions say to use.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mean the tweeze.</li>
            <li> I mean it pains me to give Tweezerman just one star.</li>
            <li> , you never know when this is going to grab a hair, and each pinch comes as an unpleasant and sudden surprise.</li>
            <li> Too bad because I am a big Tweezerman fan and have owned their tweezers for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> It is simply meant to remove the majority of hairs in the area you intend it to (rather painfully at that</li>
            <li> And when it did grab hair, it was really painful having it pull out multiple at a time.</li>
            <li> Not good if you have to go out every day.</li>
            <li> would someone want to torture themselves and to make their faces look worse?</li>
            <li> But alas, the product doesn&#x27;t provide the coverage that I need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially there is a little stinging, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> My wife use them for hair face removing, she says it works well, but a little painful.</li>
            <li> Useless...</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my hubby try it as well, both on him and me, and we fail.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a scary torture device for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit awkward on my chin, and I don&#x27;t have any hairs there at the moment,</li>
            <li> Very difficult to work  product did not  </li>
            <li> are very difficult to work on, whereas an eplilator wouldn&#x27;t have an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I figured that using this thing couldn&#x27;t be THAT bad.</li>
            <li> I know some hairs came out because I felt the painful yank, but when I surveyed the area, the majority of hair was still there.</li>
            <li> contraption however has really disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Where has this thing been all my life? I&#x27;ve always had a little bit of dark hair on my upper lip, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different ways of dealing with it. I have sensitive skin, which has become more so over the last few years, making hair removal very tricky. Waxing would pull the skin off along with the hair. Chemical depilatories used to work for me, but now they just burn my skin. I had taken to tweezing the coarser hairs that I could grab and &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; the rest with an eyebrow tool, which worked ok, but the tweezing took a long time, and the shaved hairs would grow back quickly. This tool is essentially like tweezing many hairs at once. It pulls them all out by the root, so I don&#x27;t expect they&#x27;ll grow back right away. And yes, it stings, but it&#x27;s over with quickly with no residual stinging, burning, or redness.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working well. I feel the hairs get caught in the Tweezerman but don&#x27;t see them coming out.  They appear to be off my face though. One thing to be aware of, it works best when there are lots of hairs in the same area. Tweezers would be easier if there are stray hairs.  I do love the little extra eyebrow tweezers that came with it and I sometimes use that for little chin hairs</li>
            <li> It pulls out a bunch of hairs at once.  Like anything that rips a bunch of hair out at once, it can take some practice and simply isn&#x27;t going to work for everyone or every hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve gotten some mixed results.  When using it between my eyebrows there was one or two dark hairs with several more lighter and shorter hairs.  It picked up the few dark hair fairly easily but I went over the area several more times and it still didn&#x27;t get the light hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I pretty much just ran it over my face to see what happened.  In some spots where I hadn&#x27;t even noticed hair it felt like it was trying to rip my skin off (pleasant, no?) and then I&#x27;d find a few light hairs (so it does work on them, even when it didn&#x27;t on my first try between my eyebrows).  Other times it would be pulling off quite a few hairs and I barely felt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me tweezers are all the same (unless they&#x27;re made of really weak flimsy materials).  The pair that comes with this device are like any other tweezers, no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really recommend this as an ideal form of hair removal, but if you&#x27;re willing to risk the same type of pain that an epilator gives you but where you do the work manually and have just slightly more control, eh maybe it&#x27;s for you.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it here and there, but I cannot see this being anyone&#x27;s main form of hair removal.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product much. It has a bit of a learning curve. Once I got it down, I found it rather painful plus it left behind many of my facial hairs. I was very hopeful that this tool would be the answer to my facial hair problems, but it is not the tool for me. I think this is one of those tools that works well for some and not so well for others. If your sensitive to pain, this is probably not for you.</li>
            <li> This facial hair remover is an interesting design. You basically grab onto the metal cylenders below the spring and twist them to roll up or down your face. The spring actually grabs onto the hair and plucks it out at the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this hair remover did what it is supposed to do dependably, it would have gotten 5 stars. The problem is, it doesn&#x27;t. I have one hair to the side of my nose that I want to pluck out. I&#x27;ve pulled it out several times and it just grows back. No matter how many times I tried, the one hair I wanted to remove just won&#x27;t come out. This thing just glides right over it. I managed to get a couple others out but not this one. So it&#x27;s a cool idea but it may or may not work. It comes with a pair of tweezers but those just slip off of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, either this thing is not dependable or this one hair is secured to my face with adamantium.</li>
            <li> I got excited about this product because there should be something like this on the market. It also looked easy to use- and it was. The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t work! I followed the directions which are very straightforward. You hold it in  your hands and twist both handles in same direction. This is supposed to remove the hairs but I kept going over spots and it wasn&#x27;t removing them. I ended up using a tweezer. Good idea but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Remember the Epilady? It was an electronic device which had a head of rotating coils like these that pinched the hair off your legs, bodies, underarms and face. It was incredibly painful, and inefficient because it seldom caught more than a hair or two each go-round, so it took a very long time to successfully pinch every hair off you. This is that, only worse. You manually rotate the coils by twisting little dials on the handles right above the colored part. That means you need both hands to work it. Unlike with a pair of tweezers when you can see you have grasped a hair and you are immediately mentally prepared for the pinch, you never know when this is going to grab a hair, and each pinch comes as an unpleasant and sudden surprise. It is a very imprecise way to remove many hairs, and it requires too much precision to remove one, whereas as tweezer takes a second. And forget about using it on your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband refused to let me try rubbing this across his beard to see if it can pull out great patches of stubble, so I am not sure who in the world is the market for this. It oddly came with a pair of tweezers, which makes me think why? Why did they think their device would fail often enough that you would still need tweezers? And although some reviewers were delighted to at least get a pair of Tweezerman brand tweezers, I was not. I have found the best tweezers are flat edged, not angled, and are as narrow as possible at the edge. They are almost impossible to find in stores, so the few I have come across, I guard like precious diamonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later: Once again I tried to let remove my husband&#x27;s beard, and he said it pinched too much and unexpectedly, but to try it in his ears. Well, that he liked. He thought it did a good job of removing hairs growing inside and along his ear lobes. So I said, here, you can have it then.</li>
            <li> Works well, just a twist of the wrists and hair comes right out. I won&#x27;t get rid of my tweezers, but this is a neat little hair remover. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Clever design. It works well. Those who couldn&#x27;t get it to work may want to try a different technique. The way I got it to work most effectively (and could feel the hairs pulled from my face) is to slide it up over the area with hair while twisting the silver rollers. I actually found that twisting them the opposite way from the directions worked better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great because you can remove a lot of hair in a short amount of time. I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal done on my \\&quot;upper lip\\&quot;/mustache, so I don&#x27;t have a huge amount of hair there, but it still comes back a bit. With this gadget, I can get rid of it all quickly. It&#x27;s a bit awkward on my chin, and I don&#x27;t have any hairs there at the moment, but with practice it&#x27;ll get better. And as others have said, it comes with a bonus mini tweezer.</li>
            <li> This is really cool!  This coil design makes for tweezing hairs in sensitive areas much less painful.  I had to turn it a few different ways before I really got the hang of it - but twisting the coils is a much easier and much less eye-watering way to remove unwanted hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some facial hair areas very quickly, without much pain or redness and my face was much smoother afterwards.  There were a few more coarse hairs that I ended up having to tackle on their own - but for a couple of minutes work - this device took care of all the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first few seconds - it is easy to get the hang of this design and I am very glad I got this.  I would definitely recommend this over regular tweezers and certainly over those stinky creams or waxes.</li>
            <li> Modern people need to avoid this. I am not even sure why this was made.&lt;br /&gt;You roll it on your face, then twist and turn to remove hair. It hurts and it grabs some hair but not others.&lt;br /&gt;Why would someone want to torture themselves and to make their faces look worse?</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and I love it.  It is a lot less painful than individually tweezing the hairs.  my skin appears red immediately after i use this product but then it clears up within 5 minutes.  I would absolutely recommend this product and I already have.</li>
            <li> Useless...this does not work...and it is not worth the $$$.  If you buy this you are as foolish as I was...bottom line 1) does not work at all 2) not worth the $$$ and 3) they are using the Tweezerman name as a come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget this product just clearly is useless...check out the reviews on YouTube to confirm the above info.</li>
            <li> Neat idea, item work sort of well, but I still needed to clean but stray hairs with regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> This item is like a torture device. I originally wanted to try it as A) My facial skin becomes irritated from waxing, and B) Trimming facial hair with cuticle scissors can be time consuming. And I figured that using this thing couldn&#x27;t be THAT bad. But it really is that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it most useful for removing very thin hair (&amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;) on the sides of my face, but removing my upper lip hair and hair under my chin was absurdly painful. And even though this device is not advertised to do so, I would like to point out that you should not even try removing other bodily hair with this; longer hair just gets tangled in the coils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, I guess it technically does remove most facial hair, but I had to go over these spots several times to get the majority of it, and overall it just wasn&#x27;t worth the agony of using this. I&#x27;ll be sticking to using cuticle scissors for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you insist on trying this anyway, save your receipt, because there is a good chance you will dislike it. And if you try this and find that it&#x27;s not so bad to use, well, more power to you then?</li>
            <li> My wife use them for hair face removing, she says it works well, but a little painful.</li>
            <li> Not in love.  This works okay on very fine hairs in the chin and lip area.  It will pull out eyelashes if used on eyebrows and there is no fine tuning with this.  It does not grab thicker/stiffer hairs (the kind you can actually see), nor does it grab short hairs.  So, I can only see myself using this to smooth the fine hair areas over the lip or between the eyebrows on an occasional basis.  I&#x27;m much happier with a good pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman is a unique tool for removing unwanted facial hair.  The process is very simple, just hold the Tweezerman against the skin where you want to remove hair and rotate the cylinders in the direction of the arrows.  Holding the cylinders in place remove the Tweezerman tool.  Very little practice is required to become efficient in removing unwanted hair. The eyebrow tweezers work like a charm for me.  Follow the directions, you will be surprised how well the facial hair remover tool works.  I am very happy with the Tweezerman hair remover tool and the eyebrow tweezers and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great product! I did not expect it to work so well. It is better than doing it at a beauty saloon, as it hurts less and achieves the same results!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. It takes a lot of hair out I guess but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t actually take it out at the root. I&#x27;m going to wait and see how it grows in but I&#x27;m not sure that it actually does what I was hoping it would do.</li>
            <li> Ok. I NEVER EVER leave reviews. But I am making an exception for this thing! OMG. It took me like a half hour to figure this thing out. At first I thought it didn&#x27;t work, that it&#x27;s going back, that Tweezerman had a big HUGE FAIL on their hands with this...but NO. I was over thinking it. I was trying to bend the little arm things in to make it work. You don&#x27;t need to bend the colored arms at all. Just lay it on your face and roll it as you twist the little things with the arrows on them. I use it with the arrows facing me and twist in. Instructions say have the arrows face out and twist out-but that wasn&#x27;t working for me...and it does all the work! You don&#x27;t even have to look in the mirror to use it-you can feel where it&#x27;s pulling the hair our. Honestly, this thing ROCKS. It&#x27;s better than the inexpensive bendy ones--you don&#x27;t have to do anything but twist in...BUY THIS and don&#x27;t overthink how to use it...</li>
            <li> Leider funktioniert das Haareentfernen damit überhaupt nicht damit. Jedes Epliliergerät ist besser.</li>
            <li> No it did not live up to my expectations and what it&#x27;s write up claims!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was me, or the product.  However, I had a hard time removing facial hair with this remover.  I will stick to regular tweezers and the one at a time method.</li>
            <li> For starters, let me set up these criteria:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool is not designed to be your solely used tool for hair removal. It will miss hairs that angle themselves just right so that it misses the rings and also ones that are too short for the tool to pick up. It is simply meant to remove the majority of hairs in the area you intend it to (rather painfully at that if you don&#x27;t make the right preparations) so that you can use a finer tool like actual tweezers to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I judge harshly for hair removal tools, as in even if I know it&#x27;s supposed to go as a 2 or 3-step process, I&#x27;ll nick off a star just because the tool wasn&#x27;t an all-in-one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with that in mind, it works exactly as said so long as you follow the steps shown. As goes with any procedure of plucking hairs, it may be painful, more so in areas where you are more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Not really much else to say, it just works.</li>
            <li> It was able to get very few hairs I don&#x27;t think it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Received this item today and tried it immediately. I am at the age where little whiskers [soft and not-so-soft] occasionally crop up on my chin and throat. I generally use tweezers and they always come back. I wanted to try this because it says it removes the root of the hair and this keeps it from growing back as quickly, and sometimes not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gadget is hard to use. It&#x27;s awkward to handle while twisting the coils and does not have a &#x27;flat side&#x27; as the instructions say to use. I tried it on various areas of my face, leg and even my friends face.  It removed no hair at all from either of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Looks like a mini medieval torture device but works very well to remove fine hairs around the chin and lip area.  Yes, you&#x27;re ripping the hair out by the roots, so its not painless, but thats no big deal if you&#x27;re used to waxing, even tweezing. I found that it got my fine blonde hairs really well.  There is a small learning curve as with any device. I think this is a good alternative to waxing. Btw, it comes with a mini plastic tweezerman tweezer, useless, not the same quality as the metal ones.  I would recommend this for removal of fine baby hairs on the chin and lip area.</li>
            <li> This is really a cool little grooming tool! I am not sure how well it would work if you had a lot of facial hair to contend with, but if you have finer hairs or moderate errant hairs, it is a lot more comfortable that waxing and the electric tweezers I have used, and quicker than plucking hair by hair. It&#x27;s really easy to use, although the instructions were a little vague. There is a very subtle shape to the &amp;#34;business&amp;#34; end of the device, and there are very small directional arrows on the metal sleeves above the colored handles. Depending upon which way you place the coils against your face, you will need to adjust the direction you turn the sleeves. It works both ways for me, but is more efficient when used the way they recommend, with the &amp;#34;flatter&amp;#34; side against your face. Somehow the coils manage to extract hairs a bit less painfully than when I pluck with a tweezers (I love my Rubis slant tweezer). For travelling very light, I would still bring just my tweezers, but this will be my go-to for keeping my chin and upper lip nude from now on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this device if you have a few stray hairs (punishment for a woman living long enough!).  It works fine for the occasional stray hair if it&#x27;s fairly coarse hair like a whisker.  Less effective for very fine facial hair.  I will say that it&#x27;s ouchy, but that&#x27;s to be expected, this is really just fancy tweezers.  I find it easier to use than tweezers, easier to hold on to with the arthritis in my hands.</li>
            <li> I found this more difficult to use than tweezers or wax. It was clunky and took a while to get the hang of. Twisting the handles while holding against the area to remove the hair, the stiff spring rolls and grabs the hairs and pulls them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it did grab the hairs but instead of removing them, it just pulled them and then let go before they were removed. This was probably more painful than just pulling them out one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume because my hairs are light and fine, it might be better for someone with more coarse hairs. So buyer beware, maybe this isn&#x27;t the right tool for you if you are like me.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to work  product did not  for me very well</li>
            <li> This does not work. I feel like I just wasted $20. Tweezerman tweezers are the best around but this coil contraption is worthless.</li>
            <li> Fantastic once I got the hang of it. I was originally dragging it downwards as it appeared to show on the instructions and wondered why it didn&#x27;t seem to catch any hairs but then I decided to stroke it upwards and it works wonderfully. I think many commenting that it doesn&#x27;t work are doing as I did originally. Great little gadget.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with this product.  It did not tweeze well at all.</li>
            <li> This product did a poor job of removing facial hair around lip and chin...not worth the money...I am returning it.  Disappointed as I love Tweezerman products normally and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap alternative to an epilator ($17 vs. $60)&lt;br /&gt;-pulls most hairs out&lt;br /&gt;- Convenient/light to carry around in purse, no noise (like an epliator would have)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Time consuming (whilst an epilator can go through fairly quickly, this is much more tedious)&lt;br /&gt;-Does not pull all hairs out, and brakes some (if I&#x27;m trying to get one particular hair out - it seems I can&#x27;t do it - but if I just go in to my peach fuzz, it does a pretty good job at ripping them out. It is definitely not as effective as my epilator.&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to reach areas (neck/bottom of jaw) are very difficult to work on, whereas an eplilator wouldn&#x27;t have an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as my epilator died. I&#x27;m happy with this as it was cheap. I would not pay more money for this - and I will probably buy an epilator later on.</li>
            <li> This item was bigger than I thought it would be. I thought it was small, the size of an average pair of tweezers. It is actually about 4 ½ inches long. It comes with a regular tweezer (slanted edge).&lt;br /&gt;The directions were a bit confusing. It says to “place the flatter side of the coil tip against the skin”. What is the flatter side? That makes no sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;It’s easy to figure out though. There is a bit of a bend where the coil meets the handles. Just make sure the convex part of the bend is facing you (and the concave part is facing away).&lt;br /&gt;This facial hair remover takes some practice to get it work efficiently, but it will work. It kind of reminds me of the Epilady (the coil type) I bought years ago. It also trapped the hairs and yanked them out. It hurt a lot at first but you get used to it and then it didn’t hurt as much. It was electric and it worked well, but it had large coils and was meant for longer hair, like on the legs. This product works on the same principle… trap the hair and yank it out. It’s coils are small and is meant for finer facial hair. It is not electric like the Epilady, but instead works by manual power, turning the knobs at each handle.&lt;br /&gt;So why not just tweeze, you ask? Well, this product removes several hairs at a time. It also removes the really fine, peach fuzz hair that is hard to see, and if you are a bit older and can’t see well up close any more, then this product is great. It does not rely on good close up vision like tweezers do.</li>
            <li> I am SO happy with this product.  As a lady of &amp;#34;a certain age&amp;#34;, I am plagued with the occasional chin whisker, and a mustache.  Slight, but a mustache, never the less.  And also, being of this age, I wear bifocals.  So, I take my tweezers and start to pluck those little suckers.  I turn on all the lights.  I get out the magnifying mirror.  I pinch and pull and fight to try and get ride of those pesky little hairs, with varying degrees of success..  SO....... I now have Tweezerman.  It took me a couple minutes to get the hang of using it.  You lay the coil against your skin and twist the little metal handles.  At first I had the urge to let the unit roll up my face, but I finally figured out to just hold the spring thing against my face where the hair is, and twist the handles while holding the spring thing in place,  Eureka!  The Tweezerman grabs the hair and poof, it&#x27;s pulled out.  Just like that.  I removed all the offending hair with just one pass of the unit. It works better than any pair of tweezers that I have ever tried.  Very very happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised about the poor reviews so far. I just bought it at walgreens and I absolutely love it. It works very well for chin and upper lip. I wonder if the reviewer tried another one that was better or didn&#x27;t know how it works? I saw there is another one here on amazon, but I can&#x27;t compare them since I only have this one. Maybe this one is more stiff?&lt;br /&gt;It took a few minutes to figure out how it works, but once you get the idea it works wonderful. The other one is a little cheaper, but this one comes with little tweezers and it&#x27;s from Tweezerman! I use Tweezerman  for years and the quality is outstanding. I only wish I bought this years ago. I kept seeing it at shopping channels but never believed it really works. I don&#x27;t have much hairs on my upper lip, mostly on the chin and those are hard and wiry. This just sounded too good to be true, but it really works and so much better and faster than using tweezers. With tweezers I keep missing hairs and usually don&#x27;t see it to I sit in the car and look in the rear mirror. I also love that I can use this while watching TV or reading. I don&#x27;t have much spare time and this is a great time saver.&lt;br /&gt;Initially there is a little stinging, but it&#x27;s not too bad. It pulls out several hairs, but I believe once I use it more often it will be also less stinging.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. You need to follow the directions on the package and twist the metal handles on the side to grab your hair. It stings when you pull but that&#x27;s expected of a tweezer. I like this Koch better than creams or waxes that can burn or harm your skin.  Other than price being in the high end for this product, I&#x27;m happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> This is a bit difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t seem well suited to clearing larger areas such as over the lip and between the brows. It is fine for eliminating individual hairs if they are long enough to be grasped by the coils, but it can be tricky targeting them properly.</li>
            <li> I, like many women have a few facial hairs that need removing. I mostly use Nair or a micro shaver if I&#x27;m in a hurry. So, when I was offered the Twezzerman Smooth Finish Facial Hair Remover I was really excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrives in a simple plastic package along with a bonus tweezer. Mine arrived with pink handles. The device is very well made and the included instructions are easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are easy, but it takes a little practice to turn the handle areas while moving it about the face. It catches hairs, but I found that I had to go over the spot repeatedly to remove hairs. I found it takes too much time. Pain wise, it&#x27;s bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works, but just not as good as other methods already on the market.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and watched the video on this to make sure I was doing it right, and gave it several tries, thinking maybe it just required practice. Ultimately, however, this just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do it correctly, the coil will snag the hairs - you can feel it catch - but it lacks the strength or the grip to actually pull them out. This is true for even more wiry hairs that should give it plenty to hold onto. I did not find it to be effective on finer hair either, and it just doesn&#x27;t grab very short hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks cute and seems like a good idea, but ultimately just doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to. Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> Nothing more than a stiff spring with handles. Difficult to use. I love Tweezerman tweezers, but this item is a dud in my opinion. I was very disappointed. Only gave it 2 stars because it came with tweezers. My recommendation would be to save your money.</li>
            <li> This is unit is extremely painful to use and only moderately effective.  Mostly tried it on various areas on and around the face and after two different sessions, would not use again.  2 stars because the tweezers that it comes with are quite nice.</li>
            <li> ... and I don&#x27;t mean the tweeze. I mean it pains me to give Tweezerman just one star. I love their products.&lt;br /&gt;This contraption however has really disappointed me. I&#x27;ve tried every day for the last 2 weeks to pull out a few stubborn chin hairs and just can&#x27;t get it to grab anything. I&#x27;ve had my hubby try it as well, both on him and me, and we fail. We are following instructions. We are going to see if there is perhaps a video available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their tweezers however, are the best and they will resharpen them free for life (except for postage to send them in). I own two pair and other of their products that I&#x27;m quite happy with. The tweezers they give you free with this contraption however, are not like those, or of the same quality. They&#x27;ve got a thicker head and seem clutzier. It took three attempts to pull out one hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if anything changes. For now, thumbs down!</li>
            <li> I would love it if it didn&#x27;t hurt.  It is a clever way to trick yourself into believing that facial hair will just disappear if you just twist the two bands above the handles.  But once you do that you are committed to twist further.  [A little ouch would be in order here]  Anytime you pull a hair from its roots you are going to feel something.  With the Tweezerman hair remover you do feel something, but the ouch is gone before you realize the hair was successfully removed.  I think it works well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work well for me. Especially in the areas with smaller or &amp;#34;shorter&amp;#34; hair.  It basically ripped out the hair but not from the root.  I&#x27;ve tried it several times over the past two weeks and honestly it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool is  simple to use, but not effective. To use you simply center the top of coil on the area where you want to remove hair.  Then you  rotate the knobs on the handles.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself at Christmas.  My most useful Christmas present this season, maybe ever.  I love it.  If you use it correctly is gets even those stubborn hairs and the ones you can&#x27;t even see. It takes a little practice, but once you feel the little &#x27;tug&amp;#34; from a hair you pull it away from your face, the root and all are removed. I believe some of the issues the other reviewer&#x27;s are having is how they are using it, it took some practice, but it works marvelously. I have arthritis and carpel tunnel and I can&#x27;t do it for a long time, but I can sit in front of the TV and use it without a mirror. My face is so much smoother now. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely does not work. Too bad because I am a big Tweezerman fan and have owned their tweezers for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> This item does not work AT ALL.  Cannot get it to even grab hair much less remove it.  It deserves zero stars.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product and would NOT recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  For me it has not really pulled hairs out but rather tears them off and makes them shorter.  This is ok for me.  It&#x27;s not the most comfortable but for covering a large area, it works great.  If you dont need to be fully hair free but are ok with shorter hairs, then it works great.</li>
            <li> painful and still on the fence as to how useful this is....</li>
            <li> This thing is alot bigger than you would think it was from the picture; its about 8 inches tall. I bought it for my wife to try out and she really didn&#x27;t even want to take it out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, it removes hair fine I guess, but I dont think any &amp;#34;easier&amp;#34; than other methods, so tbh I don&#x27;t know why you would want to use this instead of tweezers for just 1 or 2 hairs, or instead of a razor for an entire area. Just seems like a novelty gadget to me.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me at all. I asked my friends to try it and they did not have any better luck than I did. My advice...save your money and invest in a good pair of tweezers. Basically you just turn the side of the u shaped device and run it over the area where you have hair you would like to remove. I went back and forth and back and forth and no luck at removing hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised so many people don&#x27;t like this. I think it&#x27;s awesome! Sure, it&#x27;s not 100% effective every single time, but it consistently works. It pulls hair out at the root and is less painful and irritating than waxing, and FOR SURE less painful than plucking. This is a great way to keep my lip hair free without having to spend ridiculous amounts of money having it waxed or dyed with smelly treatments. It also came with a pair of tweezers- so win for me!</li>
            <li> This little device is amazing for removing unwanted hair - but beware it is painful!  The feeling is very similar to going to a treading salon and the results seem to be very much the same.  I used it on my upper lip and it removed the hair with ease.  But, it does cause redness and irritation.  If you are used to going to a treading salon and can handle the pain - this is a great alternative.  If you&#x27;re looking for something painless than look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The build is solid, and the instructions easy enough to follow, but about 80% of my attempts to use it failed to grab any hairs at all. I have a real need for a product that will make it easier to remove facial hair, but this didn&#x27;t work for me, no matter how long I stood there spinning the knobs. And when it did grab hair, it was really painful having it pull out multiple at a time. I&#x27;ll give it one more attempt, and if I figure out the trick, I&#x27;ll update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am a longtime Tweezerman fan. I&#x27;ve paid $25 for their high end tweezers to remove chin hair and eyebrow hair, so I am disappointed to have to give them a low rating.</li>
            <li> kinda hard to figure out, but is kinda fun, if you like that sorta thing! Also, I can&#x27;t see those fine hairs on my chinny chin chin, so this grabs them out!</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars as it is hit or miss.  It did pull some of the hairs from the root but others it will merely cut them off leaving a small bit of hair or fail  to get some hairs completely.  It did not hurt at all even under the nose but I have a high tolerance to pain.  My skin did get a little red but went away after 5 minutes.  A serious downside is that it will not grab stubby short regrowth which could be seen and felt. Not good if you have to go out every day. I personally would not apply makeup right after using this. It is also very easy to pull out fine hairs which you might not want pulled thus leading to thicker regrowth. It is faster than plucking and less painful than plucking or waxing larger areas such as the mustache.  Not sure if I will continue to use or only on certain areas where regrowth is not noticeable. I would not use if I only had a few stray hairs here and there. Just apply the U part of this tool with the Tweezerman name facing you and roll both silver tubes simultaneously in the direction of the arrows on the area you want hair removal rolling it against the skin.. You may have to go over it several times to get all the hair or you can try rolling the tubes in the opposite direction over the area which worked for me too. If the hair is still there, use tweezers to avoid irritation.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a scary torture device for me. I attempted it for about fifteen minutes before I broke down and threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the bravest souls must survive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am much better with waxing apparently!</li>
            <li> still haven&#x27;t figured it out yet?</li>
            <li> I got this because my old one broke. The one I had before wasn&#x27;t from tweezerman and it was only a dollar. I decided to buy a better one because my old one started rusting after a while. This is stainless steel so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the metal rusting. I really like the design of this, it&#x27;s easy to use after you get the hang of using it.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and have both thick and very fine facial hair. Typically, I get my face threaded and pluck in between my monthly threading session. I bought this item because it has hot pink (!) and made by a band I trust. At $20 I figured it would be a huge savings, if I didn&#x27;t have to do the threading anymore (as well as suffer the horrible breakouts that follow). But alas, the product doesn&#x27;t provide the coverage that I need. It does pull hair, even fine hair, but you have to work the area for a long time. I tried to remove the fine hair above my lip, but only a few hairs caught after twisting the handles several times in both directions. I know some hairs came out because I felt the painful yank, but when I surveyed the area, the majority of hair was still there. I didn&#x27;t see a noticable difference. Bummer. I so wanted this to work! But honsetly, you can remove more hair, more quickly, with plain tweezers.</li>
            <li> It works!  I tried it on those fine little hairs that you get on the side of your face after a certain age, and wow!  Quick, easy to use, and relatively painless.  It doesn&#x27;t work if the hairs are too short and I don&#x27;t recommend it for eyebrows.  Great for sides of face, chin, and upper lip.</li>
            <li> Hard time using, may be me, but won&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    </ol>
