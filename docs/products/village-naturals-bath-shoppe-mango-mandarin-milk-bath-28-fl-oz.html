            <li>Great for soaking in a nice hot bath.</li>
            <li>This is a great product - it&#x27;s a lot of bubble bath for right around 5 dollars, so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li>It is not over powering and smells much more orange than lime.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it if you love citrus smelling stuff.</li>
            <li>I am 150% satisfied with this purchase and will buy more when I run out.  </li>
            <li>I love taking bubble baths.</li>
            <li>One bottle makes 5 or 6 lovely bubbley baths.  </li>
            <li>The smell is more citrus or mandarin.</li>
            <li>Does&#x27;t have a strong smell...</li>
            <li>(I get more if I use my body wash in my bath water) and even though the scents are nice, they don&#x27;t seem to linger on the skin nor do they leave my skin feeling soft and silky</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth - no itching or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap...</li>
            <li>The mango smell is fantastic, and not overpowering as I don&#x27;t like smelly soaps/washes/candles.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time buying foaming milk - I use it for soaking my feet and taking baths, It smells wonderful much nicer than the wild orchid that I also brought.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with all Village Natural products that I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Just great and the 28 oz bottle lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li>The scents are nice (I got white tea/jasmine and mango), but the bubbles are just ok</li>
            <li>The price is good too, especially for the amount you receive.</li>
            <li>Bubbles last a good 30+ minutes for me.  </li>
            <li>Received the item quickly..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased numerous Village Naturals Bath Shoppe of many different variety, and this is hands down the best one yet.</li>
            <li>This defintely worked, and it does smell nice, but bottom line, I tried a similar product from Avon, much cheaper</li>
            <li>Does not dry out skin and love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>As&lt;br /&gt;it was very reasonable</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s foam all over the tub; you can actually use very little making it an excellent buy and product.</li>
            <li>The bubbles last about 20 minutes then start to disappear..better than most bubble bath soaps.</li>
            <li>This has a pretty creamy citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>She has tried different fragrances likes most of them.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>I love bubble bath and find that many &#x27;fancy&#x27; ones don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>I expected this bubble bath to be more luxurious.</li>
            <li>I will buy more in the future, especially if Amazon offers it as part of the free shipping over $25 deal.</li>
            <li>really like how silky my skin felt while using this product though.  </li>
            <li>too much money for what you get.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s way too much of the citrus.  </li>
            <li>It is very bubbly and you do not need to use a lot for a bubble bath.</li>
            <li>An hour after you run your bath if you stay in that long and there are still bubbles galore and the bonus is your skin actually feels silky smooth!!</li>
            <li>It makes decent bubbles, though.  </li>
            <li>This made the bath water very soft, I could feel the moisturizer without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a bubble/milk bath that made my skin feel SO soft!  </li>
            <li>Recently I have had a very hard&lt;br /&gt;time</li>
            <li>if you can get your hands on any of the Village natural bath soap..</li>
            <li>The smell was just okay for me, but really it&#x27;s not a strong enough smell that you even notice it in the bath.  </li>
            <li>Since she has not complained, I can only assume that she likes it</li>
            <li>The scent is ok, not great, and doesn&#x27;t last at all.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I expected this bubble bath to be more luxurious. The scents are nice (I got white tea/jasmine and mango), but the bubbles are just ok (I get more if I use my body wash in my bath water) and even though the scents are nice, they don&#x27;t seem to linger on the skin nor do they leave my skin feeling soft and silky like I was hoping. Won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
            <li> This is the best bubble bath ever, in whatever scent you prefer. I personally like the Mango Mandarin. An hour after you run your bath if you stay in that long and there are still bubbles galore and the bonus is your skin actually feels silky smooth!! Two thumbs waay up!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved bath foam and bubbles iin my tub. Recently I have had a very hard&lt;br /&gt;time finding any within my price range. The&lt;br /&gt;ones I have tried were very expensive and&lt;br /&gt;had almost no foam and no oil. I found out&lt;br /&gt;about this product in my grocery store. As&lt;br /&gt;it was very reasonable I thought I would try it. It is fantastic. There&#x27;s foam all over the tub; you can actually use very little making it an excellent buy and product. If I could i would give it 100 stars.</li>
            <li> This smells good and makes lots of bubbles if you pour for about five seconds under the faucet! The bubbles last about 20 minutes then start to disappear..better than most bubble bath soaps.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying foaming milk - I use it for soaking my feet and taking baths, It smells wonderful much nicer than the wild orchid that I also brought.

            <li> Received the item quickly..this is a good one but not the best. Creats lot of foam but does not smell that great.</li>
            <li> This bubble bath was a little disappointing to me.  You have to use a lot to make enough bubbles (it does say on the directions to pour a \\&quot;generous\\&quot; amount) and they don&#x27;t last all that long.  The smell was just okay for me, but really it&#x27;s not a strong enough smell that you even notice it in the bath.  I did really like how silky my skin felt while using this product though.  Doesn&#x27;t appear to be a product that will dry out my skin.  I like it enough that I will finish using this bottle, but I will probably opt for something different the next time I buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased numerous Village Naturals Bath Shoppe of many different variety, and this is hands down the best one yet. Kind of disappointed that they increased the price of it, but whatever I suppose. Good product...</li>
            <li> This is a great product - it&#x27;s a lot of bubble bath for right around 5 dollars, so it lasts a while. It smells good, makes lots of bubbles and it&#x27;s cheap...which are my three bubble bath criteria points. I&#x27;ll order it again!</li>
            <li> Since she has not complained, I can only assume that she likes it, I haven&#x27;t heard anything from her.</li>
            <li> It does not say anywhere if your products are tested on animals, or not.&lt;br /&gt;Usually if not that company writes this stuff on label.&lt;br /&gt;Does this company test on animals? Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love bubble bath and find that many &#x27;fancy&#x27; ones don&#x27;t last long.  Bubbles last a good 30+ minutes for me.  The mango smell is fantastic, and not overpowering as I don&#x27;t like smelly soaps/washes/candles.  This made the bath water very soft, I could feel the moisturizer without being greasy.  I am 150% satisfied with this purchase and will buy more when I run out.  A great price too.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m still wondering what sort of mammal a Mango Mandarin is, and where its teats are located.  My cat want&#x27;s to know, too.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with all Village Natural products that I have purchased. This is a great bath item, smells really nice. I use it in the shower too.</li>
            <li> if you can get your hands on any of the Village natural bath soap..OMG it is the best stuff you will ever ever use.</li>
            <li> I love taking bubble baths. I like the way it foams up . I would buy this product again. It smells good too.</li>
            <li> This defintely worked, and it does smell nice, but bottom line, I tried a similar product from Avon, much cheaper and it worked just as well.</li>
            <li> Just want to tell everyone to order some of this Village Naturals White Tea Milk Bath.  This is the greatest and I searched everywhere to find it after the place I bought it quit having any and the online place where I found it also has an out of stock notice.  On E-Bay, sellers wanted about twice the $ for this.  I kept searching and to my delight found it here on Amazon.  It is the best ever!!!  The scent is mild and very nice.  It makes lots of bubbles and they last until you get out of the tub.  No bathtub ring and moisturizes too. Just great and the 28 oz bottle lasts a long time!  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  I like Jasmine best; but the Mango Mandarin is also nice. Does&#x27;t have a strong smell...just a good one for relaxation.</li>
            <li> too much money for what you get.  Didn&#x27;t realize the bottle was so small and could have got this at Walmart for 1/2 the price</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. We have ordered these for over a year. She has tried different fragrances likes most of them.&lt;br /&gt;She really likes the lavender the best and milk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a bubble/milk bath that made my skin feel SO soft!  One bottle makes 5 or 6 lovely bubbley baths.  I &#x27;like&#x27; alot of bubbles.  The only thing that I&#x27;d like improved is the scent.  There&#x27;s way too much of the citrus.  5 stars if it was more Mango!  Over all, a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This works great as a shower gel or bubble bath. It is very bubbly and you do not need to use a lot for a bubble bath. The smell is more citrus or mandarin. My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t smell like mangos.</li>
            <li> Great for soaking in a nice hot bath. Does not dry out skin and love the fragrance. Only problem is that it is hard to find in stores locally</li>
            <li> I love this milk bath, it smells great and is relaxing to soak in the bath tub with.  Great buy</li>
            <li> The scent is ok, not great, and doesn&#x27;t last at all.  Also, my bottle may have been defected because it was really hard to close.  It makes decent bubbles, though.  I would probably try a different scent next time.</li>
