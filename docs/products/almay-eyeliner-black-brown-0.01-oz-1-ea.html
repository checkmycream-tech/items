            <li> Ever since I had contracted pink eye a couple years ago, my eyes for some reason became sensitive after that to any eye makeup and would be red and irritated a little bit from using them, no matter what brand.</li>

            <li> I typically have to wear primer to get anything to stick to my eyelid for longer than an hour, but this eyeliner stayed on for hours without it.</li>
            <li> The color was mix of brown and black</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it was not available in black</li>
            <li> and I tried it, but it still smudged a little bit until two days ago.</li>

            <li> and it does not smear after a few hours.</li>
            <li> It does last all day, and I do not have raccoon and tired looking eyes.  </li>
            <li> I would also like to find mascara in dark brown or brown black which is also hard to find</li>

            <li> I have always liked and used this product because of sensitive skin.  But it has been hard to find.  I would also like to find mascara in dark brown or brown black which is also hard to find</li>
            <li> I purchased for the first time this type of Almay Eyeliner a few months ago and when it came to be consumed I again went to purchase this Eyeliner becuase I found it to be quite reliable and handy, no sharpening the point no mess and so on.</li>
            <li> It really does stay on!!!!! I have always had trouble finding eye  liner that doesnt smear. But this one is a different story. It stays on goes on smooth and the  color is great</li>
            <li> Stayed on in the heat for 10 hours.</li>
            <li> This is the best waterproof liner I have ever tried.  It goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> This product is somewhat easy to apply, although it might get dry sometimes. I bought it as a replacement to an eye pencil that worked wonders because mine broke, and they don&#x27;t sell it in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a dark brown, but you can&#x27;t really tell the difference from black unless you really want to (in a good way). It does last through the day if you don&#x27;t touch your eye or fidget or sweat or anything like that, but that being said, it does smudge. I have yet to find a truly good eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t smudge, but this is worse than some I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely good enough for me to use while I wait for my other product to arrive, but I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I put eyeliner below my eyes and this doesn&#x27;t run. It will on very rare occasion and that could even be from me subconsciously touching my eyes.</li>
            <li> In my experience, the liner is too dry.  When I try to draw a dark line, it breaks off every time.</li>
            <li> my fav eyeliner. &#x27;nuff said</li>
            <li> Only need one application per day, that is if I remember not to touch my eyes, which I frequently do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black brown is a lovely colour. It is neutral enough to use with any other colors you are using.</li>
            <li> Wow, it goes on like a crayon!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna try another long lasting product.</li>
            <li> My favorite.  Getting hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It does stay on much better than others I have tried. It is hypoallergenic which is good for me because I rub my eyes a lot. Mostly by the end of the day, the liner on my bottom lashes is gone. Still think it&#x27;s very good and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Perfect and stays on.</li>
            <li> Not as long lasting as claims to be.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. Easy to apply and it does not smear after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I originally left 5 star feedback. This product does not smudge as badly as others.on my eyes. The seller sent very quiclkly, superb service. Would buy again because I also have NO burning as with other products.</li>
            <li> I spent all summer trying to find a eye liner that did not make me look like a raccoon! I tried Mac, Ester Lauder, Clinique, Lancôme, etc..... All the expensive brands and none of them did what I wanted. Then I found this product, and decided to start trying the cheaper liners. Almay was the  firstliner that I purchase at Walmart and it worked perfect. It lasted almost 16 hours and never smudged. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Under $6 AND IT&#x27;S A GREAT EYE LINER THAT LAST AND DOESN&#x27;T SMUDGE. I will be using this liner and throwing all the rest away.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner for the price! Doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear off even after a tough workout at the gym. It lasts all day long and into the evening without a second application.</li>
            <li> I typically have to wear primer to get anything to stick to my eyelid for longer than an hour, but this eyeliner stayed on for hours without it. Actually, I didn&#x27;t realize it was water resistant until I tried washing it off. I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of that since I was looking for an eyeliner with zero waterproof ingredients - I like to wash my face and get it over with quick. But big points for staying on all day like it said it would!</li>
            <li> shipping was very quick, love the color and staying power of this eyeliner!  just what i needed, bought this because i am switching from black to brown, love it!</li>
            <li> I am so please with this eyeliner.  It stays on a long time and does not smudge or run.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, so far it&#x27;s the best. I&#x27;ve been using Mac for 4 years because all the eyeliner I tried smudged. So someone recommended me the Mac and I tried it, but it still smudged a little bit until two days ago. I saw this Almay eyeliner and I was scared to try it so I bought it and tried it in the morning and I was surprised that it really worked! No smudge! It lasted until late at night when I took off all my make up. Thank u Almay! Plus it&#x27;s not expensive like Mac, which costs $20. Thank u again. 👍</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on easily and does not smudge.  I like it better than any I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this. Typically eyeliners wear off easily on me, but this one last me a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Expensive and hard to apply. Do not waste your hard earn money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply because you have to rub and rub it to get a good, dark line. My eyelids hurt after that! It looks perfectly nice once you can get a good coat on, and it lasts all day. I love the little sharpener, and it does apply better after you use the sharpener. But you&#x27;d have to use the sharpener every day, losing a lot of the product that way. Also, with all that applying, the pencil twists back down. So I&#x27;m constantly twisting it back up and trying to figure out how to keep it from twisting back in while I&#x27;m using it. I wont buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it was not available in black</li>
            <li> runs a little but goes on nice</li>
            <li> The color was mix of brown and black</li>
            <li> I have purchased it before!!</li>
            <li> I would have given it five stars, but it was lighter than I expected. This is really brown, not at all black.</li>
            <li> No different than any you buy in the drug store.</li>
            <li> Have been using this pencil for years now and will continue as long as Almay has it available.  It really stays put which I appreciate as I tear a lot and sometimes rub my eyes.</li>
            <li> As a teenager, I usually wear makeup everyday. Out of all the brands of eyeliner I used, this one is my favorite. I use black and it glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t smudge. However, you would have to reapply during the day. I use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Ever since I had contracted pink eye a couple years ago, my eyes for some reason became sensitive after that to any eye makeup and would be red and irritated a little bit from using them, no matter what brand. I switched to Almay and it&#x27;s amazing, no irritation whatsoever. Also it stays on very well for a long time.</li>
            <li> I used this product one time before it broke off out of the pen/stick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years!  It&#x27;s very easy to use and it stays on all day!  No sharpener required!</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner. Goes on smoothly. Like it alot</li>
            <li> I am bad about rubbing my eyes, this eye pencil works the best on my water line. If you use it on your upper lid it does not last as long but does a great job of lading on the water line.</li>
            <li> Almay delivers!  It does last all day, and I do not have raccoon and tired looking eyes.  I am very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. Goes on easily and lasts all day; however, the tip is very fragile and keeps breaking off.</li>
            <li> I love almay products. This is another good one. Lasts all day and washes off easily. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smooth and rich while applying it to the eyelid. Stays on for 16 hours and did not smear. Will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have tried every eye makeup from drugstore to department store brands and Almay is the only one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand that is selling the black/brown color.  I don&#x27;t understand why the other brands are going to all these other colors.</li>
