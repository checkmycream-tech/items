            <li>I&#x27;m definitely not happy that I paid this much for sunscreen that&#x27;s not any more quality than the $2 bottles at the store.</li>
            <li>Though it smells better than the average sunscreen, this product is greasier than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The few fish we have left on the planet should probably go as chemical free as possible.</li>
            <li>Other than that I really like it.</li>

            <li> I love this easy application of nice smelling coconut oil that lasts the entire day and compliments are given as to the nice smelling spray.  I will continue to use and share this product for years to come; so please never discontinue the product or change it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I love the smell and the way it makes my skin so soft. It also helps darken your tan. It is surprisingly water resistant.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting, non-greasy, look elsewhere. Though it smells better than the average sunscreen, this product is greasier than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m definitely not happy that I paid this much for sunscreen that&#x27;s not any more quality than the $2 bottles at the store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, it smells good, it&#x27;s lightweight and very easy to use. I walk a lot during the course of the day and I find it easy to spritz it while on the go.</li>
            <li> Love this for under foundation it makes the skin glow.  It is oily but absorbs nicely and keeps a little shine</li>
            <li> Loved this oil. 15 spf is very low but smelled great and went on well</li>
            <li> This spray is greasy when you spray it on so do it outside on the grass! Other than that I really like it. The smell is wonderful and I have not been sunburned since I started using it. I have also not had any adverse skin reactions which is a plus for me since I sometimes get a rash with other sunscreen products.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite sunscreen. Smells great, protects fantastically, makes your skin look and feel gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s very light and my skin absorbs it well. I haven&#x27;t gotten burned using it, so it&#x27;s doing its job. I lost mine when I was on vacation, but I&#x27;ll be ordering more next summer.</li>
            <li> Smells INCREDIBLE!!! Will def buy again, tempting to wear as like a perfume (lol, no, I do not do that...but it IS tempting)</li>
            <li> The description does not tell you that it contains octocrylene.  You are led to believe it is a safe natural product.  I think think the active ingredients should be listed on the Amazon description, not just what the product doesn&#x27;t contain.  From the Truth in Aging website:&lt;br /&gt;Although there is evidence that octocrylene is responsible for reproductive toxicity, the trials used doses far higher than would be used in cosmetics.Another reason to reconsider octocrylene, is that it has been found in fish. According to a Swiss study, it is quick to biodegrade and then bioaccumulate. The few fish we have left on the planet should probably go as chemical free as possible.</li>
            <li> I use Alba Tanning Oil every time i enter the beach, it is great. Gives me beautiful and fast tan! It is also convenient to carry and has nice smell.</li>
            <li> Too greasy for a dry oil sunscreen</li>
            <li> Love this suntan  sunscreen oil spray. Smells tropical and floral.. Non greasy..love that it is all natural. No bad chemicals. Will buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, smells good, works well, gives your skin a slight sheen, but not that greased up body builder look. Not greasey feeling either. Love the dry oil concept. I like to get some sun exposure daily, but I have very fair skin after not spending much time in the sun for a few years &amp; this keeps me from getting burned when hanging out the yard or park.... Wonderful. Don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d use this (or any sunscreen, no matter the spf or type, without an umbrella) if I was going to spend a day at the beach though.</li>
            <li> very strong smell (not unpleasant).&lt;br /&gt;goes on nicely, and washes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend during the time when bees are dormant.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  The light coconut fragrance is very pleasant.  It is non-greasy unless you apply too much at one time.  The pump spray is evenly dispersed which is also a plus.  Retail stores frequently run out of supply due to its popularity so I buy it online.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and it goes a long way.  I put it on and went out in the boat for the day and didn&#x27;t get burned at all.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 would be because it ended up in my eyes ever though I was very careful to keep it away when putting it on.  I guess that would be the disadvantages of oil instead of lotion.  It did work very well and smells great!</li>
