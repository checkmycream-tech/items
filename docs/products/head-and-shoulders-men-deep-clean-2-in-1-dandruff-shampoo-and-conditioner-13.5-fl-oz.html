            <li>He has used it everyday and his scalp looks so much better.</li>
            <li>What I truly enjoy is that Head &amp; Shoulders now has different scents and conditioners, and not just the blue one.</li>
            <li>very fast sh Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>This exact shampoo used to smell awesome but now smells TERRIBLE.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a big relief since I have that type of luck normally.</li>
            <li>and now I barely find any.</li>
            <li>I also started taking cold showers which is good for not drying out your skin, so that may be a factor as well.</li>

            <li> I just needed Dandruff shampoo, not crazy about smell, but I careless.</li>
            <li> It is what it is, no real surprise here.</li>
            <li> The Michigan winters are rough on my scalp, and the store brands just do not compare.  </li>
            <li> in going to try one of the other ones</li>
            <li> Dermatologists across the country are probably turning in their Maserati because they are getting less patients referred for their Dandruff issue.</li>
            <li> Not cheap but works.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick hair and without using an occasional dandruf or teatree shampoo I&#x27;ll start to develop flakes, or at least some itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> It sadly didn&#x27;t have a manly enough scent to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo being like this in the past.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this and no more wiping dandruff off his shirts</li>
            <li> I hate that Heads and Shoulders no longer comes in the solid blue container.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe the scent, but I like it.</li>
            <li> no more dandruff!</li>
            <li> Yes, I can buy a knock off at the dollar store, but it is always poor, thin quality and dries out the hair like.  </li>
            <li> No need for those fancy and expensive dandruff control shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Head and Shoulders for my son for a while, as he suffers from eczema/ psoriasis on his scalp.</li>
            <li> No way to go wrong!  </li>
            <li> It made me sick to my stomach and it gave me a headache..</li>
            <li> The mix of citrus and mint gives this shampoo a ghastly, almost evil smell.</li>

            <li> One of the best smelling shampoos ever for those that suffer from dandruff and it really works..The smell is just wonderful . I purchased like three of these.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders. Enough said. You get what you pay for and this works well.</li>
            <li> Nobody likes dandruff.  I have a lot of thick hair and without using an occasional dandruf or teatree shampoo I&#x27;ll start to develop flakes, or at least some itchy scalp.  I like the 2 in 1 variety of this shampoo for the ease, but I might prefer to use the shampoo only version, and use a quality conditioner to follow up.</li>
            <li> My hubby really likes the way this shampoo controls his dandruff without the strong scent of sulphur.  He has used it everyday and his scalp looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Head and Shoulders for my son for a while, as he suffers from eczema/ psoriasis on his scalp. This is the very first time I purchased Head and Shoulders MEN. I was looking forward to more of a manly scent...possibly similar to Axe products. It sadly didn&#x27;t have a manly enough scent to it. It does clean as advertised though.</li>
            <li> Works well and the price was low.</li>
            <li> great for my boys the 2 in 1 takes out a step in staying clean. The deep clean, does it&#x27;s job and it smells great.</li>
            <li> It either doesn&#x27;t foam up much, or the suds disappear really quickly.  I don&#x27;t recall Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo being like this in the past.</li>
            <li> Scratching my head about how good this is. Oh wait I&#x27;m not scratching my head anymore, because this stuff works</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this in the stores because my boyfriend loved using this specific type.  However, our local store stopped selling it so when he was almost out I took to my favorite online store.... Amazon!  I was so thrilled to see they have this and also that there was a coupon too!  Who doesn&#x27;t like to save money right?  Even more now because one day a week I volunteer in a kitchen and at the end of the day I just want the smell of the kitchen out of my hair and scalp.  It says deep clean, does the trick, PLUS has a great smell!!  Just wished they didn&#x27;t label it for men lol.... just don&#x27;t tell my boyfriend.  Thinking I may just have to utilize the subscribe and save option on this one!</li>
            <li> My husband love this shampoo and we got it way cheaper than a generic brand</li>
            <li> Smells really good and works well, my guy loves it.</li>
            <li> My son loves this shampoo. And it it has a nice fragrance for a man!</li>

            <li> Husband loves, it&#x27;s a staple in our home.</li>
            <li> My husband loves head and shoulders shampoo. It&#x27;s all he will use. There was a coupon available so I picked this one up for cheap. He liked the formula. It smelled great as always. His hair looked soft and clean after use.</li>
            <li> Bottle was smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Bought this for a family member - They were very pleased with it! Cleaned hair and scalp well - and they loved that it was 2-in-1!</li>
            <li> good vale for the price</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I know it is for men and I bought it for the men in the family but I just want to steal it because I love its scent. This is a great product and it works good .</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well for me. I used to have some dandruff and now I barely find any. I also started taking cold showers which is good for not drying out your skin, so that may be a factor as well. The citrus and mint smell is good. Having 2-in-1 is useful and it&#x27;s not expensive (got it at $4.97) at all, which is good especially since I&#x27;m a college student. My hair is good also. I used to use some Pantene Pro-V 2-in-1 Classic that my mom bought and I&#x27;d say this works about just as well.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend, is hair smells great (which was never a problem) but also no more dandruff! Thank u jesus</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe the scent, but I like it. It leaves my hair feeling clean and soft and my scalp soothed. Ahhhhhhhhh!</li>
            <li> Very effective incuring mild dandruff problem gave four stars just because the conditioner doesnt work leaves the hair dry.</li>
            <li> No need for those fancy and expensive dandruff control shampoos and conditioners.  This one works great and my husband is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend absolutely loves this product. great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he told me he really loves it. The smell is great and everything else about it!</li>
            <li> I hate that Heads and Shoulders no longer comes in the solid blue container.  I don&#x27;t care for the scent of this particular type of the product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, we love head and shoulders, smells great!</li>
            <li> this one worked ok but not as good as some of the other ones... in going to try one of the other ones but i may come back to this one...</li>
            <li> This is not as good as the refresh H&amp;amp;S, but in is decent. I would say its worth a try . You may just like it.</li>
            <li> Good smelling shampoo and helps with dandruff.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband and son. Both swear by head and shoulders! No store brands for them! They love this product, even the smell they were impressed with! They both expressed that their hair felt cleaner then ever. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff and flakes gone in days after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scalp feels clean and good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair looks good and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling oily, not that clean-conditioned feeling.  Once my hair dries it&#x27;s ok.  I have used Head and Shoulders for years and I have no idea why this &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is different.  I won&#x27;t buy it again but I expect to finish my bottle, it smells good.</li>
            <li> Not the best smell, it&#x27;s ok though.</li>
            <li> Whatever makes this extra strength has caused an allergic reaction in my husband. Even just in the same room with it he sneezes.</li>
            <li> Ordered this conditioner as a subscribe and save item with a coupon.  Was a great value at the price!  Since only my husband uses this brand in our house, I tend to never know when he is out, so subscribe and save is great and makes me look like a rock star when he never runs out.  .  This brand never disappoints.  Yes, I can buy a knock off at the dollar store, but it is always poor, thin quality and dries out the hair like.  Head and shoulders does not!  This bottle lasts longer since he doesn&#x27;t need to use as much to be effective.  Smells great and does not leave a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging wise, when I receives the item, it was individually sealed in it&#x27;s own bag so that in the event that there was leakage (there was not), it would not get the other items in the package wet.  That&#x27;s a big relief since I have that type of luck normally.</li>
            <li> Only hair product my boyfriend uses!</li>
            <li> H&amp;S changed their formula for this shampoo.  This exact shampoo used to smell awesome but now smells TERRIBLE.  The new packaging says &amp;#34;New Fresh Scent Technology&amp;#34; on the top right, so that must be the change.  Now it smells like cedar chips, which is not what I want my head to smell like.  It seems all their &amp;#34;Men&amp;#34; versions have this &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; now.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to believe this but I no longer have a dandruff issue. It&#x27;s quite possible that this item helped me to get to this point in my life. Dermatologists across the country are probably turning in their Maserati because they are getting less patients referred for their Dandruff issue. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. He loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo...you wash your hair with it. What else can i say</li>
            <li> What can I say?  Still great! After all these years!</li>
            <li> A great dandruff shampoo With a great price to boot. definitely  recommend it. very fast sh Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells good, helps stop the itchy dry scalp</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product and we use it often</li>
            <li> One star b/c the shampoo busted open in route and was 1/2 leaked over everything else in the package.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t expecting such a large bottle to arrive but it smell s great and the price i paid was well worth it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the first anti dandruff shampoo that has kept me dandruff free for one month when used daily in my shower.&lt;br /&gt;The built in conditioner keeps my hair light and manageable while the mint in it provides a very refreshing and tingly feeling on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I like the fact that this shampoo does not have a medicine-y smell and has a fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say that the claims that this shampoo will leave your hair and scalp healthier are accurate.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these. I used it once and threw both bottles away. The mix of citrus and mint gives this shampoo a ghastly, almost evil smell. It made me sick to my stomach and it gave me a headache.. Both. My recommendation would be to avoid this product.</li>
            <li> It is what it is, no real surprise here.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my son. We are loyal to H&amp;S</li>
            <li> Feels good on the scalp, and it did very well with my head.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I know it is for men and I bought it for the men in the family but I just want to steal it because I love its scent. This is a great product and it works ++</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo.It worked great and seen instant results</li>
            <li> My son loves this shampoo so I have it on subscribe and save. Not cheap but works.</li>
            <li> No way to go wrong!  Thank you Amazon for having wonderful products available through subscriptions!</li>
            <li> I have been using head and shoulders since I was in middle school.  The Michigan winters are rough on my scalp, and the store brands just do not compare.  What I truly enjoy is that Head &amp; Shoulders now has different scents and conditioners, and not just the blue one.</li>
