            <li>and if you do, your hair will look fresh, smooth, and glossy.</li>
            <li>I have used Moroccan oil, but for those whose hair it weights down too much, this is the best.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s super runny or anything.</li>
            <li>This product helped my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li>Sinks right in and my skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li>The individual oils for this line have had some pretty good Web buzz.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t quite sure if my fine, color treated hair could handle a oil prior to blowdrying but this made me a believer.</li>
            <li>So, ladies, take that for what it is worth.</li>

            <li>I started using Mythic Oil (Colour Glow) back in September, and I have to say I love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even said I smelled really good when he got a whiff hours after my hair was dried and styled.</li>
            <li>The ones that have been pretty good have weighted down my hair too much and/or made it look oily.  </li>
            <li>Love it, and will continue to use it as long as they make it!</li>
            <li>No need to use a lot of it, but I wish it could hydrate a little more specially the top layer of my hair that is dryer due to sun/wind exposure.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and color really pops.  </li>
            <li>It brings out the real color of your hair coloring.</li>
            <li>And great to condition blown dried and flat ironed hair.</li>
            <li>using Sojourn detangler and serum; now, I only use Mythic Oil to calm, detangle, relax my frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>Before using this, I had split ends and was due for a trim... being myself and refusing to get it cut, i tried this mythic oil and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t weight it down instead it restored the shine and made it more manageable and hold volume.</li>
            <li>with more sheen but didn&#x27;t feel weighed down or oily.</li>
            <li>highly recommend trying this out.</li>
            <li>highly recommend trying this out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for processed hair as it helps with the dryness.</li>
            <li>Hair feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The oil looks clear when you pump it into your hand.</li>
            <li>applied the two pumps into the palm of my hand, rubbed together to emulsify and started applying to the lengths of damp, just washed and conditioned hair, steering clear of my roots.</li>
            <li>Hair was so soft and it was not heavy</li>
            <li>Mystic oil make it so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This stuff is a miracle for my hair which is naturally curly and beyond frizzy.</li>
            <li>The Mythic Oil provides a soft, controlled finish, with no greasy look.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I recommend Mythic Oil for soft, manageable hair.</li>
            <li>Gotta use very sparingly, (this bottle will last me forever!)</li>
            <li>I have lots of thin, unruly, semi-curly hair and have never really found a product that was very effective in controlling it.  </li>
            <li>Some oils I&#x27;ve used dry out my hair, but this really moisturizes without making my hair look greasy!</li>
            <li>Two pumps seemed like such a small amount, but I resisted the urge to use more.</li>
            <li>like the fact the bottle is clear so you can actually see the oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been battling haven&#x27;t seen much improvement with other products until this....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thinner but not so much</li>

            <li> In addition to using this on my hair, I do use it all over my body as a moisturizer. Sinks right in and my skin feels and looks great. A wonderful product</li>
            <li> Hair was so soft and it was not heavy</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; quick shipping.</li>

            <li> I recommend this product to anyone that has dry hair. I have thin, long, blonde hair. This product didn&#x27;t weight it down instead it restored the shine and made it more manageable and hold volume.</li>
            <li> My cousin is celebrity hairstylist Andy Cruz, at the Sally Hershberger Salon in L.A., he recommended it to me and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s not a styling serum, it&#x27;s light so it gives your hair the perfect shine and strength without making it sticky or too oily.</li>
            <li> I did not see the shine in my hair. I had to use another product to archive the results that this product was supposed to deliver.</li>
            <li> It was great that you carried these items.  Just what i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.&lt;br /&gt;Denise</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely incredible. I bought the Colour Glow version since I dye my hair every few months and the dryness/split ends I&#x27;ve been battling haven&#x27;t seen much improvement with other products until this....this glorious miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, totally expensive, but totally worth it IMO. Granted, I took a chance based in the positive reviews I&#x27;ve read on so many blogs, and I&#x27;m glad I did since, for me, it lives up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is just over 4 oz. Considering how little you need the bottle should last quite awhile, further justifying the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact the bottle is clear so you can actually see the oil. The bottle is a gold color with a really nice capped pump. I wish the pump locked off and on in case the cap goes missing and I want to take it with me somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviews, I used 2 pumps for my medium length A-line that hits my shoulders in the back and hits an inch below my collar bone in the front. The oil looks clear when you pump it into your hand. The consistency isn&#x27;t as thick as, say, Agadir. It&#x27;s a little thinner but not so much that it&#x27;s super runny or anything. It actually is a really nice consistency and applies very easily without leaving your hands tacky or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing....like roses mixed with jasmine or lavender. I&#x27;m usually not a fan of florals, but this doesn&#x27;t smell overwhelmingly or sickeningly floral. It&#x27;s just a really nice scent that makes your hair smell fantastic. My boyfriend even said I smelled really good when he got a whiff hours after my hair was dried and styled. He doesn&#x27;t like florals either, so that was definitely a pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the two pumps into the palm of my hand, rubbed together to emulsify and started applying to the lengths of damp, just washed and conditioned hair, steering clear of my roots. Two pumps seemed like such a small amount, but I resisted the urge to use more. My hair felt less tangly, a little softer with more sheen but didn&#x27;t feel weighed down or oily. I let my hair air dry for about 20 mins so it&#x27;s not soaking wet when I blow dry. As soon as I started blow drying I could see a huge difference in the smoothness, the shine, and softness of my hair. It made my hair ridiculously soft and shiny, but incredibly light with body. My ends felt completely nourished and smooth. I haven&#x27;t been able to stop running my fingers through my hair lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after sleeping, my hair is still shiny, smooth, and smells fresh. I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of other oils I&#x27;ve tried tend to make my hair kinda stringy or lank after sleeping and my ends don&#x27;t retain any smoothness...they go back to feeling kinky and dry while the length feels a bit heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this out. It&#x27;s an amazing product and worth every cent I paid.fter with more sheen but didn&#x27;t feel weighed down or oily.

            <li> Love, this product!  Even use it on my dogs hair!</li>
            <li> I have used Moroccan oil, but for those whose hair it weights down too much, this is the best. Far less pricier too!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this religiously. She loves it and I have to say that, even as a guy, I notice how great her hair looks. So, ladies, take that for what it is worth. If you are wondering...I would give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the girl who refuses to cut her hair and am dying for it to grow grow grow!  I have blonde hair that I highlight every 6 months or so.... i&#x27;m growing it out right now to see if it improves the health of my hair.  Before using this, I had split ends and was due for a trim... being myself and refusing to get it cut, i tried this mythic oil and fell in love.  My hair is more hydrated and I actually think it mended my split ends!  I got some samples of the other L&#x27;Oreal Professional products from my hair dresser and am dying to buy the Lactic Acid Conditioner and the Cleansing balm.  This stuff is great and I&#x27;m seeing much better results than I ever did with Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that protects and nourishes my hair.  No need to use a lot of it, but I wish it could hydrate a little more specially the top layer of my hair that is dryer due to sun/wind exposure.  All in all a good product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Does not weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> I started using Mythic Oil (Colour Glow) back in September, and I have to say I love it.  It makes my hair shiny and color really pops.  It&#x27;s also great for detangling, which I&#x27;ve always had a problem with.  Now it&#x27;s no problem at all!  Love it, and will continue to use it as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> This product helped my hair tremendously. I highly recommend this for processed hair as it helps with the dryness.</li>
            <li> Makes my ombre hair feel untouched by any chemicals at all. I LOVE this stuff and definitely recommend it. I&#x27;ve tried a handful of other oils, including Moroccan oil and this is by far the best. Actual noticeable softness.</li>
            <li> Works great/smells great, good seller, fast shipping! (A little goes a long way with this product)</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;d be a but thicker and let me style my hair with it like moroccan oil but nope</li>
            <li> This serum smells pretty good, but the best part is that it makes my hair look shiny and healthy. Some oils I&#x27;ve used dry out my hair, but this really moisturizes without making my hair look greasy! Love it!</li>
            <li> Used two pumps into my hand, enough for my below ear length hair.  Made it shiny and soft, good condition..</li>
            <li> Love this product! Better than Moroccan Oil, Paul Mitchell oils, Redken oils, Tigi oils and everything else I&#x27;ve tried! And priced way better than Kerastase. This stuff is a miracle for my hair which is naturally curly and beyond frizzy. It doesn&#x27;t leave hair looking or feeling oily, just smooth, sleek, shiny, soft hair! Looks and feels healthier than ever!</li>
            <li> love it! my hair is colored and dry at the ends. after washing it gets all tangled. Mythic Glow Oil is just the best get smooth and silky.,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no regrets! i would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love it...smells really nice...</li>
            <li> Great for calming hair when it&#x27;s humid out.And great to condition blown dried and flat ironed hair. Amazon had the lowest price too!</li>
            <li> I have lots of thin, unruly, semi-curly hair and have never really found a product that was very effective in controlling it.  The ones that have been pretty good have weighted down my hair too much and/or made it look oily.  The Mythic Oil provides a soft, controlled finish, with no greasy look.  I hope Loreal continues to offer it, but I have never seen it on store shelves -- could be I&#x27;m not looking in the right stores!  Anyway, I recommend Mythic Oil for soft, manageable hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, it goes into your hair without the oily look.  Hair feels very soft.  It brings out the real color of your hair coloring.</li>
            <li> Oh! Wow! Cannot say enough about how incredible this product is!&lt;br /&gt;Was using Sojourn detangler and serum; now, I only use Mythic Oil to calm, detangle, relax my frizzy hair! and how my hair shines...MAGNIFICENT OIL - for me, much better than morrocan oil.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it some much I purchase 1 for best friend, sister and my son.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite sure if my fine, color treated hair could handle a oil prior to blowdrying but this made me a believer. Smells yummy. Gotta use very sparingly, (this bottle will last me forever!) and if you do, your hair will look fresh, smooth, and glossy. I&#x27;m pretty pleased. The individual oils for this line have had some pretty good Web buzz. Worth trying if you want to make nice with your hair.</li>
