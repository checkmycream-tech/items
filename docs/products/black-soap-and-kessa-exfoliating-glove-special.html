            <li>The glove is amazing, better at exfoliating than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The soap is soft and smells delicious of olives.</li>
            <li>I use argan oil/sesame oil/fig oil (depending on what I have handy) after the shower and my skins stays hydrated for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizing soap yet rinsed right off.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!  </li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s slightly better quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hands even look better after using soap and mitt.  </li>

            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love this combo set.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the exfoliating glove they used because my skin felt like silk afterwards.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth soap made from olive oil.  </li>
            <li>be sure to get the exfoliating glove.</li>
            <li>This soap reminds me of Morocco so much, I love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I found Zakia&#x27;s</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smear on your favorite rich body lotion after (mine is Kiehl&#x27;s Creme de Corp) and voila!</li>
            <li>The products look good on paper; very reasonably priced...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the soap and glove together makes your feel so clean!</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and great afterwards.</li>
            <li>In all in all, I have had great experience so far.</li>
            <li>Feels great to scrub after a long warm bath.</li>
            <li>The scent is OK, kind of spa like, but it doesnt really stay on my skin.</li>
            <li>very high quality w/ NO chemicals!!!</li>
            <li>The soap and mitt are fantastic.</li>
            <li>So happy with this product, I ordered their back exfoliating scrubber too!</li>
            <li>Light is the way to go with this mitt.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed an improvement in skin tone, but I have fair, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>But this is some voodoo magic right here.</li>
            <li>I love how the glove feels, be gentle on your face!</li>
            <li>I find them both great for really cleaning your skin and leaving it soft and polished.</li>
            <li>After just one use; my skin is squeaky clean &amp; hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I soaked in clean water for about 10 minutes and then used the mit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a compliment from my manicurist after giving special attention with the soap &amp; glove to my hands, feet &amp; cuticles.</li>
            <li>then I turn the hot water back on and use the glove to get a great scrub.</li>
            <li>, I will be ordering some more very soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their skin.</li>
            <li>It did more than live up to the hype</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was concerned about using it on my face with the mitt, but I think it works better than my Perricone cleanser and Clarisonic cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Definitely made my skin feel better and softer!</li>
            <li>This moroccan soap is great, you wont imagine the dead cells that come out after using it with the glove.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It really made my skin feel smooth</li>
            <li>2 times a week is golden.</li>
            <li>If you want soft skin, buy this product; you will love it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling super clean, but it is also very drying.  </li>
            <li>My skin all over is extremely sensitive, and I am even able to use this on my face.</li>
            <li>The important thing to remember is to get your skin wet and warm.</li>
            <li>After 2 exfoliation my skin is soft :) Never been like this before!&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
            <li>The black soap and the kessa worked great, exactly like the one I used during my Moroccan bath bridal shower.</li>
            <li>I turn on the shower super hot for a couple of minutes to let it steam up then turn  it off.</li>
            <li>If you are doing it right, this glove is not a means to wash your body - it is a way to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li>My two year old loses &#x27;Best Skin in the House&amp;#34</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try a middle of the road one to see if I liked it before committing too much money to one.</li>
            <li>Secondly, because I think the soap can sometimes create a barrier between the skin and the glove so the glove just slides right over the skin rather than removing that top layer of skin.</li>
            <li>The mitt feels a little scratchy, but it feels kinda good.</li>
            <li>Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>First thing&#x27;s first, I NEVER review products.</li>
            <li>I wet my body with warm water</li>
            <li>glove is exactly like the ones used in Morocco</li>
            <li>First, let me say that this has worked out well.</li>
            <li>This product is as authentic an experience you can get outside of Morocco.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make sure to re-order before my current container is empty...don&#x27;t want to be without!</li>
            <li>I most definitely do not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li>and I would most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Some of these gloves get pretty pricey</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, on my legs, I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but I kept at it</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a harsh lover, but fair.</li>
            <li>whatever black soap is (jesusjelly) and really work it between your hands to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>the soap smells nice enough and my skin is very soft and moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li>Soap is a little stinky, but I love it!</li>
            <li>but I was finally able to leave one and decided it&#x27;s better late than never!</li>
            <li>It seemed unimpressive at first, especially when I used it in the shower, but I came out with smoother skin that felt truly clean.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know it was legal to touch.</li>
            <li>I spent on it :).</li>
            <li>When I used this prior to shaving, I got a smooth shave, no cuts, and my legs were like a baby&#x27;s bottom for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t plan to be without this combination again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>it really does what it says.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>And the soap is very slippery where the glove is required.</li>
            <li>The gloves are very well made.</li>
            <li>I found that this product is much more effective than other more expensive mittens.</li>
            <li>I find that when I use the black soap first, my skin exfoliates a lot better</li>
            <li>Smells better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>Left my skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>As gross as it may sound, I almost prefer the tub, despite the mess, because I love seeing results for my efforts.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Zakia&#x27;s Moroccan black soap and so far I have enjoyed my experience.</li>
            <li>I am new!</li>
            <li>I was so glad that I found Zakia&#x27;s Morocco black soap and kessa.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>gentle cycle using All Free &amp; Clear detergent, and air dry.</li>
            <li>This little glove knows more about me than my husband</li>
            <li>I usually use a pumice stone all over my body, intense I know, but I swear this does a better job and doesn&#x27;t seem quite so abrasive in the process.</li>
            <li>I guess I couldn&#x27;t notice it in the shower, but being surrounded in a bath of my own dry, dead skin that was no longer just hanging on me thanks to this set, was a real eye opener.</li>
            <li>I used it almost every day initially, and my skin got really dry, so now I use it every other day and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my body so smooth as noted from other reviewers.</li>
            <li>After one shower with my new lover Zakia, I thought I was molting.</li>
            <li>The Kessa exfoliating glove looks delicate but do not be fooled it is very strong and has not ripped or anything.</li>
            <li>We actually live in Turkey and recently had our first Turkish Bath experience.</li>
            <li>and if you jump into a steaming hot bath right after scrubbing yourself down your body will feel like it&#x27;s on fire.</li>
            <li>The Kessa Exfoliating glove gives a gentle scrub, and the Black Soap makes my skin feel so soft and clean</li>
            <li>and I will say that this soap lasts a long time so to me it is worth every dollar</li>
            <li>My skin felt incredibly smooth after I used the black soap and kessa exfoliating glove.</li>
            <li>when I threw the mit in the water - it shrunk up and got very coarse (it seems pretty soft in the packaging), so that surprised me.</li>
            <li>The glove works wonders as long as you soak first.</li>
            <li>You feel so soft afterwards ..</li>
            <li>The soap contains a very small list of ingredients (which is very important for me).</li>
            <li>The mitten will exfoliate layers and layers of grey dead skin rolls until your skin is soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>it was not black.</li>
            <li>Firstly, because I think the soap could potentially mask the results (visually) and could give someone the impression it isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>The mitt is rough without being too rough, and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product, but after using it I love it!</li>
            <li>I loiter at the Moroccan restaurant wearing the glove and they&#x27;re pretty close to recognizing their long lost sister and inviting me back to the hammam.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as the current authority on exfoliation let me give you some pointers.</li>
            <li>but those are barely negatives-</li>
            <li>Use of the kessa is critical to getting soft skin.</li>
            <li>but it will shave ALL the dead skin right off.</li>
            <li>I have never used Moroccan Black Soap before so this is my first product.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think I could go back to other soaps now or washcloths or loofahs.</li>
            <li>For my really delicate skin, a true test of this soap and its benefits is the winter time.</li>
            <li>and then I put the black soap into the glove and then gently scrub my body with it.</li>
            <li>I think the only downside to this is that it&#x27;s easy to lose lumps of the soap, and the mitt is a little too harsh for my face-</li>

            <li> I wet my body with warm water</li>
            <li> glove is exactly like the ones used in Morocco</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this has worked out well.</li>
            <li> This product is as authentic an experience you can get outside of Morocco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make sure to re-order before my current container is empty...don&#x27;t want to be without!</li>
            <li> I most definitely do not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> and I would most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Some of these gloves get pretty pricey</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, on my legs, I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but I kept at it</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a harsh lover, but fair.</li>
            <li> whatever black soap is (jesusjelly) and really work it between your hands to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> the soap smells nice enough and my skin is very soft and moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li> Soap is a little stinky, but I love it!</li>
            <li> but I was finally able to leave one and decided it&#x27;s better late than never!</li>
            <li> It seemed unimpressive at first, especially when I used it in the shower, but I came out with smoother skin that felt truly clean.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know it was legal to touch.</li>
            <li> I spent on it :).</li>
            <li> When I used this prior to shaving, I got a smooth shave, no cuts, and my legs were like a baby&#x27;s bottom for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t plan to be without this combination again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> it really does what it says.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> And the soap is very slippery where the glove is required.</li>
            <li> The gloves are very well made.</li>
            <li> I found that this product is much more effective than other more expensive mittens.</li>
            <li> I find that when I use the black soap first, my skin exfoliates a lot better</li>
            <li> Smells better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> Left my skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> As gross as it may sound, I almost prefer the tub, despite the mess, because I love seeing results for my efforts.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Zakia&#x27;s Moroccan black soap and so far I have enjoyed my experience.</li>
            <li> I am new!</li>
            <li> I was so glad that I found Zakia&#x27;s Morocco black soap and kessa.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> gentle cycle using All Free &amp; Clear detergent, and air dry.</li>
            <li> This little glove knows more about me than my husband</li>
            <li> I usually use a pumice stone all over my body, intense I know, but I swear this does a better job and doesn&#x27;t seem quite so abrasive in the process.</li>
            <li> I guess I couldn&#x27;t notice it in the shower, but being surrounded in a bath of my own dry, dead skin that was no longer just hanging on me thanks to this set, was a real eye opener.</li>
            <li> I used it almost every day initially, and my skin got really dry, so now I use it every other day and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my body so smooth as noted from other reviewers.</li>
            <li> After one shower with my new lover Zakia, I thought I was molting.</li>
            <li> The Kessa exfoliating glove looks delicate but do not be fooled it is very strong and has not ripped or anything.</li>
            <li> We actually live in Turkey and recently had our first Turkish Bath experience.</li>
            <li> and if you jump into a steaming hot bath right after scrubbing yourself down your body will feel like it&#x27;s on fire.</li>
            <li> The Kessa Exfoliating glove gives a gentle scrub, and the Black Soap makes my skin feel so soft and clean</li>
            <li> and I will say that this soap lasts a long time so to me it is worth every dollar</li>
            <li> My skin felt incredibly smooth after I used the black soap and kessa exfoliating glove.</li>
            <li> when I threw the mit in the water - it shrunk up and got very coarse (it seems pretty soft in the packaging), so that surprised me.</li>
            <li> The glove works wonders as long as you soak first.</li>
            <li> You feel so soft afterwards ..</li>
            <li> The soap contains a very small list of ingredients (which is very important for me).</li>
            <li> The mitten will exfoliate layers and layers of grey dead skin rolls until your skin is soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> it was not black.</li>
            <li> Firstly, because I think the soap could potentially mask the results (visually) and could give someone the impression it isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> The mitt is rough without being too rough, and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but after using it I love it!</li>
            <li> I loiter at the Moroccan restaurant wearing the glove and they&#x27;re pretty close to recognizing their long lost sister and inviting me back to the hammam.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as the current authority on exfoliation let me give you some pointers.</li>
            <li> but those are barely negatives-</li>
            <li> Use of the kessa is critical to getting soft skin.</li>
            <li> but it will shave ALL the dead skin right off.</li>
            <li> I have never used Moroccan Black Soap before so this is my first product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think I could go back to other soaps now or washcloths or loofahs.</li>
            <li> For my really delicate skin, a true test of this soap and its benefits is the winter time.</li>
            <li> and then I put the black soap into the glove and then gently scrub my body with it.</li>
            <li> I think the only downside to this is that it&#x27;s easy to lose lumps of the soap, and the mitt is a little too harsh for my face-</li>
            <li> have VERY sensitive skin and MOROCCAN BLACK SOAP &amp; KESSA GLOVE are the only products that have NOT caused  inflammation, irritation &amp; allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> Some areas (like hips, lower back, upper thighs) exfoliated more than others (arms and legs) that tend to get a little more attention on the regular, but I kept at it for a long time and could actually see in the disgusting bath water</li>
            <li> The black soap does exactly what it is supposed to do and the exfoliating glove does wonders for eliminating the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> really strange</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a time committment but make time to do it once a week, particularly in the cold winter months when skin gets so dry and flaky, and it will be 100% worth your while.</li>
            <li> but I would kiss him or her firmly on those soft Moroccan lips for as long as it took to fully express my admiration and gratitude for this exfoliative masterpiece.</li>
            <li> (dry?)</li>
            <li> What I like about the Moroccan black soap is that it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has remained nice and soft through the dry and frigid weather.</li>
            <li> I first heard about the Moroccan Black Soap from a friend who is from Morocco who visits a spa/hamaam at least once a week, and swears by it..</li>
            <li> The key is to pair it with the Moroccan black soap beforehand.</li>
            <li> The kessa is the same as the ones we used to buy in Morocco when I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post her comments once she tries it.</li>
            <li> Be careful, do not be tempted to scrub.</li>
            <li> your black soap in a dry place and keep the lid sealed tight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Rinse off the aforementioned grotesque bits and embark on your new, clearer path.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris all over and nothing smooths down my skin like this.</li>
            <li> but I persevered for the sake of wearing black and health, probably.</li>
            <li> I roam the streets passively daring strangers to brush up against my oddly exposed skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels less &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> after using the Black Soap and mitt and the tonal color is improved as well.</li>
            <li> I tried this  moroccan black soap...</li>
            <li> My brother in law introduced me to Moroccan Black Soap &amp; Kessa Glove.</li>
            <li> I spend 5 minutes rubbing the black soap into my skin and let it sit.</li>
            <li> I purchased another set of Moroccan Black Soap &amp; glove for my husband (product aversion to anything other than plain soap)</li>
            <li> Scoop a little of</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first on the effectiveness of the black soap and glove</li>
            <li> the exfoliating glove is very thin, doesn&#x27;t look and feel like it will last very long.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, body and feet everyday.  </li>
            <li> what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and soon I started to see the dead skin roll up and rinse off.</li>
            <li> Tons of dead skin will come off your body and it is easier to rinse the floor of the shower than to scrub the ring of dead skin from your bath tub!</li>
            <li> usually follow this routine with using any moisturizer I have on hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for such a delay in this review</li>
            <li> The soap is a little strong and smells horrible</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t wait that long and water is expensive.</li>
            <li> There are bumps and flakes and dull dryness on skin</li>
            <li> is what I recommend about this product that would probably mean the difference between a 5-star review and a 2-star review</li>
            <li> Hang out in the hot shower, wash your hair, say goodbye to that disgusting, graying sac of skin you&#x27;ve been dragging around because you shall never meet again.</li>
            <li> I also have a terrible tendency to cut my legs while shaving, and the shave lasts less than two days before the stubble is back.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very thick.</li>
            <li> Weird,</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Afraid to use it again...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This soap is beautiful . Really I like it , for best result use it with milk salt spa.</li>
            <li> Soap is a little stinky, but I love it! Skin feels soft and great afterwards. A little goes a long way.  The glove is amazing, better at exfoliating than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The best stuff ive ever used!!!! Definitely made my skin feel better and softer! Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> First thing&#x27;s first, I NEVER review products. But this is some voodoo magic right here. I am an extra white lady in the throes of Midwestern winter. There are bumps and flakes and dull dryness on skin I didn&#x27;t even know it was legal to touch. Dire straits. Not cute.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know who Zakia is but I would kiss him or her firmly on those soft Moroccan lips for as long as it took to fully express my admiration and gratitude for this exfoliative masterpiece. After one shower with my new lover Zakia, I thought I was molting. Weird, but I persevered for the sake of wearing black and health, probably. Now four showers in, I am re-born. A pasty but glowing Phoenix rising from the snow. Victorious! I am new! I am the Venus de Milo! I am Beyonc&amp;eacute;! I am Jackie Kennedy! I am Xena! I roam the streets passively daring strangers to brush up against my oddly exposed skin. My two year old loses &#x27;Best Skin in the House&amp;#34; now (he was always so smug about it anyways). I loiter at the Moroccan restaurant wearing the glove and they&#x27;re pretty close to recognizing their long lost sister and inviting me back to the hammam.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as the current authority on exfoliation let me give you some pointers. If you shower every day like a nutjob maybe chill out on the Zakia vibe. She&#x27;s a harsh lover, but fair. 2 times a week is golden. Hang out in the hot shower, wash your hair, say goodbye to that disgusting, graying sac of skin you&#x27;ve been dragging around because you shall never meet again. Scoop a little of whatever black soap is (jesusjelly) and really work it between your hands to get a good lather. I imagine this is what boys do in the shower. You&#x27;re supposed to leave it on for several minutes but I can&#x27;t wait that long and water is expensive. Then, The Glove. This little glove knows more about me than my husband and I don&#x27;t mind one bit. I&#x27;m talkin ev-ry-where if you get my drift (butt). Rinse off the aforementioned grotesque bits and embark on your new, clearer path. Marvel in the beauty that is the purest form of you. Inhale. Notice the air- it&#x27;s sweeter. Colors brighter. Is that the call of a whippoorwill in the distance? Possibilities unfold before your eyes. Humans and animals alike cannot help but yield to your magnetism. Welcome, you say knowingly, let me show you the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bow to you, Zakia- you beautiful sorcerer.n the beauty that is the purest form of you. Inhale.

            <li> The Kessa Exfoliating glove gives a gentle scrub, and the Black Soap makes my skin feel so soft and clean, I feel like I had just been to a Turkish bath. I would definitely buy this product again. JB</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Zakia&#x27;s Moroccan black soap and so far I have enjoyed my experience. The soap contains a very small list of ingredients (which is very important for me). The soap is soft and smells delicious of olives. The Kessa exfoliating glove looks delicate but do not be fooled it is very strong and has not ripped or anything. I wet my body with warm water and then I put the black soap into the glove and then gently scrub my body with it. What I like about the Moroccan black soap is that it does not dry my skin. For my really delicate skin, a true test of this soap and its benefits is the winter time. My skin has remained nice and soft through the dry and frigid weather. In all in all, I have had great experience so far. Also, as a student I try to keep to a budget and I will say that this soap lasts a long time so to me it is worth every dollar I spent on it :). Thank you Zakia for the wonderful soap.</li>
            <li> After visiting a hamam (bath house) in Morocco I have been searching for a way to recreate that experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This glove is exactly like the ones used in Morocco and I think it&#x27;s slightly better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the soap and glove together makes your feel so clean! I find that when I use the black soap first, my skin exfoliates a lot better and I can see the dirt coming out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some acne scars on my back and with weekly exfoliation I have seen a great reduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your black soap in a dry place and keep the lid sealed tight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually follow this routine with using any moisturizer I have on hand.</li>
            <li> the exfoliating glove is very thin, doesn&#x27;t look and feel like it will last very long.</li>
            <li> The soap and mitt are fantastic. I use this on my face, body and feet everyday.  I have very sensitive skin and was concerned about using it on my face with the mitt, but I think it works better than my Perricone cleanser and Clarisonic cleaning.  My skin feels less &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; (dry?) after using the Black Soap and mitt and the tonal color is improved as well. I use argan oil/sesame oil/fig oil (depending on what I have handy) after the shower and my skins stays hydrated for most of the day.  My hands even look better after using soap and mitt.  So happy with this product, I ordered their back exfoliating scrubber too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wondered whether it was the glove, the soap, or truly both together that made this a good exfoliator. I recently started using self-tanner, so I needed to get my skin exfoliated before applying anything. First, let me say that this has worked out well. It seemed unimpressive at first, especially when I used it in the shower, but I came out with smoother skin that felt truly clean. Then I tried it one day in the bath. It was the grossest, most impressive thing I&#x27;ve seen. I guess I couldn&#x27;t notice it in the shower, but being surrounded in a bath of my own dry, dead skin that was no longer just hanging on me thanks to this set, was a real eye opener. I also have a terrible tendency to cut my legs while shaving, and the shave lasts less than two days before the stubble is back. When I used this prior to shaving, I got a smooth shave, no cuts, and my legs were like a baby&#x27;s bottom for 2-3 days. I think this is definitely something to use once a week. As gross as it may sound, I almost prefer the tub, despite the mess, because I love seeing results for my efforts. I&#x27;ve also come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s not just the mitt because I&#x27;ve tried another exfoliating scrub with the mitt and it wasn&#x27;t the same. The mitt feels a little scratchy, but it feels kinda good. I think the only downside to this is that it&#x27;s easy to lose lumps of the soap, and the mitt is a little too harsh for my face- but those are barely negatives- if say 4.5 stars.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several weeks ago and have used it only one time. The experience was a great one. The black soap does exactly what it is supposed to do and the exfoliating glove does wonders for eliminating the dead skin cells. I would recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> I found that this product is much more effective than other more expensive mittens. The key is to pair it with the Moroccan black soap beforehand. Soak your skin in shower or bath and then lather up using the poof. The mitten will exfoliate layers and layers of grey dead skin rolls until your skin is soft and smooth! I really don&#x27;t plan to be without this combination again. I try to do it about once a week. I have keratosis pilaris all over and nothing smooths down my skin like this. It leaves your skin moisturized as well. Set aside some time on the weekend and I recommend leaving a layer of water in your bathtub to wash away the skin gunk.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!  My skin feels and looks so much better. I gave my mother a sample to try and she wanted to buy some immediately after trying it. Which goes to show good for all ages of skin. Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This moroccan soap is great, you wont imagine the dead cells that come out after using it with the glove.&lt;br /&gt;And for better results use it 2 or 3 times / week.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is a gift for my sister, so she&#x27;ll have to tell me what she thinks. I&#x27;ll post her comments once she tries it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I will order more soon.</li>
            <li> It smells good, does the job and the gloves are great.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing soap yet rinsed right off. Left my skin squeaky clean. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the smell. The consistency is very thick. The glove works wonders as long as you soak first. I&#x27;ve also used both items in the shower. I find them both great for really cleaning your skin and leaving it soft and polished.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to improve my skin. It has worked wonders for me it really does what it says. You can not go wrong with this product.I will be ordering more. A customer for life. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for such a delay in this review but I was finally able to leave one and decided it&#x27;s better late than never! I have never used Moroccan Black Soap before so this is my first product. I have to say that the product does what it says. What a great clean, scrubbed feeling and no breakouts from it on my face or my body. The glove is amazing; it just scrubs wonderfully and leaves you tingly and knowing you are clean. I really don&#x27;t think I could go back to other soaps now or washcloths or loofahs. This made me feel like I was in a spa instead of a shower. The company is wonderful as well... They go above and beyond for their products. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their skin. If you want soft skin, buy this product; you will love it.</li>
            <li> Love this combo set. It&#x27;s made my body so smooth as noted from other reviewers. And the soap is very slippery where the glove is required.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling super clean, but it is also very drying.  I have not noticed an improvement in skin tone, but I have fair, sensitive skin and it&#x27;s winter in the Midwest, so I don&#x27;t fully blame the product.  I will keep using it to see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but after using it I love it! I used it almost every day initially, and my skin got really dry, so now I use it every other day and the results are amazing! My skin all over is extremely sensitive, and I am even able to use this on my face. The scent is OK, kind of spa like, but it doesnt really stay on my skin. I love how the glove feels, be gentle on your face!</li>
            <li> The best soap on the market. Smells better than any other product I have tried. The important thing to remember is to get your skin wet and warm. I have a steam shower which also aids in the absorption of the soap. Use of the kessa is critical to getting soft skin. This product is as authentic an experience you can get outside of Morocco.</li>
            <li> good product. I did not like the color of Kessa it was not black.</li>
            <li> I tried this  moroccan black soap... Its perfect .. You feel so soft afterwards .. And I like the lofa the one comes with it  ...</li>
            <li> My brother in law introduced me to Moroccan Black Soap &amp; Kessa Glove. He asked me to order a set on his behalf (since I have Amazon prime...). The products look good on paper; very reasonably priced...so I also ordered a set for myself. So happy I did!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic products...very high quality w/ NO chemicals!!! After just one use; my skin is squeaky clean &amp; hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY sensitive skin and MOROCCAN BLACK SOAP &amp; KESSA GLOVE are the only products that have NOT caused  inflammation, irritation &amp; allergic reactions. I received a compliment from my manicurist after giving special attention with the soap &amp; glove to my hands, feet &amp; cuticles. I purchased another set of Moroccan Black Soap &amp; glove for my husband (product aversion to anything other than plain soap) and he uses 3-4 times a week. The gloves are very well made. I put them in a lingerie bag and washing machine, gentle cycle using All Free &amp; Clear detergent, and air dry. Perfect! I&#x27;ll make sure to re-order before my current container is empty...don&#x27;t want to be without! One of my favorite products. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We actually live in Turkey and recently had our first Turkish Bath experience. I fell in love with the exfoliating glove they used because my skin felt like silk afterwards. I usually use a pumice stone all over my body, intense I know, but I swear this does a better job and doesn&#x27;t seem quite so abrasive in the process. I&#x27;ve already ordered this for two of my family members as gifts!</li>
            <li> Nice smooth soap made from olive oil.  The mitt is rough without being too rough, and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but after using it all my body and face bloated up! It was as if I had a rash! Never used it after this time and went back to Dove. Afraid to use it again...I might throw it...what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome. be sure to get the exfoliating glove. I turn on the shower super hot for a couple of minutes to let it steam up then turn  it off. I spend 5 minutes rubbing the black soap into my skin and let it sit. then I turn the hot water back on and use the glove to get a great scrub. the soap smells nice enough and my skin is very soft and moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li> Very nice soap and exfoliating glove. Feels great to scrub after a long warm bath. When do it at the Spa when you can do it at home.  Pleasant smell and feeling.</li>
            <li> After 2 exfoliation my skin is soft :) Never been like this before!&lt;br /&gt;Soap AND glove are great.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it</li>
            <li> I was so glad that I found Zakia&#x27;s Morocco black soap and kessa. My mom wanted some and I wasn&#x27;t where to get it. This soap reminds me of Morocco so much, I love it. The kessa is the same as the ones we used to buy in Morocco when I was a little girl. So glad I found Zakia&#x27;s, I will be ordering some more very soon. THANK YOU!!!!</li>
            <li> The soap is a little strong and smells horrible but it will shave ALL the dead skin right off. Be careful, do not be tempted to scrub. Light is the way to go with this mitt.</li>
            <li> I first heard about the Moroccan Black Soap from a friend who is from Morocco who visits a spa/hamaam at least once a week, and swears by it.. I was very skeptical at first on the effectiveness of the black soap and glove but I went through with the purchase to give it a try. I most definitely do not regret this purchase. My skin felt incredibly smooth after I used the black soap and kessa exfoliating glove. It did more than live up to the hype and I would most definitely recommend it. It is doing wonders to my skin.</li>
            <li> The black soap and the kessa worked great, exactly like the one I used during my Moroccan bath bridal shower. Of course, this time body glitter wasn&#x27;t flung at me. It really made my skin feel smooth and my pores have shrunk a bit. The exfoliation also helped some ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Use these products in a shower, not a bath! Tons of dead skin will come off your body and it is easier to rinse the floor of the shower than to scrub the ring of dead skin from your bath tub! Also, don&#x27;t over scrub and if you jump into a steaming hot bath right after scrubbing yourself down your body will feel like it&#x27;s on fire.</li>
            <li> After reading this blog post (http://www.garancedore.fr/en/2014/11/25/bath-rituals/) I couldn&#x27;t help but try it. Some of these gloves get pretty pricey so I wanted to try a middle of the road one to see if I liked it before committing too much money to one. So I got this one which came with the soap and tried it the day it was delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I recommend about this product that would probably mean the difference between a 5-star review and a 2-star review: I did not use the soap with it. Why? Firstly, because I think the soap could potentially mask the results (visually) and could give someone the impression it isn&#x27;t working. Secondly, because I think the soap can sometimes create a barrier between the skin and the glove so the glove just slides right over the skin rather than removing that top layer of skin. So I soaked in clean water for about 10 minutes and then used the mit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felt really strange when I threw the mit in the water - it shrunk up and got very coarse (it seems pretty soft in the packaging), so that surprised me. When I first started using it, on my legs, I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but I kept at it and soon I started to see the dead skin roll up and rinse off. Some areas (like hips, lower back, upper thighs) exfoliated more than others (arms and legs) that tend to get a little more attention on the regular, but I kept at it for a long time and could actually see in the disgusting bath water how well it was working. I scrubbed at my skin till I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and finally drained the tub and turned on the shower and washed off. If you are doing it right, this glove is not a means to wash your body - it is a way to exfoliate your skin. You will actually want to wash AFTER you use the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smear on your favorite rich body lotion after (mine is Kiehl&#x27;s Creme de Corp) and voila! Skin like a baby. Yes, it&#x27;s a time committment but make time to do it once a week, particularly in the cold winter months when skin gets so dry and flaky, and it will be 100% worth your while.</li>
