            <li> Save your money and buy from a spa or other legit retailer.</li>
            <li> This was a joke and waste of money.</li>
            <li> She also recommended using the creme 28 moisturizer, which I&#x27;ve done and haven&#x27;t broken out.</li>

            <li> Let me start by saying I love the face wash and have used it for years. I will never spend my money with this buyer again.

This one was clearly watered down. Save your money and buy from a spa or other legit retailer. This was a joke and waste of money.
