            <li>I love the color and also like everything i pay from amazon.com</li>
            <li>Love this color, great price and fast delivery time.</li>
            <li>So be sure that you get what you see on the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I truly love this color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite for this brand.</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>The product looks just as good online as in real life.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>Also, the brown is not quite as rich in color as the photo shows.</li>
            <li>(When I clean the bathrooms, dishes, etc.</li>
            <li>Others have mentioned this, and it is true.</li>
            <li>I am hesitant to buy Sensational Gel Polish again as I had a similar experience with their Mis Behave color.</li>
            <li>Fun colour</li>
            <li>, it is clear on the box that it has to be used with the light (I already had the light that came with the starter kit of Sensationail).&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>In indoor lighting, the picture is more green and would be so gross if it didn&#x27;t have the resilient and beautiful gold flecks in the paint.</li>
            <li>It is more of a bronze--and not a shiny, new bronze but a somewhat tarnished, older bronze.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>The color after you apply looks exactly like the color of the picture on the box!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The learning curve was so steep that my first foot I looked like I had poop smeared all over my toes.</li>
            <li>It’s actually a bit more greenish.</li>
            <li>applied the plastic tips and then proceeded to the steps of Sensationail, and it worked really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With outdoor lighting, the paint looks brown with the golden flecks but certainly not a dark brown like I wanted.</li>
            <li>The same is true of their taupe gel polish.</li>
            <li>The color on my nails, is a brown with more yellow-ish green undertones.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The polish was able to cover the slight bump that the nail tips created and the result is seamless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like on the pic, the color is greenish bronze, not bad color but not that what I expected</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even go a full 24 hours wearing because I disliked it so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dark, rich color.</li>
            <li>effect of the color is the same too (the \\&quot;star\\&quot; or \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; effect), I LOVE dark nails (black, brown...), and the color is really nice, unless you don&#x27;t like dark nails.</li>
            <li>Thought the bottle would be a little larger, but I truly LOVE the color.  </li>
            <li>I complete everything i do</li>
            <li>The photo of Espresso Bean on the website, and on the box, is different from what it really is.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product along with the overall Sensationail kit!</li>
            <li>The website and box shows a light flesh color brown, but it&#x27;s actually grey green in color.</li>
            <li>While the box and label on the bottle display this color as a dark brown &amp;#34;espresso bean,&amp;#34; it is much more of a bronze green color.</li>
            <li>In general, the shimmery colors seem to last longer.</li>

            <li> In general, the shimmery colors seem to last longer.</li>
            <li> I no longer worry about how long my manicure will last and under what conditions my polish will chip.</li>
            <li> I know Sensationail protocols say to apply a “thin” layer of polish, but I found that with the consistency of the product I had to apply it so thinly that I had to apply 3 layers to get good enough coverage.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was more methodical and painstaking with my other foot</li>
            <li> I had to cure one finger at a time because if I waited to long it would pool up.</li>
            <li> consistency is quite thin and quickly disperses into the little crevices beneath the cuticles and around the nail.</li>
            <li> Instead of a brownish red, it is a bronze green.</li>
            <li> , although it&#x27;s not directly related to this product: I bite my nails so I couldn&#x27;t wait for them to grow, so I bought nail tips (similar to fake nails, but it&#x27;s glued only to the tip of the nails, which I thought would be healthier...</li>
            <li> I also think this one lasts longer on my nails than any other, and I have about 8 colors.</li>
            <li> When outdoors it had a weird green undertone which I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li> I like dark and near-black colors as I find it easier to match my wardrobe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are getting bronze green unless they aren&#x27;t applying properly.</li>
            <li> The color pictured on the box is a dark chocolate brown with redish sparkles.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a bronze green you might like this color.</li>
            <li> Brown with a hint of green hughes.  </li>
            <li> but it did, and got hard as the acrylic product promises.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to apply a thick layer of the polish each time for this to happen, and I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> I got this polish based off the picture and was disappointed with the actual polish color.</li>
            <li> That said, I found this polish to be extremely difficult to work</li>
            <li> It’s not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> Not that it&#x27;s awful, but it&#x27;s not what was shown.</li>

            <li> Beautiful color and outstanding durability! The product looks just as good online as in real life. I will order another color soon.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT STAY ON THE NAIL.</li>
            <li> Love sensational products. Does exactly what it says. Stays on for two weeks. (When I clean the bathrooms, dishes, etc. I wear gloves. Otherwise it will chip eventual)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like on the pic, the color is greenish bronze, not bad color but not that what I expected</li>
            <li> Nice brown with gold flecks in it. Kind of runny. I had to cure one finger at a time because if I waited to long it would pool up. When outdoors it had a weird green undertone which I&#x27;m not crazy about but it&#x27;s not horrible. Cute fall color.</li>

            <li> Love this color, great price and fast delivery time. Thank you</li>
            <li> Beautiful color!! Love this product and the color options are awesome. Highly recommend this product along with the overall Sensationail kit!</li>
            <li> Fun colour and it changes hues depending on the lighting.</li>
            <li> Love love love this nail polish color!  Just enough sparkle and so so creamy.  Brown with a hint of green hughes.  I have receives sooo many compliments!!</li>
            <li> The color after you apply looks exactly like the color of the picture on the box!&lt;br /&gt;I put my nails side by side with the picture and it&#x27;s the same.&lt;br /&gt;The effect of the color is the same too (the \\&quot;star\\&quot; or \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; effect), I LOVE dark nails (black, brown...), and the color is really nice, unless you don&#x27;t like dark nails. So be sure that you get what you see on the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is clear on the box that it has to be used with the light (I already had the light that came with the starter kit of Sensationail).&lt;br /&gt;As an addition, although it&#x27;s not directly related to this product: I bite my nails so I couldn&#x27;t wait for them to grow, so I bought nail tips (similar to fake nails, but it&#x27;s glued only to the tip of the nails, which I thought would be healthier...).&lt;br /&gt;I applied the plastic tips and then proceeded to the steps of Sensationail, and it worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;The polish was able to cover the slight bump that the nail tips created and the result is seamless.

            <li> I have been using Sensationail gel polishes for about six months now and have considered them to be life-changing. I no longer worry about how long my manicure will last and under what conditions my polish will chip. That said, I found this polish to be extremely difficult to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is quite thin and quickly disperses into the little crevices beneath the cuticles and around the nail. I know Sensationail protocols say to apply a “thin” layer of polish, but I found that with the consistency of the product I had to apply it so thinly that I had to apply 3 layers to get good enough coverage. I almost applied a fourth layer. The learning curve was so steep that my first foot I looked like I had poop smeared all over my toes. Needless to say, I was more methodical and painstaking with my other foot and it looked a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably continue to use this polish now that I know what I’m in for. It’s not for the faint of heart. Also, the brown is not quite as rich in color as the photo shows. It’s actually a bit more greenish.</li>
            <li> I truly love this color. It&#x27;s my favorite for this brand. I&#x27;m not sure why people are getting bronze green unless they aren&#x27;t applying properly. Mine always looks like, well, an espresso bean--with some gold shimmer. It&#x27;s a dark, rich color. I also think this one lasts longer on my nails than any other, and I have about 8 colors. In general, the shimmery colors seem to last longer. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> It turned out gold, not brown.</li>
            <li> The photo of Espresso Bean on the website, and on the box, is different from what it really is. Instead of a brownish red, it is a bronze green. Not that it&#x27;s awful, but it&#x27;s not what was shown. The same is true of their taupe gel polish. The website and box shows a light flesh color brown, but it&#x27;s actually grey green in color.</li>
            <li> The color pictured on the box is a dark chocolate brown with redish sparkles. The color on my nails, is a brown with more yellow-ish green undertones.  Don&#x27;t expect it to look like the picture.</li>
            <li> I love this color.  It is a gorgeous coffee (espresso) bean color and I get compliments on it all the time.  Enjoy</li>
