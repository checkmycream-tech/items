            <li>really fantastic kit.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the gloves, but I made sure my hands were super clean.</li>
            <li>Just carefully push the needle out with your jewelry and you are good to go!  </li>
            <li>I love my new belly ring :) I didn&#x27;t use the ring that came with the kit.</li>
            <li>This kit was perfect and did the job, the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that the needle gauge and belly ring gauge are different, so I had to pierce it and take the needle out then put the ring in.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It took awhile, but I love my new piercing.</li>
            <li>I love how my new piercing looks.</li>
            <li>The clamps worked fine when I put a rubber band around them to hold them steady.</li>
            <li>Other than that everything was there and good quality</li>
            <li>It was a great kit everything was packaged and sterile the needle was too small.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and</li>
            <li>I give it a 3 star because it came as described but the clamps were very cheap plastic and didn&#x27;t close properly.</li>
            <li>the needle was super sharp and the barbell looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>And was very helpful.</li>
            <li>and I felt that it was very sanitary.</li>
            <li>So I ended up having to go buy real surgical steel clamps.</li>
            <li>The top triangle went a little to the right when I closed while the bottom triangle stayed straight.</li>
            <li>I placed everything out on that blue paper towel kind of thing and got a mirror, used the body ink marker and made two little dots for where I wanted the entrance and exit of my piercing</li>
            <li>Came early.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to get mine done for a long time</li>
            <li>The needle and the belly ring are the same thing that you&#x27;d get at a professional place.</li>
            <li>it came with which was kind of weird.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to push through, normally suppose to fit into the piercing needle to make it easier to pull through..</li>

            <li> I would Like To Say Is That I Bought This And it Came 2 days Later ! It&#x27;s great , if You Are Planning To Buy This Then Get It !</li>
            <li> Everything it said and it has better clamps then the eBay one! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Worked great! Pierced it a week ago with this! So far so good! :)</li>
            <li> Everything was good except for the clamps. The top triangle went a little to the right when I closed while the bottom triangle stayed straight. I discovered this after I had pierced my belly button so I had to take that one out and repierce it.</li>
            <li> Great kit and came with everything listed and shown!!! Painless procedure that&#x27;s quick and easy!</li>
            <li> It was a great kit everything was packaged and sterile the needle was too small. It wouldn&#x27;t attach the bar bell to the needle because the needle was about the same size as the bat bell it came with which was kind of weird. I Just pushed the needle out with my barbell though so it still worked you just can&#x27;t attach the jewelry to the needle. Just carefully push the needle out with your jewelry and you are good to go!  I would buy it again if I needed to.</li>
            <li> This product worked nicely. However the needle and ring were different sizes but I had no issue getting it in. This didn&#x27;t come with directions tho so i would definitely look up a video to see what all the wipes are for and the order. I was re-piercing and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice and clean, came on time. And was very helpful. I didn&#x27;t have to pay at a tattoo shop. Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Worked out great for a DIY kit</li>
            <li> Worked great! This kit has everything you could possibly need to do your piercing and I felt that it was very sanitary.</li>
            <li> It was great but needed more gauge needles</li>
            <li> I pierced my belly button with this. The clamps aren&#x27;t the best so I didn&#x27;t use them. I used a butterfly clip instead. It took a few tries to get it through because i&#x27;m a chicken and it hurt really bad for me. But the needle is sterilized and the package was closed and everything. Same with the belly ring. The needle and the belly ring are the same thing that you&#x27;d get at a professional place. I like my belly ring and i&#x27;m hoping it heals okay</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 star because it came as described but the clamps were very cheap plastic and didn&#x27;t close properly. So I ended up having to go buy real surgical steel clamps.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this to pierce but to repierce. Worked well. But the plastic pliers sucks wh en your doing it by your self.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this kit to pierce my belly button today. Super fast shipping and everything is sterile and wrapped up! A+++++++ ! I definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> very nice kit , thank you !!!</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than the delivery date, and everything was included. It took me a few minutes to do it myself because I was afraid of the pain and had to go through scar tissue from a rejected one a few years ago. This kit was perfect and did the job, the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that the needle gauge and belly ring gauge are different, so I had to pierce it and take the needle out then put the ring in. It took awhile, but I love my new piercing. :) can&#x27;t wait to buy cute rings again.</li>
            <li> Great and cheap piercing kit!</li>
            <li> Everything in my kit was amazing, clamps and all. I got this kit yesterday and pierced my navel today. It looks amazing. I love how my new piercing looks. I really wanted to get mine done for a long time and I did a lot of research on navel piercings so I would know how to pierce my belly button. What I did was I placed everything out on that blue paper towel kind of thing and got a mirror, used the body ink marker and made two little dots for where I wanted the entrance and exit of my piercing I then cleansed my belly button with all of the materials given and put on the clamps (the clamps hurt the most) I then tightened the clamps looked into the mirror where the bottom dot was and inserted the needle. (From buttom up.) I then put in the jewelry and screwed on the ball. Hope this helped.</li>
            <li> Came early. But the needle is the wrong gauge. Other than that everything was there and good quality</li>
            <li> 2nd time piercing mine. I&#x27;ve done someone else&#x27;s also and prefer the curved needles. Still great though.</li>
            <li> Got here earlier than expected. Came with everything as showed. Haven&#x27;t tried this out on anyone yet, but I have a customer waiting for it to be done! Will recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Came with everything I needed , needle was very sharp so no pain, very sanitary and came a day earlier than expected</li>
            <li> I used this kit today and it came out perfectly. I love my new belly ring :) I didn&#x27;t use the ring that came with the kit. Instead I used a purple gem barbel that I purchased with 4 other rings. Everything that&#x27;s shown came. I didn&#x27;t use the gloves, but I made sure my hands were super clean. The clamps worked fine when I put a rubber band around them to hold them steady. I also didn&#x27;t use the pen. Everything was individually wrapped and sterile which is great. So all in all my experience with this kit was a 15 out of 10. Love it. Also thinking of doing my bottom belly button too. 5 ⭐️s</li>
            <li> Came earlier (2 days) and everything seemed sterile. Didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I thought and was fairly easy. I blacked out after the needle was through though lol. I&#x27;m a wimp. We will see if it gets infected or not!</li>
            <li> Pierced nicely. Everything inlcuded in picture. Quick shipping. Only thing I would recommend is getting a larger needle than the barbell. It is difficult to push through, normally suppose to fit into the piercing needle to make it easier to pull through..</li>
            <li> really fantastic kit. the needle was super sharp and the barbell looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> My package came in 5 days and it had everything in it I&#x27;m so happy😋</li>
