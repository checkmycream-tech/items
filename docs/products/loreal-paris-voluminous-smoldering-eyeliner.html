            <li>I find this eye pencil easy to handle and control.</li>
            <li>I love the depth of the dark brown color, and I love how beautifully it applies - no tugging or skipping.</li>
            <li>It applied easily and smoothly.  </li>

            <li>I liked this so much.  </li>
            <li>The price is absolutely fantastic for</li>

            <li>It is easy to apply, glides on smooth, does not smudge or give me the ‘raccoon look’, stays put for hours, easy to remove, provides intense color and makes my eyes pop!</li>
            <li>Very favorite eyeliner by far.</li>
            <li>I generally prefer a medium line, but a fine precise line is created easily by sharpening the point with the sharpener that is included, which is a nice and useful addition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to get this eye liner right into your lash line for that deeper volume lash look.</li>
            <li>It gives you a perfect thick line every time.</li>
            <li>Then, this would have been my absolute favorite eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This pencil is not bad.</li>
            <li>Howver if youre lining the inside of your eyelid, this is prettt much the perfect black eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Plus it comes with this cool sharpener that does a great job (I have used it to sharpen my other eye pencils).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So much to like about this product: the low price, the great sharpener that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on soft &amp; smoothly without me having to tug at my skin.  </li>
            <li>goes on smooth, stays in place, I like very much</li>
            <li>This is a great shade of black.</li>
            <li>I love kohl eyeliners, they glide on smoothly and effortlessly, and I barely apply any pressure during my application.</li>
            <li>Great black eye pencil.</li>
            <li>You dont have to sharpen it very often, it stays put and its easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Very creamy, easy to use on your waterline, very pigmented and glides on smooth.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth your money ..</li>
            <li>Gives a nice touch to the naked eye.</li>
            <li>its good only negative point its not smudge proof but look great</li>
            <li>Smoldering is right.  </li>
            <li>The price is right</li>
            <li>but unless I&#x27;m rubbing my eyes because my allergies are acting up, I have beautifully lined eyes the entire work-day and into the evening.</li>
            <li>Excellent for dark, solid lines as well as smokey lines.</li>
            <li>Very soft and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t necessarily have the time to fix my makeup during the work day, but if you keep a q-tip in your makeup bag, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for you as it is very easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used, and it doesn&#x27;t look dark grey like the others.  </li>
            <li>Smudges easily during application for a natural or smokey look.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I liked l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s extra intense liquid liner and wanted to compare it</li>
            <li>Slides and looks better in the lower eyelid than in the upper eyelid.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s one of the reason I got it in the first place......</li>
            <li>I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to draw a proper line.  </li>
            <li>This one is sooo smooth and soft and stays on pretty well through the day.  </li>
            <li>Product recommended from a friend &amp; I REALLY like it!</li>
            <li>The eyeliner is pretty</li>
            <li>This point came amazingly precise and was ultra soft to apply.  </li>
            <li>color is Ok for Asian.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and easy to apply, leaves an intense black layer.</li>
            <li>I have many pencils I tried a few times and threw out because thy just didn&#x27;t apply easily.  </li>
            <li>Another feature that I am thankful for is how easily this washes off with my gentle cleanser and a soft face cloth.</li>
            <li>It does run easily, and smudge, if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>Can draw a fine line or thick line with ease and if you want that smoky look smudges nicely.  </li>
            <li>, it works best when its not super sharp.</li>
            <li>It really works well on the waterline, lasting about 6 hours, even in Texas heat. :)</li>
            <li>Ok, as long as everyone knows how much they are paying for something that you could normally buy as a full stick for under $5....</li>
            <li>I really like this product as it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Has a nice dark color and stays all day</li>
            <li>I really love this eyeliner as it has a rich black color and smudgy, smoldering, smoky eye look!</li>
            <li>looks so for people like me who prefer a more thinner, more subtle line, this just didn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the make up stays, goes on super easy</li>
            <li>I wear this everyday and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is super easy to apply as it glides right across your eyelid with very little effort.</li>
            <li>Great product, I have been using the same stick, everyday, for a year now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than I expected</li>
            <li>I really like this eye liner.</li>
            <li>Can;t really use liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li>so after much deliberation I decided to buy this pencil.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really like it much for this reason..and who like smudged eyeliner anyways..</li>
            <li>otherwise nothing much else..do not recommend this..</li>
            <li>very disappointed😔</li>
            <li>While this eyeliner can be smudged very well for the effect you want, it stays in place very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to you</li>
            <li>you really hit the jackpot on this one...and please no changes or improvements  </li>
            <li>but it really pulls.  </li>
            <li>That eyeliner&#x27;s formula stays on longer and doesn&#x27;t need as much sharpening and is much darker than this pencil.</li>
            <li>Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner, Intense Black&amp;#34; to stay on without smudging.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times, but this glides on perfectly and has a super black color.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I would like, and smudges really easily.</li>
            <li>The line I get is so thin, clean and nice</li>
            <li>It glides on SUPER easy, is VERY black, and stays reasonably put (for the price).</li>
            <li>If you want dramatic eyes, this is a great product that will give you the enhancement you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>May need to apply about 3-4 times in a day but overall, not bad at all.</li>
            <li>This will be my new go-to eyeliner!</li>
            <li>The black color seems to make my eyes more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Decent eyeliner for the price.</li>
            <li>I like it, but it smudges easily and often ends up on my upper lid if I am not careful to blot it.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this to everyone.  </li>
            <li>eyeliner gives you the ability to go super dark/bold or just soft and light depending on how heavily you apply it.</li>
            <li>so it makes it look like I have natural eyeliner on my waterline till I take extra time to clean it</li>
            <li>Its so dark and creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The only con I find is that it doesn&#x27;t lasts for long, specially if there is some hot weather going on.</li>
            <li>This had such huge potential.</li>
            <li>the only thing nice about it is that its very black..</li>
            <li>Its really disappointing because it goes on beautifully....</li>
            <li>So if you normally have sensitive eyes, I would proceed with caution on this.</li>
            <li>so I was happily surprised when there was one in the package!</li>
            <li>I have older skin, not very firm, and very soft sensitive lid areas.  </li>
            <li>After I ordered it, I was thinking I would need to run to Target in the next week or so to get a large size sharpener</li>
            <li>I have not had to use it yet on this eyeliner, but I used it on my lipliner, and it was super sharp.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner is soft so it doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes.</li>
            <li>I can color my waterline with no trouble at all.  </li>
            <li>so you can make it as precise as you want without destroying the tip.  </li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;ve found &amp;#34;stila Stay All Day</li>
            <li>It stays put all day and I love that it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li>smudges but nice dark black</li>
            <li>: The pencil is too short, Needs to be reapplied occasionally throughout the day, Gets oily/smudges in hot weather</li>
            <li>Only problem is that the color doesn&#x27;t apply solidly on my waterline and mostly disappears after a few hours.</li>
            <li>This pencil is huge and works so well!I never use the smaller pencils anymore because this one goes on dark!</li>
            <li>Thick point makes it easy to draw on varies line thickness.</li>
            <li>The pencil is so soft and comfortable to apply and gives your eye a thick line of eyeliner since the pencil is fat.</li>
            <li>I am very fussy when it comes to eyeliner, and this one fulfills every single requirement.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll need to be sharpening this eyeliner more than usual especially if worn daily.</li>
            <li>It stays on pretty well, and also works for my sensitive water line and tight line areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very rich black color, as dark as liquid liners.</li>
            <li>It delivers a clean, dark line for my lower lash waterline that stays for a long time.</li>
            <li>I would NOT recommend this for things such as dramatic winged eyes etc or that kind of effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important for me to find an eyeliner that stays on without smudging or disappearing for at least 8 hours because I work as a hostess at a fast-paced restaurant</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s soft enough to go on without yanking your eyelid.</li>
            <li>One personal benefit is that I can&#x27;t seem to get it cleaned off my waterline completely if I&#x27;m in a rush</li>
            <li>Color is stunning and dramatic</li>
            <li>The only issue i have is that you need to sharper it in order to be able to draw a thin line.</li>
            <li>Too thick, not very long-lasting and somehow most of the eyeliners don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Price is about the same as major drugstores.</li>
            <li>I go for the messy look anyways, but buyers be aware it doesn&#x27;t set like a liquid will.</li>
            <li>Though this eyeliner does go on smooth, you do realize you&#x27;re purchasing less than half a stick of eyeliner for $7?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a very charcoal black or something like that.</li>
            <li>The formula is very creamy and black and it glides on in one swipe.</li>

            <li> I find this eye pencil easy to handle and control.</li>
            <li> I love the depth of the dark brown color, and I love how beautifully it applies - no tugging or skipping.</li>

            <li> This goes on so smooth and without pulling.  </li>
            <li> I liked this so much.  </li>
            <li> The price is absolutely fantastic for</li>

            <li> It is easy to apply, glides on smooth, does not smudge or give me the ‘raccoon look’, stays put for hours, easy to remove, provides intense color and makes my eyes pop!</li>
            <li> Very favorite eyeliner by far.</li>
            <li> I generally prefer a medium line, but a fine precise line is created easily by sharpening the point with the sharpener that is included, which is a nice and useful addition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to get this eye liner right into your lash line for that deeper volume lash look.</li>
            <li> It gives you a perfect thick line every time.</li>
            <li> Then, this would have been my absolute favorite eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This pencil is not bad.</li>
            <li> Howver if youre lining the inside of your eyelid, this is prettt much the perfect black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Plus it comes with this cool sharpener that does a great job (I have used it to sharpen my other eye pencils).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So much to like about this product: the low price, the great sharpener that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on soft &amp; smoothly without me having to tug at my skin.  </li>
            <li> goes on smooth, stays in place, I like very much</li>
            <li> This is a great shade of black.</li>
            <li> I love kohl eyeliners, they glide on smoothly and effortlessly, and I barely apply any pressure during my application.</li>
            <li> Great black eye pencil.</li>
            <li> You dont have to sharpen it very often, it stays put and its easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, easy to use on your waterline, very pigmented and glides on smooth.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth your money ..</li>
            <li> Gives a nice touch to the naked eye.</li>
            <li> its good only negative point its not smudge proof but look great</li>
            <li> Smoldering is right.  </li>
            <li> The price is right</li>
            <li> but unless I&#x27;m rubbing my eyes because my allergies are acting up, I have beautifully lined eyes the entire work-day and into the evening.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dark, solid lines as well as smokey lines.</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t necessarily have the time to fix my makeup during the work day, but if you keep a q-tip in your makeup bag, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for you as it is very easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used, and it doesn&#x27;t look dark grey like the others.  </li>
            <li> Smudges easily during application for a natural or smokey look.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I liked l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s extra intense liquid liner and wanted to compare it</li>
            <li> Slides and looks better in the lower eyelid than in the upper eyelid.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s one of the reason I got it in the first place......</li>
            <li> I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to draw a proper line.  </li>
            <li> This one is sooo smooth and soft and stays on pretty well through the day.  </li>
            <li> Product recommended from a friend &amp; I REALLY like it!</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is pretty</li>
            <li> This point came amazingly precise and was ultra soft to apply.  </li>
            <li> color is Ok for Asian.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and easy to apply, leaves an intense black layer.</li>
            <li> I have many pencils I tried a few times and threw out because thy just didn&#x27;t apply easily.  </li>
            <li> Another feature that I am thankful for is how easily this washes off with my gentle cleanser and a soft face cloth.</li>
            <li> It does run easily, and smudge, if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Can draw a fine line or thick line with ease and if you want that smoky look smudges nicely.  </li>
            <li> , it works best when its not super sharp.</li>
            <li> It really works well on the waterline, lasting about 6 hours, even in Texas heat. :)</li>
            <li> Ok, as long as everyone knows how much they are paying for something that you could normally buy as a full stick for under $5....</li>
            <li> I really like this product as it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Has a nice dark color and stays all day</li>
            <li> I really love this eyeliner as it has a rich black color and smudgy, smoldering, smoky eye look!</li>
            <li> looks so for people like me who prefer a more thinner, more subtle line, this just didn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the make up stays, goes on super easy</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is super easy to apply as it glides right across your eyelid with very little effort.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have been using the same stick, everyday, for a year now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than I expected</li>
            <li> I really like this eye liner.</li>
            <li> Can;t really use liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> so after much deliberation I decided to buy this pencil.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really like it much for this reason..and who like smudged eyeliner anyways..</li>
            <li> otherwise nothing much else..do not recommend this..</li>
            <li> very disappointed😔</li>
            <li> While this eyeliner can be smudged very well for the effect you want, it stays in place very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to you</li>
            <li> you really hit the jackpot on this one...and please no changes or improvements  </li>
            <li> but it really pulls.  </li>
            <li> That eyeliner&#x27;s formula stays on longer and doesn&#x27;t need as much sharpening and is much darker than this pencil.</li>
            <li> Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner, Intense Black&amp;#34; to stay on without smudging.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times, but this glides on perfectly and has a super black color.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I would like, and smudges really easily.</li>
            <li> The line I get is so thin, clean and nice</li>
            <li> It glides on SUPER easy, is VERY black, and stays reasonably put (for the price).</li>
            <li> If you want dramatic eyes, this is a great product that will give you the enhancement you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> May need to apply about 3-4 times in a day but overall, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> This will be my new go-to eyeliner!</li>
            <li> The black color seems to make my eyes more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Decent eyeliner for the price.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it smudges easily and often ends up on my upper lid if I am not careful to blot it.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this to everyone.  </li>
            <li> eyeliner gives you the ability to go super dark/bold or just soft and light depending on how heavily you apply it.</li>
            <li> so it makes it look like I have natural eyeliner on my waterline till I take extra time to clean it</li>
            <li> Its so dark and creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The only con I find is that it doesn&#x27;t lasts for long, specially if there is some hot weather going on.</li>
            <li> This had such huge potential.</li>
            <li> the only thing nice about it is that its very black..</li>
            <li> Its really disappointing because it goes on beautifully....</li>
            <li> So if you normally have sensitive eyes, I would proceed with caution on this.</li>
            <li> so I was happily surprised when there was one in the package!</li>
            <li> I have older skin, not very firm, and very soft sensitive lid areas.  </li>
            <li> After I ordered it, I was thinking I would need to run to Target in the next week or so to get a large size sharpener</li>
            <li> I have not had to use it yet on this eyeliner, but I used it on my lipliner, and it was super sharp.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is soft so it doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes.</li>
            <li> I can color my waterline with no trouble at all.  </li>
            <li> so you can make it as precise as you want without destroying the tip.  </li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve found &amp;#34;stila Stay All Day</li>
            <li> It stays put all day and I love that it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> smudges but nice dark black</li>
            <li> : The pencil is too short, Needs to be reapplied occasionally throughout the day, Gets oily/smudges in hot weather</li>
            <li> Only problem is that the color doesn&#x27;t apply solidly on my waterline and mostly disappears after a few hours.</li>
            <li> This pencil is huge and works so well!I never use the smaller pencils anymore because this one goes on dark!</li>
            <li> Thick point makes it easy to draw on varies line thickness.</li>
            <li> The pencil is so soft and comfortable to apply and gives your eye a thick line of eyeliner since the pencil is fat.</li>
            <li> I am very fussy when it comes to eyeliner, and this one fulfills every single requirement.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll need to be sharpening this eyeliner more than usual especially if worn daily.</li>
            <li> It stays on pretty well, and also works for my sensitive water line and tight line areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very rich black color, as dark as liquid liners.</li>
            <li> It delivers a clean, dark line for my lower lash waterline that stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this for things such as dramatic winged eyes etc or that kind of effect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s important for me to find an eyeliner that stays on without smudging or disappearing for at least 8 hours because I work as a hostess at a fast-paced restaurant</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s soft enough to go on without yanking your eyelid.</li>
            <li> One personal benefit is that I can&#x27;t seem to get it cleaned off my waterline completely if I&#x27;m in a rush</li>
            <li> Color is stunning and dramatic</li>
            <li> The only issue i have is that you need to sharper it in order to be able to draw a thin line.</li>
            <li> Too thick, not very long-lasting and somehow most of the eyeliners don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Price is about the same as major drugstores.</li>
            <li> I go for the messy look anyways, but buyers be aware it doesn&#x27;t set like a liquid will.</li>
            <li> Though this eyeliner does go on smooth, you do realize you&#x27;re purchasing less than half a stick of eyeliner for $7?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a very charcoal black or something like that.</li>
            <li> The formula is very creamy and black and it glides on in one swipe.</li>
            <li> Bonus: the sharpener is larger than the standard &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; option in dual sharpeners, so I was able to use it to sharpen Clinique lipstick crayons and an old Benefit Bad Gal liner that had broken off, and I didn&#x27;t have a sharpener that would fit it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t run, easy to apply and stays on for at least a few hours.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m running out later I can easily freshen it up as needed since it merely wears away and doesn&#x27;t smear all over the place or cake up.  </li>
            <li> I do wear a primer underneath for long lasting wear</li>
            <li> Long lasting product.</li>
            <li> Only critique is it fades some after a long day</li>
            <li> Other more expensive pencils (MAC ProLongwear) are comperable but, runs about $20.</li>
            <li> The formula is okay, it does transfer above my lid which is super annoying!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting eye liner on straight.  </li>
            <li> The point is very thin so you can draw a fine line if you like.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great for me because I hate the mess of sharpening</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that i don&#x27;t ahve to work hard or press down too hard to get the color that i want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not much different than my other brand.</li>
            <li> The liner lasts for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal usually makes very pigmented black liners.</li>
            <li> I have oily lids and ended up with black smudges on my upper eyelids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a eye liner like the one wet seal use to sell years ago.  </li>
            <li> The pencil lasts, even if you use heavy liner daily.</li>
            <li> That saved 3 of my cosmetic items, so was worth the price even if the liner was lame</li>
            <li> I found kohl is not fine as it was initially at the time of applying.</li>
            <li> It has strange black pigment.  </li>
            <li> Very black, Not too smudge-y, Feels lightweight, Not waxy, Sharpens smoothly especially with accompanying sharpener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a little too black for me, so next time I may order the brown.  </li>
            <li> I would not trade this eyeliner for any other I&#x27;ve ever bought and used.  </li>
            <li> It was during Christmas and we were getting a lot of stuff meant for other people</li>
            <li> It is easily applicable, but it smudges so badly.</li>
            <li> I am horrible at applying eyeliner and have tried every different kind and style imaginable from gels to liquids to pencils.</li>
            <li> In fact, this will be the ONLY liner product I buy (for as long as I can find it anyway, I tend to have bad luck with products disappearing when I like them haha).</li>
            <li> I have a hard time buying eyeliner for my waterline due to all allergies but this last all day with out having to re apply</li>
            <li> Very intense color and looks dramatic!</li>
            <li> The only downside to me is that it is hard to get it all off as it settles in all the spaces between your lashes -</li>
            <li> I received one of these from my sister and adored the dark effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only downside is that it is not smudge proof - but that is the least of your worries!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love it, as a base, to line your eye, my husband use it to caver bald spots in his mustache or beard.</li>
            <li> It glide very easily, it&#x27;s SO black,</li>
            <li> Leaves your eye smokey and black for hours n hours...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always searching for a black liner that will stay put on my water line.</li>
            <li> that being said, if you&#x27;re looking for black eyeliner, this is BLACK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> find that at the end of the day, I have black rings under my eyes and the outer corners of my eye</li>
            <li> I set mine with a little black eye shadow so it stays put after I put this on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn black eyeliner every day for years and have never had this much trouble getting eyeliner to stay put.</li>
            <li> a side note because it is so creamy, sometimes it will smudge a little.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s extremely affordable!!</li>
            <li> It will tend to be to wide of line if you press to hard</li>
            <li> I used this liner everyday.</li>
            <li> It makes me want to put some on everyday</li>
            <li> A bit messy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very black</li>
            <li> Unfortunately even with primer (Urban Decay Primer Potion is my fave), this stuff smears all over the place on me within a few hours.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to make a dozen lines like with ordinary skinny pencil eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Usually eye pencils are difficult for me to use because the point is not fine enough or the pencil is hard.  </li>
            <li> But watch how hard you press.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;glide, it&#x27;s hard to resharpen, I don&#x27;t recommend this product, or</li>
            <li> but it is just too hard to put on.</li>
            <li> There is no rubbing or scrubbing that will irritate the delicate skin around the eye</li>
            <li> I would never have tried this liner pencil without reading the reviews as it looks so thick</li>
            <li> I like the thick of it.&lt;br /&gt;Recommed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive replacement for my Lancome pencils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an eyeliner girl, i&#x27;m not good at doing it.</li>
            <li> Not good for water line.</li>
            <li> Not good for waterline&lt;</li>
            <li> Thick or thin lines can be made with this pencil.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> But otherwise I would recommend it to eye makeup  addicted people.</li>
            <li> Other brands keep changing their formula leaving me disappointed when I repurchase.</li>
            <li> It is my go to eye liner for casual occasions</li>
            <li> For creating a smudgy, smoky eye, just use the side of the pencil point and the result is very dramatic.</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> That or it got tossed out by accident in the mad rush of Christmas.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I hate putting on eyeliner</li>
            <li> I am always weary of cheaper eyeliners because I don&#x27;t want them to run/smudge all over (without my doing so) and look awful during the day.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It does come off but I still love it.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES the colour, and how it applies and such, but the product was delivered WITHOUT the sharpener.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, stays in place, I like very much</li>
            <li> THIS EYELINER ROCKS!! SUPER GREAT PRODUCT..FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> Love it. Going to reorder.</li>
            <li> easy to use but not waterproof</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a eye liner like the one wet seal use to sell years ago.  This one is very similar and I&#x27;ll buy again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome. My mom loves them and I had to reorder them.</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy to apply.  But watch how hard you press.  It will tend to be to wide of line if you press to hard</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this eyeliner. It gives you a perfect thick line every time. I will never buy another eyeliner. Sharpens to the perfect point for when you want a thinner line.</li>
            <li> I wore this for about two weeks, tried all the tricks I knew to get the eyeliner to stay put without any luck, it was smudged above my lids, below my bottom lashes....everywhere it could reach on its own. I&#x27;ve worn black eyeliner every day for years and have never had this much trouble getting eyeliner to stay put. Its really disappointing because it goes on beautifully....it just doesn&#x27;t stay where it belongs.</li>
            <li> I used this liner everyday. The pencil lasts, even if you use heavy liner daily. It comes with a sharpener. It stays on pretty well, and also works for my sensitive water line and tight line areas. It&#x27;s a very rich black color, as dark as liquid liners. L&#x27;Oreal usually makes very pigmented black liners.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner ever. All day wear. I have a hard time buying eyeliner for my waterline due to all allergies but this last all day with out having to re apply</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on smoothly every time.  If you want dramatic eyes, this is a great product that will give you the enhancement you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> This eye liner didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes after i applied it to my water line. The only issue i have is that you need to sharper it in order to be able to draw a thin line. Over all really good pencil, best price too</li>
            <li> Too thick, not very long-lasting and somehow most of the eyeliners don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It is so nice .I really love  it ,also it is good prise.</li>
            <li> So I have to say I love how easy this is to put on.  It simply glides on.  I have a hard time getting eye liner on straight.  This is amazing, it is easy to put on.  I set mine with a little black eye shadow so it stays put after I put this on.  I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> OMG. This eyeliner is amazing . I can&#x27;t find any word to describe it. Go ahead and buy it girls. Perfect</li>
            <li> This eyeliner was recommended by a friend. It really works well on the waterline, lasting about 6 hours, even in Texas heat. :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than I expected</li>
            <li> Perfect for getting the cat eye look.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.. But I didn&#x27;t receive the sharpener. I need to search for a big sharpener since the pencil is thicker than regular pencils.</li>
            <li> Excellent eye liner for the waterline.  I have only used it a few times, but this glides on perfectly and has a super black color.  It&#x27;s almost a little too black for me, so next time I may order the brown.  The liner lasts for a very long time.  By the end of the day it still looks pretty good in AZ warm weather, but you&#x27;d need to reapply for it to look perfect.  The pencil sharpener was great.  I have not had to use it yet on this eyeliner, but I used it on my lipliner, and it was super sharp.</li>
            <li> smudges but nice dark black</li>
            <li> Easy to apply on and not smudge. The eyeliner is soft so it doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes. The thickness of the eyeliner makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Glides smoothly but does not stay all day</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Thick point makes it easy to draw on varies line thickness. Price is about the same as major drugstores.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye liner. I purchased one in a local store and they quit stocking it so of course I checked Amazon and found them here! The pencil is a good size and is easy to use. It goes on very smoothly with no tugging or pulling. I hope Amazon keeps carrying this product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t run, easy to apply and stays on for at least a few hours. May need to apply about 3-4 times in a day but overall, not bad at all. the sharpener is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Can;t really use liquid eyeliner so I opted for this one. It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as creamy as a gel liner, but in a pencil form! Very bold color, absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;As a side note because it is so creamy, sometimes it will smudge a little. I go for the messy look anyways, but buyers be aware it doesn&#x27;t set like a liquid will.</li>
            <li> Love this line for my waterline. Its so dark and creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had .. I love it! It&#x27;s very black and it&#x27;s worth your money .. It makes me want to put some on everyday</li>
            <li> love it.also put it on my monthy  subscription</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this eyeliner. Goes on smooth and looks very good! This will be my new go-to eyeliner!</li>
            <li> As i read that product is inspired by kajal but I don&#x27;t think so because I m using kajal from 10 years and it was not like the kajal..The best part is that product is very smooth while using but what I dislike most that it is not smudge free after some time I found kohl is not fine as it was initially at the time of applying.</li>
            <li> I really like this product as it is exactly what I wanted. It goes on very easily and lasts all day. It was inexpensive as well. The only downside to me is that it is hard to get it all off as it settles in all the spaces between your lashes - which is part of why it looks so good.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used, and it doesn&#x27;t look dark grey like the others.  And it&#x27;s soft enough to go on without yanking your eyelid.</li>
            <li> This had such huge potential. So much to like about this product: the low price, the great sharpener that&#x27;s included. I love the depth of the dark brown color, and I love how beautifully it applies - no tugging or skipping. Smudges easily during application for a natural or smokey look. Unfortunately even with primer (Urban Decay Primer Potion is my fave), this stuff smears all over the place on me within a few hours. I have hooded lids and it ends up all over my upper lid, and also smudges below my lower lashes for the raccoon-eye look. Bummer. Ended up throwing it out after trying it five times.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing kohl for 15+ years and I used to use a different kohl pencil (from Pakistan) which I could not find anymore so after much deliberation I decided to buy this pencil.  I absolutely love it.  It has strange black pigment.  It applied easily and smoothly.  Plus it comes with this cool sharpener that does a great job (I have used it to sharpen my other eye pencils).&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to everyone.  No irritation. Easy to work with.  Smudges nicely for the smoky eye effect as well and goes well on the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used kajar eyeliner before and it tends to smudge, this is no different, especially if you use it on the lower eyelids, preferable for the upper eyelid..don&#x27;t really like it much for this reason..and who like smudged eyeliner anyways..the only thing nice about it is that its very black..otherwise nothing much else..do not recommend this..</li>
            <li> This is a great shade of black. It&#x27;s like a very charcoal black or something like that. It is my go to eye liner for casual occasions (works great for smokey eyes too). The only con I find is that it doesn&#x27;t lasts for long, specially if there is some hot weather going on.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth. Slides and looks better in the lower eyelid than in the upper eyelid. Smudges lot easily by rubbing the eye. But otherwise I would recommend it to eye makeup  addicted people. Gives a nice touch to the naked eye.</li>
            <li> This was a great eyeliner for the waterline</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an eyeliner girl, i&#x27;m not good at doing it. But this stuff is easy to apply, and easy to build color with. It does run easily, and smudge, if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> It glide very easily, it&#x27;s SO black, it&#x27;s waxy so it can be smudging :)</li>
            <li> I am horrible at applying eyeliner and have tried every different kind and style imaginable from gels to liquids to pencils. Nothing has ever gone on my eyes well. I have older skin, not very firm, and very soft sensitive lid areas.  I bought this pencil in brown and gray from a local store with a coupon from L&#x27;Oreal for about $2.74 each to give them a try. The very first time I used it I had perfectly lined eyes. It glides on smooth, fills in the nooks and crannies and does not pull my skin (but I do I hold the skin taut when applying as I do with any product). I don&#x27;t understand what people are doing that say the line is too fat, maybe they haven&#x27;t sharpened it well enough. The line I get is so thin, clean and nice that I actually end up intently smudging it with a brush just to fatten it out a bit. Thinner and cleaner than any eyeliner pen/liquid/gel I&#x27;ve ever tried.  The only drawback is it will smudge and wear if you don&#x27;t set it with powder but unless I&#x27;m rubbing my eyes because my allergies are acting up, I have beautifully lined eyes the entire work-day and into the evening. If I&#x27;m running out later I can easily freshen it up as needed since it merely wears away and doesn&#x27;t smear all over the place or cake up.  I haven&#x27;t tried the sharpener yet, haven&#x27;t needed to because the point is still nearly perfect even after using it for a couple weeks so can&#x27;t comment on that. I would DEFINITELY buy this product again. In fact, this will be the ONLY liner product I buy (for as long as I can find it anyway, I tend to have bad luck with products disappearing when I like them haha).</li>
            <li> Love it, as a base, to line your eye, my husband use it to caver bald spots in his mustache or beard.</li>
            <li> supposed to come with pencil sharpener and did not! RIP OFF</li>
            <li> This is a repeat buy definitely. It goes on for a daytime look, but you can definitely get a smoky eye with it as well. Blends very easily. This probably means it will be discontinued soon. Hope not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I look at it makes me think of the commercial with the mom that explains her &amp;#34;smoky eye&amp;#34; to her two scared kids.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner! Smudges well, no tug on application. Great for smoky eye. I do wear a primer underneath for long lasting wear</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot because the formula goes on super smooth and creamy and it&#x27;s so easy to do eyeliner with this!! Plus it&#x27;s extremely affordable!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and I have been using it for some time now. Glides ON easily and does not smudge.</li>
            <li> Mine did not come with the sharpener ..... that&#x27;s one of the reason I got it in the first place...... very disappointed😔</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with eye make up, but I think there is something in this one that I&#x27;m allergic to. So if you normally have sensitive eyes, I would proceed with caution on this. Other than that, the make up stays, goes on super easy (i LOVE that feature). Its just that it makes only one eye water a ton which makes the make up run lol.</li>
            <li> its good only negative point its not smudge proof but look great so i like it ..if u want smudge proof go for milani kohl ....</li>
            <li> This pencil is huge and works so well!I never use the smaller pencils anymore because this one goes on dark!</li>
            <li> This never dries. If you touch your eyes a lot you are bound to end up with streaks and smudges all over the place.  It cannot work in the waterline area because it won&#x27;t last and it will run. Even when using a primer this stuff will not stay put I have oily lids and ended up with black smudges on my upper eyelids.</li>
            <li> I would never have tried this liner pencil without reading the reviews as it looks so thick I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to draw a proper line.  Wrong!  This goes on so smooth and without pulling.  I have many pencils I tried a few times and threw out because thy just didn&#x27;t apply easily.  This one is sooo smooth and soft and stays on pretty well through the day.  I can color my waterline with no trouble at all.  Awesome!  I bought several colors I liked this so much.  I always used a liquid liner with a brush.  This is so much easier and works great.  It comes with it&#x27;s own perfect sharpener so you can make it as precise as you want without destroying the tip.  Nice!</li>
            <li> Just like the Stila Kajal eyeliner, this is one of the best eyeliners out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Applies easily, Smokey look, Very black, Not too smudge-y, Feels lightweight, Not waxy, Sharpens smoothly especially with accompanying sharpener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The pencil is too short, Needs to be reapplied occasionally throughout the day, Gets oily/smudges in hot weather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final words: For the price, you get a smokey eyeliner that applies well and feels lightweight. The price is absolutely fantastic for the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner will smudge after a while especially if it&#x27;s hot and you get oily or sweat, (but most eyeliners will do this unless they&#x27;re waterproof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner gives you the ability to go super dark/bold or just soft and light depending on how heavily you apply it. If you set the eyeliner with some powder or use primer, then your eye makeup will stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this eyeliner, you get more than what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li> I am very fussy when it comes to eyeliner, and this one fulfills every single requirement. I love kohl eyeliners, they glide on smoothly and effortlessly, and I barely apply any pressure during my application. Since this eyeliner does not tug at my eyelid, there are no blank spaces, or ‘skipped over’ spots. I generally prefer a medium line, but a fine precise line is created easily by sharpening the point with the sharpener that is included, which is a nice and useful addition. For me, it has staying power, which I cannot get from all eyeliners, and yet I do not have any smearing problems from this eyeliner at all. For creating a smudgy, smoky eye, just use the side of the pencil point and the result is very dramatic. It delivers a clean, dark line for my lower lash waterline that stays for a long time. Another feature that I am thankful for is how easily this washes off with my gentle cleanser and a soft face cloth. There is no rubbing or scrubbing that will irritate the delicate skin around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, this liner is perfection. It is easy to apply, glides on smooth, does not smudge or give me the ‘raccoon look’, stays put for hours, easy to remove, provides intense color and makes my eyes pop!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t glide like I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend. Love it. The gray is almost black which is perfect. I love how easy it glides on. I hate putting on eyeliner but this product changed my mind!</li>
            <li> Well Done Loreal, you do it this time with the eye smoldering liner that tops off all brands. Leaves your eye smokey and black for hours n hours... Best thing about is it doesnt fade or smudge or sear around, it actually stays in place. Definetly a re-purchase as well as reccomended.</li>
            <li> Great product! The cost-benefit can not be beaten. Very smooth and easy to apply, leaves an intense black layer. Can be used as eyeliner or below the eyes, smudging after drawing the line.</li>
            <li> Product recommended from a friend &amp; I REALLY like it! After I ordered it, I was thinking I would need to run to Target in the next week or so to get a large size sharpener so I was happily surprised when there was one in the package!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. I am always weary of cheaper eyeliners because I don&#x27;t want them to run/smudge all over (without my doing so) and look awful during the day. While this eyeliner can be smudged very well for the effect you want, it stays in place very well. Even better if you use a primer underneath. Excellent for dark, solid lines as well as smokey lines.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth as silk and doesn&#x27;t tug or scratch. The only eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried that actually works to line the lower rim.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it smudges easily and often ends up on my upper lid if I am not careful to blot it.  I like the smoky look that it can easily give, but I wish it would stay put.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive replacement for my Lancome pencils. After trying 3 or 4 (whose cost added up to the same as my Lancome!) I found this one to be the only one that was close to the lancome in smoothness of application, blending capability, and lasting through the day.</li>
            <li> I am not exprienced with makeup and this is soooo easy to use. And it stays in place. My favorite part is that i don&#x27;t ahve to work hard or press down too hard to get the color that i want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works great.</li>
            <li> ive been using this eyeliner for about a year and it works perfectly all the time. i would recommend this eyeliner for anyone!!!</li>
            <li> I would not trade this eyeliner for any other I&#x27;ve ever bought and used.  It stays on all day and it looks good on me.  I love the way it goes on soft &amp; smoothly without me having to tug at my skin.  Thanks to you L&#x27;Oreal...you really hit the jackpot on this one...and please no changes or improvements  This one is a winner!</li>
            <li> to bulky, I ended up using a brush, then applying .  It doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;glide, it&#x27;s hard to resharpen, I don&#x27;t recommend this product, or&lt;br /&gt;perhaps, I&#x27;m just to amature-ish for this product lol</li>
            <li> I was lusting after this eyeliner for a while and I figured I&#x27;d try it. I LOVE it. I&#x27;m so glad I invested in it. I use it a lot for my waterline and smudging. It stays put all day and I love that it&#x27;s thick so I don&#x27;t have to make a dozen lines like with ordinary skinny pencil eyeliners.</li>
            <li> She likes the fat size eye liner and says it works great and is easy to hold in her hand</li>
            <li> Decent eyeliner for the price. I like that it came with its own sharpener. The pencil itself is nice and great for a smokey eye.</li>
            <li> My favorite black eyeliner...quickest way for perfect winged eyeliner is to use this product.  I prefer it to brushes or liquid any day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always searching for a black liner that will stay put on my water line. Other brands keep changing their formula leaving me disappointed when I repurchase. I hope Loreal doesn&#x27;t do that with this pencil. It glides on SUPER easy, is VERY black, and stays reasonably put (for the price). Other more expensive pencils (MAC ProLongwear) are comperable but, runs about $20. Bonus: the sharpener is larger than the standard &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; option in dual sharpeners, so I was able to use it to sharpen Clinique lipstick crayons and an old Benefit Bad Gal liner that had broken off, and I didn&#x27;t have a sharpener that would fit it. That saved 3 of my cosmetic items, so was worth the price even if the liner was lame (it wasn&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and nicely! Very intense color and looks dramatic! I wear this everyday and LOVE it! I gave it 4 stars because it tends to smudge and I have to keep it in check.</li>
            <li> A good eyeliner to have, it works best when its not super sharp.</li>
            <li> Best eye liner I have ever tried! Love it. Will be ordering faithfully!</li>
            <li> By far the best eye liner!! It goes on so freaking easy and stays on all day. It&#x27;s really easy to get this eye liner right into your lash line for that deeper volume lash look. Plus you just can&#x27;t be the price.</li>
            <li> I like  product and your service.</li>
            <li> its alright..still runs</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is pretty but it does smudge. I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this eyeliner. It doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I would like, and smudges really easily.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. Awesome stuff. It comes out so nice after application. I&#x27;ll buy it again. O o o o</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! Goes on so easy and smooth!</li>
            <li> Though this eyeliner does go on smooth, you do realize you&#x27;re purchasing less than half a stick of eyeliner for $7? Ok, as long as everyone knows how much they are paying for something that you could normally buy as a full stick for under $5....</li>
            <li> Okay for the price.  A bit messy.  Not good for water line.</li>
            <li> The formula is very creamy and black and it glides on in one swipe. However I did not receive a sharpener</li>
            <li> Love how smooth and easy the eyeliner glides on. Met my expections.</li>
            <li> Usually eye pencils are difficult for me to use because the point is not fine enough or the pencil is hard.  This point came amazingly precise and was ultra soft to apply.  Very easy to line the tear line.  It will be a staple of mine going forward - love that it comes with a sharpener.</li>
            <li> I had hopes that this would be a good eyeliner but it really pulls.  Has a nice dark color and stays all day but it is just too hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, easy to use on your waterline, very pigmented and glides on smooth. Love this product</li>
            <li> I really love this eyeliner as it has a rich black color and smudgy, smoldering, smoky eye look! The pencil is so soft and comfortable to apply and gives your eye a thick line of eyeliner since the pencil is fat. Very happy with this L&#x27;Oreal Paris eyeliner!</li>
            <li> This goes on smooth.  That&#x27;s the good part.  Then it proceeds to melt all over your eyes.  Smoldering is right.  You&#x27;ll look like a clown.</li>
            <li> I think this pencil is like a 6/10. The formula is okay, it does transfer above my lid which is super annoying! This pencil is better suited for smokey eyes or thicker lined looks so for people like me who prefer a more thinner, more subtle line, this just didn&#x27;t cut it for me. You probably can use it but you&#x27;ll need to be sharpening this eyeliner more than usual especially if worn daily. I bought it because I liked l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s extra intense liquid liner and wanted to compare it but I know now that I&#x27;ll just be sticking to that one. That eyeliner&#x27;s formula stays on longer and doesn&#x27;t need as much sharpening and is much darker than this pencil. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, however it never came. I&#x27;ll have to go to the drugstore to buy it or order it again. It was during Christmas and we were getting a lot of stuff meant for other people so I suspect someone has a great L&#x27;oreal product they didn&#x27;t order. That or it got tossed out by accident in the mad rush of Christmas.</li>
            <li> Long lasting product. Used all week and still have not put a dent in point.</li>
            <li> It makes a beautiful line and would recommend it.Great eyeliner by L&#x27;Oreal Paris Hoping for more great makeup from L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Pencil works well but the sharpener is garbage..... it ruined the pencil and does work well....</li>
            <li> I received one of these from my sister and adored the dark effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, if you&#x27;re looking for black eyeliner, this is BLACK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is super easy to apply as it glides right across your eyelid with very little effort. I have been using it for 5 months now and still have yet to have to sharpen it! That&#x27;s great for me because I hate the mess of sharpening eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;The actual eyeliner stick is thick which enables you to have a firm grasp around it, ensuring you have more control over where it gets applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it is not smudge proof - but that is the least of your worries!&lt;br /&gt;I find that at the end of the day, I have black rings under my eyes and the outer corners of my eye look as though they begin to drip.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t necessarily have the time to fix my makeup during the work day, but if you keep a q-tip in your makeup bag, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for you as it is very easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> I use a much more expensive eyeliner by &amp;#34;Urban Decay&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t want to spend $20+ anymore. This pencil is not bad. It comes with a sharpener and It glides on smoothly. The point is very thin so you can draw a fine line if you like. Its not much different than my other brand. It seems to last all day with no smudging. The price is right and I would use this again. I may try to find this in blue.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. Ive ordered it twice already.  It goes on smoothly. I will order it again!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the rundown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Color is stunning and dramatic&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on solidly&lt;br /&gt;- Good for the cheap price&lt;br /&gt;- Came with own sharpener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Smudges and runs after a couple hours (not meant for oily skin)&lt;br /&gt;- Not good for waterline&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian with hooded eyes and oily skin. I also wear contacts so my eyes get runny.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, on my quest for eyeliners, this one definitely will not be on my list. It is easily applicable, but it smudges so badly. One personal benefit is that I can&#x27;t seem to get it cleaned off my waterline completely if I&#x27;m in a rush so it makes it look like I have natural eyeliner on my waterline till I take extra time to clean it off.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important for me to find an eyeliner that stays on without smudging or disappearing for at least 8 hours because I work as a hostess at a fast-paced restaurant and there is no time for me to dwell on whether my eyeliner is still on or not! So this is a no-no for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve found &amp;#34;stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner, Intense Black&amp;#34; to stay on without smudging. Only problem is that the color doesn&#x27;t apply solidly on my waterline and mostly disappears after a few hours. But the rest stays on all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish this eyeliner wouldn&#x27;t smudge and actually stay on. Then, this would have been my absolute favorite eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like the sharpener has more use than the eyeliner this time.</li>
            <li> Can draw a fine line or thick line with ease and if you want that smoky look smudges nicely.  Love how it comes with the sharpener.  Since i reorder, I have several of the sharpeners which I passed along to the kids to sharpen the jumbo pencils and crayons.</li>
            <li> very easy application</li>
            <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;The color is Ok for Asian. And it is easy to apply. I like the thick of it.&lt;br /&gt;Recommed.</li>
            <li> I find this eye pencil easy to handle and control. Thick or thin lines can be made with this pencil. The black color seems to make my eyes more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Great black eye pencil.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get pencil sharpener.  The liner goes on well, real happy ;)</li>
            <li> Great product, I have been using the same stick, everyday, for a year now.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is perfect. You dont have to sharpen it very often, it stays put and its easy to apply. Very favorite eyeliner by far. Only critique is it fades some after a long day but I dont care if I have to reapply at night if Im going out. Now they just need to make tons more colors!</li>
            <li> This is very good one and i absolutely love this pencil. Very easy to use and correct. Good idea for providing the sharpener.</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this for things such as dramatic winged eyes etc or that kind of effect. Howver if youre lining the inside of your eyelid, this is prettt much the perfect black eyeliner. I keep buying it over and over and evrything else I have tried in its stead now disappoints. This is a staple i my makyup bag</li>
