            <li>My hair is significantly softer to the touch and looks healthier.  </li>

            <li>After a wonderful experience at the hair salon, I splashed out on my most expensive conduit we ever, but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>My Daughters are much younger and have beautiful hair naturally</li>
            <li>This is the best deep conditioner I have found to restore vitality, moisture that doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down and makes it shiny as well.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and even when I use the hot iron, it remains soft and smelling nice:</li>

            <li>Let me tell you what I did first, i washed my hair with an claifying shampoo then</li>
            <li>After I was done with all of that I used the morrocan oil treamemt witch driedmy hair pretty fast</li>
            <li>I also love the Moroccan oil spray, 3 sprays on my long hair is all it takes.</li>
            <li>Moroccanoil Intense Mask&lt;br /&gt;for hair.</li>

            <li> Natural and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my very curly thick hair.  </li>

            <li> After you wash your hair, you need to towel dry it well.  </li>
            <li> What can I say it delivers what it said it would do on my dry brittle relaxed hair.</li>

            <li> A bit disappointed that it would not be packaged safely.  </li>
            <li> This product is definitely for thick and curly hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to Kerastase by L&#x27;Oreal for thick hair...</li>
            <li> About half of it leaked around during the the 2 weeks of trying to get it &#x27;warrantied&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but when you can&#x27;t find anything else that won&#x27;t add body while adding moisture, this is the product to use.  </li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> me and my sister are completely crazy about it.</li>
            <li> beauty saloon quality without paying the outrageous amount they charge.</li>

            <li> Great product, got here in time just as promissed, my wife is very pleased with the positive results of Morrocan Oil.</li>
            <li> I live in a low humidity environment and a mask is a must.  This is the best product I have ever used.  I have curly hair I dry straight and flat iron and my hair is in great shape, shiny and soft.  I use this once a week and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Excellent good experience.</li>
            <li> Very, very good. The products are very special and I a usually for all tipes pieces, cases for the stores recently.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! Leaves my hair feeling like silk!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  I would be gray if I didn&#x27;t dye my hair every 4-6 weeks.  My hair texture is unruly and dry and fly-away but not so using this product.  My hair is soft and easy to curl and shiny.  I have received many complements.  My Daughters are much younger and have beautiful hair naturally but they use it also for the shine and manageability.</li>
            <li> Love this mask!  I wash my color-treated hair alot, but my stylist is always telling me how great my hair feels.  We think it is the Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> This works so beautifully and softens my hair since it is subjected to a lot of hair coloring; and probably over washing.  And it makes your hair smell beautiful, like roses in a summer breeze.  It leaves my hair very soft and even when I use the hot iron, it remains soft and smelling nice: no greasiness at all.  I love it.  After a wonderful experience at the hair salon, I splashed out on my most expensive conduit we ever, but it was worth it.  It is a nice once a week treat!</li>
            <li> Very good Product. Hidrate the hair, letting it soft and smooth.l l l l l l l l l l</li>
            <li> this is my third moroccanoil mask. me and my sister are completely crazy about it. beauty saloon quality without paying the outrageous amount they charge.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve had in years. Natural and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my very curly thick hair.  The other type is thicker with the orange top. Good to use once a month. Tis I use weekly.. Great not overly flower smell. Fantastic !</li>
            <li> I bought 4 products from this brand (Intense Hydrating Mask, Restorative Hair Mask, Hydrating Styling Cream and Oil Treatment) and I love them ... especially the oil that is phenomenal. I love the smell and the hair is wonderful. Today I went to the hairdresser (for the New Year:)) and for the 1st time she praised my hair ... said he was treated well and very healthy! HEALTHY! I was amazed and very happy. :)  This mask is excellent, but it seems that the combination of other products make the difference ... especially oil. I highly recommend it.  Sílvia, Portugal</li>
            <li> I read about this mask in Oprah magazine and decided to give it a try.  I home color my hair.  My hair dresser and my husband have both been telling me my hair feels, &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; (crunchy?!?).  I bought this off Amazon as it was significantly cheaper than in my salon.  Within a week I could feel the difference.  It smells wonderful.  My hair is significantly softer to the touch and looks healthier.  It&#x27;s a high maintenance product, to be sure (at least for me who doesn&#x27;t spend a lot of time on her hair).  After you wash your hair, you need to towel dry it well.  Then add the Moroccan Oil to ends and comb through entire head.  I then cover my hair with a shower cap to let it sit for four to seven minutes.  I only do this once a week, but it has truly made a difference.</li>
            <li> I have received this item, label is coming off. The smell and texture is not the same as the one I purchased from the hair salon. Becareful buyers, if you think that you are saving money by buying it online. Turn out I have to spend 15.00 on return shipping. what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Love this mask! Makes my hair silky and soft! My go-to hydration treatment.</li>
            <li> You must try leaving it in your hair overnight or while you are sunbathing! Your hair will smell amazing for days.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, so do I. Her hair is shining and exhaling a very good scent. I woud recommend this product to every women in the world.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product Moroccanoil Intense Mask&lt;br /&gt;for hair. It got to me very fast, the price and shiping was&lt;br /&gt;afordable. I Thank You.&lt;br /&gt;lil_rhodey_in_sc@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> This does not look like what I ordered. Had some breakage and took it to the salon to show what I was using and was quickly made aware that this is not the same product. It is a fraud.  Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner I have found to restore vitality, moisture that doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down and makes it shiny as well.  I also, once hair is rinsed and dryed, use one pump of the morrocan oil daily in wet hair before blow dry and the combo is shiny soft effect.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely for thick and curly hair...Everybody was telling me how great this product is, but unfortunately not for my type.. I&#x27;m going to try the repair mask... If is the same as the hydration type I&#x27;m going back to Kerastase by L&#x27;Oreal for thick hair...</li>
            <li> I like this product cause it is really good from my hair and i have definately seen an improvement which is great!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, red (graying red) hair that is drier the older I get. When I use this mask a couple of times a week every week my hair is so much better. It looks &amp; feels better &amp; is more managable.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but when you can&#x27;t find anything else that won&#x27;t add body while adding moisture, this is the product to use.  Great smell, too!</li>
            <li> my hair has never been softer or healthier&lt;br /&gt;sometimes i just leave it in for hours or even days before i wash it out&lt;br /&gt;changed my hair&#x27;s life</li>
            <li> Uso este produto a mais de um ano e posso dizer sem problema nenhum que &#x27;e um dos melhores que ja usei. Segunda vez que compro com eles. Recomendo</li>
            <li> What can I say it delivers what it said it would do on my dry brittle relaxed hair. Let me tell you what I did first, i washed my hair with an claifying shampoo then,I did a protein treatment using aphoogee 2 step treatment,I put the morrcanoil hydrating mask on my hair concentrating on the ends, put a plastic cap on,sat under a dryer for about 30 min and rinsed. After I was done with all of that I used the morrocan oil treamemt witch driedmy hair pretty fast so I didn&#x27;t need to use a blow dryer then I sprayed my hair with joico straightening thermal sprayed and straighten my hair with my sedu straightner (witch works wonders) then I was done. The results?AMAZING considering the fact that this was a fist time use. Im convinced that this stuff works and will be purchasing more from the morrocanoil line!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the large 16 size and it arrived cracked and broken.  Rather than mail it back and return it for a nonbroke one they offered to send me a free 8 oz one.  A bit disappointed that it would not be packaged safely.  About half of it leaked around during the the 2 weeks of trying to get it &#x27;warrantied&#x27;.  Again their solution was an 8 oz replacement for the 16 oz that was damaged.  Since I was able to use more than half of the broken one I came out even, but it made a bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> Smoothing my dry hair, each use is better and longer lasting.  Expensive but will last a very long time.  I also love the Moroccan oil spray, 3 sprays on my long hair is all it takes.</li>
    </ol>
