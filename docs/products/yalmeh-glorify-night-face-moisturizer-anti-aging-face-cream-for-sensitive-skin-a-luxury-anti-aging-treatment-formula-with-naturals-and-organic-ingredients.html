            <li>Looking forward to a beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>It spread beautifully, wasn&#x27;t greasy, and my skin sucked in that hydration and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The container is equally as beautiful.</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always thought Aloe Vera is great for skin</li>
            <li>As of now, happy of my purchase.</li>
            <li>But with that said - it&#x27;s been a great week for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Also whats great about this product is that it does not make your skin look greasy and shiny, so you can&#x27;t tell that you put something on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can imagine that being a great feature for those with oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it would work best in warm weather as it sort of needs to \\&quot;melt\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Their suggestions are great.</li>
            <li>This cream has been great to me.</li>
            <li>Great product for moisturizer purposes.</li>
            <li>My makeup looks great with the cream underneath it</li>
            <li>I took it to my dermatologist and he said it&#x27;s great for eczema as well.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I am totally happy with this cream</li>
            <li>Feels great on her face and doesn&#x27;t make her skin feel oily.</li>
            <li>Also great that it has a guarantee</li>
            <li>This exfoliate is great, but if someone think they are purchasing a face moisturizer or cream, this is neither.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the reviews but it didn&#x27;t expect it to be amazing!</li>
            <li>Warm Regards Everyone!</li>
            <li>The thing about this product that impressed me the most, was it&#x27;s ability to fade age spots/sun damage and heal scars.</li>

            <li>DEFINITELY A GOOD FACE MOISTURIZER AND A GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li>We are always looking for the best thing because we are never quite satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>Both smell amazingly good</li>
            <li>how good it smells.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Does not smell good because no perfume inside</li>
            <li>the smell is good</li>
            <li>This creme HAS to clog pores, I expect I will be getting some break-outs, but to be fair I will give it a chance as a night creme.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s hoping it is every bit as good as the reviews claim.</li>
            <li>, he ate 2/3 of jar, must of been good , my fault.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and in  good condition.</li>
            <li>makes it a good value.</li>
            <li>It so good, so</li>
            <li>It smells good though.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting and I feel very safe putting it on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to smelling it since so many reviews commented on the \\&quot;great scent\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Product is great, doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or sticky like most others do.</li>

            <li>The Yalmeh aloe vera face moisturizer cream results are truly amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>They both feel so effective and are non-greasy.</li>
            <li>so l had him warm it up between his fingers</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m amazed that my face still feels this nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent product and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Nice costumer serves too.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best face cream we&#x27;ve ever had.</li>

            <li>From a man&#x27;s view this is a unique and very nice product.  </li>
            <li>Light and not sticky with a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>If it can make her that happy, I&#x27;ve really done a good job at selecting a gift for her.  </li>
            <li>My face is so soft in the morning, I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It goes on better if you warm it by rubbing your hands together before application.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much more about how effective it is until I&#x27;ve used it for awhile</li>
            <li>This is the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li>This would make this product even more effective.</li>
            <li>Good customer service is great, but it can&#x27;t replace a product that doesn&#x27;t live up to their claims.</li>
            <li>You can feel how moisturizing it is, as my skin feels very smooth and hydrated, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>It is very light but hydrating and soothing.</li>

            <li>Two weeks into the product and enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>If this cream was a hefty price (like Rosa Arctica and so many others)</li>
            <li>I received an email from customer service before it even arrived telling me they care about my purchase and to be sure and let them know what I think.</li>

            <li>Even better than described.</li>

            <li>I also love the eye cream.</li>
            <li>After using it for 2 weeks it seems OK</li>
            <li>Took a chance on this and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this cream.</li>
            <li>The scent is okay.  </li>
            <li>Many reviews raved about the scent</li>
            <li>I love everything about Yalmeh.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>My skin feels brighter and more toned.</li>
            <li>love the creamy moisture on my face.</li>
            <li>Enjoying the texture of this product and how healthy my skin look throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Please never stop making these for people that love to pamper and take care of the skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li>I love the texture of it on my skin</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but it was time and this one smells amazing and feels rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>I received this product and was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with skin concerns its really great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cool and refreshing when applied.</li>
            <li>Cream is great for normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li>and I do feel like my skin is looking better without ever getting clogged or becoming oily.</li>
            <li>They have ideal products, they follow up all sales IMMEDIATELY and anticipate any potential issues that may arise, AND, they respond to any inquiries at light speed!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine any single cream ever being perfect for everyone.</li>
            <li>It a great product, I do like it so far......</li>
            <li>This product really feels good as soon as you put it on.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my dry skin and goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>This cream leaves your skin very feeling very smooth and it does a nice job of softening the skin.</li>
            <li>The price is great, so I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I get acne easily.  </li>
            <li>With that, it somehow manages to go on nice an smooth and is absorbed easily.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my skin at all and doesnt have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>They both smell almost identical though Yalmeh&#x27;s scent is not as strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of weeks and don&#x27;t have any strong feelings about the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using eye cream &amp; hands down the best eye cream</li>
            <li>Fine lines are diminished.</li>
            <li>you know what&#x27;s, nothing happen he was just fine.</li>
            <li>But I have not seen any improvements regarding fine lines yet.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer which is especially useful during the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li>The eye cream is fabulous too.</li>
            <li>and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it provided the necessary moisturization without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll see what to do I like creams smooth</li>
            <li>Makes applying smooth.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>She keeps telling me to smell her face and how smooth it is.  </li>
            <li>Great product overall and would recommend!</li>
            <li>So far really good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I was looking at other options and found this one with very good reviews.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t love it more I have tried many high end moisturizers and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>This product is worth buying!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great value as it lasts twice as long as the cream I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am ordering more since I just finished my first jar.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use and if it stays like the first day I will buy more.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent!</li>
            <li>If you can get past that, then it is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>My skin quickly absorbs it and it leaves you skin feeling velvety smooth.</li>
            <li>When I got my face moisturizer I use it right away hoping it will help me with this problem and it did!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s nice to read the ingredients and see that they are all natural ingredients too.</li>
            <li>has that kinda cool relaxing effect when I put it on my face, maybe its</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too much into aromas, but I love the scent of this face cream.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it glides on my face and neck and really protects.</li>
            <li>I will post a full review in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very rich but it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working so great, compare to the other brand I tried before.</li>
            <li>it smells clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this face cream daily, and my skin feels so nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Not only does my skin feel better, I also think it looks better too.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that is paraben free &amp; natural organic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Because of the super moisture this delivers, I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I love it for that reason and that it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The cream melts at body temperature, which is why is spreads so quickly onto the face., and feels luxurious on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I thought it might even fit that bill for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the packaging was very pretty and the company seems quite conscientious and customer service oriented.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and performs better than creams costing twice as much.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and absorbs quickly and deeply into my skin.</li>
            <li>so soft &amp; very smooth</li>
            <li>Love the organic natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this and the eye cream for a month and notice my skin feels more soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Would buy again but not crazy about the s&amp;h.</li>
            <li>My skin looks healthy like it did in my early 20s.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s got far too many pros not to buy again but</li>
            <li>The next morning after applying the cream before bed, my face has a nice glowing tone.</li>
            <li>Finally, and most importantly....</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about this product.  </li>
            <li>forever, has a natural, healthy appearance, and is VERY economical, as, (for me!), less is more,</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of moisturizers in the past, but this by far is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I used the product for the past two days and my face feels great.</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s thicker than most other creams I&#x27;ve used and has a strong, flowery fragrance that reminds me of jasmine perfume.  </li>
            <li>Thanks very much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for over 6 months and have noticed a marked improvement to fine lines and skin tone.</li>
            <li>I tend to vary which moisturizer I use on any given day without thinking abut it too much, but I&#x27;ve used this one exclusively since the first time I tried it!</li>
            <li>I have used numerous moisturizers, always trying for the best fit for my skin (dry from living in a dry climate).</li>
            <li>only downside is that I have to be careful not to use it all to fast because of the incredible smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which is exactly what my skin needs.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS,WILL DEFINITELY KEEP BUYING</li>
            <li>Thanks Yalmeh!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done of my first tube</li>
            <li>It does leave your face clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I noticed changes in my complexion since the first week</li>
            <li>My favorite, can tell a big difference when I run out of it...</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel and look smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Night vs Day:  I have dry skin and was thinking this would soak in more, but it tends to make me a little oily/shiny during the day, so I&#x27;m enjoying it better as a Night</li>
            <li>I received the product very fast, lightening fast to be exact, points again for service.  </li>
            <li>If the purchase price remains reasonable, under $20, I will certainly buy again for Yalmeh&#x27;s healing properties alone!</li>

            <li>I have only used this moisturizer for a week, but so far I have liked it.</li>
            <li>Very little cream is needed to achieve good results.</li>
            <li>It has made quite a positive difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Results:  In just a week, I notice that my skin seems more calm, less redness, makeup goes on better, pores on my nose appear smaller.</li>
            <li>People rave about that product too and it costs 3 times as much as this one and having both, I can definitely say that this one is better in some ways but does not have as much oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>jar of the \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; eye cream I had liked so well and because my previous experience with \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; had been so positive</li>
            <li>My face is no longer dry which gives it a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I ordered this cream purely based on the reviews here, and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The cream is thicker than i expected but once it warms up, it is absorbed very quickly.  </li>
            <li>When I woke up this morning I felt something different on my face, my face was soft and very smooth and never experience it before.</li>
            <li>Very thick &amp; despite the recommendation to use as a night cream, I actually apply this before my foundation &amp; it is GREAT!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give an accurate review.</li>
            <li>You can really feel the moisture absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my friend Linda.</li>
            <li>It really moistrurizes and softens skin.</li>
            <li>really like this cream a lot.</li>
            <li>This one seems to come very close</li>
            <li>I really like to recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute thickest face cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>but this might be too much for others.  </li>
            <li>, I USE IT ALONG WITH THE EYE CREAM, I AM VERY SASTIFIED.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and the price</li>
            <li>I really like this face cream.</li>
            <li>The prices are so reasonable.</li>
            <li>I liked this moisturizer, but I had to put some water on my face to spread it out because it is  too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have tried many different products.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream and also its eye cream because of great reviews, however the jar I received is not the same as it is shown in the picture, I have not used either products everyday, but so far so good, but in terms of whitening, no whitening effect I have noticed in my dark circle maybe because I have not been using it everyday, overall good products.</li>
            <li>I will return with an update on the product as a night creme and any other valuable information I might be able to contribute as a REAL customer.</li>
            <li>but so many products contain a bunch of other junk</li>
            <li>I have many other anti-aging skin products as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and the skin absorptive is amazing!</li>
            <li>So far he has said he likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>addiction is that,  I dabbed it on my shoulders specially my arms &amp; the back &amp; front my hands</li>
            <li>specially my ARMs &amp; the back of my hands!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I normally have very oily skin and have had no problems with this cream at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I found this cream, and recommend for anyone with dry, sensitive skin, or just to maintain normal skin.</li>
            <li>The fragrance lasted throughout the work day and the cream has left my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>an adequate variety of moisturizers, but as I was reordering another (larger!)</li>
            <li>Nice packaging, light, fresh smell, a little heavier than most facial creams I&#x27;ve used in the past but after reading the reviews I expected as much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those needing to nourish their faces.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little bit more than a week</li>
            <li>I have been using various facial product but this one is very special.</li>
            <li>I am also suspicious of all these rave reviews, because these descriptions of the creme are SO far from what the product is really like.</li>
            <li>I really like the products this company offers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product review 5 stars so far for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>After a few more days they were gone and so were my pimples.</li>
            <li>and I suffer from rosacea and normally scared to death to put something on my face</li>
            <li>I also like how the cream is thick and it has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I did see improvement right away (withing 2 weeks), especially on the sun damage on my chin:</li>
            <li>Little by little day by day it lightens so I&#x27;m happy with the result.</li>
            <li>Is thick and different in texture from anything I&#x27;ve used before but the result e pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying new anti-aging face products.</li>
            <li>I had scabs and dry skin from pimples and blemishes I had picked at, but the next day they had magically almost vanished completely.</li>
            <li>My skin is prone to acne and very sensitive to water.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this cream doesn&#x27;t burn or break-out my skin.</li>
            <li>Here\\&quot; is rapidly becoming my single source for ALL related products!</li>
            <li>Fine lines around eyes are slightly</li>
            <li>it is made from natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>I picked up a small jar as a suggestion from my cousin and love it.</li>
            <li>I am generously giving 3 stars for customer service so far and very fast delivery, it may be lowered or raised pending product performance and further customer service performance.</li>
            <li>The Yalmeh Peerless Beauty Aloe Day-Night Moisturizing Cream is the first facial cream in a long time that I have seen positive results in my skins texture and tone.</li>
            <li>My little dog was sitting on my lap , while watching TV, he never eats anything but his own food or wants a little of ours, but no trouble of anything else.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happy customer so far.</li>
            <li>This cream made my skin feel moist and soft.</li>
            <li>so far I have used it over a month.</li>
            <li>I think this cream is really natural without harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I like how this aloe vera face moisturizer contains natural plant based ingredients and no harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Just be ware if you are sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li>plus, I have a sensitive &amp; acne prone&lt;</li>
            <li>Not a \\&quot;tight\\&quot; drying but like a soft \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; drying.</li>
            <li>The skin is still soft but ...</li>
            <li>I will say, my sixty-four year old mother can use products like this without break outs sometimes, so this may not be a problem for others.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that this product does not cause any acne problem for me.  </li>
            <li>This cream made my skin feel moist and soft.</li>
            <li>HOW SOFT IT FEELS,</li>
            <li>I put some on and it feels so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and is finally clear.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised.  </li>
            <li>boy was I surprised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54, sensitive skin, wear sun screen faithfully.</li>
            <li>I apply it at night and it gives me a soft finish for when I apply my makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and it makes my face feel young again.</li>
            <li>and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>then realized it did happen my face is so soft and moist</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s thick, absorbs well, is not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have a perfume like scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too rich for blending with make-up</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of the smell but wears out very fast so is not a big deal.</li>
            <li>I only need a little because it spreads really easily.</li>
            <li>I did warm it up in my hands prior to applying it as advised, yet it left a thick mask like residue upon waking up the next day.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way which to me is very economical.</li>
            <li>It not only has reduced my puffiness, but also makes it feal soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>It is thick, but goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I am sorry, but I have quite dry to Normal/dry combination skin and it will drink up a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because I tried a millions of skin care products from high ends to low ends but still not satisfied.</li>
            <li>My skin was very soft all day long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars for the moment because I&#x27;ve only had it a week and don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s long enough to really assess the product.</li>
            <li>I believe it may have irritated my top level epidermis because my skin was very sensitive, red, and had a few small welts.</li>
            <li>Yalmeh recommended warming it in your hands a bit first to make it easier to spread, that helps a little bit.</li>
            <li>This cream is very thick, rich, and dense, much more substantial  than any other such products in my experience, but still spreads and absorbs with little time and effort.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry area and applying this at night has in just 2 weeks has repaired and rejuvenated my skin.</li>
            <li>I only have to apply the face cream once a day and my skin is soft and moist all day long.  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used it, I always see an instant firming effect, which lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li>This cream is very moisturizing, and smooths out the rough patches on my cheeks and nose from the dry winter air.</li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is a little thick, but is non-greasy and not only does my face feel soft - the fine lines are GONE.</li>
            <li>I have some pretty bad scars, due to burns from an automobile accident, so when this product helped not only fade the scars, but give the thin, paper-like skin, some elasticity and overall healthier appearance and feel, I was really impressed.</li>

            <li> Great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought Aloe Vera is great for skin</li>
            <li> As of now, happy of my purchase.</li>
            <li> But with that said - it&#x27;s been a great week for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Also whats great about this product is that it does not make your skin look greasy and shiny, so you can&#x27;t tell that you put something on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can imagine that being a great feature for those with oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it would work best in warm weather as it sort of needs to \\&quot;melt\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Their suggestions are great.</li>
            <li> This cream has been great to me.</li>

            <li> I took it to my dermatologist and he said it&#x27;s great for eczema as well.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I am totally happy with this cream</li>
            <li> Feels great on her face and doesn&#x27;t make her skin feel oily.</li>
            <li> Also great that it has a guarantee</li>
            <li> This exfoliate is great, but if someone think they are purchasing a face moisturizer or cream, this is neither.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the reviews but it didn&#x27;t expect it to be amazing!</li>
            <li> Warm Regards Everyone!</li>
            <li> The thing about this product that impressed me the most, was it&#x27;s ability to fade age spots/sun damage and heal scars.</li>

            <li> DEFINITELY A GOOD FACE MOISTURIZER AND A GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> We are always looking for the best thing because we are never quite satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> Both smell amazingly good</li>
            <li> how good it smells.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Does not smell good because no perfume inside</li>
            <li> the smell is good</li>
            <li> This creme HAS to clog pores, I expect I will be getting some break-outs, but to be fair I will give it a chance as a night creme.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping it is every bit as good as the reviews claim.</li>
            <li> , he ate 2/3 of jar, must of been good , my fault.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and in  good condition.</li>
            <li> makes it a good value.</li>
            <li> It so good, so</li>
            <li> It smells good though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting and I feel very safe putting it on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to smelling it since so many reviews commented on the \\&quot;great scent\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Product is great, doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or sticky like most others do.</li>
            <li> I have gradually added Yalmeh products to my routine and am very satisfied with each one.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>

            <li> From a man&#x27;s view this is a unique and very nice product.  </li>
            <li> Light and not sticky with a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> If it can make her that happy, I&#x27;ve really done a good job at selecting a gift for her.  </li>
            <li> My face is so soft in the morning, I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It goes on better if you warm it by rubbing your hands together before application.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much more about how effective it is until I&#x27;ve used it for awhile</li>
            <li> This is the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li> This would make this product even more effective.</li>
            <li> Good customer service is great, but it can&#x27;t replace a product that doesn&#x27;t live up to their claims.</li>
            <li> You can feel how moisturizing it is, as my skin feels very smooth and hydrated, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is very light but hydrating and soothing.</li>

            <li> I love how the product is viscous and how it locks in moisture when I apply after taking a shower.  </li>
            <li> Two weeks into the product and enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> If this cream was a hefty price (like Rosa Arctica and so many others)</li>
            <li> I received an email from customer service before it even arrived telling me they care about my purchase and to be sure and let them know what I think.</li>
            <li> Ok, here goes.</li>

            <li> Even better than described.</li>

            <li> I love this.</li>

            <li> Took a chance on this and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this cream.</li>
            <li> The scent is okay.  </li>
            <li> Many reviews raved about the scent</li>
            <li> I love everything about Yalmeh.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> My skin feels brighter and more toned.</li>
            <li> love the creamy moisture on my face.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the texture of this product and how healthy my skin look throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Please never stop making these for people that love to pamper and take care of the skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li> I love the texture of it on my skin</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but it was time and this one smells amazing and feels rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> I received this product and was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with skin concerns its really great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cool and refreshing when applied.</li>
            <li> Cream is great for normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li> and I do feel like my skin is looking better without ever getting clogged or becoming oily.</li>
            <li> They have ideal products, they follow up all sales IMMEDIATELY and anticipate any potential issues that may arise, AND, they respond to any inquiries at light speed!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine any single cream ever being perfect for everyone.</li>
            <li> It a great product, I do like it so far......</li>
            <li> This product really feels good as soon as you put it on.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my dry skin and goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> This cream leaves your skin very feeling very smooth and it does a nice job of softening the skin.</li>
            <li> The price is great, so I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I get acne easily.  </li>
            <li> With that, it somehow manages to go on nice an smooth and is absorbed easily.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my skin at all and doesnt have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> They both smell almost identical though Yalmeh&#x27;s scent is not as strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of weeks and don&#x27;t have any strong feelings about the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using eye cream &amp; hands down the best eye cream</li>
            <li> Fine lines are diminished.</li>
            <li> you know what&#x27;s, nothing happen he was just fine.</li>
            <li> But I have not seen any improvements regarding fine lines yet.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer which is especially useful during the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> The eye cream is fabulous too.</li>
            <li> and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it provided the necessary moisturization without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll see what to do I like creams smooth</li>
            <li> Makes applying smooth.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> She keeps telling me to smell her face and how smooth it is.  </li>
            <li> Great product overall and would recommend!</li>
            <li> So far really good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I was looking at other options and found this one with very good reviews.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t love it more I have tried many high end moisturizers and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> This product is worth buying!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great value as it lasts twice as long as the cream I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am ordering more since I just finished my first jar.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and if it stays like the first day I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> If you can get past that, then it is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> My skin quickly absorbs it and it leaves you skin feeling velvety smooth.</li>
            <li> When I got my face moisturizer I use it right away hoping it will help me with this problem and it did!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s nice to read the ingredients and see that they are all natural ingredients too.</li>
            <li> has that kinda cool relaxing effect when I put it on my face, maybe its</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too much into aromas, but I love the scent of this face cream.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it glides on my face and neck and really protects.</li>
            <li> I will post a full review in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very rich but it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working so great, compare to the other brand I tried before.</li>
            <li> it smells clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream daily, and my skin feels so nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Not only does my skin feel better, I also think it looks better too.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that is paraben free &amp; natural organic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Because of the super moisture this delivers, I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love it for that reason and that it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The cream melts at body temperature, which is why is spreads so quickly onto the face., and feels luxurious on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I thought it might even fit that bill for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the packaging was very pretty and the company seems quite conscientious and customer service oriented.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced and performs better than creams costing twice as much.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and absorbs quickly and deeply into my skin.</li>
            <li> so soft &amp; very smooth</li>
            <li> Love the organic natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this and the eye cream for a month and notice my skin feels more soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Would buy again but not crazy about the s&amp;h.</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthy like it did in my early 20s.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s got far too many pros not to buy again but</li>
            <li> The next morning after applying the cream before bed, my face has a nice glowing tone.</li>
            <li> Finally, and most importantly....</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about this product.  </li>
            <li> forever, has a natural, healthy appearance, and is VERY economical, as, (for me!), less is more,</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of moisturizers in the past, but this by far is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used the product for the past two days and my face feels great.</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s thicker than most other creams I&#x27;ve used and has a strong, flowery fragrance that reminds me of jasmine perfume.  </li>
            <li> Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for over 6 months and have noticed a marked improvement to fine lines and skin tone.</li>
            <li> I tend to vary which moisturizer I use on any given day without thinking abut it too much, but I&#x27;ve used this one exclusively since the first time I tried it!</li>
            <li> I have used numerous moisturizers, always trying for the best fit for my skin (dry from living in a dry climate).</li>
            <li> only downside is that I have to be careful not to use it all to fast because of the incredible smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which is exactly what my skin needs.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS,WILL DEFINITELY KEEP BUYING</li>
            <li> Thanks Yalmeh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done of my first tube</li>
            <li> It does leave your face clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I noticed changes in my complexion since the first week</li>
            <li> My favorite, can tell a big difference when I run out of it...</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel and look smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Night vs Day:  I have dry skin and was thinking this would soak in more, but it tends to make me a little oily/shiny during the day, so I&#x27;m enjoying it better as a Night</li>
            <li> I received the product very fast, lightening fast to be exact, points again for service.  </li>
            <li> If the purchase price remains reasonable, under $20, I will certainly buy again for Yalmeh&#x27;s healing properties alone!</li>
            <li> If the purchase price remains reasonable, under $20, I will certainly buy again for Yalmeh&#x27;s healing properties alone!</li>
            <li> I have only used this moisturizer for a week, but so far I have liked it.</li>
            <li> Very little cream is needed to achieve good results.</li>
            <li> It has made quite a positive difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Results:  In just a week, I notice that my skin seems more calm, less redness, makeup goes on better, pores on my nose appear smaller.</li>
            <li> People rave about that product too and it costs 3 times as much as this one and having both, I can definitely say that this one is better in some ways but does not have as much oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> jar of the \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; eye cream I had liked so well and because my previous experience with \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; had been so positive</li>
            <li> My face is no longer dry which gives it a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream purely based on the reviews here, and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cream is thicker than i expected but once it warms up, it is absorbed very quickly.  </li>
            <li> When I woke up this morning I felt something different on my face, my face was soft and very smooth and never experience it before.</li>
            <li> Very thick &amp; despite the recommendation to use as a night cream, I actually apply this before my foundation &amp; it is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give an accurate review.</li>
            <li> You can really feel the moisture absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my friend Linda.</li>
            <li> It really moistrurizes and softens skin.</li>
            <li> really like this cream a lot.</li>
            <li> This one seems to come very close</li>
            <li> I really like to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute thickest face cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> but this might be too much for others.  </li>
            <li> , I USE IT ALONG WITH THE EYE CREAM, I AM VERY SASTIFIED.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the price</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.</li>
            <li> The prices are so reasonable.</li>
            <li> I liked this moisturizer, but I had to put some water on my face to spread it out because it is  too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have tried many different products.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream and also its eye cream because of great reviews, however the jar I received is not the same as it is shown in the picture, I have not used either products everyday, but so far so good, but in terms of whitening, no whitening effect I have noticed in my dark circle maybe because I have not been using it everyday, overall good products.</li>
            <li> I will return with an update on the product as a night creme and any other valuable information I might be able to contribute as a REAL customer.</li>
            <li> but so many products contain a bunch of other junk</li>
            <li> I have many other anti-aging skin products as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and the skin absorptive is amazing!</li>
            <li> So far he has said he likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> addiction is that,  I dabbed it on my shoulders specially my arms &amp; the back &amp; front my hands</li>
            <li> specially my ARMs &amp; the back of my hands!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I normally have very oily skin and have had no problems with this cream at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I found this cream, and recommend for anyone with dry, sensitive skin, or just to maintain normal skin.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasted throughout the work day and the cream has left my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> an adequate variety of moisturizers, but as I was reordering another (larger!)</li>
            <li> Nice packaging, light, fresh smell, a little heavier than most facial creams I&#x27;ve used in the past but after reading the reviews I expected as much.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those needing to nourish their faces.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little bit more than a week</li>
            <li> I have been using various facial product but this one is very special.</li>
            <li> I am also suspicious of all these rave reviews, because these descriptions of the creme are SO far from what the product is really like.</li>
            <li> I really like the products this company offers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product review 5 stars so far for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> After a few more days they were gone and so were my pimples.</li>
            <li> and I suffer from rosacea and normally scared to death to put something on my face</li>
            <li> I also like how the cream is thick and it has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I did see improvement right away (withing 2 weeks), especially on the sun damage on my chin:</li>
            <li> Little by little day by day it lightens so I&#x27;m happy with the result.</li>
            <li> Is thick and different in texture from anything I&#x27;ve used before but the result e pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying new anti-aging face products.</li>
            <li> I had scabs and dry skin from pimples and blemishes I had picked at, but the next day they had magically almost vanished completely.</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to acne and very sensitive to water.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this cream doesn&#x27;t burn or break-out my skin.</li>
            <li> Here\\&quot; is rapidly becoming my single source for ALL related products!</li>
            <li> Fine lines around eyes are slightly</li>
            <li> it is made from natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> I picked up a small jar as a suggestion from my cousin and love it.</li>
            <li> I am generously giving 3 stars for customer service so far and very fast delivery, it may be lowered or raised pending product performance and further customer service performance.</li>
            <li> The Yalmeh Peerless Beauty Aloe Day-Night Moisturizing Cream is the first facial cream in a long time that I have seen positive results in my skins texture and tone.</li>
            <li> My little dog was sitting on my lap , while watching TV, he never eats anything but his own food or wants a little of ours, but no trouble of anything else.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Happy customer so far.</li>
            <li> This cream made my skin feel moist and soft.</li>
            <li> so far I have used it over a month.</li>
            <li> I think this cream is really natural without harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like how this aloe vera face moisturizer contains natural plant based ingredients and no harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Just be ware if you are sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li> plus, I have a sensitive &amp; acne prone&lt;</li>
            <li> Not a \\&quot;tight\\&quot; drying but like a soft \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; drying.</li>
            <li> The skin is still soft but ...</li>
            <li> I will say, my sixty-four year old mother can use products like this without break outs sometimes, so this may not be a problem for others.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that this product does not cause any acne problem for me.  </li>
            <li> This cream made my skin feel moist and soft.</li>
            <li> HOW SOFT IT FEELS,</li>
            <li> I put some on and it feels so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and is finally clear.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised.  </li>
            <li> boy was I surprised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54, sensitive skin, wear sun screen faithfully.</li>
            <li> I apply it at night and it gives me a soft finish for when I apply my makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and it makes my face feel young again.</li>
            <li> and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> then realized it did happen my face is so soft and moist</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s thick, absorbs well, is not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have a perfume like scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too rich for blending with make-up</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the smell but wears out very fast so is not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I only need a little because it spreads really easily.</li>
            <li> I did warm it up in my hands prior to applying it as advised, yet it left a thick mask like residue upon waking up the next day.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way which to me is very economical.</li>
            <li> It not only has reduced my puffiness, but also makes it feal soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> It is thick, but goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I am sorry, but I have quite dry to Normal/dry combination skin and it will drink up a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because I tried a millions of skin care products from high ends to low ends but still not satisfied.</li>
            <li> My skin was very soft all day long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars for the moment because I&#x27;ve only had it a week and don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s long enough to really assess the product.</li>
            <li> I believe it may have irritated my top level epidermis because my skin was very sensitive, red, and had a few small welts.</li>
            <li> Yalmeh recommended warming it in your hands a bit first to make it easier to spread, that helps a little bit.</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick, rich, and dense, much more substantial  than any other such products in my experience, but still spreads and absorbs with little time and effort.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry area and applying this at night has in just 2 weeks has repaired and rejuvenated my skin.</li>
            <li> I only have to apply the face cream once a day and my skin is soft and moist all day long.  </li>
            <li> From the first time I used it, I always see an instant firming effect, which lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> This cream is very moisturizing, and smooths out the rough patches on my cheeks and nose from the dry winter air.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little thick, but is non-greasy and not only does my face feel soft - the fine lines are GONE.</li>
            <li> I have some pretty bad scars, due to burns from an automobile accident, so when this product helped not only fade the scars, but give the thin, paper-like skin, some elasticity and overall healthier appearance and feel, I was really impressed.</li>
            <li> I have some pretty bad scars, due to burns from an automobile accident, so when this product helped not only fade the scars, but give the thin, paper-like skin, some elasticity and overall healthier appearance and feel, I was really impressed.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s the new packaging or the old</li>
            <li> and I thought at first that it would be hard to spread on my very, very dry sensitive skin---</li>
            <li> I thought it was the least I could do to try any other products they might have available.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what makes it different from other products that claim to be absolutely natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, especially on my face, so I have to be very careful of what face creams I use.  </li>
            <li> but when I first smelled it is was so strong I felt sick.</li>
            <li> It did the trick over my other, wanted natural , non chemical one.</li>
            <li> After a few days of letting my skin rest, it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
            <li> Used it for few weeks,I did not find anything special in it,it&#x27;s even kind of heavy and unpleasant to apply.</li>
            <li> At first it was so thick</li>
            <li> At first I felt that it was too thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks so far, but I can already see the results.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this cream for dry skin!</li>
            <li> Recently I ran out before my next order, I used my previous moisturizer for 2 days, I could tell a big difference!  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this cream has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Never had dry skin in Chicago till this year.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and roscea</li>
            <li> My skin is oily in some areas and dry in others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so not sure what the problem was.</li>
            <li> In using an exfoliate some may not need to apply it everyday due to sensitive skin as opposed to MOISTURIZER, therefore the product name should be changed to Face Exfoliate</li>
            <li> A friend of mine was swearing by this product, so she let me have the last bit of her jar to try.&lt;br /&gt;After using Yalmeh Aloe vera face Cream for less than one week, I can feel and see a difference in the dry skin surrounding my eyes and lips.</li>
            <li> I have been using different facial products in the past because I can&#x27;t see the difference from one to another.  </li>
            <li> My face was irritated and had a slight burning sensation, to where I finally washed it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties, have combination skin and live at a very high altitude in a place that is cold and windy</li>
            <li> had very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry, wrinkle prone skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and this cream hydrates me all day.  </li>
            <li> He might only have little</li>
            <li> A little hard to apply, but worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> He has extremely dry skin on his face and other veranda we have tried weren&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> , I was shocked when I dint get any flare-ups and my skin looks so much better</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I found that my facial skin became smoother.  </li>
            <li> I had to stop using Yalmeh on my face, it is just too thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin enough, so it caused breakouts due to clogged pores for me personally.</li>
            <li> Right now my skin is extremely dry from the long and cold winter.</li>
            <li> After I would take a shower, if I didnt apply moisturizer right away, my skin would start to get very dry and start to hurt, This has only gotten worse within the past few years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and oddly, just ever so slightly, drying at the same time.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After I entered my late 20s, my face has always been red and dry.</li>
            <li> or so then will just order some other product.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this product would have worked for me, after buying it on a friend&#x27;s referral, at a discounted price due to a promo code on their web-page on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I received it and find that it makes my skin a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product since it contains only natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could give this a try as a day creme too, but there is NO WAY it can be used under make-up, it is simply not right for that.</li>
            <li> and yet it has a similar consistency (somewhat) to say, a cortizone cream, in a way -- hard to describe.</li>
            <li> but it did not, it cleared up my dry skin due to allergies in 2 days and even cleared up small patches of eczema on my arms.</li>
            <li> Has a funny smell (nothing bad) but kinda different.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any dark skin in my face anymore.  </li>
            <li> This product seems drier, less moisture for spreading.  </li>
            <li> I noticed there&#x27;s a formation of dark circle in my face, it worries me because it&#x27;s getting darker everyday.  </li>
            <li> try to put a little &amp; kinda spread it at night &amp;  when I wake up in the morning</li>
            <li> Well a little story to tell how non chemical this was.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not at all greasy or heavy fragranced.</li>
            <li> After a few applications, I just got used to it.</li>
            <li> I tend to sort of pat it on my face all over and let it sit a few seconds before spreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after just a few days of using this product, my skin became ultra hydrated and my complexion changed dramatically.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream a few times before bed and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> This winter has really dried out my combination skin</li>
            <li> Heavy but penetrates and leaves no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> There are few that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> thats why it is heavy as some reviewers mentioned.  </li>
            <li> The creme lays on my skin like a paste, no soaking in and certainly no brightening while your skin is coated in a thick blanket of paste-like creme.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, this moisturizer is a little thick to use in the morning.  </li>
            <li> what little scent there is, it is unpleasant to me, strange actually.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike typical face creams, Yalmeh Moisturizer has a thick density but glides on effortlessly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not entirely sure I&#x27;ll be placing this order nor one for the eye cream.</li>
            <li> I am used to putting on a moisturizer that spreads easier, they are usually creamier.  </li>
            <li> No more Olay or L&#x27;Oreal for me.</li>
            <li> I just purchase this product base also on positive review I read on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> because, I been breaking out lately but,&lt;br /&gt;not from the face cream</li>
            <li> If you have ever tried Kiehl&#x27;s Rosa Arctica moisturizer then you&#x27;ll have somewhat of an idea of at least the category this would be in.</li>
            <li> This stuff if REALLY THICK.</li>
            <li> Yes it arrive on time the cream is to thick</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the cream is thick.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick which i like rather than creamy or watery.</li>
            <li> Lately my complexion has been pale and unhealthy looking.  </li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel oily in the heat and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry in the cold.</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick, luxuriously creamy even</li>
            <li> The cream is very thick</li>
            <li> However, it is very thick like a nighttime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using product for approximately 3 months and the cream is very thick and leaves a somewhat greasy feel on my face.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of my childhood when we used to have honeysuckle behind our house and we would pull out the stem of the flower to get at the nectar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am about integrity and honesty in a company and it&#x27;s products, fake reviews are exceedingly unsavory.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was unhappy with hos this item reacted on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I am disappointed the product is no longer eligible for Amazon Prime and that the price has gone up a couple of dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly disappointed in this skin cream.</li>
            <li> I hated looking in the mirror and would always turn my head to not see myself when I entered the bathroom.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good. Love the organic natural ingredients and it&#x27;s not at all greasy or heavy fragranced. Great value. Just ordered my second tube.</li>
            <li> Love this cream ! Just received my second tube. Does just as well or better then those expensive brands that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and absorbs quickly and deeply into my skin. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought Aloe Vera is great for skin but so many products contain a bunch of other junk I don&#x27;t want on my skin. I like that this contains no mineral oil, propylene glycol or paraben.</li>
            <li> I have used just about every moisturizer under the sun and none worked until I found Yalmeh. It is amazing and effective. At first it was so thick I though it would cause a break out but it did not, it cleared up my dry skin due to allergies in 2 days and even cleared up small patches of eczema on my arms. This is a above standard face crème!</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and my pores seem smaller.  I could tell a difference in my skin within a week.  This product is worth buying!</li>
            <li> Just love this face cream. I have dry skin and this cream has worked wonders for me. Fine lines are diminished. The eye cream is fabulous too. Both smell amazingly good</li>
            <li> I was use Aveeno Face SPF 15 and love it. When I saw a similar product at Costco by Oil of Olay - I got two bottles. Big mistake; did not like it at all. Nothing against Oil of Olay - it was just NOT Aveeno. I was looking at other options and found this one with very good reviews. So I got it to try. I like it so far. Has a funny smell (nothing bad) but kinda different. My son also said the same. I wanted to get something with Aloe Vera. This is a 5-start except that it does not have a SPF .. if it has I would have given it a 5-star.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. The eye cream is equally satisfying. They both feel so effective and are non-greasy. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it clogs your pores and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I have acne prone and semi-oily skin. (For my breakout days I use Proactive products). I have many other anti-aging skin products as well. This product really feels good as soon as you put it on. I even rub some on the tops of my hands it&#x27;s so wonderful. I can&#x27;t wait to put it on, and you can use it AM and PM. I&#x27;ve been using this and the eye cream for a month and notice my skin feels more soft and supple. You can really feel the moisture absorbing into your skin. There is no scent, I would compare the texture to Greek yogurt.</li>
            <li> I love the thickness and how good it smells. My face is so soft in the morning, I am very happy with the product. The price is great, so I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> The cream is thicker than i expected but once it warms up, it is absorbed very quickly.  No breakouts and skin seems hydrated.  Would buy again but not crazy about the s&amp;h.</li>
            <li> Works as we thought it would.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend . He has extremely dry skin on his face and other veranda we have tried weren&#x27;t working. This cream is very thick so l had him warm it up between his fingers like and it went on smoothly. So far he has said he likes it very much.  A little goes a long way which to me is very economical. I am glad l bought 2 so l can use it too!</li>
            <li> I just purchase this product base also on positive review I read on Amazon.  I was hesitant at first because I tried a millions of skin care products from high ends to low ends but still not satisfied. I said to myself there&#x27;s no harm in trying it. So I bought one and used it last night. When I woke up this morning I felt something different on my face, my face was soft and very smooth and never experience it before. As of now, happy of my purchase. Will keep using it. Looking forward to a beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars for the moment because I&#x27;ve only had it a week and don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s long enough to really assess the product. But with that said - it&#x27;s been a great week for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency &amp; Application:  This stuff if REALLY THICK. Yalmeh recommended warming it in your hands a bit first to make it easier to spread, that helps a little bit. After a few applications, I just got used to it. I tend to sort of pat it on my face all over and let it sit a few seconds before spreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night vs Day:  I have dry skin and was thinking this would soak in more, but it tends to make me a little oily/shiny during the day, so I&#x27;m enjoying it better as a Night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:  In just a week, I notice that my skin seems more calm, less redness, makeup goes on better, pores on my nose appear smaller. Fine lines around eyes are slightly diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer so far.</li>
            <li> It a great product, I do like it so far......I have been using various facial product but this one is very special.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine was swearing by this product, so she let me have the last bit of her jar to try.&lt;br /&gt;After using Yalmeh Aloe vera face Cream for less than one week, I can feel and see a difference in the dry skin surrounding my eyes and lips.With this face cream my skin is softer now and I am planning to order one jar and continue using it. Thanks to my friend Linda.</li>
            <li> Good product. This cream made my skin feel moist and soft. Very good for winter time.&lt;br /&gt;I have no issues so far I have used it over a month. Does not smell good because no perfume inside but that&#x27;s what makes it different from other products that claim to be absolutely natural. I think this cream is really natural without harmful ingredients.I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The smell of honeysuckle and jasmine is so amazing that I want to get a spoon and eat it. It reminds me of my childhood when we used to have honeysuckle behind our house and we would pull out the stem of the flower to get at the nectar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that I have to be careful not to use it all to fast because of the incredible smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But besides the smell it also makes my skin feel amazing as well. And it&#x27;s nice to read the ingredients and see that they are all natural ingredients too. And the packaging is very beautiful.</li>
            <li> Hi, this is Terry&#x27;s wife.  I&#x27;m the one who ordered the face cream.  I find it&#x27;s thicker than most other creams I&#x27;ve used and has a strong, flowery fragrance that reminds me of jasmine perfume.  The fragrance lasted throughout the work day and the cream has left my skin soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s been 16 hours since I applied it and I&#x27;m amazed that my face still feels this nice.  It&#x27;s like I just had a spa facial!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this face cream.  I have sensitive skin, especially on my face, so I have to be very careful of what face creams I use.  I like how this aloe vera face moisturizer contains natural plant based ingredients and no harsh chemicals.  I&#x27;ve been using this face cream daily, and my skin feels so nice and smooth.  I also like how the cream is thick and it has a nice fragrance.  I only have to apply the face cream once a day and my skin is soft and moist all day long.  Not only does my skin feel better, I also think it looks better too.</li>
            <li> It really moistrurizes and softens skin. The only downfall about htis product is that it has a peculiar smell. I somewhat got used to it but when I first smelled it is was so strong I felt sick. Just be ware if you are sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li> After I entered my late 20s, my face has always been red and dry. After I would take a shower, if I didnt apply moisturizer right away, my skin would start to get very dry and start to hurt, This has only gotten worse within the past few years. Lately my complexion has been pale and unhealthy looking.  I hated looking in the mirror and would always turn my head to not see myself when I entered the bathroom.  I was skeptical of this product since it contains only natural ingredients.  But after just a few days of using this product, my skin became ultra hydrated and my complexion changed dramatically. My skin looks healthy like it did in my early 20s.  I am really happy with the results. I have tried all kinds of moisturizers in the past, but this by far is the best I have ever used.  I love how the product is viscous and how it locks in moisture when I apply after taking a shower.  It does not irritate my skin at all and doesnt have a strong scent.  Also whats great about this product is that it does not make your skin look greasy and shiny, so you can&#x27;t tell that you put something on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can use this cream during the summer months under my make-up.  Cream is great for normal to oily skin.  Right now my skin is extremely dry from the long and cold winter.</li>
            <li> From a man&#x27;s view this is a unique and very nice product.  Light and not sticky with a pleasant fragrance.  Two weeks into the product and enjoying it.  Also great follow-up from the seller with excellent usage tips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using eye cream &amp; hands down the best eye cream ever!&lt;br /&gt;I commented the eye cream as miracle cream! And yes after that,&lt;br /&gt;I been using both. I love the fact that is paraben free &amp; natural organic.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the face cream for a while because, I been breaking out lately but,&lt;br /&gt;not from the face cream, it&#x27;s just hormones &amp; all plus, I have a sensitive &amp; acne prone&lt;br /&gt;oily/combination skin however, when I use it own my face it feels so good &amp; the smell is good too!&lt;br /&gt;It has that kinda cool relaxing effect when I put it on my face, maybe its just me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My addiction is that,  I dabbed it on my shoulders specially my arms &amp; the back &amp; front my hands&lt;br /&gt;Plus, my neck that has lines (that starts to bothers me) I can&#x27;t help it although, it&#x27;s only for the face,&lt;br /&gt;I try to put a little &amp; kinda spread it at night &amp;  when I wake up in the morning walah!&lt;br /&gt;Its so soft &amp; very smooth specially my ARMs &amp; the back of my hands!&lt;br /&gt;I wish they make a body lotion with the same results!&lt;br /&gt;Gees! Im like a sales rep for YALMEH my friend saw my comment on the Eye cream&lt;br /&gt;&amp; she said that Yalmeh should hire me Lolz!&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, they&#x27;ll make the BODY LOTION.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little bit more than a week and so far it&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s very thick and the skin absorptive is amazing!</li>
            <li> If you have ever tried Kiehl&#x27;s Rosa Arctica moisturizer then you&#x27;ll have somewhat of an idea of at least the category this would be in. This is quite similar but creamier. They both smell almost identical though Yalmeh&#x27;s scent is not as strong. I am talking about the fragrance-free here. People rave about that product too and it costs 3 times as much as this one and having both, I can definitely say that this one is better in some ways but does not have as much oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this cream a lot. There are a couple of things that keep me from giving it 5 stars. For my skin, I would actually like it to be \\&quot;oilier\\&quot;. My skin needs oil and lots of it. This cream is very thick, luxuriously creamy even and yet it has a similar consistency (somewhat) to say, a cortizone cream, in a way -- hard to describe. It&#x27;s moisturizing and oddly, just ever so slightly, drying at the same time. Not a \\&quot;tight\\&quot; drying but like a soft \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; drying. The skin is still soft but ... gosh, I don&#x27;t know how to describe it. I can imagine that being a great feature for those with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like a summer cream. I think it would work best in warm weather as it sort of needs to \\&quot;melt\\&quot;. It&#x27;s very cool and refreshing when applied. It doesn&#x27;t sting and I feel very safe putting it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got far too many pros not to buy again but its biggest pro is the price. If this cream was a hefty price (like Rosa Arctica and so many others) I might not buy this again. We all have different skin and I can&#x27;t imagine any single cream ever being perfect for everyone. This one seems to come very close and I can see how this could be a \\&quot;holy grail type\\&quot; cream for some. When I first put it on, I thought it might even fit that bill for me but it&#x27;s not quite there (but it&#x27;s close).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the packaging was very pretty and the company seems quite conscientious and customer service oriented. 5 stars for that.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream purely based on the reviews here, and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had very dry skin and this cream has eliminated the tightness I used to feel upon waking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great value as it lasts twice as long as the cream I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed.</li>
            <li> I used the product for the past two days and my face feels great. I would recommend buying and using this product.</li>
            <li> Ok. I received an email from customer service before it even arrived telling me they care about my purchase and to be sure and let them know what I think. Good customer service is great, but it can&#x27;t replace a product that doesn&#x27;t live up to their claims. I received the product very fast, lightening fast to be exact, points again for service.  I immediately washed my face in order to try the creme...I was looking forward to smelling it since so many reviews commented on the \\&quot;great scent\\&quot;. Well, NO...what little scent there is, it is unpleasant to me, strange actually. The creme lays on my skin like a paste, no soaking in and certainly no brightening while your skin is coated in a thick blanket of paste-like creme. I am sorry, but I have quite dry to Normal/dry combination skin and it will drink up a good moisturizer. This creme HAS to clog pores, I expect I will be getting some break-outs, but to be fair I will give it a chance as a night creme. I wish I could give this a try as a day creme too, but there is NO WAY it can be used under make-up, it is simply not right for that. I am also suspicious of all these rave reviews, because these descriptions of the creme are SO far from what the product is really like. I am about integrity and honesty in a company and it&#x27;s products, fake reviews are exceedingly unsavory. I will return with an update on the product as a night creme and any other valuable information I might be able to contribute as a REAL customer. I am generously giving 3 stars for customer service so far and very fast delivery, it may be lowered or raised pending product performance and further customer service performance. Warm Regards Everyone! Clementhyme&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;03/10/2014 UPDATE!!! MAKES AN IMPRESSIVE HEALING BALM/SCAR CREAM!!! Ok, here goes. I had to stop using Yalmeh on my face, it is just too thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin enough, so it caused breakouts due to clogged pores for me personally. I will say, my sixty-four year old mother can use products like this without break outs sometimes, so this may not be a problem for others. The thing about this product that impressed me the most, was it&#x27;s ability to fade age spots/sun damage and heal scars. I have some pretty bad scars, due to burns from an automobile accident, so when this product helped not only fade the scars, but give the thin, paper-like skin, some elasticity and overall healthier appearance and feel, I was really impressed. If the purchase price remains reasonable, under $20, I will certainly buy again for Yalmeh&#x27;s healing properties alone! So, 5 stars as a healing balm...will change my rating to 4 stars over all, I&#x27;m taking the 1 star off since it did not work for what it was advertised to do in my opinion. (If it were sold as a healing balm I would def give all 5 stars for both product and customer service)use products like this without break outs sometimes, so this may not be a problem for others.

            <li> I have only used this moisturizer for a week, but so far I have liked it. I am impressed with the follow up emails that help you to use this product correctly. Their suggestions are great. Stay tuned for a month from now, when I can tell you how the moisturizer has done for a 30 use!</li>
            <li> So far really good. I really like to recommend this product. I will order again. Like to try more products.</li>
            <li> What a great find! I ordered this after trying Yalmeh eye cream and I really love this&lt;br /&gt;product! It is perfect for my dry skin and goes on so smoothly. I am confident  that with&lt;br /&gt;continued use my skin will look its best! I hope this company continues to expand their&lt;br /&gt;product line!</li>
            <li> I bought second jar. I love the cream. My skin is prone to acne and very sensitive to water. This cream has been great to me. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream hoping to use it under my foundation. It&#x27;s a little too rich for blending with make-up so I use it as a night cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it provided the necessary moisturization without clogging my pores. I am ordering more since I just finished my first jar.</li>
            <li> I have been using different facial products in the past because I can&#x27;t see the difference from one to another.  I read the reviews about Yalmeh face moisturizer and thought that I give it a shot.  At first I felt that it was too thick but it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get used to it.  After a few weeks, I found that my facial skin became smoother.  I get acne easily.  I am surprised that this product does not cause any acne problem for me.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This cream leaves your skin very feeling very smooth and it does a nice job of softening the skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very good ingredients and smell wonderful. This cream made my skin feel moist and soft. Nice costumer serves too.Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute thickest face cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s even thicker than LaMer! With that, it somehow manages to go on nice an smooth and is absorbed easily. I feel like I&#x27;m actually getting all day moisturizing which is exactly what my skin needs. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and I do feel like my skin is looking better without ever getting clogged or becoming oily. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s reducing the appearance of wrinkles however I do feel like it may end up helping prevent further ones. Because of the super moisture this delivers, I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, wrinkle prone skin and I have tried TONS of products.  This is the most moisturizing cream I have ever used!  It goes on better if you warm it by rubbing your hands together before application.  I love the way my skin looks and feels in the morning.  I use it both day and night but this might be too much for others.  I definitely recommend this cream for dry skin!</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> Great product for moisturizer purposes. Contains plant based. I wish they could offer this cream a pump bottle not a jar only .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE ONLY BEEN USING IT 2 WEEKS BUT I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN AND HOW SOFT IT FEELS, DEFINITELY A GOOD FACE MOISTURIZER AND A GREAT PRICE, I USE IT ALONG WITH THE EYE CREAM, I AM VERY SASTIFIED.  WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS,WILL DEFINITELY KEEP BUYING</li>
            <li> Recently received the product.  Brought based on the reviews.  Nice packaging, light, fresh smell, a little heavier than most facial creams I&#x27;ve used in the past but after reading the reviews I expected as much.  Can&#x27;t say much more about how effective it is until I&#x27;ve used it for awhile which is why I only gave it 3 stars.  Will give it a month and then will revise comments accordingly.  Here&#x27;s hoping it is every bit as good as the reviews claim.</li>
            <li> I really love this cream. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks so far, but I can already see the results. This cream is very moisturizing, and smooths out the rough patches on my cheeks and nose from the dry winter air. You can feel how moisturizing it is, as my skin feels very smooth and hydrated, but not greasy. The next morning after applying the cream before bed, my face has a nice glowing tone. I&#x27;m really glad I found this cream, and recommend for anyone with dry, sensitive skin, or just to maintain normal skin. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I just received my order and it came on the date that was said. I put some on and it feels so soft. I will continue to use and if it stays like the first day I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Great night cream! Looking forward to good results based on the ingredients! American made!! Yay!!</li>
            <li> The Yalmeh Peerless Beauty Aloe Day-Night Moisturizing Cream is the first facial cream in a long time that I have seen positive results in my skins texture and tone. My face radiates a healthy glow and looks smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike typical face creams, Yalmeh Moisturizer has a thick density but glides on effortlessly. My skin quickly absorbs it and it leaves you skin feeling velvety smooth. It has a wonderful aroma of flowers (maybe lilacs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really impressed me the most is I had scabs and dry skin from pimples and blemishes I had picked at, but the next day they had magically almost vanished completely. After a few more days they were gone and so were my pimples. I don&#x27;t know if there is something to treat acne or blemishes in the ingredients, but it is helping my issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the $100 face creams and vanishing lotions with no luck. I am truly amazed that a face cream that I have never heard of before was the answer that I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous moisturizers, always trying for the best fit for my skin (dry from living in a dry climate). This is the best I have found so far. It is thick, but goes on smoothly. From the first time I used it, I always see an instant firming effect, which lasts for a few hours. I love it for that reason and that it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. Finally, and most importantly....it is made from natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have sent some to my two daughters and they both are very happy with it.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Yes it arrive on time the cream is to thick but I&#x27;ll see what to do I like creams smooth</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin. I am prone to breakouts. I tried this product and absolutely love it. My skin feels soft and is finally clear. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the cream is thick. I dampen my fingertips before applying. Makes applying smooth. I&#x27;ve been using for over 6 months and have noticed a marked improvement to fine lines and skin tone. I also love the eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am disappointed the product is no longer eligible for Amazon Prime and that the price has gone up a couple of dollars. Combined with a shipping charge of $6.40 and I&#x27;m not entirely sure I&#x27;ll be placing this order nor one for the eye cream.</li>
            <li> Product is great, doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or sticky like most others do. It goes on thick which i like rather than creamy or watery.</li>
            <li> love this cream. it is already helping to ease the stubborn lines on my neck and upper chest. my face is taking on a youthful glow, it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Never had dry skin in Chicago till this year. My moisturizer not enough, looking for non gel ,aloe moisturizer, found this cream. It did the trick over my other, wanted natural , non chemical one. Well a little story to tell how non chemical this was. My little dog was sitting on my lap , while watching TV, he never eats anything but his own food or wants a little of ours, but no trouble of anything else. Well I was not looking at him ,watching TV, he ate 2/3 of jar, must of been good , my fault. I got scared called animal poision control , they look it up, no problem, no chemicals, not toxic. He might only have little you know what&#x27;s, nothing happen he was just fine.What does that tell you about this product. Love it, and I guess he does too, but he will not be hogging my moisturizer anymore!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I received it and find that it makes my skin a little dry.  I have followed the directions.  I will give it another week or so then will just order some other product.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin on my hands.  Just using them to apply this moisturizer to my face has helped heal my hands in a big way.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely reorder when low on product.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer which is especially useful during the dry winter months.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this moisturizer is a little thick to use in the morning.  It is perfect for before bed.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks &amp; I love it! It is a little thick, but is non-greasy and not only does my face feel soft - the fine lines are GONE. I really like the products this company offers. Thanks Yalmeh!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this face cream when I bought it, but I had a friend recommend it.  I am really surprised.  I&#x27;m not too much into aromas, but I love the scent of this face cream.  I can&#x27;t describe it, but it doesn&#x27;t smell perfumy to me--it smells clean and fresh.  The cream is very thick and I thought at first that it would be hard to spread on my very, very dry sensitive skin---boy was I surprised.  It spread beautifully, wasn&#x27;t greasy, and my skin sucked in that hydration and moisturizer.  My makeup looks great with the cream underneath it and I love that I can use it at night as well.  It is fantastic and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the reviews but it didn&#x27;t expect it to be amazing! Is thick and different in texture from anything I&#x27;ve used before but the result e pretty amazing. I took it to my dermatologist and he said it&#x27;s great for eczema as well. I&#x27;ll definitely buying it again.</li>
            <li> This face moisturizer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Even better than described. I live in a very dry area and applying this at night has in just 2 weeks has repaired and rejuvenated my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. Excellent customer service. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I am totally happy with this cream im in my 60 s and I suffer from rosacea and normally scared to death to put something on my face, I was shocked when I dint get any flare-ups and my skin looks so much better I highly recommend this product to anyone with skin concerns its really great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to comment on how this moisturizer affects my skin, as I&#x27;ve only been using it a week.  What I can comment on is this - I love that it&#x27;s thick, absorbs well, is not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have a perfume like scent.</li>
            <li> I already had (what I considered!) an adequate variety of moisturizers, but as I was reordering another (larger!) jar of the \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; eye cream I had liked so well and because my previous experience with \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; had been so positive I thought it was the least I could do to try any other products they might have available. So I bought a jar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This cream is very thick, rich, and dense, much more substantial  than any other such products in my experience, but still spreads and absorbs with little time and effort. I&#x27;ve only applied it as a \\&quot;day\\&quot; cream, it lasts.... forever, has a natural, healthy appearance, and is VERY economical, as, (for me!), less is more, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I tend to vary which moisturizer I use on any given day without thinking abut it too much, but I&#x27;ve used this one exclusively since the first time I tried it! \\&quot;Yalmeh/Amazing Stuff Here\\&quot; is rapidly becoming my single source for ALL related products! They have ideal products, they follow up all sales IMMEDIATELY and anticipate any potential issues that may arise, AND, they respond to any inquiries at light speed!</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was unhappy with hos this item reacted on my face. My face was irritated and had a slight burning sensation, to where I finally washed it off. Was hoping this product would have worked for me, after buying it on a friend&#x27;s referral, at a discounted price due to a promo code on their web-page on Amazon. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so not sure what the problem was.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome! I am now 38, in my age I am now seeing some sigh of aging.  I noticed there&#x27;s a formation of dark circle in my face, it worries me because it&#x27;s getting darker everyday.  When I got my face moisturizer I use it right away hoping it will help me with this problem and it did! Little by little day by day it lightens so I&#x27;m happy with the result. I&#x27;m using it for more than a month now and I don&#x27;t see any dark skin in my face anymore.  The tone and color of my face is now balance.  I love this.</li>
            <li> I liked this moisturizer, but I had to put some water on my face to spread it out because it is  too heavy.  The product arrived on time and in  good condition.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly a m a z i n g!! Worth every cent! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I picked up a small jar as a suggestion from my cousin and love it. It is very light but hydrating and soothing. It&#x27;s perfect for anytime day or night. Once I finish this jar I plan to purchase and will come back and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased another one to give to my BFF for Christmas. The packaging is awesome. The container is equally as beautiful. The moisturizer smells heavenly with all the organic ingredients. I&#x27;m a big fan of aloe vera. I love the way it glides on my face and neck and really protects. I just know my BFF is going to love it! Highly recommended for those needing to nourish their faces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done of my first tube and I&#x27;m waiting for the best result&lt;br /&gt;It moistures my face</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have used this cream a few times before bed and it seems to be working. This winter has really dried out my combination skin and I was starting to wrinkle a bit. I have never used night cream before but it was time and this one smells amazing and feels rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> Very thick &amp; despite the recommendation to use as a night cream, I actually apply this before my foundation &amp; it is GREAT! Nice fragrance. I have medium to oily AA skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine arrived in the jar. Not sure if that&#x27;s the new packaging or the old but I prefer the jar.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many face creams me and my girlfriend haven&#x27;t tried. We are always looking for the best thing because we are never quite satisfied with the result. However, our search is O-V-E-R! This is the absolute best face cream we&#x27;ve ever had. The Yalmeh aloe vera face moisturizer cream results are truly amazing.We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly disappointed in this skin cream. It doesn&#x27;t absorb well into the skin. I did warm it up in my hands prior to applying it as advised, yet it left a thick mask like residue upon waking up the next day. I believe it may have irritated my top level epidermis because my skin was very sensitive, red, and had a few small welts. Anything I put on my face after that, burned. After a few days of letting my skin rest, it&#x27;s back to normal. I may have had an allergic reaction to an ingredient in the product.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need alot. A little goes a long way. Your skin feels hydrated and smooth. Love this moisturizer. Use it day and night.</li>
            <li> Used it for few weeks,I did not find anything special in it,it&#x27;s even kind of heavy and unpleasant to apply.</li>
            <li> My Wife is loving this product already.  She keeps telling me to smell her face and how smooth it is.  If it can make her that happy, I&#x27;ve really done a good job at selecting a gift for her.  She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and this cream hydrates me all day.  I am doing glycolic peels, which are drying, and this cream takes care of the dryness and tightness.  I also love the eye cream.</li>
            <li> I saw no improvement in the texture nor moisture content of my facial skin, nor did I experience any results as the description averred.   Also,  received phone calls from this seller, presumably to solicit additional sales.</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 weeks it seems OK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying new anti-aging face products. I&#x27;m 54, sensitive skin, wear sun screen faithfully. I bought this unfamiliar product based on the 5 star reviews. I did see improvement right away (withing 2 weeks), especially on the sun damage on my chin: two rather deep cracks that are half-gone now. The cream melts at body temperature, which is why is spreads so quickly onto the face., and feels luxurious on my skin.  About the packaging: anti-oxidants lose their strength when exposed to air. A wide-mouth jar does not make sense to me. This cream should be dispensed from a tube or bottle, preventing air from getting to it. This would make this product even more effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my wife and she loves the heck out of it! A little bit goes a long way. Very little cream is needed to achieve good results. Feels great on her face and doesn&#x27;t make her skin feel oily. Very reasonably priced and performs better than creams costing twice as much. Wife only wishes there was SPF in the cream. Great product overall and would recommend!</li>
            <li> Took a chance on this and glad I did.  Also great that it has a guarantee so you have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Love this Yalmeh Face  Moisturizer!  I have dry skin and roscea so almost everything causes problems but Yalmeh has been perfect. My face doesn&#x27;t feel oily in the heat and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry in the cold. Recently I ran out before my next order, I used my previous moisturizer for 2 days, I could tell a big difference!  I was so glad when Yalmeh was delivered!</li>
            <li> As advertised, this is a heavier cream which I use before bed along with the Vitamin C Serum.  It has made quite a positive difference.  I have gradually added Yalmeh products to my routine and am very satisfied with each one.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about this product.  I am used to putting on a moisturizer that spreads easier, they are usually creamier.  This product seems drier, less moisture for spreading.  Is that the way it is supposed to be?  If so, why.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this cream. My skin is very sensitive and this cream doesn&#x27;t burn or break-out my skin. It not only has reduced my puffiness, but also makes it feal soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Between using this cream and their phytorjuvenate capsules my face looks awesome!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the price makes it a good value. Heavy but penetrates and leaves no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t love it more I have tried many high end moisturizers and this is by far my favorite. Such a hydrant based lotion. It moisturizers so nicely and feels good on my face. My skin drinks it up! But I have not seen any improvements regarding fine lines yet. I will update my review again if I notice any changes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now and my skin loves it.  FYI- I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties, have combination skin and live at a very high altitude in a place that is cold and windy the majority of the year.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar and am totally amazed at how well it works.  I normally have very oily skin and have had no problems with this cream at all.  I recently started chemotherapy and this cream is a godsend, helps me keep my face well moisturized without leaving a greasy feel.  This will not be my last jar, this is now my permanent cream.</li>
            <li> honesty I bought this cream and also its eye cream because of great reviews, however the jar I received is not the same as it is shown in the picture, I have not used either products everyday, but so far so good, but in terms of whitening, no whitening effect I have noticed in my dark circle maybe because I have not been using it everyday, overall good products.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have started using this about two weeks ago.  It has tightening the skin under my eye. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream. My skin is oily in some areas and dry in others. This cream is perfect for me. It is very rich but it absorbs fast. I am not a big fan of the smell but wears out very fast so is not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a day moisturizer since Costco no longer sells the one I was using.  This says it is a day/night moisturizer.  However, it is very thick like a nighttime moisturizer.  I used it in the morning anyways.  My skin was very soft all day long.  No greasy feel or look.  It just feels like I&#x27;m putting on night cream.  If you can get past that, then it is an excellent product.  I have not had any sensitivity to it.  The scent is okay.  Many reviews raved about the scent so I chose it instead of the fragrant-free one.  Had I to do over, I&#x27;d probably by the fragrant-free just because I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; the scent.  It&#x27;s not bad...it just smells too similar to an inexpensive $4 cream and not a $20 cream.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have tried many different products. There are few that I would recommend. I would recommend Yalmeh. My co-workers noticed a difference in my skin. One commented &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing but you looking younger all the time&amp;#34;. This product goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Yalmeh Aloe Vera Face Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt; I love everything about Yalmeh.  The prices are so reasonable. The customer service is the best of anyone I&#x27;ve ever did business with.  And their products work. No more Olay or L&#x27;Oreal for me. I am a loyal customer. Beverly</li>
            <li> I received this product and was very excited to try it.  I followed the instruction provided to me by the company and found it to be an exfoliate NOT a facial cream as it states; and as some of reviewers stated.  If one thinks that this is a cream it maybe applied incorrectly.  I like this product but I thought I had purchased a facial moisturizer NOT an exfoliate.  But that&#x27;s okay, however  it is somewhat misleading.  It does leave your face clear and smooth.  In using an exfoliate some may not need to apply it everyday due to sensitive skin as opposed to MOISTURIZER, therefore the product name should be changed to Face Exfoliate and it is not a cream - thats why it is heavy as some reviewers mentioned.  I am given 3 stars for the misleading of the product&#x27;s name.  This exfoliate is great, but if someone think they are purchasing a face moisturizer or cream, this is neither.</li>
            <li> This cream feels so nice on my face. I apply it at night and it gives me a soft finish for when I apply my makeup in the morning. My skin feels brighter and more toned. I only need a little because it spreads really easily. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just started using this cream, and I already Love It!  I am 67 years old and it makes my face feel young again.</li>
            <li> A little hard to apply, but worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working so great, compare to the other brand I tried before. I had to get another one!. Recommended to every one!.</li>
            <li> I have been using product for approximately 3 months and the cream is very thick and leaves a somewhat greasy feel on my face. It cannot be worn under makeup for this reason plus the fact that I see no visible difference in my skin at all even after 3 months of usage. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product review 5 stars so far for fast shipping. I have only had this product a week and so far I like it. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give an accurate review. I will post a full review in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!! I noticed changes in my complexion since the first week I tried this product. My face feels smoother and my complexion is even. My face is no longer dry which gives it a healthy glow. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I received Yalmeh Face Moistorizer a couple of weeks ago, I didn&#x27;t want to post a review unitl something happened.&lt;br /&gt;I then realized it did happen my face is so soft and moist, I used the product every morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month or so now, and I like it, but it&#x27;s not the fountain of youth or anything like that.</li>
            <li> My favorite, can tell a big difference when I run out of it...</li>
            <li> love the creamy moisture on my face. i am not a reviewer myself but this is the best .</li>
            <li> Perfect product quality. It works even for male. I bought it for my wife and she loves it! It so good, so I also started to use it.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the texture of this product and how healthy my skin look throughout the day.  I use mine as a night time regimen with the Vitamin C by Yalmeh.  I also use the eye product with aloe vera.  My lifetime products forever.  Please never stop making these for people that love to pamper and take care of the skin.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the interest the company has in customers using their product.  I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of weeks and don&#x27;t have any strong feelings about the product.  It seems to work ok.  The texture isn&#x27;t my preference as you have to pull on the skin to spread it.  It smells good though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I love the texture of it on my skin and I feel like my skin is getting a moisture treatment at night!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It makes my skin feel and look smooth and soft. This is my 4th bottle and still loving it. Think I will now try their eye cream.</li>
