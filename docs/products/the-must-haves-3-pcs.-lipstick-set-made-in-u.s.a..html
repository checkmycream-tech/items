            <li>Two out of four are on the Brownside but they are beautiful colors when I apply the lighter shades it didn&#x27;t seem like there was much color until I got in the light</li>

            <li>I was skeptical buying a lipstick offline, but they turned out amazing!</li>
            <li>I recently just used one of them for the first time</li>
            <li>The quality of the lipstick is similar to higher end brands.  </li>

            <li> so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s going to be pretty hard to take the color off</li>
            <li> , they dont look good on me. :(</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say whether or not it stays on for that long</li>
            <li> The only negative side to the order for me is that I feel like two of the lipsticks are almost identical like they look like the same color.</li>
            <li> And also the pink is ehh..</li>
            <li> They are five lipsticks in the pack, but four of them are the same colors (nude), and not a nice one either.</li>
            <li> Usually lipsticks dry out my lips</li>
            <li> Which I feel like is kinda a waste.</li>
            <li> no color dont waste ur money</li>
            <li> Not good at</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I hate writing bad reviews, but I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> just got my lipsticks and i am so happy to get them. They  in great shape</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are like butter on your lips! The color pigmentation is not so strong. I suggest applying over another lipstick that does not have enough softness.it does say that it has &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; color.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot except the colors are darker than in the picture. I thought they were going to be lighter colors but there are actually some that look brown...I wish I would have gotten something else because I can&#x27;t use the browns, they dont look good on me. :(</li>
            <li> I really like then,  and the smell!!!!</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery! Exactly the way they were described!</li>
            <li> I actually really love these, i was skeptical but it was definitely worth it. Usually lipsticks dry out my lips but this doesn&#x27;t at all I would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great ordered it on Saturday received it on Tuesday, was packed nicely the colors are beautiful  glides on perfectly, it does not dry out my lips I have used many brands including Mac which always leaves my lips so dry they&#x27;re made in US great Quality better than some high quality brands. Two out of four are on the Brownside but they are beautiful colors when I apply the lighter shades it didn&#x27;t seem like there was much color until I got in the light and then I was able to see the beautiful color and as for the red well it&#x27;s just gorgeous I haven&#x27;t used it all day so I can&#x27;t say whether or not it stays on for that long but when I try to rub it off my arm it takes some scrubbing to come off so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s going to be pretty hard to take the color off thank you Kiki luxe!!</li>
            <li> I really like these lipsticks they are soft, smell wonderful and are really pretty colors if you like nudes and light pinks then you should totally order. The only negative side to the order for me is that I feel like two of the lipsticks are almost identical like they look like the same color. Which I feel like is kinda a waste. But I guess on the bright side if you run out of one color you&#x27;ll have the other one!  And also the pink is ehh.. It&#x27;s so light. doesn&#x27;t really have a good pigmentation but A pigmented lip liner and a little gloss would take care of that. I recently just used one of them for the first time and I lined my lips with Spice from Mac and then applied one of the lipstick overtop and it looked so beautiful! Total match! So i totally recommend these! I received my lipsticks in a couple of days so that was nice!</li>
            <li> Love them!!!! Beautiful colors and so soft for daily use</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love these lipsticks! Great colors and quality. You really get a lot for your money. Highly recommend!💄</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Love the colors :-)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them. They have no color. Only the red one does.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price if you like mat look.</li>
            <li> BEST LIPSTICK EVER!!! I have tried many lip products, and I have to say that Kiki lipsticks are my favorite so far. It goes on very smoothy and the color lasts a long time. I get compliments every time I wear it the red shade. It&#x27;s a perfect set for any day time or night time look! You&#x27;ll need to try it, if you haven&#x27;t already! I&#x27;ve defitnetly hit the jackpot with this amazing set!</li>
            <li> Loved this set! The colors are really nice and it smells awesome too.. I would definitely buy another set. Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> Only needs to be applied after eating or drinking.  The colors are both natural, with one vivid color.  They are better than expected.</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d give this a try but I am very disappointed! Shades are lighter than the picture except for the red. When you put them on it isn&#x27;t a deep coloring effect. It goes on almost like chap stick. Definitely do not purchase.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase.  The quality of the lipstick is similar to higher end brands.  The set arrived in 2 days and was very well packaged in a lovely gift bag.  Thank you and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Colors are very light (I have medium olive skin and they all look so pale). Definitely not drying. All in all great value if you like light lipstick and you don&#x27;t mind reapplying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry. I hate writing bad reviews, but I was very disappointed. They are five lipsticks in the pack, but four of them are the same colors (nude), and not a nice one either. The picture is very deceiving and the lipstick do not last for more than two hours max. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical buying a lipstick offline, but they turned out amazing! Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Not good at all the red One go on the teeth and the others are just shiny no color dont waste ur money Nd one star jst for bc it was fast delevery</li>
