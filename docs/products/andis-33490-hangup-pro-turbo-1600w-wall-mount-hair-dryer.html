            <li>We like the Andis 33295/33490 the best.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li>and it was wonderful...</li>
            <li>this one not too impressive...</li>
            <li>However, once in place, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Not too happy...</li>
            <li>Excellent product, works well, is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was too bright.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with quality.</li>
            <li>but we hope that the unit has better cratsmanship than the installation hardware that came with the unit.</li>
            <li>I tried to buy a replacement from the company, and found out that Amazon had a better price.</li>
            <li>and I am always pleased with the performance of this</li>
            <li>Easy to install and helps declutter the countertop.</li>
            <li>It is easy to mount onto a wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine (as in wife likes it).</li>
            <li>The heat settings are more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>We have had models with the night light and without the night light...</li>
            <li>Be sure to order the right version -- either with a plug or with a whip prepared to hardwire.</li>
            <li>Overall, it a good hair dryer, with a neat looking wall mount design.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the whole description as this hairdryer has to be HARDWIRED in and not just mounted on the wall and plugged in.</li>
            <li>Easy install; dries hair fast!</li>
            <li>we prefer the one without the night light as the greenish hue from the night light is a bit much.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased they still make the same one since I have it built into my wall.</li>
            <li>It did not blow as strong and was much louder.  </li>
            <li>No big deal, but cosmetically, I would have liked the nozzle to face the mirror.  </li>
            <li>The Andis 33490 hair dryer was easy to install and works quietly and quickly.</li>
            <li>READ THIS FIRST ---</li>
            <li>First I ordered once and nothing ever came had to cancel that order and reorder.  </li>
            <li>Easy enough for the do-it-yourselfer to install in minutes.</li>
            <li>This makes a much cleaner installation.       </li>
            <li>Make sure you order the one with a standard plug if that&#x27;s what you want, or the one with direct wire into a junction box if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li>Bought our first one 3 years ago, wife uses it nearly every day.</li>
            <li>Performance is typical for a 1600 watt dryer, nothing outstanding.  </li>
            <li>We bought two in 2000; one was to use right away and the second we used as a backup.</li>
            <li>I had to order new ones of this type of hair dryer which I had for 4 years.  </li>
            <li>There are other models that have a plug in and much simpler that look exactly like this one.</li>
            <li>The mounting hardware is very shoddy; amazingly crappy materials.</li>
            <li>There is nothing in the description that indicates that this is a direct wired product.  </li>
            <li>It is not too loud.  </li>
            <li>Over the years we have had a couple different Andis Wall Mounted units, including the #33700 with the bright green nightlight, and some other manufacturer models.  </li>
            <li>I did not open the package until we moved to our new home and discovered the mistake.  </li>
            <li>We then bought the third dryer which we are now using in our new home.</li>
            <li>This new one, although not advertised as such, is marked \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; on the outside.  </li>
            <li>However I could not tell any physical difference when comparing it side by side to the old (non-ionic) one.  </li>
            <li>It is actually noisier than a normal hand held dryer probably because of its smaller size, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one of these, my first finally had to be replaced after a long 10 years!</li>

            <li> There is nothing in the description that indicates that this is a direct wired product.  I did not open the package until we moved to our new home and discovered the mistake.  Now I cannot return it because it is past 30 days!!!</li>
            <li> Gets the cord and the dryer off the cabinet!  Easy install; dries hair fast!</li>
            <li> READ THIS FIRST --- This unit, the model #33490 is HARDWIRED!  The Andis model #33295 is the same unit with a plug.  Those giving low rating because of this alone are not justified.    Over the years we have had a couple different Andis Wall Mounted units, including the #33700 with the bright green nightlight, and some other manufacturer models.  We like the Andis 33295/33490 the best.  In my wife&#x27;s bath, they typically last 3 years of everyday use on long hair.  I just replaced her Andis 33700 with the nightlight that we purchased in Jan 2007 with the Andis 33490 hardwired unit.  My wife likes it without the nightlight.  It was too bright.  Prior to buying another Andis, I did try the Oster 76932 wall mounted dryer.  My wife did not like it.  It did not blow as strong and was much louder.  After replacing hers, the Jerdon in my bathroom died.  I also decide to purchase the Andis.  Installation/Cosmetic caution - since mine is being installed of the wall to my left, the nozzle faced outward.  No big deal, but cosmetically, I would have liked the nozzle to face the mirror.  With the wall mounted units where the unit fits perpendicular to the wall, handedness is not an issue.    Installation of the hardwired unit requires some modification to the wall mounting bracket because the pre-punched holes do not correspond to cord position on the back of the unit.  I simply drill a hole and installed a rubber grommet.  I think even if you did decide to route the wire through one of the pre-punched holes, I would use a grommet to prevent the sharp edge hole on the wall bracket from damaging the wire and possible causing an electrical short.  Additionally, you may decide to drill additional mounting holes in the bracket if you can mount it to a stud.  The three mounting holes are triangular.  So, if you hit a stud with one, you will not with the other two.    Another plus with the Andis units with a plug, is that the GFI (big square control with reset) is inside the unit, not outside on the cord.  Also, the extra cord can be wrapped inside the unit so only the minimal amount is visible.  This makes a much cleaner installation.       I wish I could find an industrial strength luxury wall mounted dryer that is build to last a lifetime.  I have looked and cannot find one.  The field is rather limited.  In my opinion, this is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these, my first finally had to be replaced after a long 10 years! I am very pleased they still make the same one since I have it built into my wall. Easy enough for the do-it-yourselfer to install in minutes.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve just installed the Andis model 33490 hard wired hair dryer as a replacement unit.  Since it hasn&#x27;t been used yet we don&#x27;t know how well it will hold up but we hope that the unit has better cratsmanship than the installation hardware that came with the unit. The mounting hardware is very shoddy; amazingly crappy materials.</li>
            <li> My current Andis wall mounted hair dryer stopped working and I wanted to order another since I do like the product.  Unfortunately, when I ordered this product the description did not indicate it needed to be \\&quot;hardwired\\&quot; rather than just plugged into the electrical outlet.  I had to return the product and that cost me money in non-refunded shipping costs!</li>
            <li> This is our second Andis 33490 Wall Mounted Hair Dryer.  The previous one lasted 3 years of practically daily use.  A little disappointing since our other hair dryers typically lasts longer.  This one is almost identical to the previous one we had.  Performance is typical for a 1600 watt dryer, nothing outstanding.  It is actually noisier than a normal hand held dryer probably because of its smaller size, but it does the job.  This new one, although not advertised as such, is marked \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; on the outside.  However I could not tell any physical difference when comparing it side by side to the old (non-ionic) one.  We did not notice any difference in performance.    Overall, it a good hair dryer, with a neat looking wall mount design.</li>
            <li> Andis MicroTurbo with this model number on the outer box - not even close!  [[ASIN:B001UE7D32 Andis 30095 Micro Turbo 1200 Watt Hair Dryer]]  Website picture of the the picture and description is misleading.</li>
            <li> I removed the ground fault interupter to repair it.  Not needed since there is one in the breaker.</li>
            <li> Bought our first one 3 years ago, wife uses it nearly every day. Remodeling another bathroom and buying this one for that room. Very satisfied with quality.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine (as in wife likes it). She uses a mesh-like diffuser over it. They seem to burn out after about 5 years.    Be sure to order the right version -- either with a plug or with a whip prepared to hardwire. The hardwired version has a specific place for the electical box.</li>
            <li> we have had this item for several years. If it ever quits we will get another one Would be lost without it</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the whole description as this hairdryer has to be HARDWIRED in and not just mounted on the wall and plugged in.</li>
            <li> This one is going back, can not be installed.  It is a HARD WIRE model, which is described in the PRODUCT INFORMATION!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Easy to install and helps declutter the countertop. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works well, is easy to use. This is the third that we have purchased. We bought two in 2000; one was to use right away and the second we used as a backup. The first one did eventually fail and we then installed the second one. When we sold our home the second dryer was still going but had to stay as part of the house sale. We then bought the third dryer which we are now using in our new home. We have had models with the night light and without the night light...we prefer the one without the night light as the greenish hue from the night light is a bit much.</li>
            <li> The Andis 33490 hair dryer was easy to install and works quietly and quickly.</li>
            <li> very difficult to install. There are other models that have a plug in and much simpler that look exactly like this one.</li>
            <li> I had to order new ones of this type of hair dryer which I had for 4 years.  They worked without a problem.  The only thing I found to complain about was with two of them exposed to sunlight the plastic of the base unit changed to a yellow tint while the blower remained white.</li>
            <li> I was not too impress with Amazon .com or the product this time...First I ordered once and nothing ever came had to cancel that order and reorder.  Product came and I specifily said with plug what I got was hair dryer with no plug which my husband had to put a plug on and it still is not very warm when it dries... Not too happy... I&#x27;ve had one of these before for about 8 years and it was wonderful... this one not too impressive...</li>
            <li> I have used one of these for years. I tried to buy a replacement from the company, and found out that Amazon had a better price.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this as a replacement for the same model I had for 9 years. The template provided makes it easy to attach the metal base plate to the wall. It was a little bit of work to snap the unit into the base plate. However, once in place, it works beautifully. Note: this unit plugs into the wall.</li>
            <li> The volume of air that blows is plentiful.  The heat settings are more than adequate.  It is not too loud.  It is easy to mount onto a wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought several of these over the years for two of my houses and I am always pleased with the performance of this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I must caution potential buyers with the following two cautions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The version with the &amp;#34;nightlight&amp;#34; -- the nightlight failed after a few months.  Don&#x27;t bother with that extra option.  The version with the built-in digital clock -- the clock failed after a few months.  Don&#x27;t bother with that extra option.  Just get the plain one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Make sure you order the one with a standard plug if that&#x27;s what you want, or the one with direct wire into a junction box if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
