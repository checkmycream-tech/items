            <li>I love these pastilles - I remember them from my childhood!</li>
            <li>I love these pastilles!....</li>
            <li>These are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Well, they do taste good but are nothing more than a glorified gummy candy.  </li>
            <li>Changed my review to 5 stars as these really are the best candy in the world.</li>
            <li>I prefer the sugar free, but both are good.  </li>
            <li>Arrived super fresh, tin in perfect shape.  </li>
            <li>I have looked for many years to find a substitute.</li>
            <li>Although these are higher priced, I am willing to pay for a drop that soothes my throat and tastes delicious.</li>
            <li>Spend the money, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I love these pastilles.</li>
            <li>Was expecting more relief from a sore throat than what was delivered.  </li>
            <li>Have used for many years.  </li>
            <li>again love the product</li>
            <li>Sadly I love these - so do my co-workers.</li>
            <li>I used to have them as a kid many years ago</li>
            <li>and i fell in love again.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Been enjoying these pastilles for 45 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can still find them.</li>
            <li>Trader Joe used to carry them, and I was downhearted not to be able to purchase them.  </li>
            <li>Please...don&#x27;t ever stop!:)  </li>
            <li>and the flavour is fabulous!</li>
            <li>This not the authentic Swiss Pastilles.  </li>
            <li>If you really love this candy, this is the one to get.</li>
            <li>They are not too sweet and kind of taste like berries.</li>
            <li>let alone to get a taste of the delicious blackcurrant pastilles, then put aboard a tramp steamer from the 1920s that gets lost in a maelstrom where the surviving crew get washed up on a desert island and get attacked by grizzlies and the single survivor makes a tent out of grizzly hides, and lives there for two years before being rescued by pirates who force him work aboard their ship for 5 years before he gets released into my home city, and with him in his pocket</li>
            <li>I have been a believer in these pastilles ever since and was glad to see them on Amazon, as they were readily available in NYC, but not out here in the West.</li>
            <li>I wish they were more available.</li>
            <li>It is not hand picked by virgins on the first day of spring, then added to a pot along with  water from the fountain of youth and honey from the top of a 400 foot tall tree then stirred lovingly with a unicorn&#x27;s horn by the queen of Sheeba for 60 hours then delivered by mule through 2000 miles of rain forest, where all the natives will murder you for crossing their territory</li>
            <li>I am so happy that Amazon.com offers this product.  </li>
            <li>I loved the ones thar used real suar .</li>
            <li>I call them her special gummy!</li>
            <li>My favorite candy: slightly tart, excellent flavor!</li>
            <li>Costs more but worth the expense!</li>
            <li>If you like chewy candy that tastes of black currants and can soothe your throat, you can&#x27;t do better than these they taste incredible.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if some special insulation was applied, during hot weather, to protect the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update..</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Fantastic candies...</li>
            <li>Thanks for bringing back wonderful memories- AND soothing my throat!</li>
            <li>The taste is great, very natural and not fake or chemical tasting.</li>
            <li>they take a long time to dissolve, taste great and moisten your throat as advertized.</li>
            <li>I just love these and wish I could find them more easily, but I&#x27;m now on my third box and can find no fault with the service from the Seller.</li>
            <li>They really and truly soothe my throat as well as somehow magically relieve any anxiety I have.</li>
            <li>They the are addictive, and the non-sugar free ones are best as actual lozenges for the voice.</li>
            <li>I will order these again, but in cool weather to avoid this happening.  </li>
            <li>My large boxes always include a small purse-sized tin which is totally brilliant!</li>
            <li>These are so good to keep by the bedside for the winter nights where the electric heat is running and your throat is so dry you can&#x27;t sleep.</li>
            <li>They are consumed for dry throats or just for the good taste.</li>
            <li>There are no artificial colors or flavors.</li>
            <li>Blackcurrant Pastilles not only tastes great, they are completely soothing to your throat.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying BP since I was a young kid.  </li>
            <li>Wish I could afford to buy these more frequently.</li>
            <li>The original is much firmer.</li>
            <li>The texture is firmer than a gummy and the size is just right for one at a time.</li>
            <li>They have not been available for a long time, I am so glad to be abe to get them again.</li>
            <li>Fresh and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>If you like black currant Pastilles, this is also a good product to try.</li>
            <li>Love that tart black current flavor and its a good lubrication for my throat.</li>
            <li>They are hard yet gummy and a great flavor.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The cost would not stop me from purchasing them if their effectiveness was more lasting and that much better than the standard lozenges.</li>
            <li>so it was pretty hilarious to see this giant tin when opening the package.</li>
            <li>pastilles he carried through madness, despair, slavery and starvation, and right before dying he places the pastilles gently on my doorstep and is carried off on angels wings.  </li>
            <li>They are very flavorful and just the right consistency to moisten my mouth and throat.</li>
            <li>large tin lasts me a couple of months -</li>
            <li>very soothing lubricant.  </li>
            <li>Important since I am a public speaker.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>She is slender and wants to stay that way.</li>
            <li>Very soothing to the vocal cords.  </li>
            <li>They really help irritated throats.</li>
            <li>the clever tin container makes you think that these have been the secret of many, many years before.</li>
            <li>Order the large box, and you get a handy small box inside for carrying pastilles in your pocket, gym bag, purse, etc.</li>
            <li>I, now, order them, only, in cool weather..</li>
            <li>SUPER ADDICTIVE!</li>
            <li>Great throat lozenges but expensive.</li>
            <li>where we live.</li>
            <li>Mine also came with a free mini tin which I absolutely adore and like to put a few Pastilles in so that I can keep in my purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second shipment pastilles were hard and seemed to be old even though the date was still good.  </li>
            <li>I first saw a box of these being opened by my seatmate (a total stranger) at the Metropolitan Opera; she gave me one.</li>
            <li>The one box I ordered was a bit dry and shrunken but teh next box was fine.</li>
            <li>fine glycerin smacks of pure cassis black current flavor with the texture of rubber.</li>
            <li>The Black Currant is such an appealing flavour.</li>
            <li>They came fresh and were soft as expected.</li>
            <li>The tin is a classy way to store them wiothout them hardening.</li>
            <li>As a professional singer, I use them a lot during a show.</li>
            <li>I get frequent post nasal drip coughs from a deviated septum, and one of these  stops my coughing immediately.</li>
            <li>A must have for Voiceover talent, Singers, Actors, MC&#x27;s, DJ&#x27;s and anyone that uses their voice professionally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soft.  </li>
            <li>But these work as a mild expectorant--everything loosens up and calms down.</li>
            <li>If you let them sit a long time they will cure nicely and become stiffer and harder and less chewy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same exact design as the regular tin except big as a brick.</li>
            <li>She has to use them frequently and thinks that they did not help enough to keep her from going back to her old ones.</li>
            <li>They are expensive but they work so well and are so delicious it is hard to keep my kids from wanting to eat them like gummy bears!</li>
            <li>black current pastilles are like a tougher version of a gummy and are fun to suck on.</li>
            <li>These glycerine-based lozenges are estremely soothing for irritated vocal folds and other tissues of the throat, especially for people who talk far too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to remember that I buy these for my throat and not just for something sweet to eat.</li>
            <li>I just wish they were more readily available for a less expensive price!</li>
            <li>Rather than return the item, I had to cut it apart, into smaller pieces, which, really, did not work because they stuck to each other.  </li>
            <li>Personally I really like the black currant flavor and find them addictive.</li>

            <li> pastilles he carried through madness, despair, slavery and starvation, and right before dying he places the pastilles gently on my doorstep and is carried off on angels wings.  </li>

            <li> Order the large box, and you get a handy small box inside for carrying pastilles in your pocket, gym bag, purse, etc.</li>
            <li> I, now, order them, only, in cool weather..</li>
            <li> SUPER ADDICTIVE!</li>
            <li> Great throat lozenges but expensive.</li>
            <li> where we live.</li>
            <li> Mine also came with a free mini tin which I absolutely adore and like to put a few Pastilles in so that I can keep in my purse.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s too soft.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to remember that I buy these for my throat and not just for something sweet to eat.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are amazing!  Obviously, they are also VERY expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it. There is nothing even remotely similar to these in any way. Typical sore throat drops only aim to provide a numbing effect. But these work as a mild expectorant--everything loosens up and calms down. Bonus: they taste great.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s always a point in the day when something, not necessarily big and calorie loaded, but something is needed to cut the dreariness......and literally, just one BLACKCURRANT PASTILLES does it......the clever tin container makes you think that these have been the secret of many, many years before.</li>
            <li> I used to buy throat drops in a little box (can&#x27;t remember the brand) until they stopped manufacturing them. I have looked for many years to find a substitute. Airborne had glycerine throat drops a few years ago, but I haven&#x27;t found any for the last few years. I finally stumbled upon these. These are excellent! There are no artificial colors or flavors. They are like the drops I remembered. The taste is great, very natural and not fake or chemical tasting. This almost one pound tin contains a tiny tin to fill and put in your purse or pocket. Although these are higher priced, I am willing to pay for a drop that soothes my throat and tastes delicious.</li>
            <li> My go-to when my voice gets tired at work.</li>
            <li> I just love these and wish I could find them more easily, but I&#x27;m now on my third box and can find no fault with the service from the Seller. My large boxes always include a small purse-sized tin which is totally brilliant! It&#x27;s hard to remember that I buy these for my throat and not just for something sweet to eat. They are delicious!</li>
            <li> I have a problem throat in that I am hoarse a lot.  I was so hopeful that these lozenges would be soothing and help me out.  Well, they do taste good but are nothing more than a glorified gummy candy.  For $50, that is unacceptable.  I have emailed the shipper twice requesting instructions on how to return for refund and have gotten no response.  So I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product...does what it is intended to do.  very soothing lubricant.  Important since I am a public speaker.  product was recommended by voice coach, who was referred by ENT M.D.</li>
            <li> Have loved these since I was a child!</li>
            <li> Hello these are a delight to your palate! Having only 18 calories each is a plus. They soothe your sore throat without a nasty taste. The texture is firmer than a gummy and the size is just right for one at a time. The tin is a classy way to store them wiothout them hardening. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great throat lozenges but expensive.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful when I need to do a lot of talking.  I also like them whenever I have a sore throat from colds.</li>
            <li> As a trained Voice Over artist and someone who records a lot.  This product is so great tasting and good to keep my vocals lubricated  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> These are the best things for your throat EVER. As a professional singer, I use them a lot during a show. Wish there was a US distributor (mine always come from London) but to the merchant&#x27;s credit shipping time almost never looks like the estimate. Always MUCH earlier than expected. Spend the money, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> My wife has a long time tickling sensation in the back of her throat that makes her cough. A friend gave her a pastille and it seemed to ease the irritation. She has to use them frequently and thinks that they did not help enough to keep her from going back to her old ones. They are sugar free and a lot less expensive.  She is slender and wants to stay that way. The cost would not stop me from purchasing them if their effectiveness was more lasting and that much better than the standard lozenges.</li>
            <li> These are so good to keep by the bedside for the winter nights where the electric heat is running and your throat is so dry you can&#x27;t sleep. They are expensive but they work so well and are so delicious it is hard to keep my kids from wanting to eat them like gummy bears! I have never found them locally and Amazon is my &#x27;go to&#x27; place when I can&#x27;t find what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any with voice or throat problems. It sooths and moistens your throat and vocal cords.</li>
            <li> I love these pastilles. The flavor and texture are unsurpassed. They have not been available for a long time, I am so glad to be abe to get them again.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the shipment and will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> First shipment was perfect. Second shipment pastilles were hard and seemed to be old even though the date was still good.  I will return.</li>
            <li> These are great and quite tasty!</li>
            <li> I first saw a box of these being opened by my seatmate (a total stranger) at the Metropolitan Opera; she gave me one. I have been a believer in these pastilles ever since and was glad to see them on Amazon, as they were readily available in NYC, but not out here in the West. where we live. I get frequent post nasal drip coughs from a deviated septum, and one of these  stops my coughing immediately. Order the large box, and you get a handy small box inside for carrying pastilles in your pocket, gym bag, purse, etc.</li>
            <li> Best lozenges EVER!  I just wish they were more readily available for a less expensive price!</li>
            <li> Great for the throat!!!</li>
            <li> These glycerine-based lozenges are estremely soothing for irritated vocal folds and other tissues of the throat, especially for people who talk far too much.</li>
            <li> Excellent for strained voices.....</li>
            <li> I loved the ones thar used real suar . They really and truly soothe my throat as well as somehow magically relieve any anxiety I have. Magically delicious.</li>
            <li> Was expecting more relief from a sore throat than what was delivered.  The taste is awesome but that wasn&#x27;t the purpose for the purchase.  If they were cheaper I would purchase again for the flavor.</li>
            <li> this is a great lozenge if you have reflux and must avoid mint.  they take a long time to dissolve, taste great and moisten your throat as advertized.</li>
            <li> Have used for many years.  Very soothing to the vocal cords.  Helps to stifle a cough for me.</li>
            <li> They really help irritated throats. We order pastilles a couple of times a year. I wish they were more available.</li>
            <li> I will order from you guys again love the product</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using these your years and they are consistently good! They are consumed for dry throats or just for the good taste.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended Grether&#x27;s Pastilles to me due to my paralyzed vocal cord.  They sooth my throat without any dryness or irritation which you can get from regular cough drops.    Costs more but worth the expense!</li>
            <li> These are just as good as they were 40+ years ago!! Thanks for bringing back wonderful memories- AND soothing my throat!</li>
            <li> The best for a dry mouth tastes great works great so happy I encourage you to try</li>
            <li> If you like chewy candy that tastes of black currants and can soothe your throat, you can&#x27;t do better than these they taste incredible. I give one star because the due date for delivery is 37 days from now.  This candy is made in a factory in England.  It is not hand picked by virgins on the first day of spring, then added to a pot along with  water from the fountain of youth and honey from the top of a 400 foot tall tree then stirred lovingly with a unicorn&#x27;s horn by the queen of Sheeba for 60 hours then delivered by mule through 2000 miles of rain forest, where all the natives will murder you for crossing their territory let alone to get a taste of the delicious blackcurrant pastilles, then put aboard a tramp steamer from the 1920s that gets lost in a maelstrom where the surviving crew get washed up on a desert island and get attacked by grizzlies and the single survivor makes a tent out of grizzly hides, and lives there for two years before being rescued by pirates who force him work aboard their ship for 5 years before he gets released into my home city, and with him in his pocket he carries a single untouched tin of pastilles; pastilles he carried through madness, despair, slavery and starvation, and right before dying he places the pastilles gently on my doorstep and is carried off on angels wings.  P.S.  Actually, they arrived in 3 days.  Changed my review to 5 stars as these really are the best candy in the world.</li>
            <li> Delicious. Great product.delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Sadly I love these - so do my co-workers. Why is this sad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for! These are high-quality, very superior tasting, throat soothing pastilles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are EXPENSIVE - and worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is very nice - not too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a challenge not to chew them because they taste so nice.&lt;br /&gt;The large tin lasts me a couple of months - so perhaps it&#x27;s not too bad ;)</li>
            <li> I prefer the sugar free, but both are good.  The one box I ordered was a bit dry and shrunken but teh next box was fine.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat these. The Black Currant is such an appealing flavour. Remember these from the 50&#x27;s and it seems the same formula and quality is still maintained.</li>
            <li> I had to order the big pack because I ate the 3oz in a couple days :X SUPER ADDICTIVE! INSANELY AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> Fresh and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The blackcurrant ones taste great! You should try them. Warning! They the are addictive, and the non-sugar free ones are best as actual lozenges for the voice. If you like the black currant I recommend trying Ribena products, and if you like the texture of the pastilles try Pine Bros. Softish Lozenges in Wild Cherry, and a few other flavors. Enjoy. PS. Do not give to small children as there is a choking hazard as with any small size candy or lozenge. F&#x27;ing customs loves to slice open your boxes. WTF do They think is hiden in these things. but the got sbtle tis time im reporting it.</li>
            <li> Preserve your instrument...Blackcurrant Pastilles not only tastes great, they are completely soothing to your throat. A must have for Voiceover talent, Singers, Actors, MC&#x27;s, DJ&#x27;s and anyone that uses their voice professionally.</li>
            <li> These have been a family staple for decades. My kid even likes them. I call them her special gummy!</li>
            <li> These are great gummy candy. I used to have them as a kid many years ago and i fell in love again. They are hard yet gummy and a great flavor.</li>
            <li> whatever you do avoid this product! What do you want me to say,&amp;#34;they&#x27;re great&amp;#34;? are you kidding?and let the rest of you guys in on a long kept secret?</li>
            <li> Best throat lozenges I&#x27;ve ever used and they taste great!</li>
            <li> If you like black current, you&#x27;ll like these. They last a long time in one&#x27;s mouth and are soothing. They are also cost a lot.</li>
            <li> Love them. They work really well for a tired voice.</li>
            <li> I am highly impressed with the product and the help given me to accomplish this.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jean</li>
            <li> I love these pastilles - I remember them from my childhood!</li>
            <li> One of my very favorite pick-me-ups. Loaded with flavor, yet not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if these work when you have throat problems, but they&#x27;re delicious and I&#x27;ll be buying them again,</li>
            <li> Soothing, taste great, nice packaging, how much more would you ask for in a pastille. Been enjoying these pastilles for 45 years.</li>
            <li> GP is the best. Traditionally made. I have been enjoying BP since I was a young kid.  If you let them sit a long time they will cure nicely and become stiffer and harder and less chewy. They came fresh and were soft as expected. I keep them for about year.&lt;br /&gt;The fine glycerin smacks of pure cassis black current flavor with the texture of rubber. It will literally last hours in my mouth when sucked slowly. Love that tart black current flavor and its a good lubrication for my throat. I&#x27;m so glad I can still find them.</li>
            <li> I love these pastilles!....but there was no provision for extreme heat re the packing that had been done.  I watched all day, so that I would see when it had been delivered.  The package was tossed over my gate, left on the ground, and within five minutes, when I brought it into the house, all of the pieces had formed into one square.  Rather than return the item, I had to cut it apart, into smaller pieces, which, really, did not work because they stuck to each other.  I will order these again, but in cool weather to avoid this happening.  It would be nice if some special insulation was applied, during hot weather, to protect the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update..I hope the shipper takes note of my previous review.  I, now, order them, only, in cool weather..although I hope that some provision will be made, in the future, for hot-weather packaging.  These are sensational!  Trader Joe used to carry them, and I was downhearted not to be able to purchase them.  I am so happy that Amazon.com offers this product.  Please...don&#x27;t ever stop!:)  The only problem I have with them is that they are addictive...lol  Great for many reasons...and the flavour is fabulous!</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  If you haven&#x27;t tried them, you are missing out.</li>
            <li> This not the authentic Swiss Pastilles.  It&#x27;s too soft.  The original is much firmer.</li>
            <li> Wish I could afford to buy these more frequently. They are very flavorful and just the right consistency to moisten my mouth and throat.</li>
            <li> Fantastic candies... Arrived super fresh, tin in perfect shape.  Only problem is that I can&#x27;t stop eating them.</li>
            <li> My favorite candy: slightly tart, excellent flavor!</li>
            <li> If you really love this candy, this is the one to get. If you like black currant Pastilles, this is also a good product to try. I&#x27;ve purchased the regular 3.75 oz size before so it was pretty hilarious to see this giant tin when opening the package. It&#x27;s the same exact design as the regular tin except big as a brick. Mine also came with a free mini tin which I absolutely adore and like to put a few Pastilles in so that I can keep in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These black current pastilles are like a tougher version of a gummy and are fun to suck on. Personally I really like the black currant flavor and find them addictive. They are not too sweet and kind of taste like berries. They are not minty and do not taste like cough drops or throat lozenges. I did start taking them due to a cough and I do think it has help reduce my cough.</li>
