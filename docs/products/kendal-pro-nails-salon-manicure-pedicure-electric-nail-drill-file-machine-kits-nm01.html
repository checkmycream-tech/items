            <li>I was so happy because I top all my brothers and my sister with mother&#x27;s day....</li>
            <li>And am loving it.</li>
            <li>spins nicely until you are on othe nail.  </li>
            <li>Very nice and light weight</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very good quality it works for now but dosent have very much power.</li>
            <li>I need one with more power.</li>
            <li>It costs a lot more money than this, but let&#x27;s be</li>
            <li>The BEST feature has to be the locking on the actual drill part for the bit.</li>
            <li>This ítem never reduce the speed, Always is on top speed</li>
            <li>I received this item promptly, and was very excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>THE BEST DRIL HANDS DOWN !</li>
            <li>Cheap drill.</li>
            <li>So I have to give great credit to the company and change my feed back on this product.</li>
            <li>Learned my lesson to not not buy cheap knock off products to practice.</li>
            <li>its okay not much power but good</li>
            <li>it would stop, really, what good does that do as a professional!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for your effort and kindness.</li>
            <li>I had written a negative review on this product and the company has made great effort for this problem.</li>
            <li>At first I was scare to use it.</li>
            <li>It broke the first day I got it, drilled once and over heated.</li>
            <li>It went from low RPMs (Revolutions Per Minute) to top speed with no in-between.  </li>
            <li>this is my first one.</li>
            <li>and it saves me so much time rather than hand filling</li>
            <li>On my particular unit the variable speed... didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>realistic - one gets what one pays for.</li>
            <li>The drill was stuck on high reguardless of where the slide button was located.</li>
            <li>Works well, very little vibration - hand piece stays cool and is light weight enough to handle all day</li>
            <li>So far no problems with this purchase I use a lot</li>
            <li>quiet,easy to use and doesn&#x27;t get hot after long use.</li>
            <li>The torque did remain pretty constant, even during the heavy use during the initial try out.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> realistic - one gets what one pays for.</li>
            <li> The drill was stuck on high reguardless of where the slide button was located.</li>

            <li> The torque did remain pretty constant, even during the heavy use during the initial try out.  </li>
            <li> - the mouth opening is slightly too small to fit the standard US bit sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not a strong enough motor if you are using all day as a professional.</li>
            <li> Has a lot of vibration and not a whole lot of power.</li>
            <li> I absolutely do not think this happens with all the units, but I opted for a Dremel unit with the cable instead.  </li>
            <li> will have to find alternate bits once the few &amp;#34;Reasonably O.K&amp;#34; bits that came with the machine are spent.</li>
            <li> Runs real  rough not very smooth&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> only negative is that my 3/32 bits do not fit the machine</li>
            <li> It bogs down and does not hold tightly in the spin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it stopped working after a little while</li>
            <li> I find it odd that a company would try this hard to correct something.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money, go with brand instead and not these cheapies!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I do use variable speeds as I use the bits for a wide variety of 3-D nail art fixes and tweaks.  </li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> Worst machine</li>

            <li> Used this drill for one day and then the button to change the speed stopped working. The drill was stuck on high reguardless of where the slide button was located. Cheap drill. Get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> the machine worked for 15 - 20 minutes then it start speeding out of control.  The machine was faulty.  I hate it</li>
            <li> I had written a negative review on this product and the company has made great effort for this problem. They have went to great lengths to correct it. So I have to give great credit to the company and change my feed back on this product. I find it odd that a company would try this hard to correct something. Thank you very much for your effort and kindness.</li>
            <li> I never had a acrylic machine filer. And am loving it. At first I was scare to use it. Now that am getting use to it I need one with more power.</li>
            <li> spins nicely until you are on othe nail.  It bogs down and does not hold tightly in the spin.&lt;br /&gt;I will be sending it back this week.</li>
            <li> This would be great for home use. Has a lot of vibration and not a whole lot of power. Not a strong enough motor if you are using all day as a professional. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> Did not work was not like the pic</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very good quality it works for now but dosent have very much power.</li>
            <li> So far no problems with this purchase I use a lot and it saves me so much time rather than hand filling</li>
            <li> It broke the first day I got it, drilled once and over heated. Learned my lesson to not not buy cheap knock off products to practice.</li>
            <li> I received this item promptly, and was very excited to try it out.  On my particular unit the variable speed... didn&#x27;t.  It went from low RPMs (Revolutions Per Minute) to top speed with no in-between.  The torque did remain pretty constant, even during the heavy use during the initial try out.  Even with the speed issue I would have kept the drill - I did like it a lot.  Unfortunately I do use variable speeds as I use the bits for a wide variety of 3-D nail art fixes and tweaks.  I had no problem with returning the unit.  I absolutely do not think this happens with all the units, but I opted for a Dremel unit with the cable instead.  It costs a lot more money than this, but let&#x27;s be realistic - one gets what one pays for.</li>
            <li> its okay not much power but good</li>
            <li> it stopped working after a little while</li>
            <li> I was using a battery powered drill !!! I cant believe it even removed any gel after using this Kendal Pro Nails Electric Drill !!!  It was 2 directions, you can use the foot pedal or  the power on the box, it has like 10 different speeds and can go forwards and backwards !!!  The BEST feature has to be the locking on the actual drill part for the bit. If you have used a drill that didnt have a locking mechanism then you know as your drilling and filing the tip will just fall out !!!  THE BEST DRIL HANDS DOWN !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the machine for about a week now.  Works well, very little vibration - hand piece stays cool and is light weight enough to handle all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that my 3/32 bits do not fit the machine - the mouth opening is slightly too small to fit the standard US bit sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to find alternate bits once the few &amp;#34;Reasonably O.K&amp;#34; bits that came with the machine are spent.</li>
            <li> quiet,easy to use and doesn&#x27;t get hot after long use.Someone said it doesn&#x27;t work with their standard bit sizes but I don&#x27;t know about that yert this is my first one.</li>
            <li> The nail drill broke the second time I used it</li>
            <li> My machine had problems since I bought it now it don&#x27;t work 👎 Worst machine</li>
            <li> This ítem never reduce the speed, Always is on top speed</li>
            <li> It has a lot of speed but as soon as you touch it to the nail it almost stops the motor has no power would not recommend this drill.</li>
            <li> Runs real  rough not very smooth&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this electric nail file&lt;br /&gt;I ended up sending it back</li>
            <li> i bought one similar to this one, it may be the same seller and now i am having the hardest time collecting my money from them. i messaged them to tell them i did not want it, its almost like a toy. as soon as i would touch the nail it would stop, really, what good does that do as a professional! Now i am out my money and drill since i returned it per seller request. This is a waste of money, go with brand instead and not these cheapies! For the review about the mothers gift, i want to know if she was as happy when she used it, i think not!</li>
            <li> My mom has been asking for one of these  machines for the longest. I got it for mother&#x27;s day and when it arrived at her house I was on the phone. I told her to open it and when she did all you can do was hear her scream and say THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!! This is the best mother&#x27;s day giif I ever gotten. I was so happy because I top all my brothers and my sister with mother&#x27;s day....</li>
            <li> Bought 2 and use them both always!!!! Very nice and light weight</li>
