    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 weeks now. i&#x27;m rating it a 1..because  this product has done nothing in doing what it was suppose to do. which is  make lashes longer,thicker,and fuller. i really wanted this product to work   for me. so i don&#x27;t think i will be placing another order for it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it does work.  Have been using it for about 6 months now and there is a noticeable difference in the length and thickness of my eyelashes.  I often don&#x27;t even bother wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it was on a great sale and the reviews seemed generally positive, but I was skeptical and really didn&#x27;t expect much.  I applied this item EVERY night to both bottom and top lashes for a month, which is when they say you should notice a difference. NOTHING happened after a month, but I figured what the heck might as well finish the product. Two weeks later (so after 6 weeks of nightly application) I noticed my bottom lashes were much longer and my top lashes were less sparse and longer as well. I am thrilled with this product. I used to have to layer on black mascara which is such a pain to take off at night. Now I no longer need mascara, and I apply this product 2-3 times a week for maintenance.  If you don&#x27;t see results after a month STICK WITH IT.</li>
            <li> If you continue to use this product every night, you will see results.  My lashes have never looked so good!</li>
            <li> THe best product to grow your eyelashes and even your eyebrows! You&#x27;re suppose to see results within 4-6 weeks but my eyelashes starting growing like weeds within 1 1/2 weeks and I  accomplished my desired length in 4 weeks. I had tried latisse.  It made my eyelashes grow also but it took longer to see the results,  made my eyes red and irritated, and was definitely much more exspensive. And u have to go throuh he hassle of getting a prescription from a doctor! I recommened rapid lash to anyone and everyone who wants thicker fuller lashes to get rapidlash. You just can&#x27;t go wrong :)</li>
            <li> This product is great!!  I noticed a difference in the length and fullness of my lashes in one weeks time.  Will buy again and again</li>
            <li> I first bought this product @ Walgreens, it made a HUGE difference. my eyelashes weren&#x27;t too thin / short to begin w/ but after using this for a few weeks people would constantly ask me if i was wearing false lashes. I am glad i can buy this product from amazon for about 1/2 the price i paid @ Walgreen&#x27;s. :)i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product really works! It is also a lot less money than other Lash growing products. This Rapid Lash size, will last at two  months or more,  if applied as directed.</li>
            <li> My niece recommended this product. When I saw her lash photos, I had to try it. It really works! Forget paying megabucks for prescription Latishe (or whatever it&#x27;s called).</li>
            <li> About six months ago I purchased Rapid Lash eyelash and brow serum and I absolutely love it.  I was skeptical at first because it took a little longer for my lashes to grow and thicken.  I have the typical short, thin, Asian eyelashes.  I would apply it to my top and bottom lash line every night before bed.  It was slow in the beginning, but by the 4th week I started to see a slight difference then by the 8th week a very dramatic difference in the length.  I had a friend recently commented to me and said \\&quot;omg... your lashes are really long!\\&quot;  That made me feel good and I knew then that the product really works.  So, I&#x27;ve been devoted to this product for six months now and my lashes are fuller and longer and I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash for about 9 weeks and my lashes are definitely longer and slightly fuller. I think my eyebrows are fuller also. I don&#x27;t know if I will continue to use it, I am starting my 3rd vial/sample and will decide if it is worth it. I still need to use mascara!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to early to see any results.  However, I am using it as instructed and I will have to give it some time.</li>
            <li> I used this product and I started to see fuller lashes within three weeks. I have sparse lashes, because when they itch or I get stress I pull at them. I realized this makes them luck ugly so i tried this product and it helped me grow fuller lashes. I am on my second bottle and plan to keep using the product to help my brows grow faster and enhance my lashes even more sso they can be longer, thicker, and the same length.I am learning how to stop my bad habit of pulling my lashes now I won&#x27;t have to wear mascara to cover the bald spaces. Thinks rapid lash!!!</li>
            <li> When I first received the Rapid Lash serum, I was very faithful in applying it on my lashline every night before bedtime.  During the first week, I did not notice anything.  The second &amp; third week my lashes started falling out.  By the end of the third week, all my eyelashes were gone.  Completely bald!  But I was still applying the Rapid Lash serum every night!  Then on the fifth week, I noticed baby hairs growing on my lash line.  The following week, my lashes were getting longer &amp; I was feeling a bit more confident.  Two months after I received the Rapid Lash, my eyelashes are the longest they&#x27;ve ever been.  I was ready to give up in the middle of it all.  But I stayed faithful &amp; patient.  I will continue to use Rapid Lash to maintain the long length of my eyelashes.  I am very satisfied with the results.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am the world&#x27;s biggest skeptic because nothing ever works for me. UNTIL NOW. For the price, I thought, what the heck I&#x27;ll try it. It took about 5 wks. before I started to notice longer lashes and I did use it every night faithfully. I didn&#x27;t use mascara the whole time just to see if I would notice the difference. So at 6 wks. I put mascara on and there is a very real difference in the length of my lashes and I seem to have more lashes too. Everyone is different, but this worked for me. I will cut back to every other day and see if it maintains what I have. I don&#x27;t know how much product I have left, but I&#x27;m ordering another one so I&#x27;ll have it. It&#x27;s lasted about 9 wks so far.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have re-ordered several times. It makes my lashes longer and fuller. I don&#x27;t even have to use an eyelash curler anymore!</li>
            <li> After using as directed every night for 4 weeks, I started to finally see noticeably longer and darker lashes. I am on my second tube now and am pleased with the results. The first few times I used Rapid Lash it made my lids a bit red and sensitive, after continued use I had no further issues or negative side effects. Overall I am happy with the results. Rapid Lash is also a much more cost effective way to achieve longer and darker lashes vs an Rx.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me. I was a little worried after reading other reviews. I used it every night but didn&#x27;t see results until the 5th week. Didn&#x27;t have any issues with eyelash fallout or burning. Really happy with results.</li>
            <li> This product really worked for me.  However, it does take a while to see results.  After I had been using it a month, I still had not seen any major changes, but after a couple of months, people thought I was wearing false eyelahes.  The product lasts a long time too, so it is a good value for the money.  I am now on my second purchase, so I would recommend it.  It did not seem to do much for my eyebrows, however.</li>
            <li> I think this is waste of maney I used for 9 week and I do not see any difference only wasting my time to. To disapointe not recommended. [[ASIN:B003339APW Rapid Lash]]</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on Latisse, I did my homework and found decent reviews on Rapid Lash. I also was hesitant about the darkening of eye color (I have light brown eyes) - and have not had any darkening at all.  By the 2nd week I noticed increase in length and number of eyelashes. A few did start falling off...but I continued to use the product and was extra gentle when removing makeup &amp; washing my face. Now at 5weeks none are falling out. My eye lashes are noticeably longer and fuller. For under $30...VERY worth it. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am 52 and have had tiny,  some what sparse lashes all my life. Mascara can only help so much.  So many times you buy a cometic product that makes great claims, but falls  far short. THIS ONE DOES WHAT IT PROMISES. It has such a wow factor for me. My lashes look better now without mascara than they did before with mascara. I love it. My sister loves it. I purchased RL in early February  of this year and within 2 weeks had very visible results. It is now May ,andat the very least, I have triple thickness and length in my lashes !  I can not rave enough about  RapidLash. I thought about Latisse,but did not want to be committed to spending  100 + a month so decided to take a chance with much more reasonably priced Rapid Lash.  I have had a  tiny little bit of itchiness initially. The wows are real on this product.</li>
