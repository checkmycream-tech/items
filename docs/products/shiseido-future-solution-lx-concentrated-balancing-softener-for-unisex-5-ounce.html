            <li> Have used Shiseido products for over 30 years. Have changed the formulations through the years as my skin changed. This is worth every penny!  If you have drier, slightly aging skin, you will be amazed with the Future Solution line.  Try the cleanser!</li>
            <li> I have used Lancome&#x27; skincare products for 19 years, and I looked about 7 to 10 years younger than my bio age.  About 3 months ago, I began to look bad, more winkle and deep lines, age spots, and dry skin.  I knew it was the time for me to use another kind of skincare products.  I read all the information of most of the skincare products, and I did all the research (I am a bio scientist and researcher.  I finally decided to use Shiseido&#x27;s LX future solution collection and Benefiance NutriPerfect collection.  At night I use LX future solution collection, at day time I use Benefiance collection.  Shiseido make me another 10 years younger in less than two weeks.  Now I look 15 to 17 years younger than my bio-age.  My husband, my sister-in-law, my brother, and my parents all notice this.  I could not be happier.  I am 50, and my husband took a picture for me on 12/31/2011.  In the picture, I look younger than most of the 30 years old women.</li>
