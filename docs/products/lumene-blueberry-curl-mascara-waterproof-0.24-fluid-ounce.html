    <ol>
            <li>These mascaras are the BEST I have found for their price point and excel in packaging and amount.</li>
            <li>and I thought this was just perfect!</li>
            <li>Perfect until I just read the ingredients in it....</li>
            <li>This product holds excellent curl and has never smudged.</li>
            <li>and it lasted beautifully!</li>
            <li>This is the best one!</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara out there.</li>
            <li>The best mascara I have every purchased.</li>
            <li>I made the best of it for a week.</li>
            <li>Best mascara I&#x27;ve EVER had.</li>
            <li>Very happy with Lumene Blueberry Waterproof Mascara.  </li>
            <li>but they look beautiful!</li>
            <li>Loved this mascara!  </li>
            <li>But the mascara is great.</li>
            <li>They all work great, non-clumping,  no flaking, buildable length, great comb-y brushes.</li>
            <li>Great if you are going swimming or no need for a touch up during a wedding or anything.</li>
            <li>The tubes are HUGE and look GREAT!</li>
            <li>The tubes are HUGE and look GREAT!</li>
            <li>So it would be a good camping mascara, but I won&#x27;t look glamourous tomorrow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This might be good for others but not for me.</li>
            <li>Great mascara to help keep your lashes curled :)</li>
            <li>It is nice and fairly waterproof.</li>
            <li>(I hope you know how much I love you guys to include this goofy photos!! )</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>So glad I found this mascara!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s waterproof!</li>
            <li>have THRILLED me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really almost perfect compared to anything else in it&#x27;s pricepoint.</li>
            <li>Will keep my eye lashes nice and curled throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Never ever have I had that kind of experience with any mascara.</li>
            <li>Really nice mascara.</li>
            <li>But it separates my lashes, no clumping so far and looks great!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>These are both more natural, which I LOVE, and both of them do an excellent job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So consider having a clean applicator on hand that fits your lashes best for perfect results and go slow.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll look cute in the morning and will probably continue wearing it all day tomorrow.</li>
            <li>That should tell you why I love it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about this mascara despite all the good reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.</li>
            <li>A drugstore mascara like CoverGirl does a better job.</li>
            <li>I read a lot about the brand on their website and then did more digging.</li>
            <li>All my life, I have used mostly waterproof as I would always get some smearing and in effect get the raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>I believe on my 5th tube or more.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are actually more curled.</li>
            <li>Going to buy more.</li>
            <li>I love it because I can wear it</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. :)</li>
            <li>This is waterproof mascara and it certainly does a good job at that.</li>
            <li>and that is most important to me.</li>
            <li>They are easy to find in your makeup bag.</li>
            <li>They are easy to find in your makeup bag.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t run, smear, easily removed with Almay eye make up remover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not clumpy, doesn&#x27;t flake, but comes off easily with makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day without tarantula lashes and comes off easily with my Lumene waterproof eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Been searching for a cruelty free waterproof mascara that doesn&#x27;t make my lashes stiff or clumpy since I had to ditch my beloved Maybelline Great Lash.</li>
            <li>A fine, 5 star product!&lt;br /&gt;Auretha</li>
            <li>A fine, 5 star product!&lt;br /&gt;Auretha</li>
            <li>Most good mascaras now are running at $30, which is ridiculous, but we need great mascara, right Girls?</li>
            <li>Feel free to use a clean applicator rather that the one provided.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second buy and loving it!</li>
            <li>I have it for going to the beach or waterpark and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>If you do smudge, clean it up quickly with a Qtip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you do smudge, clean it up quickly with a Qtip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this would be a great mascara, based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li>This mascara seals quickly and does not layer.</li>
            <li>This mascara seals quickly and does not layer.</li>
            <li>I will be buying it again for sure and highly recommend it to others as well</li>
            <li>At first, I thought I really liked this mascara as I was switching all my makeup to natural cosmetics</li>
            <li>I think if that isn&#x27;t a true testiment of how great this product is than I am not sure what else could be.</li>
            <li>I rarely completely submerged myself under water, and was pleased with how this mascara stayed put all day through sweat, sunscreen, and some splashing in the ocean.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I wanted a healthy &amp; natural mascara that would still deliver and this one does.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin around my eyes, and most mascaras make me tear up, and/or make the area around my eyes swell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lengthen lashes as some other brands, though, but it does a good job in terms of adding color to lashes.</li>
            <li>I have had regular mascara smear on me and it wasn&#x27;t that easy to rub off without any makeup remover!</li>
            <li>I have very straight lashes</li>
            <li>Like the mascara very much.</li>
            <li>This one is ok for my sensitive skin, but it does clump pretty easily and I didn&#x27;t dare try a second coat.  </li>
            <li>Goes on great, long lasting, doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>I would really only use it for going swimming but even then, I think there might be better options out there.</li>
            <li>Clump-free, fluttery, and really holds a curl!</li>
            <li>I curl them first and then apply.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to use it in the first place since there was no seal on the tube to indicate it was fresh and new.</li>
            <li>, I have very high standards for wearing it.</li>
            <li>Really curls well and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>So much for this experiment.  </li>
            <li>Does really require a minute of scrubbing with eye make up remover when you want it off though.</li>
            <li>Lumene really nailed it.</li>
            <li>I have short fine lashes and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I had no problems getting it off with a decent face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It seems a bit hard and crunchy and it doesn&#x27;t do anything spectacular to my lashes.</li>
            <li>Also the effects on the Bobbi Brown mascara was that my lashes would keep falling out, the Lumene I guess because it&#x27;s mostly natural doesn&#x27;t really do that at all.</li>
            <li>I always like trying out new products but my eyes did not react well with this one.</li>
            <li>Another bonus is that there are no fumes to make my eyes water like most mascaras I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Awesome mascara, actually curls my lashes without me using a curler, love how you can use a little or later it on thick for more dramatic looks!</li>
            <li>THE PHOTOS ARE AFTER I TOOK ALL MY MAKEUP OFF, so only the mascara is left after a full day of wearing it.</li>
            <li>try to get people to try these mascaras because they are a super deal, large tubes, and the other one I&#x27;ve been using daily</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One unexpected bonus</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessary and it really just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessary and it really just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I like it because I know it is natural</li>
            <li>I wonder if I got an old batch?</li>
            <li>The brush is fine for most lashes but may be too hard for anyone with short or few lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you only want subtle definition and you care about whether or not the brand is ethical, then I suppose this one will suit you fine.</li>
            <li>It is definitely waterproof and is hard to get off even with makeup remover, however, I was hoping for more volume and length than this gave.</li>
            <li>I sold Lancome (top selling mascaras world wide) for over 4 years, and used Bobby Brown&#x27;s Extreme Party Mascara for the last 4 years, which I adore because it&#x27;s rewettable and layers and lasts beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have no naturally color on my lashes, especially underneath, and this hangs onto my lashes really well.</li>
            <li>I drive a semi and can apply this while getting ready for work, go work getting in and out in triple digit temps, and take a shower when I get home only to still have this mascara on with no runs down my face.</li>
            <li>The final straw was after a particularly long hot humid day, it flaked and left black gunk in my tear duct area.  </li>
            <li>Well, this still runs a little but not as much as non-waterproof mascaras.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I sold Lancome (top selling mascaras world wide) for over 4 years, and used Bobby Brown&#x27;s Extreme Party Mascara for the last 4 years, which I adore because it&#x27;s rewettable and layers and lasts beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta tell you, this mascara and it&#x27;s purple non-waterproof counterpart, have THRILLED me. Most good mascaras now are running at $30, which is ridiculous, but we need great mascara, right Girls? These mascaras are the BEST I have found for their price point and excel in packaging and amount. These are both more natural, which I LOVE, and both of them do an excellent job. The regular one can flake a little...but it&#x27;s really almost perfect compared to anything else in it&#x27;s pricepoint. Don&#x27;t even waste your time or money at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat with this one is in application. You may need to SLOW DOWN and apply it very slowly or it can flick or smear because it is very wet when applied. Feel free to use a clean applicator rather that the one provided. The brush is fine for most lashes but may be too hard for anyone with short or few lashes.&lt;br /&gt; It is difficult to remove but that is the point of waterproof mascara! I wore mine to the beach today and I&#x27;m not taking it off. I&#x27;m sleeping in it so I&#x27;ll look cute in the morning and will probably continue wearing it all day tomorrow. So it would be a good camping mascara, but I won&#x27;t look glamourous tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;* THE PHOTOS ARE AFTER I TOOK ALL MY MAKEUP OFF, so only the mascara is left after a full day of wearing it. That should tell you why I love it. I have no naturally color on my lashes, especially underneath, and this hangs onto my lashes really well. The last photo is what my makeup usually looks like at the beach with this mascara. (I hope you know how much I love you guys to include this goofy photos!! )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One unexpected bonus: It curls my lashes! They are so cute!!&lt;br /&gt;So consider having a clean applicator on hand that fits your lashes best for perfect results and go slow. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LET DRY &amp; LAYER like you do with some regular mascaras. It&#x27;s not necessary and it really just doesn&#x27;t work. This mascara seals quickly and does not layer. You will just make a mess under your eyes. If you do smudge, clean it up quickly with a Qtip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to get people to try these mascaras because they are a super deal, large tubes, and the other one I&#x27;ve been using daily and it is just now, months later, starting to dry up. The tubes are HUGE and look GREAT! They are easy to find in your makeup bag. A fine, 5 star product!&lt;br /&gt;Auretha Callison, Aurethadotcom, Soul Stylistgo slow.

            <li> Don&#x27;t want 2 b without this. Have re-ordered.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I really liked this mascara as I was switching all my makeup to natural cosmetics and I thought this was just perfect! Goes on great, long lasting, doesn&#x27;t smudge. Perfect until I just read the ingredients in it.... That I had looked for in the listing but couldn&#x27;t find but took my chances anyway. This mascara boasts about containing natural ingredients but it also contains lots of chemicals, some potentially dangerous. ie, methylparaben. I&#x27;m very disappointed in all of these companies that try to portray themselves as being natural and providing misleading information to their customers.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have a problem with is that it is hard to remove.  I have tried two different waterproof eye makeup removers.  I have maybeline and Neutrogena.  If anyone can give me some hints, I would appreciate it.  It takes some of it off but leaves some mascara left at the tips of the lashes.  Also, the reason I purchased waterproof is because after a day of work, I look like a raccoon.  Well, this still runs a little but not as much as non-waterproof mascaras.  I like it because I know it is natural and that is most important to me.</li>
            <li> I like it but it clumps my lashes together and it is REALLY hard to remove. Even with make up remover or oils it still feels like it&#x27;s on my eyelashes after 3 days so that causes some irritation. Otherwise it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I have very straight lashes so I like t o curl them. This product holds excellent curl and has never smudged. I can use this when I where fake lashes without worry of smudging or of my lashes losing curl under them. I just did a 12 mile mud run with this mascara and it lasted beautifully! I think if that isn&#x27;t a true testiment of how great this product is than I am not sure what else could be. Removal takes patience but any oil based makeup remover works well!</li>
            <li> Will keep my eye lashes nice and curled throughout the day. Wont bleed. I&#x27;m on my second buy and loving it!</li>
            <li> Clumps.  I was hoping that this would be a great mascara, based on other reviews.  I wonder if I got an old batch?</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It goes on well with no clumps. I can do both eyes without having to recoat the brush. I drive a semi and can apply this while getting ready for work, go work getting in and out in triple digit temps, and take a shower when I get home only to still have this mascara on with no runs down my face. Waterproof it is! Another bonus is that there are no fumes to make my eyes water like most mascaras I&#x27;ve tried in the past. This may be made from blueberries but it is black so have no worries.</li>
            <li> It is definitely waterproof and is hard to get off even with makeup remover, however, I was hoping for more volume and length than this gave. It was also very thin in consistency which was odd. I would really only use it for going swimming but even then, I think there might be better options out there. If you only want subtle definition and you care about whether or not the brand is ethical, then I suppose this one will suit you fine.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this mascara despite all the good reviews on Amazon and elsewhere. It seems a bit hard and crunchy and it doesn&#x27;t do anything spectacular to my lashes. A drugstore mascara like CoverGirl does a better job. Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely insane. If you are looking for a waterproof mascara that really, I mean REALLY will not go anywhere - this is it! In fact, I can&#x27;t wear it because it is extremely difficult to remove with soap or oil. I have it for going to the beach or waterpark and am not disappointed. For every day use, however, I use the non-waterproof by Lumene.</li>
            <li> Like the mascara very much. Not so crazy about the brush. Prefer a fully brush, this is long and thin. But the mascara is great. Doesn&#x27;t run, smear, easily removed with Almay eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> I would call it water resistant. My daughter and I both used this on our recent beach vacation. I rarely completely submerged myself under water, and was pleased with how this mascara stayed put all day through sweat, sunscreen, and some splashing in the ocean. She, however, swims like a fish and did have mascara smudges under her eyes. If not for that, I&#x27;d have given 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I do like this product a lot. I have all three versions; this one, curling, and volumizing. They all work great, non-clumping,  no flaking, buildable length, great comb-y brushes. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Really curls well and doesn&#x27;t clump.I will definitely buy this again. It is waterproof - requires remover to get off.</li>
            <li> I accidentally stumbled on the Lumene brand for research at work. I read a lot about the brand on their website and then did more digging. I then thought to try several items from the brand which included this mascara. All my life, I have used mostly waterproof as I would always get some smearing and in effect get the raccoon eyes. I hate that! I have used regular as well as waterproof. I would say 95 out of a 100 mascara purchases were waterproof. I have used different brands as well, drugstore and department store brands. This is the best one! This has smeared on me a few times, I would say probably less than 5 times and I am I believe on my 5th tube or more. I don&#x27;t know why it smeared those times, but it hasn&#x27;t ever since. When it did, I just used my finger tip to rub it off and guess what? I got it off! Never ever have I had that kind of experience with any mascara. I have had regular mascara smear on me and it wasn&#x27;t that easy to rub off without any makeup remover! I haven&#x27;t tried any other mascara that Lumene carries as this is the only waterproof that I found that I can buy in the USA. Every other mascara that&#x27;s being sold here are regular. This is the best mascara out there. The one after this would probably be the long wear from Bobbi Brown. That&#x27;s over $20 and the effects are blah. It didn&#x27;t smear, but never kept a curl like this mascara does. Also the effects on the Bobbi Brown mascara was that my lashes would keep falling out, the Lumene I guess because it&#x27;s mostly natural doesn&#x27;t really do that at all. After using this mascara for several months, my lashes always look longer and fuller. WOW!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! The best mascara I have every purchased. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have short fine lashes and sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t tolerate a lot of mascaras, which also means, I have very high standards for wearing it. This one is ok for my sensitive skin, but it does clump pretty easily and I didn&#x27;t dare try a second coat.  It also seems to dry faster on  your skin than on your lashes, meaning if you blink while it is still wet and it gets on your skin, it can be hard to get off if you don&#x27;t move fast.  I made the best of it for a week. I had no problems getting it off with a decent face cleanser.  The final straw was after a particularly long hot humid day, it flaked and left black gunk in my tear duct area.  Blech. So much for this experiment.  Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve EVER had. I will be buying it again for sure and highly recommend it to others as well</li>
            <li> Very happy with Lumene Blueberry Waterproof Mascara.  I wanted a healthy &amp; natural mascara that would still deliver and this one does.  It&#x27;s not clumpy, doesn&#x27;t flake, but comes off easily with makeup remover.  So glad I found this mascara!</li>
            <li> Really nice mascara. This stuff is heavy duty waterproof. I mean my eyelashes are like cement but they look beautiful! Great if you are going swimming or no need for a touch up during a wedding or anything. Does really require a minute of scrubbing with eye make up remover when you want it off though. But it separates my lashes, no clumping so far and looks great!</li>
            <li> Great mascara to help keep your lashes curled :)</li>
            <li> YIKES! This might be good for others but not for me. I was hesitant to use it in the first place since there was no seal on the tube to indicate it was fresh and new. That always makes me nervous since I have no way of knowing if someone else used the product or if it got contaminated. I went ahead and used it and after a couple hours my eyes became red and irritated. This is waterproof mascara and it certainly does a good job at that. I could not wash this off! I typically use an organic eye make-up remover wipe and it was doing nothing but clumping my lashes. I had to use coconut oil to remove this. I always like trying out new products but my eyes did not react well with this one. I would suggest that a seal be placed around the tube and cap so that customers can feel confidant that the product was not tampered with.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara, actually curls my lashes without me using a curler, love how you can use a little or later it on thick for more dramatic looks!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are actually more curled. It is difficult to remove without makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Clump-free, fluttery, and really holds a curl!</li>
            <li> Been searching for a cruelty free waterproof mascara that doesn&#x27;t make my lashes stiff or clumpy since I had to ditch my beloved Maybelline Great Lash. After spending $$$$ on brands such as Tarte and having clumpy lashes and a nightmare removing the mascara at the end of the day, THIS IS IT! This product is a WINNER in every sense of the word. It goes on smoothly, dark, and fans out my lashes while keeping the curl. I curl them first and then apply. It lasts all day without tarantula lashes and comes off easily with my Lumene waterproof eye makeup remover. I have not had a SINGLE lash fall out from this. Lumene really nailed it.</li>
            <li> It is nice and fairly waterproof.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever used. My eyelashes have never looked so long and it held the curl all evening and through dancing. No clumps either like other products. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Loved this mascara!  Going to buy more.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have extremely sensitive skin around my eyes, and most mascaras make me tear up, and/or make the area around my eyes swell. This one? Doesn&#x27;t bother me at all! And I love that it&#x27;s waterproof! It doesn&#x27;t lengthen lashes as some other brands, though, but it does a good job in terms of adding color to lashes. I love it because I can wear it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. :)</li>
