    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until then that I read the ingredients list and saw wheat germ oil listed, an excellent emollient, but a no-no for me.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t rate it as the best zinc bar that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This soap works great!</li>
            <li>In fact, I think it would be a great, all-in-one soap to use for travel!</li>
            <li>If the price can be cheaper it will be perfect.</li>
            <li>and I can see that this  product worked very good.</li>
            <li>Soap feels great on skin.</li>
            <li>This product works great on his rashes.  </li>
            <li>Hi, your product is great.</li>
            <li>The H&amp;S works really great at controlling the condition.</li>
            <li>I could cry with how happy this soap makes me.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>happy with this soap, will repurchase.</li>
            <li>I have discovered \\&quot;Defense\\&quot; line of soaps and they are very effective.  </li>
            <li>Good service, good product.</li>
            <li>Since ZNP bar disappeared I have tried a number of substitutes, without good results.</li>
            <li>But it was good to use for washing your face, as it cleared up some pimples.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin is not drying out and looks and feels good.</li>
            <li>Best of all, no bad, medicine or tar  smell.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soup in the world!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if its competitor, Noble Formula, at 3.2oz is even smaller???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a couple of months or so ago and have been using it, and it is as good or better than ZNP.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good to be able to purchase it here.</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure you rinse it off good after lathering up.</li>
            <li>1/3 the price of Noble Zinc formula and worked just as well.</li>
            <li>but luckily my husband likes the silky lather, so he&#x27;s happy to take it off my hands.</li>
            <li>This product is effective for controlling severe dandruff,and inflammation with regular use,alternate with Tea tree oil shampoo for best results.</li>
            <li>This is the best soap that is effective - until ZNP comes back.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my oily but extremely red, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with skin issues for years, and after many trips to the doctor and dermatologist who couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was, I researched myself and found my symptoms all line up with Seborrheic Dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Just bought more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The soap&#x27;s drying effect on the hair is more pronounced than I remember from ZNP; use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Will definately be buying more.</li>
            <li>Will order more again if I have too.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s getting much better, reduction of flakes and irratation.</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Woods Tea Tree liquid castile soap for everything *except* my scalp.</li>
            <li>My skin actually looks the best that it has in ages.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first good substitute for ZNP I have found.</li>
            <li>Also shipping was nice and quick.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>and it works fine for that.</li>
            <li>The soap is scent free, cleanses and exfoliates and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li>and I showed him this bar, he said he would reccomend it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I did receive free shipping (thank you)</li>
            <li>Great for controlling my persistent facial allergic dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>I understand ZNP is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>So far after using DermaZinc for these couple of days I feel good that this product will work for me.</li>
            <li>I originally got this soap because I have perioral dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>But neither of those are deal breakers, so I shall continue to happily use this until I stumble upon that anti-dandruff/itching holy grail.</li>
            <li>It does clean the skin well.</li>
            <li>I was very depressed because my psoriasis attacked 90% of my body, I wasn&#x27;t able to walk or sleep without pain, I don&#x27;t have a health insurance and paying for the shots was not a possibility.</li>
            <li>It works okay for a couple days, but then my scalp just gets really flaky and itchy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do wash the top of my forehead with it, along the hairline, which really helps with the itching in spots I can&#x27;t reach with moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This soap is not bad.</li>
            <li>lol Neutrogena T-Gel was pretty good and my scalp was less itchy, but still not enough.</li>
            <li>NIce solid bar and isn&#x27;t going to quickly.</li>
            <li>In short, this product is not as effective as ZNP.</li>
            <li>Less than a week of usage, and skin shows remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to be more economical with my usage of it, I guess, and alternate with something else.</li>
            <li>So overall its okay, just not what I wanted...</li>
            <li>I use it consistently twice per day.</li>
            <li>Even Head &amp; Shoulders for Itchy Scalp actually made my scalp MORE irritated and itchy.</li>
            <li>My face is super sensitive to just about everything and this soap works wonders in keeping redness at bay.</li>
            <li>But zinc pyrithione is colorless, meaning that the color of the end product is purely a marketing decision.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have some hair conditioner on hand to, makes your hair really really dry!</li>
            <li>I assume it&#x27;s because there isn&#x27;t really 2% zinc in the bar.</li>
            <li>This soap burns my eyes and doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li>and I really needed it too...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really grateful</li>
            <li>At least....not for a whole day.</li>
            <li>Itch-free for a whole day.</li>
            <li>What IS working is a liquid soap that I bought at Whole Body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try Noble Formula next time - maybe Emu oil is the key (joking).</li>
            <li>The fastest way to get results is to take off all your patches while taking a shower and then use the soap, This is going to hurt a lot, I cried when i did it, but in less than 4 days i was able to sleep and walk without any pain.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product line.</li>
            <li>It is not easy any more to find this type of Zinc Therapy soap anymore.</li>
            <li>( He has very sensitive skin, and problems with skin cancer popping up now and then.)  </li>
            <li>This soap relieved the itch of the seborrheic dermatitis in my eyebrows from the first use, and reduced flaking in a very short time, after cortisone, tea tree oil, and salicylic acid did not.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than the super expensive prescription creams.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve developed a bit of eczema and other rashes which seem to be quickly soothed by anything I apply with oatmeal in it.</li>
            <li>Someone recommended this and so far it is helping.</li>
            <li>If you want one that has no scent and is rather soft then this one works.</li>
            <li>personal feeling is that $9+ for a bar of soap is too much.</li>
            <li>i have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It could just be that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My flaking has been considerably reduced AND my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch.</li>
            <li>For some reason this bar is clear, which makes me think it&#x27;s less concentrated and thus less effective.  </li>
            <li>I hope it works for others, but my skin is extremely sensitive and dermatitis is winning with everything I try it gets worse.</li>
            <li>I hope it works for every single person because psoriasis is really debilitating.</li>
            <li>No other bar soap, liquid soap, face wash, or cream has EVER helped.</li>
            <li>previous reviewer noted that DermaZinc isn&#x27;t blue like ZNP and Head &amp; Shoulders, and wondered if it was full strength.  </li>
            <li>have not tried Noble Formula zinc soap, but it&#x27;s considerably more expensive and some of its negative reviews on Amazon were enough to keep me from ordering it.</li>
            <li>me, the negatives so far are, again, the fact that being itch-free only lasts for a little more than a day AND that, for the price, the bar doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>so far this is the only soap I’ve found that won’t make my redder than i already am</li>
            <li>yes it has an oatmeal texture, BUT wet it first - let it soften before use OR simply rub the soap on a bath puff or loofa.  </li>
            <li>So much more worse that it looked &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>using it about 3 times a week along with a large natural sea sponge, which is slightly exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps flares down consistently.  </li>
            <li>It irritated and stung my skin a little the first three or four times I used it, but it has been helping a lot with inflammation and acne.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about a bar of soap other than this is one of only a handful of places that handle DemraZinc soap.  </li>
            <li>DermaZinc recommended by my skin doctor to clear up some rough red patches on my face.  </li>

            <li> DermaZinc recommended by my skin doctor to clear up some rough red patches on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble finding this soap where I live</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s all there -- there are no gouged-out areas that make the wrapped bar seem larger than it really is.  </li>
            <li> A single bar lasted me months because I only used it on my face every two days or so.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how &#x27;small&#x27; this bar is, it&#x27;s about 3/4 the size of a regular bar of say Dove.</li>
            <li> I tried the DermaZinc on a whim, but hadn&#x27;t expected any different results.</li>
            <li> A typical bottle of liquid shampoo for the same price would last me a lot longer.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I tried this product is due to the backorder on the ZNP bar.</li>
            <li> except it made my skin really dry.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>

            <li> It can also  dry your skin too.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and felt this burned my face a bit.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo has the same active ingredient, but at 1% strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry the face and keeps the red down.</li>
            <li> bar may be a bit smaller than ZNP, but it seems to be about the same size as an ordinary bar of soap.  </li>

            <li> The product works as expected...</li>

            <li> I found this on Amazon by just putting in the active ingredents, (Zinc).  </li>
            <li> but without the skin-clearing effects I was hoping for, it&#x27;s not worth purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t overly drying, but in my opinion, not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It starts itching again a little bit on the second day, but that could be because I have a very oily scalp that&#x27;s feeding the dandruff causing bacteria. :(</li>

            <li> Made my red, irritated skin even worse.</li>
            <li> That just means I have to wash my hair everyday,</li>

            <li> My skin has become increasingly sensitive over the last two years, and my scalp has been driving me crazy with dandruff and incessant itching!</li>
            <li> The worst part was, it made my skin redder and more irritated.</li>
            <li> and it does the job of a soap - not much more.</li>
            <li> Some were like course sandpaper, some seem to have no medication, others were tiny and expensive, still others did not lather at all.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered</li>
            <li> Not sure it helps with that,</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a few negative reviews on this product out there, but I don&#x27;t understand them.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy soap and take a long shower and take off all the patches with a small towel (very painful) and use this soap and leave it for a few minutes (even more painful)</li>
            <li> so I gave this soap a shot, believing it&#x27;s got less irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li> It has worked well and hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive ears nor caused any painful nodules to form.</li>
            <li> but I can see the difference slowly day by day, I have flakes and redness around my nose</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to be drying and slightly irritating to acne/bumps on my arms, but it&#x27;s not drying or irritating to the rest of my body</li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> Boy, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I washed the rash twice a day and shockingly, it was already 90% gone on the second day.  </li>
            <li> This product works where every store bought product fails.</li>
            <li> The moment I used this, my eyes stung really bad which never happened with H&amp;S though I was always putting them on my eye area, unintentionally of course.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a bad soap, but it didn&#x27;t help my hormonal breakouts any.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried everything to deal with psoriasis. Someone recommended this and so far it is helping. Soap feels great on skin.</li>
            <li> The soap is scent free, cleanses and exfoliates and doesn&#x27;t leave residue. Perfect for my oily but extremely red, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> There is another product that my Dad has used for years, but are having trouble keeping up with demand.  I found this on Amazon by just putting in the active ingredents, (Zinc).  Bars are a little smaller then the previous soap he was using, but otherwise he cannot tell a difference.  This product works great on his rashes.  ( He has very sensitive skin, and problems with skin cancer popping up now and then.)  The Dematolgist recommenened soap with Zinc, and I showed him this bar, he said he would reccomend it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. My condition has been held in check since I started using it well over two years ago.</li>
            <li> Hi, your product is great. thank you i dont know what else to say. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I tried this product is due to the backorder on the ZNP bar. This product works and does what it needs to but I still prefer the ZNP bar due to the size, shape, and packaging.</li>
            <li> DermaZinc recommended by my skin doctor to clear up some rough red patches on my face.  Less than a week of usage, and skin shows remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t replace the ZNP soap bar.  Sorry.  but it doesn&#x27;t.  My face did react at all to this soap - except it made my skin really dry.</li>
            <li> Works just like the ZNP Bar, just try to keep it out of your eyes. Make sure you have some hair conditioner on hand to, makes your hair really really dry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ZNP bar for a couple of years, and I got two of these bars just because ZNP was backordered.  In short, this product is not as effective as ZNP. I assume it&#x27;s because there isn&#x27;t really 2% zinc in the bar. ZNP and another zinc shampoo I&#x27;ve used both have a blue color to them. For some reason this bar is clear, which makes me think it&#x27;s less concentrated and thus less effective.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Feels silky with a bit of abrasion material (oatmeal?). But haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my tinea versicolor.</li>
            <li> I was a looking for an alternative to the plain Head n&#x27; Shoulders as my maintenance for this horrible horrible skin condition. The H&amp;S works really great at controlling the condition. It&#x27;s just too drying at times so I gave this soap a shot, believing it&#x27;s got less irritating ingredients. Boy, I was wrong. The moment I used this, my eyes stung really bad which never happened with H&amp;S though I was always putting them on my eye area, unintentionally of course. It was also too drying, proven by how tight my face was a few minutes after I used this. The worst part was, it made my skin redder and more irritated. I&#x27;m thinking, the olive oil/coconut oils might be the culprits. These oils contain Oleic Acid which the sebderm-causing fungus (Malassezia) thrives on. Not gonna purchase this ever again.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li> It is not easy any more to find this type of Zinc Therapy soap anymore. I can say from personal experience that it does help with seborrheic dermatitis. Hope this help you too!</li>
            <li> I like it and I think its working. will let you know in another  3 months and do a updated comment</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on a skin rash that didn&#x27;t respond to lotion or shea butter.  I washed the rash twice a day and shockingly, it was already 90% gone on the second day.  It wasn&#x27;t until then that I read the ingredients list and saw wheat germ oil listed, an excellent emollient, but a no-no for me.  Don&#x27;t know how I missed seeing that, but luckily my husband likes the silky lather, so he&#x27;s happy to take it off my hands.</li>
            <li> I originally got this soap because I have perioral dermatitis.  This soap burns my eyes and doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> Clumpy texture as if the zinc (or something) isn&#x27;t mixed well.  I will not be buying another bar from this same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me and I really needed it too...sad and was hoping for more. Made my red, irritated skin even worse. So much more worse that it looked &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34;. I hope it works for others, but my skin is extremely sensitive and dermatitis is winning with everything I try it gets worse.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rate it as the best zinc bar that I&#x27;ve used. If you want one that has no scent and is rather soft then this one works.</li>
            <li> We got the soap in a timely fashion and the soap was just what we expected. Good service, good product.</li>
            <li> This is the second brand of zinc soap that I&#x27;ve tried. It irritated and stung my skin a little the first three or four times I used it, but it has been helping a lot with inflammation and acne. I will probably be repurchasing this brand.</li>
            <li> my doctor recommended this for roscea.  I like it.  it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I bought it along with the DermaZinc Cream.  It has definetly helped.</li>
            <li> I could cry with how happy this soap makes me. I&#x27;ve struggled with skin issues for years, and after many trips to the doctor and dermatologist who couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was, I researched myself and found my symptoms all line up with Seborrheic Dermatitis. No other bar soap, liquid soap, face wash, or cream has EVER helped. I tried the DermaZinc on a whim, but hadn&#x27;t expected any different results. There is nothing about it I don&#x27;t like. It was a miracle. A single bar lasted me months because I only used it on my face every two days or so. Just bought more. My next purchase will be to try their shampoo and skin cream.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item on recommendation of a lot of comments I read - stating Zinc Pyrithione 2% will get the job done. I&#x27;ve had it a week and it does the job of a soap - not much more. I was surprised at how &#x27;small&#x27; this bar is, it&#x27;s about 3/4 the size of a regular bar of say Dove. This bar is listed as 3.75 oz (oz does NOT relay size all) I&#x27;m wondering if its competitor, Noble Formula, at 3.2oz is even smaller???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal feeling is that $9+ for a bar of soap is too much. I did receive free shipping (thank you) but without the skin-clearing effects I was hoping for, it&#x27;s not worth purchasing again. I&#x27;ll try Noble Formula next time - maybe Emu oil is the key (joking).</li>
            <li> This product seems to work as well as the now discontinued ZNP Bar.  Both are (or were, in ZNP&#x27;s case) 2% zinc pyrithione.  Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo has the same active ingredient, but at 1% strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A previous reviewer noted that DermaZinc isn&#x27;t blue like ZNP and Head &amp; Shoulders, and wondered if it was full strength.  But zinc pyrithione is colorless, meaning that the color of the end product is purely a marketing decision.  I suspect that it&#x27;s not accidental that ZNP&#x27;s color matched that of Head &amp; Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar may be a bit smaller than ZNP, but it seems to be about the same size as an ordinary bar of soap.  At least it&#x27;s all there -- there are no gouged-out areas that make the wrapped bar seem larger than it really is.  Look at a recent bar of Dial soap to see what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap&#x27;s drying effect on the hair is more pronounced than I remember from ZNP; use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried Noble Formula zinc soap, but it&#x27;s considerably more expensive and some of its negative reviews on Amazon were enough to keep me from ordering it.</li>
            <li> Great for controlling my persistent facial allergic dermatitis.  Keeps flares down consistently.  Best of all, no bad, medicine or tar  smell.</li>
            <li> Works great. NIce solid bar and isn&#x27;t going to quickly. Will definately be buying more. Doesn&#x27;t over dry the face and keeps the red down.</li>
            <li> Since ZNP bar disappeared I have tried a number of substitutes, without good results. Some were like course sandpaper, some seem to have no medication, others were tiny and expensive, still others did not lather at all.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered DermaZinc a couple of months or so ago and have been using it, and it is as good or better than ZNP. It is not abrasive, lathers well, and definitely has 2% zinc pyrithione in it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first good substitute for ZNP I have found.</li>
            <li> With dry, irritated skin.  I bought it for myself and my daughter.  The soap seems to have helped her a lot as Doctor Oz suggested .</li>
            <li> This soap is not bad. It does clean the skin well. The problem is that the soap didn&#x27;t solve the issue I hoped it would (Tinea Versicolor). It can also  dry your skin too. But it was good to use for washing your face, as it cleared up some pimples. So overall its okay, just not what I wanted...</li>
            <li> This product works where every store bought product fails. My face is super sensitive to just about everything and this soap works wonders in keeping redness at bay.</li>
            <li> This soap works great! It is for my sons tena versi color. I have trouble finding this soap where I live so it&#x27;s good to be able to purchase it here. Will continue to buy this in the future. Also shipping was nice and quick.</li>
            <li> This product is effective for controlling severe dandruff,and inflammation with regular use,alternate with Tea tree oil shampoo for best results.</li>
            <li> i have really sensitive skin so far this is the only soap I’ve found that won’t make my redder than i already am</li>
            <li> Lot of suds, but is totally in-effective.  I have discovered \\&quot;Defense\\&quot; line of soaps and they are very effective.  Defense Soap - check it out.  This is the best soap that is effective - until ZNP comes back.</li>
            <li> So far after using DermaZinc for these couple of days I feel good that this product will work for me. Everytime I have quit using the steroid that was controlling my dermatitis it has broke out again. Not one time since I have quit using the steroid and been using the soap have I had any problems. Also, my skin is not drying out and looks and feels good. You just have to make sure you rinse it off good after lathering up. Will order more again if I have too.</li>
            <li> My husband has seborrhea dermatitis and rosacea.  This stuff works better than the super expensive prescription creams.  I bought the spray drops, soap, shampoo and cream.  Highly recommend this product line.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and felt this burned my face a bit. It could just be that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still watching the progress but I can see the difference slowly day by day, I have flakes and redness around my nose and it&#x27;s getting much better, reduction of flakes and irratation. I use it consistently twice per day.</li>
            <li> I had problem with acne at my back and my chest. I used this product for almost three weeks and I can see that this  product worked very good.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soup in the world! I was very depressed because my psoriasis attacked 90% of my body, I wasn&#x27;t able to walk or sleep without pain, I don&#x27;t have a health insurance and paying for the shots was not a possibility. I decided to buy soap and take a long shower and take off all the patches with a small towel (very painful) and use this soap and leave it for a few minutes (even more painful) I don&#x27;t work for these guys, I actually tried all the dermazinc soaps and they all work so you don&#x27;t have to buy this specific brand.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the last year and I&#x27;m really grateful, I&#x27;m not cured and this is not a cure but since i&#x27;ve been using it I only get 2 or 3 small patches.  The fastest way to get results is to take off all your patches while taking a shower and then use the soap, This is going to hurt a lot, I cried when i did it, but in less than 4 days i was able to sleep and walk without any pain. I hope it works for every single person because psoriasis is really debilitating.</li>
            <li> 1/3 the price of Noble Zinc formula and worked just as well.</li>
            <li> My skin has become increasingly sensitive over the last two years, and my scalp has been driving me crazy with dandruff and incessant itching! My scalp must be lacerated with all the scratching. I&#x27;ve tried a number of dandruff shampoos, both drug store and \\&quot;natural\\&quot;. Yet, while they all helped with the dandruff in varying degrees, NONE stopped the itching. Even Head &amp; Shoulders for Itchy Scalp actually made my scalp MORE irritated and itchy. lol Neutrogena T-Gel was pretty good and my scalp was less itchy, but still not enough. I love Dr. Woods Tea Tree liquid castile soap for everything *except* my scalp. It works okay for a couple days, but then my scalp just gets really flaky and itchy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the increased sensitivity of my skin, I&#x27;ve developed a bit of eczema and other rashes which seem to be quickly soothed by anything I apply with oatmeal in it. So I started looking for oatmeal based shampoos only to find that they&#x27;re all for dogs. Oops! Then I saw this soap on amazon while again looking for dandruff shampoos that also address itching. Although oatmeal is lower on the ingredients list, the list is short and simple, with fewer things to irritate me. My flaking has been considerably reduced AND my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch. At least....not for a whole day. It starts itching again a little bit on the second day, but that could be because I have a very oily scalp that&#x27;s feeding the dandruff causing bacteria. :( That just means I have to wash my hair everyday, which I do anyway because of the oiliness. Itch-free for a whole day. I&#x27;LL TAKE THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried washing my face and body with it as well and it works fine for that. In fact, I think it would be a great, all-in-one soap to use for travel! And it won&#x27;t leak like liquid shampoo. I did find it a bit drying for my face, but it could just be it&#x27;s \\&quot;newness\\&quot; that my face hasn&#x27;t gotten used to and the fact that it&#x27;s the middle of winter. I do wash the top of my forehead with it, along the hairline, which really helps with the itching in spots I can&#x27;t reach with moisturizer. Occasionally I&#x27;ll use it on my eyebrows as well, just in case. I&#x27;ve also been washing my earlobes with it since I get a bit of flaking there as well. (Eew!) It has worked well and hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive ears nor caused any painful nodules to form. I&#x27;ve also been rubbing it on spots where I&#x27;ve been getting eczema. Not sure it helps with that, but it didn&#x27;t bother it either. I might just try an Aveeno body wash or something and continue with my buckets of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the negatives so far are, again, the fact that being itch-free only lasts for a little more than a day AND that, for the price, the bar doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long. A typical bottle of liquid shampoo for the same price would last me a lot longer. I wish the bar were bigger or the price were lower. I&#x27;ll have to be more economical with my usage of it, I guess, and alternate with something else. But neither of those are deal breakers, so I shall continue to happily use this until I stumble upon that anti-dandruff/itching holy grail.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a bad soap, but it didn&#x27;t help my hormonal breakouts any.  It wasn&#x27;t overly drying, but in my opinion, not worth the money.  What IS working is a liquid soap that I bought at Whole Body.  It&#x27;s called Everyday Shea Body Wash.  My sister uses it on her body and face, so I tried it too.  It cleared my skin right up (after years of pricy face products), isn&#x27;t drying at all, and isn&#x27;t expensive.  My skin actually looks the best that it has in ages.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a few negative reviews on this product out there, but I don&#x27;t understand them.  The product works as expected... yes it has an oatmeal texture, BUT wet it first - let it soften before use OR simply rub the soap on a bath puff or loofa.  Problem solved.</li>
            <li> The product is working well as described. If the price can be cheaper it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> Not the same results as ZNP soap I used for years.  I understand ZNP is no longer available.  I am curious as to whether there are any other soaps closer to formulation of ZNP.</li>
            <li> This soap relieved the itch of the seborrheic dermatitis in my eyebrows from the first use, and reduced flaking in a very short time, after cortisone, tea tree oil, and salicylic acid did not.</li>
            <li> This is working wonders on my back/chest acne in just a few weeks. It makes my face super-smooth, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be drying and slightly irritating to acne/bumps on my arms, but it&#x27;s not drying or irritating to the rest of my body so I&#x27;ll just skip my arms when washing with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it about 3 times a week along with a large natural sea sponge, which is slightly exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this soap, will repurchase.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about a bar of soap other than this is one of only a handful of places that handle DemraZinc soap.  It is somewhat pricy but was recommended by the dermatologist.</li>
