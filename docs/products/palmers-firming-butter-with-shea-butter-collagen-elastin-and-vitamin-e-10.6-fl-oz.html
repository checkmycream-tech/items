            <li>~ * ~ Thank you Palmer&#x27;s and please make this more available!</li>
            <li>maybe if I stop with the wine, then I will get better results :).</li>
            <li>So when I put this on I made sure to rub in between my fingers as well.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Whether or not you&#x27;re a huge cocoa butter fan or not the smell is very light.  </li>
            <li>It is easy for my skin to absorb.</li>
            <li>it smells like cocoa, its not too strong.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and noticebly firmer.  </li>
            <li>and I am still bump free.</li>
            <li>Yet, i love this product most because it make my skin really soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>well i am happy with the results though i never expected much.</li>
            <li>I have been using it once a day for 1 full week and can already tell a difference.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, the bumps on the back of my arms have gone away, my stretch marks are looking better, and the skin on my thighs and &amp;#34;bat wings&amp;#34; look tighter and more smooth.</li>
            <li>I do prefer it to have NO fragrance in comparison to the mild chocolate one it does have.  </li>
            <li>It smells good though, and has a nice thick consistency.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough to buy it again, but I see no signs of it &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; anything.</li>
            <li>great for a moisterizer smells a little funny.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like to smell like a chocolate bar!  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>This is my first time to use the firming</li>
            <li>This seems to be working pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, we will see the final results in a couple more weeks… I also purchased some body wraps to help with the cellulite before I hit the pool</li>
            <li>Have never had anything but positive results with the palmers products.</li>
            <li>The only cons is the smell, recommend you to use it at night, and the smell will not be strong after the night.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work....</li>
            <li>, my skin really feels softer and a  bit firmer</li>
            <li>Too early to tell really.  </li>
            <li>But to let you know I will be buying it again as long as the price is right.</li>
            <li>It definitely firms your skin just that much.</li>
            <li>but so far it seems to be working</li>
            <li>Smells better a few hours later.</li>
            <li>I asked for this for holidays, since I cannot find this particular type of Palmer&#x27;s locally.  </li>
            <li>It really helps to smooth and firm!!!</li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft but could have bought locally in drug store and saved shippping costs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells a little wonky and strong when first applied.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say i noticed it do much, but i did not use it as often as directed due to the smell.</li>
            <li>I try many body lotion/butter products, such as body shop, Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, victory secret and so on.</li>

            <li> The reason I only gave three stars is because I haven&#x27;t used the Palmers Firming Butter long enough to have any firming results.</li>
            <li> My skin type is dry.</li>
            <li> My least favorite is the straight up Palmer&#x27;s Shea Butter version which smells bad, and isn&#x27;t as creamy or helpful, which this one is not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this everyday I work outside on the field and this palmers cocoa butter keep my skin away from dry and no ashy</li>
            <li> Some lotions helps a little and some of it actually irritates it.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve started to get really dry cracked sometimes painful skin in between my fingers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the odor/scent is so unpleasant to me</li>
            <li> I use to use a glycolic base lotion that didn&#x27;t always work and was expensive.  </li>
            <li> It did nothing for firming and has a bad smell to it.</li>

            <li> while the cream itself is pleasant&lt;br /&gt;the odor/scent is so unpleasant to me&lt;br /&gt;that I cannot bear to use it&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy it again&lt;br /&gt;and if I can&#x27;t foist it off on a family member&lt;br /&gt;will have to pitch it&lt;br /&gt;and yes, I did try it a number of times</li>
            <li> I have been using Palmers Cocoa Butter Firming Butter for about six months now.  I absolutely love it.  It smells great.  Whether or not you&#x27;re a huge cocoa butter fan or not the smell is very light.  My skin feels smooth and noticebly firmer.  I have Keratosis Pilaris which is a skin condition that causes bumps in the back of the arms and legs. I use to use a glycolic base lotion that didn&#x27;t always work and was expensive.  I found as a bonus that Palmers Firming Butter actually takes away the bumps!  I can go two or three days without using this butter and I am still bump free.</li>
            <li> Good but not too pleased with the chocolate scent.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work....</li>
            <li> With continous use, it works. Use as directred, Two times a day, along with an exercise regimen. You&#x27;e in there. I see a difference.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product along with the one for stretch marks. it has helped with the appearance of stretch marks too. as for the firming, i work out when i use to product to see progress. it smells like cocoa, its not too strong.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  Tightens up the skin where ever skin need to be tichtened!</li>
            <li> It seems to do what it says after using this product I was asked am I loosing weight although I&#x27;m not a big girl. But to let you know I will be buying it again as long as the price is right.</li>
            <li> It smells a little wonky and strong when first applied. Smells better a few hours later. Can&#x27;t say i noticed it do much, but i did not use it as often as directed due to the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and didn&#x27;t notice it worked until I ran out. It definitely firms your skin just that much. I like to use it on my thighs and what&#x27;s left on my hands for my face. And I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells really great.  Makes skin very soft but could have bought locally in drug store and saved shippping costs.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a week and about it because the coco butter is great for your skin and I  have slight drooping around the jowel area and I haven&#x27;t noticed any firming yet but I love the lotion!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time, well packaged.</li>
            <li> She reports that it did all it claimed it would do with the moisturizing but not sure about the firming part. She reports that running and lifting weights is much more effective in that area.</li>
            <li> My skin type is dry. I try many body lotion/butter products, such as body shop, Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, victory secret and so on. Yet, i love this product most because it make my skin really soft and moisturized. I use this body oil with Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter formula moisturizing body oil. It is easy for my skin to absorb. The only cons is the smell, recommend you to use it at night, and the smell will not be strong after the night.</li>
            <li> The reason I only gave three stars is because I haven&#x27;t used the Palmers Firming Butter long enough to have any firming results. I do prefer it to have NO fragrance in comparison to the mild chocolate one it does have.  I really don&#x27;t like to smell like a chocolate bar!  It does seem to absorb well and not leave a greasy residue. It&lt;br /&gt;has a creamy texture and feels good to the skin.</li>
            <li> great for a moisterizer smells a little funny.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell really.  It needs several weeks to show results, so it&#x27;s pretty stupid to review it now</li>
            <li> Loved the smell but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in skin firmness.</li>
            <li> I was not very happy with this product.  I use 3 bottles and can&#x27;t tell that it did anymore for me than the walmart brand of cocoa butter.  It did nothing for firming and has a bad smell to it.</li>
            <li> Palmers is excellent lotion &amp; w the firming added is even better</li>
            <li> well i am happy with the results though i never expected much. once u get used to the odor which i got used to it and i don&#x27;t mind it anymore , my skin really feels softer and a  bit firmer i work out too so i guess all adds up ...but it is good i ll get another bottle and continue to post my experience with time as i ve only been useing it for a couple of weeks ....</li>
            <li> * I asked for this for holidays, since I cannot find this particular type of Palmer&#x27;s locally.  I have tried all different versions by Palmer&#x27;s this one has the best ingredients and ratio of the ingredients, the best smell, and not greasy. It also does it&#x27;s job, multiple ways! I use it all over my body, even my face! It doesn&#x27;t cause pimples and even helps my combo skin, strengthen all of my skin, softening, toning, and protecting from elements! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; * My least favorite is the straight up Palmer&#x27;s Shea Butter version which smells bad, and isn&#x27;t as creamy or helpful, which this one is not.&lt;br /&gt; This one does have shea in it, but not as a base, and is more of a cocoa butter smell. That&#x27;s why it says WITH shea, not labled as shea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ~ * ~ Thank you Palmer&#x27;s and please make this more available!</li>
            <li> Love palmers cocoa butter lotion&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> The lotion makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my cousin, she is using this, just waiting for the result. I hope it work .</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I have been using it once a day for 1 full week and can already tell a difference. My skin is softer, the bumps on the back of my arms have gone away, my stretch marks are looking better, and the skin on my thighs and &amp;#34;bat wings&amp;#34; look tighter and more smooth. I will continue to use this during my weight loss journey.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday I work outside on the field and this palmers cocoa butter keep my skin away from dry and no ashy</li>
            <li> I bought this same product from a different seller about 4 months ago. I liked it enough to buy it again, but I see no signs of it &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; anything. It smells good though, and has a nice thick consistency. For the price, I will continue to use it.... maybe if I stop with the wine, then I will get better results :).</li>
            <li> Have never had anything but positive results with the palmers products. This is my first time to use the firming</li>
            <li> Only tried got anout a week but so far it seems to be working</li>
            <li> This seems to be working pretty well. It firms and adsorbs very nicely.  My bonus is the skin on my hands. See I wash my hands a lot and I&#x27;ve started to get really dry cracked sometimes painful skin in between my fingers. Some lotions helps a little and some of it actually irritates it. Ever since I stared using this it&#x27;s gotten better all the way around! So when I put this on I made sure to rub in between my fingers as well. I use their bust firming lotion as well on, so it&#x27;s probably a combination of both. Both smell nice too. I&#x27;ve been told I smell like cookies and chocolate. :) Not overwhelming though. I usually use vanilla perfume and they go well together.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother, and she loved it! She said that it helped with the cellulite on her stomach said she had lost weight… Now I&#x27;m visiting the same issue with cellulite on my stomach post weight loss. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, we will see the final results in a couple more weeks… I also purchased some body wraps to help with the cellulite before I hit the pool LOL</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! It really helps to smooth and firm!!!</li>
