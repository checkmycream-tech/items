            <li>I was instantly impressed and now have panic attacks if I don&#x27;t have a tube readily available.  </li>

            <li>It is amazing what a difference it makes.</li>
            <li>my eye shadow still looked flawless thanks to UD primer potion.</li>
            <li>this is a nice product for keeping make-up in place for the day.</li>
            <li>very nice color and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>Its by far the best around, your eyeshadow will stay in place all day.</li>
            <li>When I use it though, the results are fantastic - no creasing, lasts all night, and keeps me looking pretty flawless.    </li>
            <li>This is the most amazing primer- lightweight, goes on smoothly without caking or bleeding, and lasts forever!</li>
            <li>Package arrived quickly and works as good as a purchase made from the mall.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I think Ruebenesque is close to Sin, off the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I think Ruebenesque is close to Sin, off the top of my head.</li>
            <li>When it comes to eyeshadow primers, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this product keeps shadow on all day</li>
            <li>Looks perfect from the minute I apply my eyeshadow and liner until 24 hours later!  </li>
            <li>I will keep using this product and buy more of the tube size when my sample is finished.</li>
            <li>Again it seems I am alone amongst the reviewers in this opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. :)</li>
            <li>I love it.   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put my moisturizer on in the AM on the top of my lids, I use this primer - and yet still my eyeshadow creases.</li>
            <li>My favorite is their eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Simply the BEST shadow primer.</li>
            <li>Urban Decay Primer is the best out there.</li>
            <li>Even better though -</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>this is one of my most Favorite Eye shadow Primer.</li>
            <li>and then my powder accent color on top of that.  </li>
            <li>And she was correct, it works like a charm, I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would keep everything in place :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the urban decay eyeshadow primer for over a year now, and I have to say it was one of my best purchases.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I just love it .</li>
            <li>I just love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I use both the original and &#x27;sin&#x27; versions and love them both!</li>
            <li>However, the most I was able to reach with either product tipped the scales at 6hrs before creasing set in.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this product many times</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have tried that works great for oily eyelids!</li>
            <li>This new tube makes a great product even better.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t live without this stuff and the eyeshadow looks great all day.</li>
            <li>love it great product easy to use made colorlook better Urban decay has great products love the naked pallet also</li>
            <li>and it looks like you were smacked in the eyes with a sock full of flour!</li>
            <li>this tube easily lasts 6months.</li>
            <li>It makes my eye colors pop and blend easily.  </li>
            <li>Urban Decay&#x27;s Eye shadow primer really stays put and is an excellent neutral color for most skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Mary Kay eyeshadow primer for years and loved it - wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>After 14 hours at the office, when my eyes are bloodshot and my pressed powder is a wreck, my eyeshadow still looks fine.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist and primarily do makeup for weddings.  </li>
            <li>I use a decent amount also, about half the size of a pencil eraser (not the cap kind lol!)</li>
            <li>However, this full-size squeezable tube version makes it very easy for someone to use way more than needed (I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this motivated the change in design).</li>
            <li>came in the original packaging.</li>
            <li>Worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li>And i was really excited about it when i ordered it here.</li>
            <li>A little pricey for me, but worth every penny as it makes me feel good to see myself this way!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put on sassy, bright colors and went to the club, danced all the over the floor and woke up the next day with my peepers still intact!  </li>
            <li>guess I&#x27;ll pass it on, as I&#x27;m enjoying the Paint Pots way too much now.</li>
            <li>guess I&#x27;ll pass it on, as I&#x27;m enjoying the Paint Pots way too much now.</li>
            <li>This is true for all makeup brands you apply over the primer...  </li>
            <li>It works ok, but there is still some creasing and eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.  </li>
            <li>It really makes the eye shadow pop and stay on so much better than anything else out there.</li>
            <li>I had tried homemade, cheap remedies for this, but spending money on this product is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I even when further in testing this product, it was to good to be true, so</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions in the other reviews and it turned out great.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals eyeshadow primer works much better!</li>
            <li>I use urban decay primer and love the results, but this one cannot be authentic.  </li>
            <li>This primer does increase the life of my eyeshadow, but I have a problem with it creasing extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s worth it to spend a little more on a product that makes my eyeshadow stay perfect for 6-8 hours, while it only lasted about 2 hours without primer.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to help your eyeshadow stay beautiful and vibrant all day long, this is the stuff!  </li>
            <li>But no more creases, excellent product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and makes your eye shadow stand out more and last longer.</li>
            <li>and this keeps my shadow from creasing and keeps my eye color looking fresh all day (even in the hot Georgia weather!)</li>
            <li>I often find that if I sweat or get a little oily at all on my eyelids the eyeliner or mascara kind of smear onto the top part of my eyelid where the lash line skims the skin.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have received free samples of it and found it&#x27;s only ok on my eyelid, anywhere else</li>
            <li>This makeup investment is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>All of the great reviews sold me on the product, and I found this primer just plain doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the other reviewers, I have not judged multiple eyeshadow primers and settled on this as the best.</li>
            <li>I purchase other Urban Decay items because I believe after this primer everything would be the best.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at helping shadow stand out, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth $15 for something that creases on me :</li>
            <li>It also makes eyeshadow colors true and intense.</li>
            <li>it is pricy, but worth very penny!</li>
            <li>I started trying eyeshadow primers recently and so far, Clinique, Benefit, and Almay Bright Eyes do not work for me.</li>
            <li>Luckily I ordered this along with my Shany eyeshadow palette, so I could really experiment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Adding to my review im finding I do need more of the product for it to work properly.</li>
            <li>tube is much preferable to the wand applicator!</li>
            <li>I bought Painterly first</li>
            <li>I have since added several others, as I find the colored bases to be one more way to enhance and enliven my existing eye shadows.</li>
            <li>Painterly is like Eden, only better.</li>

            <li>Painterly is like Eden, only better.</li>
            <li>This is the first eyeshadow primer I have ever used, but I will not be searching for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to do, no tricks, bells, or whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, so I used to use Urban Decay Eyeshadow primer for years...</li>
            <li>It costs a pretty penny</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely better than the ones listed above.  </li>
            <li>Most definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I love urban decay and the eyeshadow primer will not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and keep coming back to</li>
            <li>I love this eye shadow primer because it actually DOES THE JOB!..</li>
            <li>You should never use eye shadow without putting this on first.</li>
            <li>It does keep my eye makeup on longer, especially when I put my Clinique cream eye wear on top of it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard Urban Decay PP being thrown around by so many Guru&#x27;s I</li>
            <li>Despite all the sweating, my eyeliner and eye shadow are exactly where they started.</li>
            <li>and this one really works for me!</li>
            <li>I have had VERY oily skin all my life and this is a must for me every day!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even been my experience that other brands of eyeshadow (Smashbox and Stila especially) work BETTER with the UDPP than they do with their own brands of primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then went on a hunt for the perfect primer, because hey--there&#x27;s gotta be one at least equal to or better than Urban Decay.    </li>
            <li>Make sure your lids are moisturized before using, that would be my only real tip.</li>
            <li>Halfway through the day I am taken back at my own reflection, because I look GOOD~ not like the mother of a 2 year old who is tired, but fresh and put together!  </li>
            <li>I recently started using the new MAC BB Cream (tried both the lotion and the compact with equal results) and for some reason I now get better eye color retention on top of the BB Cream if I use UDPP and not the Paint Pots.</li>

            <li>I had the original one and the container started cracking in a few spots so this makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I do have some pretty oily skin, but I use a foundation directed towards absorbing oil</li>
            <li>and I have loved the product in the past.  </li>
            <li>I have had my large tube over a year now</li>
            <li>I have had my large tube over a year now</li>
            <li>Well thank you Urban Decay for listening to your loyal customers!</li>
            <li>We had a huge heat wave here and after several hours in the heat and humidity</li>
            <li>I really worked my face is oily and</li>
            <li>I do really like the tube version of this instead of the bottle and applicator style.</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>I use my finger or a brush to apply the Paint Pots, depending on how much time I have and how fussy I want to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use my finger or a brush to apply the Paint Pots, depending on how much time I have and how fussy I want to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Too Faced comes in really close.</li>
            <li>you can with your eyeshadow brush when applying because it really sets it immediately, so you can&#x27;t blend with your fingers.</li>
            <li>It really makes my eyeshadow not smudge.</li>
            <li>I have very oily eyelids</li>
            <li>it lasts all day and works very well.</li>
            <li>Its very weightless, doesnt crease, and stays on.</li>
            <li>If I knew it had this much in it, I would not have bought it.  </li>
            <li>I use this every day and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I have very oily eyelids</li>
            <li>This primer makes whole brands name for me.</li>
            <li>No silly, it wasn&#x27;t a face full of makeup; it was simply a pop of turquoise liquid liner to match my bathing suit.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have ordered a different shade than original, so I could get some coverage on my lids.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and my eyeshadow and liner last ALL day long.</li>
            <li>You still only need a tiny dot of the stuff to cover both eyelids and the tube is more hygenic and it&#x27;s easier to get more of the stuff out when the tube is almost empty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to Coastal Scents primer which is just as good as Urban Decay but costs considerably less and is easier to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
            <li>I also found SIN to be very drying to the eye area, ok for my lid but not in the crease/browbone; it made those areas look like little cake crumbs clinging there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent size tube</li>
            <li>am of an older age, so the primer has to do a lot of things.</li>
            <li>But this rating is on this particular item (it was greasy and worked as a concealer rather than a primer).</li>
            <li>Sometimes when I truly like how my make up looks, I go to sleep without removing my eyeshadow and next day my eye shadow is exactly as it was when I first put it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, requires very little and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li>love spoiling myself with the little extras when it comes to face products.  </li>
            <li>my shadow creases normally</li>
            <li>Been using it for 2 yrs.... and even stock an extra one just in case, but it gathers dust since it lasts so long :)</li>
            <li>so i just went with the normal primer</li>
            <li>I love this product, but the one I received from this vendor was dried up, and almost not usable.</li>
            <li>This a must have if you love a long lasting shawdow no matter what the shawdow brand is!</li>
            <li>It lasts such a long time, which makes it worth the money, and it works so well at keeping eyeliner and eyeshadow in place!!</li>
            <li>I asked my mom to buy this when she was on vacation because they don&#x27;t sell this where I live.</li>
            <li>How did I ever live without this????  </li>
            <li>I live in a humid environment and my makeup would literally melt off without this primer.</li>
            <li>i use it all the time and it is great at creating a smooth base for your eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I am still on my first tube of this new container, I bought it in the yellow tint that covers the purpleness around my eyes, once I have squeezed out all that I can</li>
            <li>Still have this exact one 2 years later</li>
            <li>plus, this is the first urban decay product i bought.</li>
            <li>I start with a clean lid, then squeeze out almost the smallest amount possible and dab it on my upper lid.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and the first one has lasted me for 7 months so far.</li>
            <li>I little goes a very long way used sparingly it should last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was a huge waste.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t get near as much primer in the tube as you do with the Urban Decay one...</li>
            <li>I love this primer, its expensive but worth the money, makes your eye shadow pop and last the whole day.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>Only, I ended up looking like a clown because it ran so much.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a number of different eyeshadow primers, because I have really oily eyelids, and my eyeshadow and eyeliner ALWAYS creases.</li>
            <li>I couldnt really understand the reason for there being different shads</li>
            <li>If you work an 8 hour day and go straight home, it&#x27;s no big deal.  </li>
            <li>I am going to school for professional makeup artistry and though I may not be a pro</li>
            <li>Really can not say enough about it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was not allergic.</li>
            <li>Either it was not stored correctly, or it was too old.</li>
            <li>I worked a 10 hour day at the office and went directly to the gym for an hour-long Zumba class and I while the rest of my face/hair looked wrecked after my work out..</li>
            <li>I will not buy this product again  unless I can find the old formula.</li>
            <li>This is quite expensive but I can&#x27;t complain because it works as good as they say it does.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I hadn&#x27;t used my eye cream (and I am not wrinkly, just seasonal dry skin for a 34 year old)</li>
            <li>Even if not wearing shadow your eyelids will remain soft &amp; dry ;)</li>
            <li>Not only when I was scrolling through the items did I initially think I purchased it for MUCH cheaper than I had (20 dollars for this- HIGHLY overpriced.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d be lucky like some other reviewers and have it stay all night!</li>
            <li>I wear a super black gel eyeliner sometimes and a super black mascara all the time.  </li>
            <li>only issue I have with this particular version is that the trial size (the version I used first) came with an applicator wand that deposited the minimal amount needed to do the job.</li>
            <li>The only real issue I had with Urban Decay&#x27;s product before was the genie style bottle it came in.</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s the ONLY shadow primer that actually works on my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Having tried a different brands I have to say I was very surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>[ Shipping took longer than my previous orders and when I opened the tube it seemed like it was only 1/2 full?</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow lasts all day long, even though I have oily lids, and live here in humid South Florida!</li>
            <li>This product is drying and my eyelids do feel dry right now, but that is why my eye make-up is staying in place so well and all day long.</li>
            <li>This little bottle is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Now my mom uses this everyday because she always wears eyeshadow while I only wear it on special occasions.</li>
            <li>(their new formula is NOT the same) and I was left</li>
            <li>have tried primers far and wide: Estee Lauder, Avon, new Mary Kay, Smashbox, Benefit, Lorac, Stila, you name it.</li>
            <li>The only problem i had with this is that it had barely any formula in it!!</li>
            <li>I really only use it for nights out / special occasions, since I usually wear eyeliner without shadow Monday-Friday.  </li>
            <li>Within 2 hours, my eyeshadow had completely melted off and I had a crease in the middle of my eyelid bigger than the Mississippi River.     </li>
            <li>When I first used it it felt like there was only about half the product in the tube.</li>
            <li>The only primer that came CLOSE was the one from Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>Being a gal with oily skin, my eyeshadow needs a heavy duty primer in order to stay pretty.</li>
            <li>I have used my new bottle several times an noticed that the effect does not last as long.</li>
            <li>The only complaints I have, are for the first hour that I have the primer on my eyelids they itch a little</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it to do this since a little primer goes such a long way.</li>

            <li> I was instantly impressed and now have panic attacks if I don&#x27;t have a tube readily available.  </li>

            <li> very nice color and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Its by far the best around, your eyeshadow will stay in place all day.</li>
            <li> When I use it though, the results are fantastic - no creasing, lasts all night, and keeps me looking pretty flawless.    </li>
            <li> This is the most amazing primer- lightweight, goes on smoothly without caking or bleeding, and lasts forever!</li>

            <li> I think Ruebenesque is close to Sin, off the top of my head.</li>
            <li> When it comes to eyeshadow primers, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this product keeps shadow on all day</li>
            <li> Looks perfect from the minute I apply my eyeshadow and liner until 24 hours later!  </li>
            <li> I will keep using this product and buy more of the tube size when my sample is finished.</li>
            <li> Again it seems I am alone amongst the reviewers in this opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. :)</li>
            <li> I love it.   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put my moisturizer on in the AM on the top of my lids, I use this primer - and yet still my eyeshadow creases.</li>
            <li> My favorite is their eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Simply the BEST shadow primer.</li>
            <li> Urban Decay Primer is the best out there.</li>
            <li> Even better though -</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> this is one of my most Favorite Eye shadow Primer.</li>
            <li> and then my powder accent color on top of that.  </li>
            <li> And she was correct, it works like a charm, I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would keep everything in place :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the urban decay eyeshadow primer for over a year now, and I have to say it was one of my best purchases.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I just love it .</li>
            <li> I just love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I use both the original and &#x27;sin&#x27; versions and love them both!</li>
            <li> However, the most I was able to reach with either product tipped the scales at 6hrs before creasing set in.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product many times</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have tried that works great for oily eyelids!</li>
            <li> This new tube makes a great product even better.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t live without this stuff and the eyeshadow looks great all day.</li>
            <li> love it great product easy to use made colorlook better Urban decay has great products love the naked pallet also</li>
            <li> and it looks like you were smacked in the eyes with a sock full of flour!</li>
            <li> this tube easily lasts 6months.</li>
            <li> It makes my eye colors pop and blend easily.  </li>
            <li> Urban Decay&#x27;s Eye shadow primer really stays put and is an excellent neutral color for most skin tones.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Mary Kay eyeshadow primer for years and loved it - wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> After 14 hours at the office, when my eyes are bloodshot and my pressed powder is a wreck, my eyeshadow still looks fine.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and primarily do makeup for weddings.  </li>
            <li> I use a decent amount also, about half the size of a pencil eraser (not the cap kind lol!)</li>
            <li> However, this full-size squeezable tube version makes it very easy for someone to use way more than needed (I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this motivated the change in design).</li>
            <li> came in the original packaging.</li>
            <li> Worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li> And i was really excited about it when i ordered it here.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for me, but worth every penny as it makes me feel good to see myself this way!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put on sassy, bright colors and went to the club, danced all the over the floor and woke up the next day with my peepers still intact!  </li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;ll pass it on, as I&#x27;m enjoying the Paint Pots way too much now.</li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;ll pass it on, as I&#x27;m enjoying the Paint Pots way too much now.</li>
            <li> This is true for all makeup brands you apply over the primer...  </li>
            <li> It works ok, but there is still some creasing and eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.  </li>
            <li> It really makes the eye shadow pop and stay on so much better than anything else out there.</li>
            <li> I had tried homemade, cheap remedies for this, but spending money on this product is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I even when further in testing this product, it was to good to be true, so</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions in the other reviews and it turned out great.  </li>
            <li> Bare Minerals eyeshadow primer works much better!</li>
            <li> I use urban decay primer and love the results, but this one cannot be authentic.  </li>
            <li> This primer does increase the life of my eyeshadow, but I have a problem with it creasing extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s worth it to spend a little more on a product that makes my eyeshadow stay perfect for 6-8 hours, while it only lasted about 2 hours without primer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to help your eyeshadow stay beautiful and vibrant all day long, this is the stuff!  </li>
            <li> But no more creases, excellent product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and makes your eye shadow stand out more and last longer.</li>
            <li> and this keeps my shadow from creasing and keeps my eye color looking fresh all day (even in the hot Georgia weather!)</li>
            <li> I often find that if I sweat or get a little oily at all on my eyelids the eyeliner or mascara kind of smear onto the top part of my eyelid where the lash line skims the skin.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have received free samples of it and found it&#x27;s only ok on my eyelid, anywhere else</li>
            <li> This makeup investment is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> All of the great reviews sold me on the product, and I found this primer just plain doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviewers, I have not judged multiple eyeshadow primers and settled on this as the best.</li>
            <li> I purchase other Urban Decay items because I believe after this primer everything would be the best.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at helping shadow stand out, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth $15 for something that creases on me :</li>
            <li> It also makes eyeshadow colors true and intense.</li>
            <li> it is pricy, but worth very penny!</li>
            <li> I started trying eyeshadow primers recently and so far, Clinique, Benefit, and Almay Bright Eyes do not work for me.</li>
            <li> Luckily I ordered this along with my Shany eyeshadow palette, so I could really experiment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adding to my review im finding I do need more of the product for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> tube is much preferable to the wand applicator!</li>
            <li> I bought Painterly first</li>
            <li> I have since added several others, as I find the colored bases to be one more way to enhance and enliven my existing eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Painterly is like Eden, only better.</li>

            <li> Painterly is like Eden, only better.</li>
            <li> This is the first eyeshadow primer I have ever used, but I will not be searching for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want it to do, no tricks, bells, or whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, so I used to use Urban Decay Eyeshadow primer for years...</li>
            <li> It costs a pretty penny</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely better than the ones listed above.  </li>
            <li> Most definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love urban decay and the eyeshadow primer will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and keep coming back to</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow primer because it actually DOES THE JOB!..</li>
            <li> You should never use eye shadow without putting this on first.</li>
            <li> It does keep my eye makeup on longer, especially when I put my Clinique cream eye wear on top of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard Urban Decay PP being thrown around by so many Guru&#x27;s I</li>
            <li> Despite all the sweating, my eyeliner and eye shadow are exactly where they started.</li>
            <li> and this one really works for me!</li>
            <li> I have had VERY oily skin all my life and this is a must for me every day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even been my experience that other brands of eyeshadow (Smashbox and Stila especially) work BETTER with the UDPP than they do with their own brands of primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then went on a hunt for the perfect primer, because hey--there&#x27;s gotta be one at least equal to or better than Urban Decay.    </li>
            <li> Make sure your lids are moisturized before using, that would be my only real tip.</li>
            <li> Halfway through the day I am taken back at my own reflection, because I look GOOD~ not like the mother of a 2 year old who is tired, but fresh and put together!  </li>
            <li> I recently started using the new MAC BB Cream (tried both the lotion and the compact with equal results) and for some reason I now get better eye color retention on top of the BB Cream if I use UDPP and not the Paint Pots.</li>

            <li> I had the original one and the container started cracking in a few spots so this makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I do have some pretty oily skin, but I use a foundation directed towards absorbing oil</li>
            <li> and I have loved the product in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have had my large tube over a year now</li>
            <li> I have had my large tube over a year now</li>
            <li> Well thank you Urban Decay for listening to your loyal customers!</li>
            <li> We had a huge heat wave here and after several hours in the heat and humidity</li>
            <li> I really worked my face is oily and</li>
            <li> I do really like the tube version of this instead of the bottle and applicator style.</li>
            <li> Too much</li>
            <li> I use my finger or a brush to apply the Paint Pots, depending on how much time I have and how fussy I want to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use my finger or a brush to apply the Paint Pots, depending on how much time I have and how fussy I want to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Too Faced comes in really close.</li>
            <li> you can with your eyeshadow brush when applying because it really sets it immediately, so you can&#x27;t blend with your fingers.</li>
            <li> It really makes my eyeshadow not smudge.</li>
            <li> I have very oily eyelids</li>
            <li> it lasts all day and works very well.</li>
            <li> Its very weightless, doesnt crease, and stays on.</li>
            <li> If I knew it had this much in it, I would not have bought it.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I have very oily eyelids</li>
            <li> This primer makes whole brands name for me.</li>
            <li> No silly, it wasn&#x27;t a face full of makeup; it was simply a pop of turquoise liquid liner to match my bathing suit.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have ordered a different shade than original, so I could get some coverage on my lids.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and my eyeshadow and liner last ALL day long.</li>
            <li> You still only need a tiny dot of the stuff to cover both eyelids and the tube is more hygenic and it&#x27;s easier to get more of the stuff out when the tube is almost empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to Coastal Scents primer which is just as good as Urban Decay but costs considerably less and is easier to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I also found SIN to be very drying to the eye area, ok for my lid but not in the crease/browbone; it made those areas look like little cake crumbs clinging there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent size tube</li>
            <li> am of an older age, so the primer has to do a lot of things.</li>
            <li> But this rating is on this particular item (it was greasy and worked as a concealer rather than a primer).</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I truly like how my make up looks, I go to sleep without removing my eyeshadow and next day my eye shadow is exactly as it was when I first put it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, requires very little and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> love spoiling myself with the little extras when it comes to face products.  </li>
            <li> my shadow creases normally</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 yrs.... and even stock an extra one just in case, but it gathers dust since it lasts so long :)</li>
            <li> so i just went with the normal primer</li>
            <li> I love this product, but the one I received from this vendor was dried up, and almost not usable.</li>
            <li> This a must have if you love a long lasting shawdow no matter what the shawdow brand is!</li>
            <li> It lasts such a long time, which makes it worth the money, and it works so well at keeping eyeliner and eyeshadow in place!!</li>
            <li> I asked my mom to buy this when she was on vacation because they don&#x27;t sell this where I live.</li>
            <li> How did I ever live without this????  </li>
            <li> I live in a humid environment and my makeup would literally melt off without this primer.</li>
            <li> i use it all the time and it is great at creating a smooth base for your eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I am still on my first tube of this new container, I bought it in the yellow tint that covers the purpleness around my eyes, once I have squeezed out all that I can</li>
            <li> Still have this exact one 2 years later</li>
            <li> plus, this is the first urban decay product i bought.</li>
            <li> I start with a clean lid, then squeeze out almost the smallest amount possible and dab it on my upper lid.  </li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and the first one has lasted me for 7 months so far.</li>
            <li> I little goes a very long way used sparingly it should last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was a huge waste.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t get near as much primer in the tube as you do with the Urban Decay one...</li>
            <li> I love this primer, its expensive but worth the money, makes your eye shadow pop and last the whole day.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> Only, I ended up looking like a clown because it ran so much.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different eyeshadow primers, because I have really oily eyelids, and my eyeshadow and eyeliner ALWAYS creases.</li>
            <li> I couldnt really understand the reason for there being different shads</li>
            <li> If you work an 8 hour day and go straight home, it&#x27;s no big deal.  </li>
            <li> I am going to school for professional makeup artistry and though I may not be a pro</li>
            <li> Really can not say enough about it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was not allergic.</li>
            <li> Either it was not stored correctly, or it was too old.</li>
            <li> I worked a 10 hour day at the office and went directly to the gym for an hour-long Zumba class and I while the rest of my face/hair looked wrecked after my work out..</li>
            <li> I will not buy this product again  unless I can find the old formula.</li>
            <li> This is quite expensive but I can&#x27;t complain because it works as good as they say it does.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I hadn&#x27;t used my eye cream (and I am not wrinkly, just seasonal dry skin for a 34 year old)</li>
            <li> Even if not wearing shadow your eyelids will remain soft &amp; dry ;)</li>
            <li> Not only when I was scrolling through the items did I initially think I purchased it for MUCH cheaper than I had (20 dollars for this- HIGHLY overpriced.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d be lucky like some other reviewers and have it stay all night!</li>
            <li> I wear a super black gel eyeliner sometimes and a super black mascara all the time.  </li>
            <li> only issue I have with this particular version is that the trial size (the version I used first) came with an applicator wand that deposited the minimal amount needed to do the job.</li>
            <li> The only real issue I had with Urban Decay&#x27;s product before was the genie style bottle it came in.</li>
            <li> Really, it&#x27;s the ONLY shadow primer that actually works on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Having tried a different brands I have to say I was very surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> [ Shipping took longer than my previous orders and when I opened the tube it seemed like it was only 1/2 full?</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow lasts all day long, even though I have oily lids, and live here in humid South Florida!</li>
            <li> This product is drying and my eyelids do feel dry right now, but that is why my eye make-up is staying in place so well and all day long.</li>
            <li> This little bottle is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Now my mom uses this everyday because she always wears eyeshadow while I only wear it on special occasions.</li>
            <li> (their new formula is NOT the same) and I was left</li>
            <li> have tried primers far and wide: Estee Lauder, Avon, new Mary Kay, Smashbox, Benefit, Lorac, Stila, you name it.</li>
            <li> The only problem i had with this is that it had barely any formula in it!!</li>
            <li> I really only use it for nights out / special occasions, since I usually wear eyeliner without shadow Monday-Friday.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 hours, my eyeshadow had completely melted off and I had a crease in the middle of my eyelid bigger than the Mississippi River.     </li>
            <li> When I first used it it felt like there was only about half the product in the tube.</li>
            <li> The only primer that came CLOSE was the one from Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li> Being a gal with oily skin, my eyeshadow needs a heavy duty primer in order to stay pretty.</li>
            <li> I have used my new bottle several times an noticed that the effect does not last as long.</li>
            <li> The only complaints I have, are for the first hour that I have the primer on my eyelids they itch a little</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth it to do this since a little primer goes such a long way.</li>
            <li> It only takes a tiny dab per eye, so a tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I will use it up but am a little heartbroken as I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> It only takes a tiny bit, so the tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Shadow Insurance simply doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, the paint pots combined with either of the BB creams (I dab what&#x27;s left on the sponge across eyelids for minor coverage) makes a slidy greasiness but not with the UDPP.eye, so a tube will last a long time.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not a drugstore-priced item, but it does go a LONG way, and if you use it daily you MIGHT have to buy it as often as 3 times/year.</li>
            <li> An ulta store recently opened where i live and i recently bought this eye primer this past weekend.</li>
            <li> The only difference is, the Paint Pots don&#x27;t enhance dryness or wrinkles in my eye area, nor do they actively dry out my eye skin as the colored UDPP&#x27;s have.</li>

            <li> , I can simply snip the tube open with some scissors and scoop it into the empty lip gloss pot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eye primers and always end up disappointed and coming back to my beloved Urban Decay primer potion.  </li>
            <li> Anytime I&#x27;m doing BIG looks for a night out, or just want a single shadow to stay in place</li>
            <li> Even though I wear makeup daily, I tend to keep things pretty simple and use a lot of drugstore brands - so I was skeptical about the price.  </li>
            <li> Since there were no Sephoras around, nor any place that sells Urban Decay products, I figured I would try other primers and see how they worked.    </li>
            <li> finally, no need to try any other brand for the eyeshadow primer potion.</li>
            <li> and I am now kicking myself for waiting so long!</li>
            <li> And you have to let it dry a minute or two before applying your eye makeup otherwise</li>
            <li> The area around my eyes tends to be dry, so it has to stay put and not enhance wrinkles or any residual flaky skin.</li>
            <li> With out this my eye liner and eye shadow would only last for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I use this every single day.  </li>
            <li> I use this every single day.  </li>
            <li> so I can overlook it), but the seller sent a very unprofessional letter with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins with refund instructions, which is well enough for those who cannot figure out how to go through amazon, but it leads into a plead of not leaving negative feedback and a threat against &#x27;competitors who buy 2 leave negative&#x27; (feedback) with various grammatical and spelling errors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You put it on under your eyeshadow and it keeps it in place for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge makeup person, but I dab a little of this on my eyelid before eyeliner and a little eyeshadow and it will stay in place the whole day!</li>
            <li> It sticks so well in fact, that when I apply it to my hand first to dap on the eye, I have a difficult time removing it off the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> I love this product but this one that I ordered was bad.</li>
            <li> Plus, about halfway through the container I would have to saw the bottle into pieces with a kitchen knife and scoop the rest of the product into an empty lip gloss pot.</li>
            <li> That really only makes it a few cents a day to use.</li>
            <li> I spent $12 on the Loreal Primer.  </li>
            <li> I spent $20 on the Clinique Primer.  </li>
            <li> I spent $24 on the primer from Estee Lauder.  </li>
            <li> Initially a coworker bought this for me after hearing my woes about my eye makeup sliding off or smudging everyday.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of it, and got on Amazon to see what really works.</li>
            <li> This lasts for a very long time since you only use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other brand from now on.</li>
            <li> It lasts forevern - a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other primers, but none are like this.  </li>
            <li> You have to be very careful when applying, as there is no blending once you have applied the primer.</li>
            <li> My make up will last at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Not worth it in oily skins.</li>
            <li> and I mean nothing....has worked for me like the Urban Decay Primer Potion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am normally not a stickler for these things when it comes to casual emails or exchanges, however, if I am paying for something from someone I expect them to act professionally and behave as if they are conducting legitimate business.</li>
            <li> Previously, my eyeliner always smeared within an hour, but I stubbornly kept wearing it for 15 years.</li>
            <li> i can give it less than one star rating i would pleasingly</li>
            <li> As I&#x60;m makeup artist this product makes half of my work</li>
            <li> I used to get creases and my eyeshadow and eyeliner would cake up and just be a mess.</li>
            <li> Btw, the bottle is not full...</li>
            <li> No more frustration with sawing the bottle open, which the plastic was hard and it dulled my knife too.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have even noticed that the sample I have been using for the past couple days is working extremely well except I went to the ophthalmologist</li>
            <li> I wish somebody had addressed this issue very clearly a little sooner</li>
            <li> All you need is just a little.</li>
            <li> The wand was irritating because it came into contact with your eye and then back in the container</li>
            <li> I always ended up with some cuts and spilled primer in my kitchen which was wasted.   </li>
            <li> Wearing makeup almost everyday, one containers lasts close to six months for me.</li>
            <li> Although it took a few days for it to arrive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Too Faced for a few months</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few months since I purchased this product</li>
            <li> It takes a lot less than you think it will!</li>
            <li> It takes a lot less than you think it will!</li>
            <li> I was a little leery because it was sort of expensive, but I used it last night and...</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a LOOOOONG way!</li>
            <li> Very little product is required.</li>
            <li> Usually, any eye make-up comes off on the tissue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product creases without eye shadow over it and it doesn&#x27;t hold back the oiliness.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s not working for me.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I thought all eye primers were the same and went on with my life.  </li>
            <li> lo and behold, my eyeshadow and eye makeup was firmly in place!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small and hard to get it all out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how spoiled I was at being able to do that, until I tried other primers and they failed miserably.</li>
            <li> By the end of the workday, my morning&#x27;s hard work was virtually gone.</li>
            <li> In fact, it gets annoying that if you happen to apply just a bit too much, it can stay moist and make makeup application tricky.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t forced to experiment.  </li>
            <li> I thought my eyeshadow would stay at least until noon, and nothingn!</li>
            <li> We never used a primer before because we haven&#x27;t seen them here where we live and the eyeshadow gets very ugly by the end of the day if we don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to it.  </li>
            <li> Not happy about it - at all.</li>
            <li> My cream eyeshadow used to crease and look like crap after several hours.</li>
            <li> Approximately at 7 pm when I get home, my makeup looks just as it did at 6:30 am.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad batch or if this is a fake</li>
            <li> Silly me.  </li>
            <li> Not really impressed.</li>
            <li> That was a very poor mistake.</li>
            <li> it can not be beat by the Cold or in the Heat.</li>
            <li> It was either out dated or the company had one of those moments of a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I am used to waking up if I forget to take my eyeshadow off and having it faded and smudged all over with ugly lines.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been really frustrated with eyeshadow because it always clumps up with the oils in my eye.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> It creases within 2 hours. :-(</li>
            <li> My eye makeup smears and I am very unhappy  with  the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this primer today. I bought it at the recommendation of some you tube bloggers. I really worked my face is oily and my shadow creases normally but it did not today, I was very impressed. It&#x27;s a decent size tube I little goes a very long way used sparingly it should last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to my review im finding I do need more of the product for it to work properly. And you have to let it dry a minute or two before applying your eye makeup otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work well.  I compared it to my Mark eye primer by Avon it works just as well no drying time and is only like 8 dollars...I will stick with Mark. I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
            <li> This is the best primer I have ever used and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch.  It goes on easily and makes your eye shadow stand out more and last longer.</li>
            <li> I received this primer on time and I am completely satisfied with my order! I do makeup on people and UD Primer Potion helps the eyeshadow stick on, stay on longer, and makes the colors brighter. I would definitely recommend this if you want your eye makeup to last all day or all night.</li>
            <li> came in the original packaging. very good quality, for a good price! I would recommend this for any eye primer.</li>
            <li> This primer is amazing.  I&#x27;m addicted to it.  I followed the instructions in the other reviews and it turned out great.  I start with a clean lid, then squeeze out almost the smallest amount possible and dab it on my upper lid.  I wait about a minute before applying shadow.      I really only use it for nights out / special occasions, since I usually wear eyeliner without shadow Monday-Friday.  When I use it though, the results are fantastic - no creasing, lasts all night, and keeps me looking pretty flawless.    I&#x27;m not one to spend tons on beauty supplies.  Even though I wear makeup daily, I tend to keep things pretty simple and use a lot of drugstore brands - so I was skeptical about the price.  But the way I use it, it will probably last over a year, so I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it every morning and never leave the house without it. I do really like the tube version of this instead of the bottle and applicator style.</li>
            <li> A long, long time ago, Mary Kay made an eye primer called \\&quot;Triple Action Eye Enhancer\\&quot;. It was the best stuff on the planet! Then they discontinued it (their new formula is NOT the same) and I was left searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried primers far and wide: Estee Lauder, Avon, new Mary Kay, Smashbox, Benefit, Lorac, Stila, you name it. Nothing...and I mean nothing....has worked for me like the Urban Decay Primer Potion. It&#x27;s even been my experience that other brands of eyeshadow (Smashbox and Stila especially) work BETTER with the UDPP than they do with their own brands of primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am of an older age, so the primer has to do a lot of things. I have oily lids, so it has to keep my eyeshadow from looking like greasepaint. The area around my eyes tends to be dry, so it has to stay put and not enhance wrinkles or any residual flaky skin. (It happens! And you only notice it when you are applying your eye makeup!) I don&#x27;t want to reapply makeup all day; in fact I just put it on before work and expect it to stick. I didn&#x27;t realize how spoiled I was at being able to do that, until I tried other primers and they failed miserably. I know if UDPP won&#x27;t hold a product, I don&#x27;t want that product. It even helps keep your eyeliner from migrating when used under the eyelid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*One note about Eden and Sin: Eden is a pigmented primer, a fair color. Be sparing with this one! Too much and it looks like you were smacked in the eyes with a sock full of flour! Plus it clings to and enhances any dryness you have in your eye area. Sin is a metallic, so good luck with *that* if you have any crinklage! I have received free samples of it and found it&#x27;s only ok on my eyelid, anywhere else and I look Dame Edna. I also found SIN to be very drying to the eye area, ok for my lid but not in the crease/browbone; it made those areas look like little cake crumbs clinging there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is much preferable to the wand applicator! And lasting? It only takes a tiny dab per eye, so a tube will last a long time. I have had my large tube over a year now and I wear it 5 days a week. It takes a lot less than you think it will! This is the only primer I recommend to women my age, because I know what it does for me. It works like spackle, without LOOKING like you spackled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8-31-12: I have been experimenting with the MAC Paint Pots for awhile now, as bases under my eye makeup. I bought Painterly first, it&#x27;s a nude color. I have since added several others, as I find the colored bases to be one more way to enhance and enliven my existing eye shadows. I just realized today that I have not picked up my Urban Decay primer for months....guess I&#x27;ll pass it on, as I&#x27;m enjoying the Paint Pots way too much now. Painterly is like Eden, only better. I think Ruebenesque is close to Sin, off the top of my head. The only difference is, the Paint Pots don&#x27;t enhance dryness or wrinkles in my eye area, nor do they actively dry out my eye skin as the colored UDPP&#x27;s have. I use my finger or a brush to apply the Paint Pots, depending on how much time I have and how fussy I want to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11-14-12: I guess it depends on what you are wearing....I recently started using the new MAC BB Cream (tried both the lotion and the compact with equal results) and for some reason I now get better eye color retention on top of the BB Cream if I use UDPP and not the Paint Pots. For some reason, the paint pots combined with either of the BB creams (I dab what&#x27;s left on the sponge across eyelids for minor coverage) makes a slidy greasiness but not with the UDPP.eye, so a tube will last a long time.

            <li> this tube easily lasts 6months. Very little product is required. In fact, it gets annoying that if you happen to apply just a bit too much, it can stay moist and make makeup application tricky. This product is worth every penny!!! Been using it for 2 yrs.... and even stock an extra one just in case, but it gathers dust since it lasts so long :)</li>
            <li> Still have this exact one 2 years later</li>
            <li> When it comes to eyeshadow primers, this one is my favorite. I tried NYX and Too Faced, but this one works best for oily eyelids like mine, the Too Faced comes in really close. To me, it&#x27;s worth it to spend a little more on a product that makes my eyeshadow stay perfect for 6-8 hours, while it only lasted about 2 hours without primer. My eyecolor can survive Texas&#x27; humidity and heat, a night out, and my oily skin when I&#x27;m wearing this. The only real issue I had with Urban Decay&#x27;s product before was the genie style bottle it came in. The wand was irritating because it came into contact with your eye and then back in the container, I always wash my hands and my face before I do my makeup, but this seemed like it would be a breeding ground for bacteria otherwise. Plus, about halfway through the container I would have to saw the bottle into pieces with a kitchen knife and scoop the rest of the product into an empty lip gloss pot. I always ended up with some cuts and spilled primer in my kitchen which was wasted.   Well thank you Urban Decay for listening to your loyal customers! This new tube makes a great product even better. You still only need a tiny dot of the stuff to cover both eyelids and the tube is more hygenic and it&#x27;s easier to get more of the stuff out when the tube is almost empty. No more frustration with sawing the bottle open, which the plastic was hard and it dulled my knife too. I am still on my first tube of this new container, I bought it in the yellow tint that covers the purpleness around my eyes, once I have squeezed out all that I can, I can simply snip the tube open with some scissors and scoop it into the empty lip gloss pot. I think it&#x27;s worth it to do this since a little primer goes such a long way. Wearing makeup almost everyday, one containers lasts close to six months for me. That really only makes it a few cents a day to use. This makeup investment is totally worth it. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I love this primer, its expensive but worth the money, makes your eye shadow pop and last the whole day. I would buy and buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love this product keeps shadow on all day</li>
            <li> I used to get creases and my eyeshadow and eyeliner would cake up and just be a mess. Not with using this it&#x27;s not. Looks perfect from the minute I apply my eyeshadow and liner until 24 hours later!  You have to be very careful when applying, as there is no blending once you have applied the primer. So blend as best you can with your eyeshadow brush when applying because it really sets it immediately, so you can&#x27;t blend with your fingers. But no more creases, excellent product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing!!! I started trying eyeshadow primers recently and so far, Clinique, Benefit, and Almay Bright Eyes do not work for me. Previously, my eyeliner always smeared within an hour, but I stubbornly kept wearing it for 15 years. I wish I&#x27;d found this product when it came out. I wouldn&#x27;t have even noticed that the sample I have been using for the past couple days is working extremely well except I went to the ophthalmologist and they put eye drops in my eyes and gave me a tissue to wipe away the excess liquid. Usually, any eye make-up comes off on the tissue. This time, I noticed I dabbed after the 1st drop and there was NO make-up on the tissue. They put a 2nd drop in my eyes and I dabbed again and still NO make-up on the tissue. I was really surprised. I realized recently that I have oily eyelids so any make-up smears. This product is drying and my eyelids do feel dry right now, but that is why my eye make-up is staying in place so well and all day long. I have recently started moisturizing my eyelids at night and also in the morning before applying this eye primer. I will keep using this product and buy more of the tube size when my sample is finished. It even makes my brown eyeshadow look really good on my eyes and keeps the cream eyeliner in place, which is miraculous for my eyes! Pencil doesn&#x27;t even stay in place or MAC fluid liner. I will only stop using Urban Decay eye primer if my eyelids start turning wrinkly.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviewers, I have not judged multiple eyeshadow primers and settled on this as the best. This is the first eyeshadow primer I have ever used, but I will not be searching for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before, I literally would have to check my mirror once every 2 hours and smear off the maddening line of accumulated eyeshadow pigment in my crease. By the end of the workday, my morning&#x27;s hard work was virtually gone. I tried foundation, concealer, powder, and neutral eyeshadow in place of primer to no avail. Now that I use this primer, my eyeshadow stays in place from 8am to 8pm; no worries. It does exactly what I want it to do, no tricks, bells, or whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with this particular version is that the trial size (the version I used first) came with an applicator wand that deposited the minimal amount needed to do the job. However, this full-size squeezable tube version makes it very easy for someone to use way more than needed (I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this motivated the change in design). Again it seems I am alone amongst the reviewers in this opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. :)</li>
            <li> Ok, so I used to use Urban Decay Eyeshadow primer for years... but then I moved to the midwest, and ran out of my tube.  Since there were no Sephoras around, nor any place that sells Urban Decay products, I figured I would try other primers and see how they worked.    I then went on a hunt for the perfect primer, because hey--there&#x27;s gotta be one at least equal to or better than Urban Decay.    I spent $12 on the Loreal Primer.  Worked for about 1/2 a day, and then all melted off...  I spent $20 on the Clinique Primer.  Same thing.  Only, I ended up looking like a clown because it ran so much.  I spent $24 on the primer from Estee Lauder.  Within 2 hours, my eyeshadow had completely melted off and I had a crease in the middle of my eyelid bigger than the Mississippi River.     You get the idea.  So I buckled and bought Urban Decay&#x27;s primer again.  And--I&#x27;m back in HEAVEN.  I love it.   Never a budge, never a smudge.  I&#x27;ll never conduct this experiment again.  I know the truth when I see it. *smiles*    P.S. The only primer that came CLOSE was the one from Bare Escentuals. \\&quot;Prime Time\\&quot; I think it&#x27;s called.  It costs a pretty penny and you don&#x27;t get near as much primer in the tube as you do with the Urban Decay one...but it&#x27;s definitely better than the ones listed above.  It&#x27;s still not as long-wearing as the UD.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put my moisturizer on in the AM on the top of my lids, I use this primer - and yet still my eyeshadow creases. Not happy about it - at all. I will use it up but am a little heartbroken as I had high hopes for this product. Btw, the bottle is not full... hmm</li>
            <li> This product was akin to putting on a tinted lotion.  If I put lotion on underneath my makeup, it would crease, run, and smear immediately... that&#x27;s what this product did.  All of the great reviews sold me on the product, and I found this primer just plain doesn&#x27;t work.  I have used a Mary Kay eyeshadow primer for years and loved it - wanted to try something new.  Silly me.  I just threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Initially a coworker bought this for me after hearing my woes about my eye makeup sliding off or smudging everyday.  I was instantly impressed and now have panic attacks if I don&#x27;t have a tube readily available.  I apply it once and my makeup lasts from 5 AM until I go to bed.  It also has withstood a humid work convention and music festival.  This is true for all makeup brands you apply over the primer...  Be it the most expensive or cheapest drugstore makeup.  Most definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is quite expensive but I can&#x27;t complain because it works as good as they say it does. Make up stays perfect even if you fall asleep with it on.. Incredible!!</li>
            <li> My eye makeup began smearing before I got out of the house in the morning.  Will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> It really makes my eyeshadow not smudge. You just have to smudge it for awhile... Although it took a few days for it to arrive</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Urban Decay. My favorite is their eyeshadow primer. I have tried several brands, some more expensive, and always go back to UD.</li>
            <li> I use this every single day.  It keeps my eyeshadow in place &amp; prevents it from smudging all day &amp; night.  It only takes a tiny bit, so the tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff. Works great. I use it daily to keep my eyeliner and eyeshadow from smearing.</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t pull me away from this Primer for anything in the world! Its by far the best around, your eyeshadow will stay in place all day. I have very oily eyelids and this was my lifesaver. Its no draw backs to buying this product. Worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li> This product serves as a great primer base for eye shadow. However i have oily eyelids and like to wear primer even without eye shadows. Unfortunately this product creases without eye shadow over it and it doesn&#x27;t hold back the oiliness.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but there is still some creasing and eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.  Bare Minerals eyeshadow primer works much better!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad batch or if this is a fake but I&#x27;m upset at how this performed. I&#x27;ve been using Too Faced for a few months so I know how to properly use a primer. I decided to see what all the rave was in this primer and OH MY GOSH it was so greasy! I&#x27;ve tried it on my lids multiple times with multiple shadows and I&#x27;m so disappointed. It creases within 2 hours. :-(</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different eyeshadow primers, because I have really oily eyelids, and my eyeshadow and eyeliner ALWAYS creases. I got tired of it, and got on Amazon to see what really works. Even though Urban Decay&#x27;s product is pricey, it actually works! I am thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> Simply the BEST shadow primer. Really, it&#x27;s the ONLY shadow primer that actually works on my oily skin. I wish UD would come out with a face primer in this formula. It&#x27;s not a drugstore-priced item, but it does go a LONG way, and if you use it daily you MIGHT have to buy it as often as 3 times/year. I currently purchase it only twice/year.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 years and I will keep repurchasing. Reccommend!! get it</li>
            <li> This little bottle is worth every penny. You put it on under your eyeshadow and it keeps it in place for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I love urban decay and the eyeshadow primer will not disappoint. I couldnt really understand the reason for there being different shads so i just went with the normal primer and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is truly the best eyeshadow primer out there.  I&#x27;ve tried many and keep coming back to this one becuase it lasts all day and works very well.</li>
            <li> I love this primer! My cream eyeshadow used to crease and look like crap after several hours. Now with the primer, it lasts all day. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even bother putting eye makeup on without this. Great deal! Package arrived quickly and works as good as a purchase made from the mall.</li>
            <li> finally, no need to try any other brand for the eyeshadow primer potion. As its the best and i will recommend to my fds.</li>
            <li> I love this product but this one that I ordered was bad. It was either out dated or the company had one of those moments of a bad batch. But this rating is on this particular item (it was greasy and worked as a concealer rather than a primer). Urban Decay Primer is the best out there.</li>
            <li> My Daughter Loves it will buy again. great product enjoys the color and the easy use of the tube. Good job</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear eyeshadow it always collects in the crease of my eyelid.  This primer stops it 100% (as it is supposed to).  Even better though - I wear a super black gel eyeliner sometimes and a super black mascara all the time.  I often find that if I sweat or get a little oily at all on my eyelids the eyeliner or mascara kind of smear onto the top part of my eyelid where the lash line skims the skin.  If I use this primer before applying the mascara or liner it stays in place with no smudge problems at all.  Win!</li>
            <li> I use urban decay primer and love the results, but this one cannot be authentic.  My shadow was creasing and running all day.</li>
            <li> Item was recieved already used.  It had the actual primer around the tube inside plus it doesn&#x27;t even seem like the real Urban Decay stuff.  Definitely DOES NOT work the way it should.  Will never buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff... It&#x27;s like superglue for your eye shadow. My make up will last at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I abosloutly LOVE this primer!!! Its very weightless, doesnt crease, and stays on. It said it would deliver on August 16-August 21 and it came a day earlier than the minimum time!!  The only problem i had with this is that it had barely any formula in it!! If I knew it had this much in it, I would not have bought it.  Everything else was great though!</li>
            <li> I wish somebody had addressed this issue very clearly a little sooner so I wasn&#x27;t forced to experiment.  Shadow Insurance simply doesn&#x27;t last as long.  If you work an 8 hour day and go straight home, it&#x27;s no big deal.  I can tell the difference at about 10 hours, when Shadow Insurance starts to crease.  When I know in advance that I have to work a 12+ hour day, I always reach for UD Primer Potion.  After 14 hours at the office, when my eyes are bloodshot and my pressed powder is a wreck, my eyeshadow still looks fine.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and primarily do makeup for weddings.  Urban Decay&#x27;s Eye shadow primer really stays put and is an excellent neutral color for most skin tones.  It sticks so well in fact, that when I apply it to my hand first to dap on the eye, I have a difficult time removing it off the back of my hand. However, if you are looking for a primer with some color, I prefer Mac Cosmetics&#x27; Paint Pots.</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow primer because it actually DOES THE JOB!.. My eye shadow never creases , wears off or looks cakey even in 90 degree heat. We had a huge heat wave here and after several hours in the heat and humidity my eye shadow still looked flawless thanks to UD primer potion. I wont use anything else.</li>
            <li> You should never use eye shadow without putting this on first. It is amazing what a difference it makes. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this primer! I will never buy any other brand from now on. My eyeshadow lasts all day long, even though I have oily lids, and live here in humid South Florida!</li>
            <li> This product is a must have. I put on my makeup at 6:30 am and go work.  Approximately at 7 pm when I get home, my makeup looks just as it did at 6:30 am.  I even when further in testing this product, it was to good to be true, so after my work hours I when to my spinning class  without removing my eyeshadow and when I arrive home my eyeshadow was intact.  Amazing! I am telling you, this product  is incredible.  Sometimes when I truly like how my make up looks, I go to sleep without removing my eyeshadow and next day my eye shadow is exactly as it was when I first put it.  Girls trust me this is a must have product.  Try it, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I am going to school for professional makeup artistry and though I may not be a pro yet I am working like one. Having tried a different brands I have to say I was very surprised by this product. This product is phenomenal! It really makes the eye shadow pop and stay on so much better than anything else out there. I now keep all the colors in my kit Really can not say enough about it. Buy it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> An ulta store recently opened where i live and i recently bought this eye primer this past weekend. tried it out today and let me just say, IT&#x27;S AWESOME! it gives the shadow excellent staying power and intensifises the color, too. plus, this is the first urban decay product i bought.</li>
            <li> this is one of my most Favorite Eye shadow Primer. I can wear this All Day and holds my Eye shadows with out coming off till I wash them off. there is No Eye shadow Creasing or Cracks. it can not be beat by the Cold or in the Heat. what I think is kinda neat.</li>
            <li> I thought it was pricey but splurged.  It does keep my eye makeup on longer, especially when I put my Clinique cream eye wear on top of it and then my powder accent color on top of that.  I have sensitive skin and was not allergic.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it works very well. My eye make-up stays on great and does not smear the way it used to</li>
            <li> I have used this eyeshadow primer for a while now and it is AMAZING! I will never use a different one. It makes even the cheapest eyeshadows stay on beautifully. Lasts all day without creases. This bottle makes it even better! I had the original one and the container started cracking in a few spots so this makes it even better. I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> I thought my eyeshadow would stay at least until noon, and nothingn! It didn&#x27;t last.  Not worth it in oily skins.</li>
            <li> love spoiling myself with the little extras when it comes to face products.  this is a nice product for keeping make-up in place for the day.</li>
            <li> Being a gal with oily skin, my eyeshadow needs a heavy duty primer in order to stay pretty. I&#x27;ve heard Urban Decay PP being thrown around by so many Guru&#x27;s I just had to give in and try it for myself. Luckily I ordered this along with my Shany eyeshadow palette, so I could really experiment. I wish I would have ordered a different shade than original, so I could get some coverage on my lids. This primer does increase the life of my eyeshadow, but I have a problem with it creasing extremely quickly. I do have some pretty oily skin, but I use a foundation directed towards absorbing oil so I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s not working for me. I use a decent amount also, about half the size of a pencil eraser (not the cap kind lol!) I wish I&#x27;d be lucky like some other reviewers and have it stay all night! It does a great job at helping shadow stand out, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth $15 for something that creases on me :[ Shipping took longer than my previous orders and when I opened the tube it seemed like it was only 1/2 full?</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!! A little of this goes a LOOOOONG way! Anytime I&#x27;m doing BIG looks for a night out, or just want a single shadow to stay in place, THIS IS MY GO TO!</li>
            <li> love it great product easy to use made colorlook better Urban decay has great products love the naked pallet also</li>
            <li> I caved and bought this primer yesterday at an ULTA store.  I was a little leery because it was sort of expensive, but I used it last night and...I will never use anything else!!  My eyeshadow hasn&#x27;t budged in over 13 hours.  I am used to waking up if I forget to take my eyeshadow off and having it faded and smudged all over with ugly lines.  Not today!  LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> Bought it because natalie dee said it worked. And she was correct, it works like a charm, I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would keep everything in place :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  It lasts forevern - a little bit goes a long way!  It makes my eye colors pop and blend easily.  I have very oily eyelids and this keeps my shadow from creasing and keeps my eye color looking fresh all day (even in the hot Georgia weather!)</li>
            <li> very nice color and goes on smoothly. When I first used it it felt like there was only about half the product in the tube. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have used several different eye shadow primers and this is one of my favorites.  I would purchase this again.  It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  I use this every single day.  I have somewhat oily skin and I work out at the end of the day.  Despite all the sweating, my eyeliner and eye shadow are exactly where they started.</li>
            <li> I have been using the urban decay eyeshadow primer for over a year now, and I have to say it was one of my best purchases. While recently ordering several different items over amazon, I decided to just buy this product here. That was a very poor mistake. Not only when I was scrolling through the items did I initially think I purchased it for MUCH cheaper than I had (20 dollars for this- HIGHLY overpriced. Though I like the product so I can overlook it), but the seller sent a very unprofessional letter with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins with refund instructions, which is well enough for those who cannot figure out how to go through amazon, but it leads into a plead of not leaving negative feedback and a threat against &#x27;competitors who buy 2 leave negative&#x27; (feedback) with various grammatical and spelling errors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am normally not a stickler for these things when it comes to casual emails or exchanges, however, if I am paying for something from someone I expect them to act professionally and behave as if they are conducting legitimate business. I would be lieu to ask for a refund from someone who displays such a guise of ineptitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these things can be overlooked, it still made me cringe and I will not be purchasing anything from this seller ever again.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. i use it all the time and it is great at creating a smooth base for your eye makeup. i would recommend the urban decay makeup setting spray, also.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but the one I received from this vendor was dried up, and almost not usable. I had to shake it, and mush it around till it became even close to what it should feel like.  I use this product on a regular basis. Either it was not stored correctly, or it was too old.</li>
            <li> I SWEAR BY THIS STUFF!! I bought this container over a year ago and there is still more of it in the tube!! It lasts such a long time, which makes it worth the money, and it works so well at keeping eyeliner and eyeshadow in place!! I&#x27;m not a huge makeup person, but I dab a little of this on my eyelid before eyeliner and a little eyeshadow and it will stay in place the whole day! This is my favorite primer!</li>
            <li> I had a trial tube that a friend gave me that worked wonderfully and lasted all day. I have used my new bottle several times an noticed that the effect does not last as long. It still works just not as well. I would rather they focus on the product rather than changing the appearance.</li>
            <li> I asked my mom to buy this when she was on vacation because they don&#x27;t sell this where I live. I told my mom about this product and told how much I loved it but I have used the  one that I got with my Naked palette. My mom was amazed by how much I loved this stuff so she bought one for her too and told her friend about this and she bought one for herself. My mom loves this stuff. We never used a primer before because we haven&#x27;t seen them here where we live and the eyeshadow gets very ugly by the end of the day if we don&#x27;t use this. Now my mom uses this everyday because she always wears eyeshadow while I only wear it on special occasions. We can&#x27;t live without this stuff and the eyeshadow looks great all day. My mom bought this at Sephora but maybe we&#x27;ll buy this from amazon later when the tube is finished. This lasts for a very long time since you only use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I have heard alot of great reviews about this product. And i was really excited about it when i ordered it here. But when i tried it i was extremly shock!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cover well and it is sticky&lt;br /&gt;if i can give it less than one star rating i would pleasingly</li>
            <li> Not really impressed. It&#x27;s too small and hard to get it all out of the tube. I&#x27;ve switched to Coastal Scents primer which is just as good as Urban Decay but costs considerably less and is easier to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
            <li> The best primer ever. This primer makes whole brands name for me. I purchase other Urban Decay items because I believe after this primer everything would be the best. As I&#x60;m makeup artist this product makes half of my work</li>
            <li> I just love it . This is my second bottle and the first one has lasted me for 7 months so far.And still have some in the tube. All you need is just a little.With out this my eye liner and eye shadow would only last for a few hours. with the Primer they stay on all day. Also I have oily skin and oily eye lids with the primer on, everything stays on.  I just love the stuff.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to help your eyeshadow stay beautiful and vibrant all day long, this is the stuff!  I&#x27;ve tried other eye primers and always end up disappointed and coming back to my beloved Urban Decay primer potion.  I use both the original and &#x27;sin&#x27; versions and love them both!</li>
            <li> How did I ever live without this????  I tried Mary Kay eye primer years ago and it was a huge waste.  Sadly, I thought all eye primers were the same and went on with my life.  At age 40 I decided to give this a try and LOVE IT!  It goes on smooth, requires very little and dries quickly.  Best of all, my eye shadow stays put till I take it off at night!  Halfway through the day I am taken back at my own reflection, because I look GOOD~ not like the mother of a 2 year old who is tired, but fresh and put together!  A little pricey for me, but worth every penny as it makes me feel good to see myself this way!!!</li>
            <li> I recently caved in and bought Urban Decay eyeshadow primer and I am now kicking myself for waiting so long! It&#x27;s amazing and my eyeshadow and liner last ALL day long. Make sure your lids are moisturized before using, that would be my only real tip. The first time I used it I hadn&#x27;t used my eye cream (and I am not wrinkly, just seasonal dry skin for a 34 year old) and I noticed that the primer went on a lot smoother the 2nd time I tried it after I had moisturized properly. I worked a 10 hour day at the office and went directly to the gym for an hour-long Zumba class and I while the rest of my face/hair looked wrecked after my work out..lo and behold, my eyeshadow and eye makeup was firmly in place! It also makes eyeshadow colors true and intense. Definitely would recommend this as a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; in your make up routine.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this primer I was using MAC Paintpot or their Shadestick to assist with the longevity of my eyeshadow.  However, the most I was able to reach with either product tipped the scales at 6hrs before creasing set in.  Then I stepped outside the choke hold MAC had over me to try this product. Winning!! My eyeshadow began to last from dawn to dusk back to dawn again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few months since I purchased this product &amp; I&#x27;ve done lots of silly tests just to prove this primers love to me.  I&#x27;ve dressed it up with smokey eyeshadow and took it into the shower...it never left my side. I&#x27;ve put on sassy, bright colors and went to the club, danced all the over the floor and woke up the next day with my peepers still intact!  I&#x27;ve even...(this is when I knew we would never part)...worn it to the sunny beach and it didn&#x27;t budge.  No silly, it wasn&#x27;t a face full of makeup; it was simply a pop of turquoise liquid liner to match my bathing suit. Either way, the seashells may have moved but that darn turquoise liner stayed put!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been really frustrated with eyeshadow because it always clumps up with the oils in my eye. I had tried homemade, cheap remedies for this, but spending money on this product is totally worth it. Accept no imitations!!</li>
            <li> My eye make-up does not even smudge with this on! This a must have if you love a long lasting shawdow no matter what the shawdow brand is!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing primer- lightweight, goes on smoothly without caking or bleeding, and lasts forever! I live in a humid environment and my makeup would literally melt off without this primer. it is pricy, but worth very penny! It even looks good worn by itself. Once you try it, you&#x27;ll never put on eyeshadow without it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product many times and I have loved the product in the past.  It was the only eye primer that I found that did not let your eye shadow crease,  However the last time I bought the product the tube had been redesigned, and did not have a brush applicator.  It had a tip to squirt  out the product .  My eye makeup smears and I am very unhappy  with  the product. I will not buy this product again  unless I can find the old formula.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have tried that works great for oily eyelids! I have used just about every eyelid primer out there and this one really works for me! The only complaints I have, are for the first hour that I have the primer on my eyelids they itch a little but then the itching goes away. And it is quite expensive.&lt;br /&gt;So if you have greasy eyelids that crease your eyeshadows, this one is a winner!</li>
            <li> I have had VERY oily skin all my life and this is a must for me every day! My eye shadow will last all nite -no exceptions! Even if not wearing shadow your eyelids will remain soft &amp; dry ;)</li>
            <li> This makes all eyeshadow stay on and look good!  I use glitter glue over it, but my shadow still won&#x27;t stay on great without it.  I have tried other primers, but none are like this.  Don&#x27;t settle.  Plus, it lasts like six months!</li>
