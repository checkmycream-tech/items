            <li>I am thrilled with my new Croc.</li>
            <li>I had to clean it up and give it AS A GIFT like that.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this to me and he was definitely right!</li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron for both my daughter and I to use and we both love it!  </li>
            <li>I expected just a good flatiron</li>
            <li>You can use it on dry hair and it will STILL leave you with amazing results.</li>
            <li>My first one is three years old and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>VERY fast  </li>
            <li>The first one broke when I dropped it on the floor.  </li>
            <li>like I did the first two</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>It also works even better on dry hair, but I used it on damp hair as well.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and keeps it straight even in humid weather!!</li>
            <li>straight.</li>
            <li>It cost too much money for the amount of use I got from it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have really wavy hair</li>
            <li>good for thick hair  </li>
            <li>The Better Business Bureau should be aware of Quick E Shops deceptive sales tactics and Croc/Turbo ION, Inc.&#x27;s, failure to honor its warranty knowing the consumer has no way of establishing which companies are \\&quot;authorized dealers\\&quot;, especially through the Internet.</li>
            <li>Amazon should take action to remove companies such as Quick E Shop that sell defective products and are not authorized dealers of the product.  </li>
            <li>Was not sure at first with the Wet to Dry, but love, love this Croc</li>
            <li>The manufacture replaced it with a new one.  </li>
            <li>I was told that these unauthorized dealers often sell defective or refurbished units as new to unsuspecting consumers.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not like I could return and get a NEW one in time.</li>
            <li>it goes up to 450 degrees and heats up v fast, it works on wet hair ..  but u&#x27;re nt supposed to iron ur hair right after you get out from the shower</li>
            <li>This is not to say that someone with less hair and finer hair, couldnt do just fine with it.    </li>
            <li>the exact same item!</li>
            <li>up&amp;#34; on the top of our hair during the day like would happen with other flat irons.  </li>
            <li>I am caucasian woman with wavy hair, I had to turn the iron very very high just to get it to straighten properly.</li>
            <li>My old one had shiny plates.  </li>
            <li>It was in a box that was old looking and it had lint and rubbish in the box.</li>
            <li>It is professional quality results.</li>
            <li>It gets hot super fast and has cut down my ironing time in half.</li>
            <li>Great flat iron but got the wrong one twice and returned it twice.  </li>
            <li>I love it when it&#x27;s working, but I&#x27;ve had too many problems with them breaking.  :(</li>
            <li>I ordered the above item and received a different hot iron.</li>
            <li>on/off buttton easily gets turned off when styling  -Too thin for large amounts of hair  -Not</li>
            <li>I placed through Amazon with \\&quot;Quick E Shop\\&quot; for a Croc Classic Ceramic Wet to Dry Flat Iron on 4/19/12.  </li>
            <li>when I straighten out my entire hair (which I like to let air dry first if I have time)</li>
            <li>I could even understand if I had used it regularly over the year, but I only wear my hair straight occasionally (4-5 times a year for about a week at a time).</li>
            <li>This is the second croc classic flat iron i&#x27;ve had and they both stop working around the 1 year mark.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention my daughter who is half African American has very thick coarse hair and this is the best straightening iron I have ever used on her hair and it takes me half the time it use to with our old straightening iron.</li>
            <li>The size is super small for lots of hair.  </li>
            <li>Normally with my other flat iron I would have to go over my hair a couple times but with this one I only go over it once and its straight.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and I&#x27;ve tried several different types of straighteners.  </li>
            <li>-Soft handle  -Long cord  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always have time for my hair to fully dry and that&#x27;s why I first purchased the Croc wet to dry.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your hair or ends like traditional flat irons.</li>

            <li> It does not dry out your hair or ends like traditional flat irons.</li>
            <li> I have owned 3 of this same flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I should have to buy a new one every year for $100 each time, especially since i used it about a few times a month anyway.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron just over a year ago and used it infrequently.</li>
            <li> I turn on the flat iron</li>
            <li> The plates on this one are a flat silver.  </li>
            <li> I had to blow dry first or go over small amounts 5-6 times before it became dry and flat.  </li>
            <li> i like it,but the temperature it takes a long time before stop the 450 degree...</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this iron, not going for any other brand after this...</li>
            <li> I scraped to save the $75 to buy this item and am left extremely unsatisfied and dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I know that sounds silly, but it feels like these plates don&#x27;t straighten quite as well or they pull my hair a little more or something.  </li>
            <li> your hair doesn&#x27;t have to be just wet in order to use this flat iron.</li>
            <li> to dry thing did not work.  </li>
            <li> to dry didnt work    </li>
            <li> It also helps to not have to blow dry</li>
            <li> It is so gentle on my hair, as my hair is thin and fragile.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about purchasing it due to the malfunction reviews but the price was low enough to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I also like how you can set the temperature and use it when your hair is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> my hair - having a wet to dry saves me time.  </li>
            <li> That one finally stopped working on me the other day, after about a year and a half of using it 0-3 times per week.  </li>
            <li> The wet</li>
            <li> -wet</li>
            <li> some other irons leave.</li>
            <li> I thought there was something wrong with the first one</li>
            <li> just dry it with a towel or wait a little while after you got from the shower, have some mercy on ur hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from Elephant Steals, I mean Deals, and only used it twice before it quit working.</li>
            <li> Tamed my wild curls and very thick hair faster then my hairdresser can!</li>
            <li> That one stopped working within a few months - it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago it stopped heating up past the start temperature of 280 degrees.</li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t straighten my hair often it was past the 2 week return policy.</li>
            <li> We both have thick hair and this works like a charm, it even tames it so that neither of us has any stray hairs &amp;#34;pop</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a bad idea, no need to blow dry ...</li>
            <li> Horrible straightner- wet to dry</li>
            <li> Item doesn&#x27;t work, I never used because of  problems, It shows an error when plug in and immediately shuts down, really bad inversion</li>
            <li> I received a call from a Croc service representative advising me that they were unable to repair the unit, because it was defective and incredulously, would not replace the unit, because I did not purchase the item through an \\&quot;authorized dealer\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It is the wrong item.</li>
            <li> or they get crazy.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and am not sure what to do about this.  </li>
            <li> I hate this iron.  </li>
            <li> Highly disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will not purchase another!</li>

            <li> Works amazing. I have the thickest most untameable hair imaginable and this can get it PIN straight. I will never use anything else again!! Works best on dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist suggested this iron and I absolutely love it. It is smooth and does not snag your hair. It gets hot super fast and has cut down my ironing time in half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a magic touch.heat up fast  and safe for for the hands it gives best results as i expected of it</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and I&#x27;ve tried several different types of straighteners.  This one, by far, has been the best I&#x27;ve tried.  It makes my hair soft and keeps it straight even in humid weather!! I also like how you can set the temperature and use it when your hair is wet or dry.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for both my daughter and I to use and we both love it!  We both have thick hair and this works like a charm, it even tames it so that neither of us has any stray hairs &amp;#34;pop up&amp;#34; on the top of our hair during the day like would happen with other flat irons.  My hairdresser recommended this to me and he was definitely right!</li>
            <li> LLLOOOOVVVVEEEE MY CROC!!!!  Perfect, efficient and worth every cent....and more!  You will not regret buying this product.....I promise you that.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recomended this product.  I have think wavy hair and a lot of it.  I had a HAI  ceramic and it worked great, but i dropped it, so i though i would upgrade. I hate this iron.  The size is super small for lots of hair.  The wet to dry thing did not work.  I had to blow dry first or go over small amounts 5-6 times before it became dry and flat.  This product almost trippled my styling time!  I wasnt satisfied at all.  This is not to say that someone with less hair and finer hair, couldnt do just fine with it.    CONS:  -the on/off buttton easily gets turned off when styling  -Too thin for large amounts of hair  -Not good for thick hair  -wet to dry didnt work    PROS:  -Soft handle  -Long cord  -Heats VERY fast  -makes hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. Normally with my other flat iron I would have to go over my hair a couple times but with this one I only go over it once and its straight. Not to mention my daughter who is half African American has very thick coarse hair and this is the best straightening iron I have ever used on her hair and it takes me half the time it use to with our old straightening iron. Plus when I am in a hurry and just want to touch up my hair it takes like 30 seconds to heat up!!! I have been recommending it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Horrible straightner- wet to dry never worked for me. I am caucasian woman with wavy hair, I had to turn the iron very very high just to get it to straighten properly. Also, had to return the product before I ever used it bc I dropped it and the plate fell out of iron. Highly disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with my new Croc. I expected just a good flatiron but it is outstanding. I have never been really good at styling and with the first use it was like my hair stylist had done it. She was the one who recommended it to me. It&#x27;s quick, easy and perfect for the average woman who needs the best equipment available. 5 stars isn&#x27;t enough!</li>
            <li> i like it,but the temperature it takes a long time before stop the 450 degree...</li>
            <li> This is my third croc and I have hooked my daughter and sister on them.  My first one is three years old and still going strong.  I keep one at our cottage,  one at home,  and one for emergencies!</li>
            <li> Good while it lasted. I bought this flat iron just over a year ago and used it infrequently. I liked it because I could skip the blow drying step when straightening my hair. When it worked, the results were great: soft and shiny hair that didn&#x27;t have that burnt smell some other irons leave. A few weeks ago it stopped heating up past the start temperature of 280 degrees. I didn&#x27;t drop it, bang it, or otherwise damage it or the power cord. I could even understand if I had used it regularly over the year, but I only wear my hair straight occasionally (4-5 times a year for about a week at a time). One day it could heat up to 420 degrees and the next day it couldn&#x27;t. It cost too much money for the amount of use I got from it.</li>
            <li> This is the second croc classic flat iron i&#x27;ve had and they both stop working around the 1 year mark.  I ordered in december of &#x27;13 and it stopped working as of december &#x27;14.  I thought there was something wrong with the first one so i bought another because when it works, its great.  I turn on the flat iron and then it turns off.  It just doesn&#x27;t stay on.  I should have to buy a new one every year for $100 each time, especially since i used it about a few times a month anyway.  I am very disappointed and am not sure what to do about this.  I&#x27;m hoping the manufacturer will be able to help me with the problem.</li>
            <li> Best product! It does not dry out your hair or ends like traditional flat irons. My hair is beyond silky and it last until I decide to wash it off..Totally recommend it. It also works even better on dry hair, but I used it on damp hair as well.</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this iron, not going for any other brand after this... it goes up to 450 degrees and heats up v fast, it works on wet hair ..  but u&#x27;re nt supposed to iron ur hair right after you get out from the shower, it&#x27;s just a bad idea, no need to blow dry ... just dry it with a towel or wait a little while after you got from the shower, have some mercy on ur hair!</li>
            <li> Love the Croc products!!</li>
            <li> Was not sure at first with the Wet to Dry, but love, love this Croc</li>
            <li> I have owned 3 of this same flat iron.  The first one broke when I dropped it on the floor.  I loved how it worked, so I bought another one.  That one stopped working within a few months - it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  The manufacture replaced it with a new one.  That one finally stopped working on me the other day, after about a year and a half of using it 0-3 times per week.  I love it when it&#x27;s working, but I&#x27;ve had too many problems with them breaking.  :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from Elephant Steals, I mean Deals, and only used it twice before it quit working. Because I don&#x27;t straighten my hair often it was past the 2 week return policy. The seller would not exchange or even inspect the damaged item. I took very good care of it (never been wet or dropped) so I feel that the reason it quit working is an internal malfunction that was of no fault of mine. I scraped to save the $75 to buy this item and am left extremely unsatisfied and dissapointed. Of course some American business is screwing me. Everyone is out for themselves including Elephant Steals.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron but got the wrong one twice and returned it twice.  Will be buying it at a store.</li>
            <li> Item doesn&#x27;t work, I never used because of  problems, It shows an error when plug in and immediately shuts down, really bad inversion&lt;br /&gt;and it cost me a lot of money, not even think it doesn&#x27;t have manufactory guarantee....</li>
            <li> I researched a while before buying the Croc.  I love it. It is so gentle on my hair, as my hair is thin and fragile.  It also helps to not have to blow dry my hair - having a wet to dry saves me time.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Tamed my wild curls and very thick hair faster then my hairdresser can! Great to use on damp hair and saves from all the blow drying damage.</li>
            <li> The plates on this one are a flat silver.  My old one had shiny plates.  I know that sounds silly, but it feels like these plates don&#x27;t straighten quite as well or they pull my hair a little more or something.  Still a great product.</li>
            <li> I placed through Amazon with \\&quot;Quick E Shop\\&quot; for a Croc Classic Ceramic Wet to Dry Flat Iron on 4/19/12.  Four months later in August 2012, the heating element ceased operating and the device stopped working.  I kept the original box and one year warranty for the product.  I followed the instructions according to the warranty and returned the defective unit to Croc/Turbo Ion Inc., located at 6800 8th Street, Buena Park, CA 90620, and requested a replacement.  I received a call from a Croc service representative advising me that they were unable to repair the unit, because it was defective and incredulously, would not replace the unit, because I did not purchase the item through an \\&quot;authorized dealer\\&quot;.  I was told that these unauthorized dealers often sell defective or refurbished units as new to unsuspecting consumers.  I purchased this item in good faith using Amazon to help me locate the best deal. Amazon should take action to remove companies such as Quick E Shop that sell defective products and are not authorized dealers of the product.  This was deceptive practice.  I had no way of knowing what companies were authorized dealers. To be blunt - It all sounds like a bunch of crock to me!  The Better Business Bureau should be aware of Quick E Shops deceptive sales tactics and Croc/Turbo ION, Inc.&#x27;s, failure to honor its warranty knowing the consumer has no way of establishing which companies are \\&quot;authorized dealers\\&quot;, especially through the Internet. Croc/Turbo ION and Amazon should be pro-actively policing and eliminating any unauthorized dealers and not laying blame on the consumer.  I will think twice before using Amazon&#x27;s service again:(&lt;br /&gt; Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Theresa Murphy Sweeney</li>
            <li> Works great heats up quickly, my hair is smooth and feels silky. I would recomend this product to anyone looking for that at salon at home look!!</li>
            <li> It is the wrong item. I ordered the above item and received a different hot iron.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this flat iron. I love it!! I have really wavy hair and I HAVE TO straighten my bangs out every day or they get crazy. I don&#x27;t always have time for my hair to fully dry and that&#x27;s why I first purchased the Croc wet to dry. It instantly dries them while straightening them out at the same time. Just remember to use some sort of hair heat protectant any time you use anything with heat on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when I straighten out my entire hair (which I like to let air dry first if I have time) it leaves it silky smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;So your hair doesn&#x27;t have to be just wet in order to use this flat iron. You can use it on dry hair and it will STILL leave you with amazing results. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive my item, which was a gift, like I did the first two I bought- the exact same item! It was in a box that was old looking and it had lint and rubbish in the box. I had to clean it up and give it AS A GIFT like that. I&#x27;m in hawaii so it&#x27;s not like I could return and get a NEW one in time. Very disappointed and will not purchase another!</li>
            <li> I use this in my salon. I was a little nervous about purchasing it due to the malfunction reviews but the price was low enough to give it a shot. It is professional quality results. Been using for about 2 months.</li>
