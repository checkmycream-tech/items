            <li>I went to a beauty supply near my home, because I was so excited to finally find one of buffers from my childhood, and their Chamois buffer was far nicer, very padded and worked great.</li>
            <li>and I have not been able to find this type locally.</li>
            <li>I use the Solar oil first.  </li>
            <li>I do believe the positive comments because I have tried these before.</li>
            <li>This really buffs my nails to a pretty decent shine.</li>
            <li>works better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Nothing to very over though.</li>
            <li>and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that I can buff as often as I want without damaging the nails like other buffers</li>
            <li>I have gad other buffers that did a better job.  </li>
            <li>Used with the Supernail buffing cream gave me a decent shine.</li>
            <li>it had buffed them to a high gloss.  </li>
            <li>It smooths her nails with a little effort and it is a worthwhile use of time.</li>
            <li>I love this as it takes up little space</li>

            <li>However, so far the product works.  </li>
            <li>makes my nails very shiny and it lasts way longer than a regular buffer.</li>
            <li>The cloth is definitely on the thin side, but better to have this buffer than no buffer!</li>
            <li>This buffer is exactly what a wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>Next time I will order a smaller length since 7&amp;#34; is longer than I really need.</li>

            <li> I was disappointed to have been so excited and then left feeling flat since the buffer was rather flat, not as the picture shows.</li>
            <li> You use just a little buffing cream and start rubbing the buffer back and forth over your nails.</li>

            <li> I can buff away at one thumb nail for 5 minutes, hold it up to the other unbuffed thumb nail</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this buffer would give them at least a little luster, but</li>
            <li> Just a velour cloth that does very little.</li>
            <li> I am almost wondering if mine arrived dull.</li>
            <li> Not a good quality buffer</li>
            <li> The chamois is of very poor quality and became useless after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable to hold when using.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  </li>

            <li> Product was what I expected.  Good quality and great addition to tools for nail care.  Woks well with buffing cream.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. It smooths her nails with a little effort and it is a worthwhile use of time. The nails come out very smoth and clean.</li>
            <li> Works so great with nail buffing cream....why bother with polish.</li>
            <li> Super nice.  Keep it next to my bed and use it with a buffing cream and cuticle moisturizer.  My natural nails look like a french manicure.</li>
            <li> The nail buffer leaves a beautiful high gloss on my nails and can&#x27;t be ruined or chipped the way nail polish can.  It&#x27;s easy to use while watching television, so there is no time used waiting for anything to dry,  Great product.</li>
            <li> I use this buffer about once a week.  I use the Solar oil first.  When the nail absorbs most of the oil, I buff with the buffer.  You get a nice sheen on the nails.</li>
            <li> buffers like this are hard to find, but with patience and the right powder or cream, you get beautifully shiny nails.</li>
            <li> Not a good quality buffer</li>
            <li> The quality was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> My Mother had one of these buffers back in the 1950&#x27;s. I was just a child so no nail polish for me. Instead she would buff my nails.I loved how shiny they looked and there was no chipping or peeling like some of the other girls.Now I bought this buffer and it works just like the one I remember. You use just a little buffing cream and start rubbing the buffer back and forth over your nails. Using the cream (which is a little gritty) also helps to remove the ridges that develop as I get older. It&#x27;s so easy; I just buff while watching TV doing one hand between each set of commercials. I buff about three times a week and use the buffing cream only once a week. My nails look good. Also my cuticles are looking better and feeling softer . . . I think this is because the buffing increases the circulation to my nail beds. If you&#x27;re concerned about cost the buffer will last forever and the small jar of buffing cream will last two or three years. Sure beats polish and remover costs and is healthier for your nails and hands.</li>
            <li> This product did not do what I expected. I am almost wondering if mine arrived dull. I do believe the positive comments because I have tried these before. Maybe I just received a bad batch. Nothing to very over though. It happens.</li>
            <li> This really buffs my nails to a pretty decent shine.</li>
            <li> I love this as it takes up little space and I can buff my nails as I watch t.v.  After using it once, my husband thought I had clear nail polish on but I didn&#x27;t....it had buffed them to a high gloss.  Want to buy another one to buff my nails when I need to wait at an appt., etc.</li>
            <li> Seems sturdily made, and the chamois cloth cover buffs my &#x27;french manicure&#x27; pretty well.  I&#x27;m gonna buy one for my toes too; gotta separate the feet from the hands.  It&#x27;s handy and easy to use, and the padding is nice and thick.  I use it with a buffing cream - so that I can maintain my shine!</li>
            <li> When used with a nail buffing cream, this product produces an excellent finish to my nails.</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with a nail cream, it buffs nails to a lovely shine.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t want to polish my nails, i still want them to look good.  This does the job and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> better than going to the manicure salon!</li>
            <li> I just wanted a natural shine to my nails....I don&#x27;t like polish.  I was hoping this buffer would give them at least a little luster, but no.  I can buff away at one thumb nail for 5 minutes, hold it up to the other unbuffed thumb nail and you don&#x27;t see one bit of difference.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and operate.&lt;br /&gt;Produces a very even and clean looking finish.&lt;br /&gt;The degree of shine produced is easily controllable.</li>
            <li> This buffer is exactly what a wanted and expected. Be careful not to get it wet and it should last indefinitely.</li>
            <li> Does the job! Product as described. Next time I will order a smaller length since 7&amp;#34; is longer than I really need.</li>
            <li> The workmanship on this is marginal.  However, so far the product works.  I&#x27;m curious to see how it will hold up.</li>
            <li> makes my nails very shiny and it lasts way longer than a regular buffer.</li>
            <li> Great product, super price. Will re-order from this company. I do like a great manicure.</li>
            <li> Already falling apart</li>
            <li> After using this for about 10 minutes, the cloth started to separte from the plastic. Also, it is very cheap cloth, that sheds.  I would not buy it again.</li>
