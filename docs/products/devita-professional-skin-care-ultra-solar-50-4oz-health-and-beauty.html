    <ol>
            <li>This works great for us!    </li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer with SPF, I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has the best rating for safety in sunscreens from the ewg.org website.</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Was impressed with the size of this product and the texture.</li>
            <li>Until then, I am on another search for the perfect face lotion.</li>
            <li>A great moisturizer with the added benefit of nontoxic sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Devita Ultra solar SPF 50 sunscreen for years and was extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>I feel good about putting this on my face.  </li>
            <li>Its like food for the skin; everything in this product is good for it.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be a good deal - getting 4 oz</li>
            <li>So - I no longer think this was a good deal at all, and this isn&#x27;t even what I wanted</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing -</li>
            <li>Thanks to information on Environmental Working Group website, [...], I found this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>Devita does make great products though, and their regular solar moisturizer is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I loved this stuff more than any moisturizer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased :)</li>
            <li>More of a sunscreen than an intense moisturizer, this still seems like the best all in one I have tried.</li>
            <li>, how clean it felt, and how good it smelled.    </li>
            <li>The first one (3 years ago) was great.</li>
            <li>It seems like a fine cream and not sunscreen at all!     </li>
            <li>This one was my favorite of the five.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve gotten more freckles with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but am not a fan of the pump container.  </li>
            <li>Works as described, like the pump style bottle top and would buy again.  </li>
            <li>I do however, prefer the tinting sunscreen better for my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I love devita&#x27;s products and use many of them.  </li>
            <li>It does not sting my sensitive skin, moisturizes beautifully</li>
            <li>Kept my skin moist but never oily all day long and provided excellent sun protection.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on - non-greasy  </li>
            <li>I am in my 60&#x27;s with rosacea type skin that burns easily.  </li>
            <li>Nice gentle smell (not   Blocks the sun</li>
            <li>so happy I found a sunscreen FINALLY.  </li>
            <li>I had really planned for it to be my sunscreen for shoulders and arms, but I got the jar and put some on my face, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>- i wanted something titanium dioxide free.    </li>
            <li>that it goes on smooth without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly without being greasy and can be used under make-up.  </li>
            <li>yet it was so smooth and light</li>
            <li>This to me seems very strange since the version shown here proudly advertised being titanium dioxide free.    </li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and smooth--makes me want to put MORE on, I love this stuff--smells great, absorbs quickly, nothing white, sticky or oily about it.     </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, prone to breakouts with any kind of oil, greasy product, or fragrance on my face (even in my hair).  </li>
            <li>I like this line of products because they use quality ingredients and physical sun blockers, but now I am on the hunt for a good sunblock once again...</li>
            <li>does a super job of protecting the skin from the sun.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>(my husband is SUPER pale and this works great for him)    </li>
            <li>This sunscreen has all natural safe ingredients, is a very high SPF, goes on clear (no whitish residue), and is very light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Mexoryl, nano zinc, titanium dioxide, clear zinc--I used Badger for quite a while on my arms and shoulders, and I liked how organic and natural it was.</li>
            <li>As someone with extremely fair and extremely sensitive skin, this was the only sunscreen/moisturizer I used on my face since the day I discovered it.  </li>
            <li>It will continue to be my facial sunblock until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve found another physical sunscreen I like better:</li>
            <li>It is not perfect, so I am still searching for the perfect one, but it gets pretty close to perfection.</li>
            <li>I have found that making sure I am thoroughly moisturized before application has helped immensely</li>
            <li>Light enough to wear under make-up and nice enough to wear alone.</li>
            <li>High SPF, but went on smooth and completely invisible with no sunscreen smell.  </li>
            <li>Not gritty, not opaque, not stinky, washes off easily.</li>
            <li>but it comes in a large container, and</li>
            <li>nice, no white case...when you first put it on, it may seem as if it would but keep rubbing and remove the white stuff.&lt;br /&gt;prevents</li>
            <li>I have to apply pure shea butter to my whole face</li>
            <li>At first I thought it might be that I applied moisturizer underneath it, but it does the same thing, even on a freshly clean face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that DeVita Ultra Solar SPF 50 is a huge improvement over their SPF30 facial sunscreen lotion</li>
            <li>Finishes going on light and leaves NO white residue.</li>
            <li>There is no greasy feeling at ALL (unusual for a sunscreen), it hydrates, and does not clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works very well.</li>
            <li>I use the LaRoche-Posay Toleriane products (only the Gentle dermo cleanser and soothing protective lotion work for me - other products in their line have caused clogging), Retin-A, and now this beautiful sunscreen to keep my skin protected and moisturized daily.</li>
            <li>Unsure of this particular Devita product, but Devita seems to rate really well on the EWG website.</li>
            <li>I bought my first jar from a professional skin care salon.  </li>
            <li>(I use straight blueberry oil), and on top of that, you have to apply to only one *section of your face at a time in quick sweeping motions, just enough to work it in, then leave it be and move on to the next section.&lt;br /&gt;(*cheek1, cheek 2, forehead, chin, nose, neck side1, neck side2,</li>
            <li>Otherwise, when I apply it well, it works as a great primer for makeup, doesn&#x27;t have a white cast like I experienced with a lot of other (more) expensive brands, and actually helps me retain moisture, probably due to the aloe, glycerin, and Haluronic Acid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I  will order it again in a few months to see if Devita fixes the formulation.  </li>
            <li>it could be used as a daily moisturizer without the greasiness and white cast of most sunblocks.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I needed high sun protection.  </li>
            <li>this high that works with my skin type</li>
            <li>This used to be my go-to sunscreen because it has high SPF protection</li>
            <li>I had ordered five new sunscreens based on the new quidelines from EWG.</li>
            <li>The new formula was pasty and would not rub in.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product thinking it was titanium dioxide free, similar to the the regular Devita solar moisturizer.    </li>
            <li>The instructions say to apply every 90 minutes (ridiculous)... who has that kind of time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It pills up and rolls off of your face if you try to rub it in too much, or if you don&#x27;t apply it to your whole face at the same time.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel super dry.</li>
            <li>I am also very sensitive and my eyes usually tear up with most sunscreens, and I find I burn no matter what the number.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also noticed the first ingredient besides the zinc and titanium oxides is water versus the regular moisturizer where aloe is listed before water.  </li>
            <li>My latest order came in the pump bottle shown in the picture (rather than the usual jar) and the lotion was nothing like the old lotion.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe how soft it made my skin</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li>every &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin sunscreen out there.</li>
            <li>+ SPF around my eyes (see my review for that product) and so far, the Keys Soap brand has not stung my eyes.</li>
            <li>Its very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a white cast if applied propely.</li>
            <li>but then again i never reapplied frequently as directed because it tends to cake on and that scares me coz of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It was the same experience as another customer who described the same experience even on freshly washed skin.</li>
            <li>I had to try to clean the mess (which means I took off the SPF, basically).</li>
            <li>I am amazed by the Ultra Solar SPF 50 - it is thick and rich and very moisturizing, without feeling greasy at all, and once absorbed leaves absolutely no trace.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white with rosacea and at high risk for melanoma, so I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li>It met every requirement:  high SPF, physical block (no avobenzone)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena and Olay sunscreens (chemical sunscreens caused irritation and stinging, also clogging), Elta MD UV Clear (dried and irritated my skin), Elta MD UV Daily (sticky and greasy without feeling moisturizing, stinging, clogging), and pretty much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because there is too much zinc or titanium oxide, or whether my particular bottle was old or subjected to too much heat and thus separated, but this leaves small white particles all over my face.</li>
            <li>The second jar I bought was from Amazon and it was $15 less, a significant savings.</li>
            <li>, goes on smooth and invisible, not smelly, does not give me a rash, not crazy expensive.  </li>
            <li>Other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used would give my face a sheen and make my skin really sweaty, but not this one!</li>
            <li>Someone describes exactly the experience I had with it: as I put the cream on my face, the white residue started to transform into tiny pieces of gum (like drying your face with toilet paper).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in search of a natural sunscreen that actually blocks out sun for hours.</li>
            <li>All of my female relatives found the same issue when they bought new lotion recently</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and my skin is dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very confusing as to why they would advertise titanium dioxide free as a plus and then turn around and make a product containing it.</li>

            <li> I had a small tube of Solar Rx in my bag, but was curious to try hers, since the times I&#x27;d seen her use it, she never seemed desperate to wash her hands after applying it, and also seemed to enjoy applying it.     </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This works great for us!    PROS:  Easy to put on - non-greasy  Nice gentle smell (not   Blocks the sun (my husband is SUPER pale and this works great for him)    CONS:  A little pricey!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer with SPF, I have ever used. It provides 50 SPF, is very moisturizing and yet does not leave any of the white/chalky residue usually associated with sunblock.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s with rosacea type skin that burns easily.  I am also very sensitive and my eyes usually tear up with most sunscreens, and I find I burn no matter what the number.&lt;br /&gt; I have used one jar of ultrasolar 50 and it&#x27;s amazing - i have never burned and have no reaction to it.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 28, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last bottle i purchased left a chalky white residue and I can no longer recommend this cream.  DeVita:  are you listening?</li>
            <li> More of a sunscreen than an intense moisturizer, this still seems like the best all in one I have tried. Unsure of this particular Devita product, but Devita seems to rate really well on the EWG website. Finishes going on light and leaves NO white residue.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, prone to breakouts with any kind of oil, greasy product, or fragrance on my face (even in my hair).  I chose this because there lists none of such in the ingredients.  And I needed high sun protection.  I feel good about putting this on my face.  There is no greasy feeling at ALL (unusual for a sunscreen), it hydrates, and does not clog my pores.  Its like food for the skin; everything in this product is good for it.  Im so happy I found a sunscreen FINALLY.  Its a little expensive at $40 but it comes in a large container, and you do  not need a lot of this stuff.  I reckon it will last 2 plus months.  Very pleased :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white with rosacea and at high risk for melanoma, so I&#x27;ve tried them all. Mexoryl, nano zinc, titanium dioxide, clear zinc--I used Badger for quite a while on my arms and shoulders, and I liked how organic and natural it was. But it went on chalky, oily AND sticky. There was a lot of rubbing involved, and then washing of hands.    On my face I was using Keys Skincare Solar Rx. This was really my facial go-to sunscreen, but I preferred the feel of their regular moisturizer--the Solar Rx just feels a little tacky (sticky) and you have to rub the white away.     I can&#x27;t believe this jar of DeVita. It seems like a fine cream and not sunscreen at all!     I had really planned for it to be my sunscreen for shoulders and arms, but I got the jar and put some on my face, and it&#x27;s amazing. Makes my skin soft and smooth--makes me want to put MORE on, I love this stuff--smells great, absorbs quickly, nothing white, sticky or oily about it.     A friend turned me on to this. A few weeks ago we went to a street festival and we&#x27;re both fair-skinned and high melanoma risk, so she stopped and asked me if I want to put on some sunscreen. I had a small tube of Solar Rx in my bag, but was curious to try hers, since the times I&#x27;d seen her use it, she never seemed desperate to wash her hands after applying it, and also seemed to enjoy applying it.     I put some on my arms and neck and we walked around--no burn. I could not believe how soft it made my skin, how clean it felt, and how good it smelled.    It&#x27;s expensive, but not as expensive as some of the LaRoche Posay Mexoryl products are -- and those are pure chemicals. I used them for a while, but ultimately threw them away and started looking for something with physical shield (zinc) and ingredients I could, well, eat. Aloe, for instance.     This sunscreen is my new favorite. I really can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of the Devita 50. It will continue to be my facial sunblock until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> Thanks to information on Environmental Working Group website, [...], I found this wonderful product. A great moisturizer with the added benefit of nontoxic sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I had ordered five new sunscreens based on the new quidelines from EWG. This one was my favorite of the five. Not gritty, not opaque, not stinky, washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because there is too much zinc or titanium oxide, or whether my particular bottle was old or subjected to too much heat and thus separated, but this leaves small white particles all over my face.</li>
            <li> goes on gritty and leaves your skin feeling thick and white The 30 spf that is made goes on much nicer and it probally does the same job.</li>
            <li> I have extremely clog-prone and sensitive skin and have found that this is the only sunscreen which does not clog or irritate it. I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena and Olay sunscreens (chemical sunscreens caused irritation and stinging, also clogging), Elta MD UV Clear (dried and irritated my skin), Elta MD UV Daily (sticky and greasy without feeling moisturizing, stinging, clogging), and pretty much every &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin sunscreen out there. I&#x27;ve found that DeVita Ultra Solar SPF 50 is a huge improvement over their SPF30 facial sunscreen lotion (I found the SPF 30 sticky, not moisturizing enough, clogging, and not enough sun protection). I am amazed by the Ultra Solar SPF 50 - it is thick and rich and very moisturizing, without feeling greasy at all, and once absorbed leaves absolutely no trace. Other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used would give my face a sheen and make my skin really sweaty, but not this one! It does not sting my sensitive skin, moisturizes beautifully, I have not noticed any clogging after using it for a month, and my Retin-A and glycolic acid sensitized skin has not burned once in the sun since I&#x27;ve used it (I use a heavier sport sunscreen for longer outdoor activities). Finally, after years of searching, money-wasting, and frustration, I&#x27;ve found a sunscreen and skin regime that works! I use the LaRoche-Posay Toleriane products (only the Gentle dermo cleanser and soothing protective lotion work for me - other products in their line have caused clogging), Retin-A, and now this beautiful sunscreen to keep my skin protected and moisturized daily.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking it was titanium dioxide free, similar to the the regular Devita solar moisturizer.    The product I received had a different ingredient label than the one shown here, and it contains titanium dioxide.  This to me seems very strange since the version shown here proudly advertised being titanium dioxide free.    I also noticed the first ingredient besides the zinc and titanium oxides is water versus the regular moisturizer where aloe is listed before water.  I thought this was going to be a good deal - getting 4 oz instead of ~2 for less than twice the price.  (Also I was having trouble getting the regular version because they&#x27;ve been updating the packaging and no one seemed to have it in stock.)  However if this is just a watered down version with some extra things like titanium in it, this was not a good deal at all.  Also now the regular version is out on discount websites and you can get 2.5 oz for about sixteen dollars.      So - I no longer think this was a good deal at all, and this isn&#x27;t even what I wanted - i wanted something titanium dioxide free.    Devita does make great products though, and their regular solar moisturizer is excellent.  It&#x27;s very confusing as to why they would advertise titanium dioxide free as a plus and then turn around and make a product containing it.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of this. The first one (3 years ago) was great. The second one was bad - white, wouldn&#x27;t absorb, flaked off. I bought my bottle number 3 because I was hoping it was just one bad batch but no luck. The new one is just as bad. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> PROS: This sunscreen has all natural safe ingredients, is a very high SPF, goes on clear (no whitish residue), and is very light and non-greasy. This sunscreen has the best rating for safety in sunscreens from the ewg.org website. Because it is not greasy at all, it can be used on oily skin and can be reapplied and reapplied throughout the day without building up grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: A complaint I do have is that if you get it near your eyes, this formula stings my eyes. It is actually unbearable. SO, to remedy that, I end up having to use a different sunscreen around my eyes. I use \\&quot;Keys-Soap Solar Rx Therapeutic Sunblock\\&quot; 30+ SPF around my eyes (see my review for that product) and so far, the Keys Soap brand has not stung my eyes. Another con is that it is not moisturizing, it can leave skin tight and prone to tiny lines. The fact that it is not oily could be a plus for some people, especially those with oily skin (see PROS above)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve gotten more freckles with this product. I lowered my rating from a 4 to a 3. I don&#x27;t think it works very well. It should say a 15 SPF, not a 50 SPF. False advertising! I&#x27;m still in search of a natural sunscreen that actually blocks out sun for hours. The instructions say to apply every 90 minutes (ridiculous)... who has that kind of time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve found another physical sunscreen I like better: Livestrong Thinkbaby SPF 50+. See my reviews for that. It is not perfect, so I am still searching for the perfect one, but it gets pretty close to perfection.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but am not a fan of the pump container.  Wish the brand had kept the shorter jar!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and I like that it goes on smooth without a greasy residue. I have oily skin and my skin does not feel greasy, you don&#x27;t need alot. I have been pale all summer long.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. Only one I use for my face.. I use it alone as lotion when traveling in the summer.</li>
            <li> Pilling:&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the product will pill during application if you don&#x27;t take precautions. I have found that making sure I am thoroughly moisturized before application has helped immensely (I use straight blueberry oil), and on top of that, you have to apply to only one *section of your face at a time in quick sweeping motions, just enough to work it in, then leave it be and move on to the next section.&lt;br /&gt;(*cheek1, cheek 2, forehead, chin, nose, neck side1, neck side2, chest)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only SPF this high that works with my skin type - I&#x27;m sensitive to silicones, have mild rosacea, and the chemical SPFs make my eyes water like crazy. Otherwise, when I apply it well, it works as a great primer for makeup, doesn&#x27;t have a white cast like I experienced with a lot of other (more) expensive brands, and actually helps me retain moisture, probably due to the aloe, glycerin, and Haluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the pilling, but it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li> Works as described, like the pump style bottle top and would buy again.  I do however, prefer the tinting sunscreen better for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Was impressed with the size of this product and the texture. Its very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a white cast if applied propely. I found that dabbing it on my face made it disappear in while rubbing in left me with balls of white stuff all over. Not sure about its sin blocking properties but then again i never reapplied frequently as directed because it tends to cake on and that scares me coz of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am on my second jar of this product.  It goes on smoothly without being greasy and can be used under make-up.  I bought my first jar from a professional skin care salon.  The second jar I bought was from Amazon and it was $15 less, a significant savings. I am 66 years old and my skin is dry so I use it during the months when we do not have the heat on. I need a stronger moisturizer during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;It does a super job of protecting the skin from the sun.</li>
            <li> nice, no white case...when you first put it on, it may seem as if it would but keep rubbing and remove the white stuff.&lt;br /&gt;prevents tanning! a keeper!</li>
            <li> I love devita&#x27;s products and use many of them.  This product was terrible for me.  Someone describes exactly the experience I had with it: as I put the cream on my face, the white residue started to transform into tiny pieces of gum (like drying your face with toilet paper). I had to try to clean the mess (which means I took off the SPF, basically). I also had a white residue along my hairline, a mix of tiny gums and just white color.  I tried the cream once and not twice.  I am returning this item.&lt;br /&gt;PS: I use all Devita&#x27;s products and I just had one serum on my face from Devita. So I do not believe it had anything to do with this. It was the same experience as another customer who described the same experience even on freshly washed skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the new formula.  I&#x27;ve been using the Devita Ultra solar SPF 50 sunscreen for years and was extremely happy with it. However, since they changed the formula, it is now much more difficult to rub in and leaves small white balls on my face.  The doctor I always ordered this from reported other patients were also returning the product for the same reason.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this, and then disappointed after I tried it. It pills up and rolls off of your face if you try to rub it in too much, or if you don&#x27;t apply it to your whole face at the same time. Then you&#x27;re left trying to sweep white stuff off of your face so you don&#x27;t look like you dried your face with toilet paper or have extremely dry skin. At first I thought it might be that I applied moisturizer underneath it, but it does the same thing, even on a freshly clean face. It also makes my skin feel super dry. I have to apply pure shea butter to my whole face beforehand so my face doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry all day. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Devita Ultra solar SPF 50 sunscreen for years.  I loved this stuff more than any moisturizer I have ever used.  High SPF, but went on smooth and completely invisible with no sunscreen smell.  Kept my skin moist but never oily all day long and provided excellent sun protection.  Light enough to wear under make-up and nice enough to wear alone. As someone with extremely fair and extremely sensitive skin, this was the only sunscreen/moisturizer I used on my face since the day I discovered it.  It met every requirement:  high SPF, physical block (no avobenzone), goes on smooth and invisible, not smelly, does not give me a rash, not crazy expensive.  I recommended it to everyone and they all raved as well.  Unfortunately there is something wrong with the new formula and it is completely unusable.  My latest order came in the pump bottle shown in the picture (rather than the usual jar) and the lotion was nothing like the old lotion.  The new formula was pasty and would not rub in.  It left white pills all over my face and hands and I actually had to go wash my face because I looked like a pasty lint ball. I have been unhappy since that day because I am back to using my back-up sunscreen moisturizer (Alba organics, SPF 15 - decent, but not the wonder product the ultra solar was).  I even tried to get the old formulation from my dermatologist, but it was the same bad formulation.  All of my female relatives found the same issue when they bought new lotion recently (different cities, different stores, all the same bad lotion).  I love this product so much that I  will order it again in a few months to see if Devita fixes the formulation.  Until then, I am on another search for the perfect face lotion.</li>
            <li> This used to be my go-to sunscreen because it has high SPF protection yet it was so smooth and light it could be used as a daily moisturizer without the greasiness and white cast of most sunblocks.  But this last bottle was disappointing. I kept trying to use it hoping it was a fluke, but the formula has changed.  It leaves that thick white residue that never quite blends in to the skin. I like this line of products because they use quality ingredients and physical sun blockers, but now I am on the hunt for a good sunblock once again...</li>
