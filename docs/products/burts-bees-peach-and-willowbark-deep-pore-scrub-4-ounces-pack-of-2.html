            <li>I love this scrub!</li>
            <li>Instead it feels incredibly smooth, and after applying additional moisturizer afterwards I feel great.</li>
            <li>but it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Always use a nice moisturizer after every time you use it.</li>
            <li>Smells nice though.</li>
            <li>I love and it works sooooo good.</li>
            <li>it smells like peaches and is the perfect balance between gentle and exfoliating.</li>
            <li>The replaced product was shipped just fine and received quickly and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t I would use a very light hand when applying scrubbing pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use things with fragrance added &amp; should have read the ingredient list better before purchasing.</li>
            <li>If they were to refine the grains a bit more, I&#x27;d be all over this.</li>
            <li>Its not oily, it has an ok smell, and it works like heaven.</li>
            <li>I order a two pack every month to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>The more I use it the more of a fan I become.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and use a lot of them, but this one doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>The peachy scrub kernals in this are something that you would find more in a body scrub.</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>This is a favorite with 3 generations in my family.</li>
            <li>It feels more like lotion with flecks of sand.</li>
            <li>The Peach and Willowbark Deep Pore Scrub exfoliant was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I really love this scrub.</li>
            <li>I probably will love the product.  </li>
            <li>It is an okay product that moisturizes the skin while exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>will buy more when i run out.</li>
            <li>Burts does a pretty good job - which is not doubt why they have become so popular and such a successful company.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I also use the Rose Water toner,which leaves your skin fresh and  clean with a light rose scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I sometimes even do MORE exfolitation than might be suggested (as I do not have overly sensitive skin and like the feel of a good polish)</li>
            <li>It smells sooo good AND ITS 100% NATURAL!</li>
            <li>After a week or so of using this product I got a compliment that my skin looked very clean and healthy, it was the first comment of the like I have ever received and upon close inspection</li>
            <li>I had this huge zit on my nose, and it was so embrassing</li>
            <li>and I used soap and Got a HUGE breakout.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made a huge difference on how my face appears, so I am told.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, and my face always feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li>Its cheap in the two box set.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li>It is paraben and pthlate free, and does not contain sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate.  </li>
            <li>Good natural alternative to [[ASIN:B000UVY8IE</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a scrub, not a cleanser; therefore I don&#x27;t expect it to leave my skin clean, but exfoliated.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the pores at all, and feels oily.</li>
            <li>It does clean they skin well, though.</li>
            <li>I felt used after the face is very comfortable, no tight feeling, natural, pleasant</li>
            <li>You will start to see results and a difference right away!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product because I love that it is paraben free.</li>
            <li>This is more suitable for arms, legs, back and chest areas.</li>
            <li>After much research, I chose Burt&#x27;s Bees and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>The first noticeable difference is it does not have a strong odor.</li>
            <li>This scrub is great for sensitive skin and not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using other products to clear my face but the chemical content made my condition worsen, This is perfect for me!</li>
            <li>I love this new feeling and I&#x27;m&lt;</li>
            <li>br /&gt;definitely coming back for more!</li>
            <li>It had the very next day amazing results.</li>
            <li>I have had acne for years and now my skin is blemish free, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>While I am not afraid of exfoliation</li>
            <li>If they do use a kernal or nut shell/stone kind of product the ingredient/bits should have been micro polished firtst to smooth out any rough corners and remove any jagged edges.</li>
            <li>I like it far better than Burts Bees</li>
            <li>come right out if not taken in the wash.</li>
            <li>This one gets it right.  </li>
            <li>Right after using it, my face has the sensation of being...</li>
            <li>This is gentle, yet effective, and I can use this daily.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Peach &amp; Willowbark is my favorite facial scrub yet!   </li>
            <li>i absolutely love this facial scrub.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on my very short list of favorite products.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I am a Burts Bees fan.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got the Pack of 2, so I have a back up scrub.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will finish it out and look for Alba again, though I am aware that too has changed formulas so we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li>I am 29 with fair, sensitive, dry skin that is very prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I use it at night to wash the day&#x27;s grime off of my face and I go to bed feeling clean and baby soft.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend and the double pack is a good deal.</li>
            <li>and it left my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling very smooth and clean and the scrub is a little finer than some others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees in general, this face wash was a letdown.    </li>
            <li>, this is the first rub where I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>The creamy cleanser is nice, but I expected more crushed seed bits to be in each squeeze of the tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better pore cleansers, even though they are not natural.  </li>
            <li>I think this scrub would be good for dry skin, but definitely not oily, combination, or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Generally after I would use this product I would have to wash will a cleanser to feel clean.</li>
            <li>This is pretty okay, but there isn&#x27;t much scrubby stuff in it, and I really like to ravage my face when I&#x27;m exfoliating, to make sure that it looks much worse than before I started scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I was leery about trying all natural products because it seemed to me that natural ingredients don&#x27;t work as well, but I give a HUGE recommendation for this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this scrub for years and really like it.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li>The bottle says that it uses Peach Stone to \\&quot;gently exfoliate\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really is a shame.</li>
            <li>This scrub is absolutely fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>particular product is exactly why I highly suggest Body \\&quot;scrubs\\&quot; but face \\&quot;polishes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The granules of peach pit are large and don&#x27;t get down in the pores as well as most exfoliating cleansers.</li>
            <li>I like to use it in conjunction with a stronger acne wash (I&#x27;m not super brand loyal but mostly use neutragena), by using this scrub first, then a salicylic acne wash 2nd, after the Burt&#x27;s Bees scrub has really cleaned out my pores.</li>
            <li>The Willowbark granules in the formula make feel harsh at first, but after consistently using it are perfectly fine now.</li>
            <li>The difference I noticed from my old exfoliator (RoC) was that, instead of leaving it tight and super dry after exfoliating, it leaves my skin unbelievably smooth, like it doesn&#x27;t need to make it rough dry to work, it leaves the skin perfectly balanced.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and liked it, BUT...</li>
            <li>I guess less is more.</li>
            <li>This is more like a lotion with some occasional  big granules of something.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I feel the price is way to high for one tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ground peach stone pieces are a little bit large, so you have to be careful if using it around your eyes, but it does give the rest of your face a good scrub.  </li>
            <li>Soft youthful skin once again!!</li>
            <li>I really wish it was 100% natural.</li>
            <li>The package looks normal.</li>
            <li>The scrub looks normal.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal, never had acne breakouts</li>
            <li>Most left my skin dry and flaky and I still had acne.</li>
            <li>Might just be new, but thought people should know.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised!</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of natural beauty products, this face scrub will be a winner!  </li>
            <li>I first found this product at my local drug store.</li>
            <li>Being a mother of 4 and having blemishes as an adult, I am always looking to try something new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, am age 67 and people guess me as early 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I practice natural medicine with my family and always look for natural products.</li>
            <li>This one says 100% natural, unlike the product pictured and the store variety which is 98.43% natural.</li>
            <li>Smells old, like melted crayons.</li>
            <li>I tried it a few times and it made me break out a because it left a &#x27;film&#x27; on my skin which made my face more oily.</li>
            <li>the next was a four-day weekend, so I thought that it would be a good idea to start trying to make at least smaller.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars only because of the nice creamy cleanser base and if they are able to improve on the the peach stone exfoliating ingredient than it would be a real win.&lt;br /&gt;(If</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling fantastic and i ilke teh fact that it does not have a lot of the junk found in other facial scrubs out there.</li>
            <li>Even though my skin gets a little dry sometimes, it makes my skin very smooth and reduces my acne.</li>
            <li>as long I used it sparingly and gently.  </li>
            <li>you want to feel what a real face exfoliator should feel like try the Juara Rice Polish (which I also recently reviewed after trying for the first time - a bit pricier but a little goes a LONG way and there is quite a large bottle of product.</li>
            <li>Not particularly thrilled with this product, especially compared with other Burts Bees superior items.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin and are looking for a gentle scrub, I would recommend it, but not if you have oily, combination, or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Afterwards I can pinch my fresh out of the shower oily face skin and black heads</li>
            <li>No other scrub can do this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the smell and the kernels were somewhat large making it harder to concentrate in one area since they seem to &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I finally figured out that they exfoliate naturally by shaving every day.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money over the years trying to find something that would help my skin.</li>
            <li>There is something about the combination of Peach &amp; Willowbark that really not only cleans out your pores and rubs off the dead skin, but actually makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>After a few months I can say I rarely use this product.</li>
            <li>Caution -- be very gentle when using it and use much less often in winter.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I wonder if there are enough bits of crushed seed to really exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li>I found this unusual at first, because all of the other rubs are usually heavily scented, but I think it adds to the all-naturalness of the product.</li>
            <li>They are large and extremly sharp!</li>
            <li>Following the scrub, I apply a generous layer of rich moisturizer and leave it on for at least 15 minutes (or overnight).</li>
            <li>I am a 29 year old female who has had acne my entire life and this product left my skin feeling oily and clogged.</li>
            <li>so you should still have done a full cleanse with a face wash to remove any makeup before or at least start with that and layer this over.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clear, but doesn&#x27;t dry it.</li>
            <li>well..almost greasy, but that changes to just a wonderfully soft feeling after I dry my face.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily on dry and/or sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> If they do use a kernal or nut shell/stone kind of product the ingredient/bits should have been micro polished firtst to smooth out any rough corners and remove any jagged edges.</li>
            <li> I like it far better than Burts Bees</li>
            <li> come right out if not taken in the wash.</li>
            <li> This one gets it right.  </li>
            <li> Right after using it, my face has the sensation of being...</li>
            <li> This is gentle, yet effective, and I can use this daily.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Peach &amp; Willowbark is my favorite facial scrub yet!   </li>
            <li> i absolutely love this facial scrub.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on my very short list of favorite products.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I am a Burts Bees fan.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got the Pack of 2, so I have a back up scrub.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will finish it out and look for Alba again, though I am aware that too has changed formulas so we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> I am 29 with fair, sensitive, dry skin that is very prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use it at night to wash the day&#x27;s grime off of my face and I go to bed feeling clean and baby soft.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend and the double pack is a good deal.</li>
            <li> and it left my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling very smooth and clean and the scrub is a little finer than some others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees in general, this face wash was a letdown.    </li>
            <li> , this is the first rub where I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> The creamy cleanser is nice, but I expected more crushed seed bits to be in each squeeze of the tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better pore cleansers, even though they are not natural.  </li>
            <li> I think this scrub would be good for dry skin, but definitely not oily, combination, or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Generally after I would use this product I would have to wash will a cleanser to feel clean.</li>
            <li> This is pretty okay, but there isn&#x27;t much scrubby stuff in it, and I really like to ravage my face when I&#x27;m exfoliating, to make sure that it looks much worse than before I started scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I was leery about trying all natural products because it seemed to me that natural ingredients don&#x27;t work as well, but I give a HUGE recommendation for this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scrub for years and really like it.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> The bottle says that it uses Peach Stone to \\&quot;gently exfoliate\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really is a shame.</li>
            <li> This scrub is absolutely fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> particular product is exactly why I highly suggest Body \\&quot;scrubs\\&quot; but face \\&quot;polishes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The granules of peach pit are large and don&#x27;t get down in the pores as well as most exfoliating cleansers.</li>
            <li> I like to use it in conjunction with a stronger acne wash (I&#x27;m not super brand loyal but mostly use neutragena), by using this scrub first, then a salicylic acne wash 2nd, after the Burt&#x27;s Bees scrub has really cleaned out my pores.</li>
            <li> The Willowbark granules in the formula make feel harsh at first, but after consistently using it are perfectly fine now.</li>
            <li> The difference I noticed from my old exfoliator (RoC) was that, instead of leaving it tight and super dry after exfoliating, it leaves my skin unbelievably smooth, like it doesn&#x27;t need to make it rough dry to work, it leaves the skin perfectly balanced.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and liked it, BUT...</li>
            <li> I guess less is more.</li>
            <li> This is more like a lotion with some occasional  big granules of something.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I feel the price is way to high for one tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ground peach stone pieces are a little bit large, so you have to be careful if using it around your eyes, but it does give the rest of your face a good scrub.  </li>
            <li> Soft youthful skin once again!!</li>
            <li> I really wish it was 100% natural.</li>
            <li> The package looks normal.</li>
            <li> The scrub looks normal.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal, never had acne breakouts</li>
            <li> Most left my skin dry and flaky and I still had acne.</li>
            <li> Might just be new, but thought people should know.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised!</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of natural beauty products, this face scrub will be a winner!  </li>
            <li> I first found this product at my local drug store.</li>
            <li> Being a mother of 4 and having blemishes as an adult, I am always looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, am age 67 and people guess me as early 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I practice natural medicine with my family and always look for natural products.</li>
            <li> This one says 100% natural, unlike the product pictured and the store variety which is 98.43% natural.</li>
            <li> Smells old, like melted crayons.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times and it made me break out a because it left a &#x27;film&#x27; on my skin which made my face more oily.</li>
            <li> the next was a four-day weekend, so I thought that it would be a good idea to start trying to make at least smaller.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars only because of the nice creamy cleanser base and if they are able to improve on the the peach stone exfoliating ingredient than it would be a real win.&lt;br /&gt;(If</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling fantastic and i ilke teh fact that it does not have a lot of the junk found in other facial scrubs out there.</li>
            <li> Even though my skin gets a little dry sometimes, it makes my skin very smooth and reduces my acne.</li>
            <li> as long I used it sparingly and gently.  </li>
            <li> you want to feel what a real face exfoliator should feel like try the Juara Rice Polish (which I also recently reviewed after trying for the first time - a bit pricier but a little goes a LONG way and there is quite a large bottle of product.</li>
            <li> Not particularly thrilled with this product, especially compared with other Burts Bees superior items.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin and are looking for a gentle scrub, I would recommend it, but not if you have oily, combination, or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Afterwards I can pinch my fresh out of the shower oily face skin and black heads</li>
            <li> No other scrub can do this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell and the kernels were somewhat large making it harder to concentrate in one area since they seem to &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I finally figured out that they exfoliate naturally by shaving every day.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money over the years trying to find something that would help my skin.</li>
            <li> There is something about the combination of Peach &amp; Willowbark that really not only cleans out your pores and rubs off the dead skin, but actually makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> After a few months I can say I rarely use this product.</li>
            <li> Caution -- be very gentle when using it and use much less often in winter.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I wonder if there are enough bits of crushed seed to really exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> I found this unusual at first, because all of the other rubs are usually heavily scented, but I think it adds to the all-naturalness of the product.</li>
            <li> They are large and extremly sharp!</li>
            <li> Following the scrub, I apply a generous layer of rich moisturizer and leave it on for at least 15 minutes (or overnight).</li>
            <li> I am a 29 year old female who has had acne my entire life and this product left my skin feeling oily and clogged.</li>
            <li> so you should still have done a full cleanse with a face wash to remove any makeup before or at least start with that and layer this over.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin clear, but doesn&#x27;t dry it.</li>
            <li> well..almost greasy, but that changes to just a wonderfully soft feeling after I dry my face.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily on dry and/or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A tube just dose not last long enough.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has troubled skin should get Burt&#x27;s Bees Peach &amp; Willowbark DEEP Pore Scrub right now!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel coated and after wards I usually get zits that are not commonly found on my face (oily, swollen).</li>
            <li> It seems like the peach pits are not finely ground enough, resulting in uneven distribution, and pieces so large and sharp that they scratch my skin.  </li>
            <li> The scrub doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry and abused afterward.</li>
            <li> I felt like I could have used dry salt over my cleanser</li>
            <li> I will be giving this product to my mom who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there is a difference, as the Burt&#x27;s Bees site says the product is 98.43% natural.</li>
            <li> (I have combination skin, it goes from extremely oily to extremely dry phases, and my t-zone peels</li>
            <li> However, the grains are too rough for delicate facial skin, especially if you already have sore blemishes.   </li>
            <li> quality face exfoliator should always have an exfoliating ingredient that is in the shape of tiny round beads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use this than any chemically produced products, however, this wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> product, however does not hit the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Willowbark cream base for the scrub is fairly nice.</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t work for me, it has a waxy feel and is very hard to wash off, I have peach pit residue in the sink after washing my face and it too is hard to clean off the porcelain bowl...</li>
            <li> Then I wash with Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence Facial Cleanser Orange Essence and apply a moisturizer as usual.</li>
            <li> other face scrub with the peach pits.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a different one but thought it was time to experiment with some of Burt&#x27;s Bees other products.  </li>
            <li> Pros: Non-foaming, lightly fragranced, unlike Neutrogena&#x27;s heavy artificial scents.    </li>
            <li> Really too bad, as this used to be a terrific product.</li>
            <li> but hate is a strong word I don&#x27;t like to use.  </li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t go to waste.  </li>
            <li> I prefer natural skin care products and do not feel like I should have to sacrifice on results or quality by choosing them over cosmoceutical type products, so for the price point (compared to expensive holistic spa skin care lines)</li>
            <li> This works great but stinks so bad it gags me, so it&#x27;s going in the garbage!</li>
            <li> A lot of pore scrubs are poor scrubs, meaning they have too much aggregate in them or the wrong texture of lotion.  </li>
            <li> The cream base actually leaves your skin soft but not greasy when done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive (so only four stars for that reason), but so scrubs my pours.</li>
            <li> I am not sure.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> So I bought Burt&#x27;s Bees to tide me over and was disappointed upon first use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I had a hard time finding my usual Alba Botanica scrub in stores</li>
            <li> It left me feeling dirty, even after drying and broke my skin out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I might actually cut my face using this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is not good for people with oily skin and acne.</li>
            <li> Im not sure how the people who say this product is greasy and leaves your face feeling dirty are washing their faces, but I feel refreshed after using this face scrub.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ended throwing half the tube away :(</li>
            <li> This combination has done wonders for my once very broken out skin.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the artificial \\&quot;peach\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> this scrub ingredient (not the cream base) was quite harsh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try it anyway and see how it would go (i HATE</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think this scrub would be good for dry skin, but definitely not oily, combination, or acne-prone skin. I tried it a few times and it made me break out a because it left a &#x27;film&#x27; on my skin which made my face more oily. If you have dry skin and are looking for a gentle scrub, I would recommend it, but not if you have oily, combination, or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin &amp; didn&#x27;t realize how greasy this product was going to be. I also don&#x27;t like the artificial \\&quot;peach\\&quot; smell. I really wish it was 100% natural. I don&#x27;t use things with fragrance added &amp; should have read the ingredient list better before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Im not sure how the people who say this product is greasy and leaves your face feeling dirty are washing their faces, but I feel refreshed after using this face scrub. The scrub doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry and abused afterward. Instead it feels incredibly smooth, and after applying additional moisturizer afterwards I feel great. Burt&#x27;s Bees Peach &amp; Willowbark is my favorite facial scrub yet!   The Willowbark granules in the formula make feel harsh at first, but after consistently using it are perfectly fine now.</li>
            <li> Years ago I noticed that men almost always look younger than women of the same age.  I finally figured out that they exfoliate naturally by shaving every day. I&#x27;ve used this product for years, am age 67 and people guess me as early 50&#x27;s.  Caution -- be very gentle when using it and use much less often in winter.  Always use a nice moisturizer after every time you use it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product because I love that it is paraben free. However, the grains are too rough for delicate facial skin, especially if you already have sore blemishes.   This is more suitable for arms, legs, back and chest areas. If they were to refine the grains a bit more, I&#x27;d be all over this. Unfortunately, I ended throwing half the tube away :( Smells nice though.</li>
            <li> I use Peach &amp; Willowbark Deep Pore Scrub as a weekly exfoliation scrub. Following the scrub, I apply a generous layer of rich moisturizer and leave it on for at least 15 minutes (or overnight). Then I wash with Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence Facial Cleanser Orange Essence and apply a moisturizer as usual. The texture of the scrub is quite grainy; similar to sand on a rocky beach. I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily on dry and/or sensitive skin. It&#x27;s a scrub, not a cleanser; therefore I don&#x27;t expect it to leave my skin clean, but exfoliated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive (so only four stars for that reason), but so scrubs my pours. Afterwards I can pinch my fresh out of the shower oily face skin and black heads come right out if not taken in the wash. I use about two table spoons a washing and use it like once a month. It smells awesome, but not artificial.</li>
            <li> I love it! It had the very next day amazing results. I had this huge zit on my nose, and it was so embrassing and I knew everyone I had passed was looking at it and knew how embraaed I was, but the next was a four-day weekend, so I thought that it would be a good idea to start trying to make at least smaller. So that night   I took a shower but didn&#x27;t wash my hair and only washed my face and put Kiss My Face toner on it and the next day I was so amazed. It worked sooooooooo well. Its not oily, it has an ok smell, and it works like heaven. You will start to see results and a difference right away! Oh yeah did I meantion that I LOVE THIS CREAM!!!!!!!!!! Anyone who has troubled skin should get Burt&#x27;s Bees Peach &amp; Willowbark DEEP Pore Scrub right now! I love and it works sooooo good.</li>
            <li> Great scrub. I have been using this scrub for years and really like it. Would definitely recommend and the double pack is a good deal.</li>
            <li> About a year ago, I went to a spa for a facial and the esthetician recommended I should start using a scrub on a regular basis.  After much research, I chose Burt&#x27;s Bees and my skin has never looked better.  I used it about 3 to 4 times a week and my skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> All I can say is \\&quot;wow\\&quot;. I have spent so much money over the years trying to find something that would help my skin. I am 29 with fair, sensitive, dry skin that is very prone to breakouts. I have only been using this stuff for a week but it is amazing. When I look in the mirror I see myself and not a bunch of pimples or scars from prior pimples. The package looks normal.The scrub looks normal. I guess less is more. I so so floored that something that is so inexpensive works so well! Maybe it only works well for my situation. I am not sure. But I will always have a tube on hand from now on. My skin has not looked so nice since before I hit puberty!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this facial scrub. it smells like peaches and is the perfect balance between gentle and exfoliating. it leaves my skin feeling fantastic and i ilke teh fact that it does not have a lot of the junk found in other facial scrubs out there. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, and my face always feels so much smoother. I always keep this on hand. It&#x27;s on my very short list of favorite products. I use it at night to wash the day&#x27;s grime off of my face and I go to bed feeling clean and baby soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of Acne Solutions out there. Most left my skin dry and flaky and I still had acne. I was offered by a friend to try it out and he gave me a couple bottles! OMG! My skin cleared up with in days. I also use the Rose Water toner,which leaves your skin fresh and  clean with a light rose scent. I went without my Deep Pore Scrub for about five days while I ordered some on Amazon and I used soap and Got a HUGE breakout. As soon as I used the Deep Scrub it went away within a couple days. No other scrub can do this. I order a two pack every month to make sure I don&#x27;t run out. Its cheap in the two box set. The more I use it the more of a fan I become. I was leery about trying all natural products because it seemed to me that natural ingredients don&#x27;t work as well, but I give a HUGE recommendation for this product. I have had acne for years and now my skin is blemish free, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Soft youthful skin once again!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> This scrub left my face feeling greasy and didn&#x27;t remove my makeup.  It was TOO moisturizing for my already oil prone skin.  I ended up using it as a moisturizing shave cream so it didn&#x27;t go to waste.  It worked great in that capacity!  :)</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t work for me, it has a waxy feel and is very hard to wash off, I have peach pit residue in the sink after washing my face and it too is hard to clean off the porcelain bowl...I use a scrub sponge and even that doesn&#x27;t seem to get all the makeup off when I use this product...I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and use a lot of them, but this one doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> First let me say that I am a Burts Bees fan. I prefer natural skin care products and do not feel like I should have to sacrifice on results or quality by choosing them over cosmoceutical type products, so for the price point (compared to expensive holistic spa skin care lines) Burts does a pretty good job - which is not doubt why they have become so popular and such a successful company.&lt;br /&gt;This product, however does not hit the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Willowbark cream base for the scrub is fairly nice. Not overdrying, not supper deep cleansing by any means so you should still have done a full cleanse with a face wash to remove any makeup before or at least start with that and layer this over. The cream base actually leaves your skin soft but not greasy when done. This element of the product is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess the \\&quot;deep pore\\&quot; cleansing comes from the Peach Kernal scrub bits. The bottle says that it uses Peach Stone to \\&quot;gently exfoliate\\&quot;. Umm... No.&lt;br /&gt;This particular product is exactly why I highly suggest Body \\&quot;scrubs\\&quot; but face \\&quot;polishes\\&quot;. The peachy scrub kernals in this are something that you would find more in a body scrub. They are large and extremly sharp! I was quite surprised! While I am not afraid of exfoliation and I sometimes even do MORE exfolitation than might be suggested (as I do not have overly sensitive skin and like the feel of a good polish) this scrub ingredient (not the cream base) was quite harsh.&lt;br /&gt;A quality face exfoliator should always have an exfoliating ingredient that is in the shape of tiny round beads. If they do use a kernal or nut shell/stone kind of product the ingredient/bits should have been micro polished firtst to smooth out any rough corners and remove any jagged edges. This is a face product people! I felt like I could have used dry salt over my cleanser and it would not have been as scratchy!&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin I would not get this product. Even if you don&#x27;t I would use a very light hand when applying scrubbing pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a shame. I gave it 3 stars only because of the nice creamy cleanser base and if they are able to improve on the the peach stone exfoliating ingredient than it would be a real win.&lt;br /&gt;(If you want to feel what a real face exfoliator should feel like try the Juara Rice Polish (which I also recently reviewed after trying for the first time - a bit pricier but a little goes a LONG way and there is quite a large bottle of product. I bought both of these about the same time to try, and man what a difference between the two!)</li>
            <li> I love this scrub! Even though my skin gets a little dry sometimes, it makes my skin very smooth and reduces my acne. I am glad I got the Pack of 2, so I have a back up scrub.&lt;br /&gt;I use my scrub every night before I go to bed, and my skin does not get as oily as it got before when I used to wash my face with foam soap. I love this new feeling and I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;definitely coming back for more! I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for ridding your skin of blackheads.  I use a facial cleansing sponge with this product.  Not overly drying</li>
            <li> Being a mother of 4 and having blemishes as an adult, I am always looking to try something new. I practice natural medicine with my family and always look for natural products. I tried this scrub on my face for about a week. It left me feeling dirty, even after drying and broke my skin out. What works for one may not work for others. It&#x27;s been put to rest in the cabinet for now.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and liked it, BUT...This last batch I ordered is not satisfactory.  It seems like the peach pits are not finely ground enough, resulting in uneven distribution, and pieces so large and sharp that they scratch my skin.  Really too bad, as this used to be a terrific product.</li>
            <li> This scrub is absolutely fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;When I bought it, I came on amazon to read the reviews before opening it. I ALMOST returned it to the store, because of the reviews - people said it is oily, waxy or whatever. I decided to try it anyway and see how it would go (i HATE oily stuff).&lt;br /&gt;I AM SO GLAD I DID NOT RETURN THIS!!!&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel oily! The difference I noticed from my old exfoliator (RoC) was that, instead of leaving it tight and super dry after exfoliating, it leaves my skin unbelievably smooth, like it doesn&#x27;t need to make it rough dry to work, it leaves the skin perfectly balanced. It smells sooo good AND ITS 100% NATURAL! it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this. (I have combination skin, it goes from extremely oily to extremely dry phases, and my t-zone peels all the time - yuck)&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees is always exceeding my expectations. I&#x27;m sticking with this product forever!</li>
            <li> This is a favorite with 3 generations in my family. It leaves the skin feeling very smooth and clean and the scrub is a little finer than some others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Warning! This is a different formula than the one you may have bought at stores. This one says 100% natural, unlike the product pictured and the store variety which is 98.43% natural. This one is a different color (white) and lacks any smell. Not sure why there is a difference, as the Burt&#x27;s Bees site says the product is 98.43% natural. Might just be new, but thought people should know.</li>
            <li> A lot of pore scrubs are poor scrubs, meaning they have too much aggregate in them or the wrong texture of lotion.  This one gets it right.  I like it far better than Burts Bees other face scrub with the peach pits.  This is gentle, yet effective, and I can use this daily. It&#x27;s made a huge difference on how my face appears, so I am told.</li>
            <li> This product is not good for people with oily skin and acne. I am a 29 year old female who has had acne my entire life and this product left my skin feeling oily and clogged. After using it for two weeks, I broke out with several zits. I will be giving this product to my mom who has dry skin. I would recommend using neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> Huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees in general, this face wash was a letdown.    Pros: Non-foaming, lightly fragranced, unlike Neutrogena&#x27;s heavy artificial scents.    Cons: The granules of peach pit are large and don&#x27;t get down in the pores as well as most exfoliating cleansers. It feels more like lotion with flecks of sand. I woke up with an oil bump on my nose after using this. My skin is normal, never had acne breakouts so I&#x27;m not sure if using this to control oily skin would work out too well.    I&#x27;d rather use this than any chemically produced products, however, this wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> This works great but stinks so bad it gags me, so it&#x27;s going in the garbage! Smells old, like melted crayons.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  The Peach and Willowbark Deep Pore Scrub exfoliant was wonderful.  I usually use a different one but thought it was time to experiment with some of Burt&#x27;s Bees other products.  I was not disappointed...it was wonderful!  It was shipped timely.  I recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really love this scrub. I like to use it in conjunction with a stronger acne wash (I&#x27;m not super brand loyal but mostly use neutragena), by using this scrub first, then a salicylic acne wash 2nd, after the Burt&#x27;s Bees scrub has really cleaned out my pores. This combination has done wonders for my once very broken out skin.</li>
            <li> I have not tried product yet.  I probably will love the product.  My problem is it is advertised as (Pack of 2)  I received one tube.  I feel the price is way to high for one tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I informed Amazon of the issued with the product.  They addressed the issue immediately and sent me a replacement product.  I am very pleased with their response.  The replaced product was shipped just fine and received quickly and in perfect condition.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve listened to another reviewer who said the same thing, this stuff hurts. I&#x27;m afraid I might actually cut my face using this stuff! I would give only one star but hate is a strong word I don&#x27;t like to use.  It&#x27;s being returned.</li>
            <li> This is pretty okay, but there isn&#x27;t much scrubby stuff in it, and I really like to ravage my face when I&#x27;m exfoliating, to make sure that it looks much worse than before I started scrubbing.</li>
            <li> It is an okay product that moisturizes the skin while exfoliating.  I don&#x27;t care for the smell and the kernels were somewhat large making it harder to concentrate in one area since they seem to &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; out from my fingers.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of natural beauty products, this face scrub will be a winner!  I use this scrub, in rotation with [[ASIN:B0012NT9KG Burt&#x27;s Bees Soap Bark &amp; Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream 6 oz]], as part of my daily regimen.  It is paraben and pthlate free, and does not contain sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate.  The ground peach stone pieces are a little bit large, so you have to be careful if using it around your eyes, but it does give the rest of your face a good scrub.  Right after using it, my face has the sensation of being...well..almost greasy, but that changes to just a wonderfully soft feeling after I dry my face.  Good natural alternative to [[ASIN:B000UVY8IE St. Ives Apricot Scrub Invigorating 6 oz.]], which I used to use.</li>
            <li> I first found this product at my local drug store. I used it and noticed that my face actually cleared up and it left my skin nice and soft. I&#x27;ve tried using other products to clear my face but the chemical content made my condition worsen, This is perfect for me! It&#x27;s great for anyone with sensitive skin. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This scrub is great for sensitive skin and not harsh at all. My skin feels great afer using it.  It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this scrub. It leaves my skin clear, but doesn&#x27;t dry it. Use alongside Burt&#x27;s Bees lotions and everyone has noticed the change in my skin.</li>
            <li> After a few months I can say I rarely use this product. It makes my skin feel coated and after wards I usually get zits that are not commonly found on my face (oily, swollen). The peach cores can be a bit ruff on the skin at times. Generally after I would use this product I would have to wash will a cleanser to feel clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had a hard time finding my usual Alba Botanica scrub in stores (looks like I will have to buy it online).  Alba Botanica (or, as it&#x27;&#x27;s now called, just Alba) is a very-finely ground scrub.  I could use it every day as long I used it sparingly and gently.  So I bought Burt&#x27;s Bees to tide me over and was disappointed upon first use.  This is more like a lotion with some occasional  big granules of something.  I don&#x27;t feel like i am sloughing my face; I fell like I am putting lotion on it.  I will finish it out and look for Alba again, though I am aware that too has changed formulas so we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different rubs over the years by JASON, St. Ives, Neutrogina, etc., this is the first rub where I really noticed a difference. The first noticeable difference is it does not have a strong odor. I found this unusual at first, because all of the other rubs are usually heavily scented, but I think it adds to the all-naturalness of the product. After a week or so of using this product I got a compliment that my skin looked very clean and healthy, it was the first comment of the like I have ever received and upon close inspection I think it&#x27;s true. There is something about the combination of Peach &amp; Willowbark that really not only cleans out your pores and rubs off the dead skin, but actually makes your skin feel smooth. I think it&#x27;s because the rub has built in lotion compounds as well. Check this stuff out.</li>
            <li> I felt used after the face is very comfortable, no tight feeling, natural, pleasant taste。Next time I will choose, to have the goods Oh</li>
            <li> A tube just dose not last long enough.Works great, feels good, ya&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more when i run out.</li>
            <li> The creamy cleanser is nice, but I expected more crushed seed bits to be in each squeeze of the tube. Sometimes I wonder if there are enough bits of crushed seed to really exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> Not particularly thrilled with this product, especially compared with other Burts Bees superior items. This doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the pores at all, and feels oily. I&#x27;ve used better pore cleansers, even though they are not natural.  It does clean they skin well, though.</li>
