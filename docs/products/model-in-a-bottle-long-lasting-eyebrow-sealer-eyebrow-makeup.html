            <li>This is the answer to beautiful eye brows,put your pencil on and go over your brows with this product and Your Brows are set perfect until you take it off!</li>

            <li>Well it&#x27;s like everyone says, this a very good product.  </li>
            <li>So I was very happy to find this product at Amazon and see all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>The brush applicator is great because it allows you to control the amount of the sealer and the brush which is included is wonderful to comb eyebrows.</li>
            <li>it works perfectly and the price os great.  </li>
            <li>Very effective in completing a great eyebrow shaping job!</li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>Keeps my eyebrows looking good all day!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good for the day!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is indeed good stuff, but NOT the all-out best in the way of waterproofing.</li>
            <li>What made my perfected eyebrow fall by the wayside is my oily skin which in turn causes my beautifully faux created arches fade into obscurity.</li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>

            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on as easy as one would like, but once you play with it a while it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>easy to apply, lasted all day, loved it and would buy again.  </li>
            <li>plus my oily skin softens it very easily.</li>
            <li>I will for sure buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li>I use brow pomade and a pencil most times to color in/thicken my eyebrows and find that when applied sparingly, MIAB is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found thus far</li>
            <li>Anyone who has to draw their brows on knows how embarrassing it is to never be able to touch your own eyebrows, or exercise, or play with your kids, or even have sex without worrying if your eyebrows will rub off.</li>
            <li>I immediately went to the internet looking for a replacement product and I can honestly say Model in a Bottle is BETTER than Shelaq.  </li>
            <li>I can wash it off about as easily as any good eyeliner, and it IS able to rub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love love love model in a bottle!</li>
            <li>(powder looks more natural than using an eyebrow pencil), and then I seal the powder with a dab of this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>I am a very honest person and will definitely recommend the products to all those girlfriends in need of a great color sealer.  </li>
            <li>BUT IT IS SO GREAT FOR KEEPING MY DIVA BROW IN CHECK ;)</li>
            <li>Great product which really works!</li>
            <li>The sealer goes on very smoothly and never flakes.</li>
            <li>I have very light eyebrows</li>
            <li>I have very light and sparse eyebrows</li>
            <li>Then I VERY lightly ran my finger through a brow.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t disturb your brow makeup when you apply it and the nail polish type brush is extremely easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>It comes off easily with soap and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But with just a light stroke of the brush on top of any eyebrow makeup and it&#x27;s locked on until you take it off!  </li>
            <li>Great replacement for my Anastasia clear brow gel, which I also love!</li>
            <li>This is way cheaper and works BETTER in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so, let me start by saying...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like when MOST people say they have no eyebrows,</li>
            <li>Then on top of that, I fill it in with an eyebrow powder.</li>
            <li>I am PLEASED to announce that this product has been a MIRACLE.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>ITS MAGIC IN A BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how much I LOVE this eyebrow sealer.</li>

            <li>:)</li>
            <li>TRY IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have tried so many products out there.</li>
            <li>so then you have to put more on.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this productüëå in my opinion</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be more of a gel consistency but to my surprise</li>
            <li>but it works credibly well!</li>
            <li>love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I actually love it...</li>
            <li>Love the way it conceals the eye brows.  </li>
            <li>I use it on top of my eyebrow makeup</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I think I like it better than the product I was using before.  </li>
            <li>it just bought me more time throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>and it also contains a spoolie brush that I can use to groom the hairs I do have and make sure none of them sticking out of place.</li>
            <li>It works fabulously!  </li>
            <li>and then I just switched to something better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and would recommend it to anyone who ask.</li>
            <li>I sure think so.</li>
            <li>So definitely a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Lost most of my eye brows and had to draw them on.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was just okay.  </li>
            <li>However, I have a friend who does really like it and says it works great for her.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I get for trying to be inventive.  </li>
            <li>Now I feel confident if I brush my hair away from my eyes, or accidentally touch them, or if it rains or snows.</li>
            <li>Worth it and have kept my eyebrows looking good</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>packaging I received was more purple/nailpolish bottle looking.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I saw this on YouTube.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for those of us who are hairless in the brow zone.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will work on brow powder better.</li>
            <li>I love this bottle now</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry that I have rubbed off or smeared my brows when touching my face without thinking.  </li>
            <li>+ Came in faster than I thought it would. :)</li>
            <li>so I love Model in a Bottle, don&#x27;t have to worry about pencil coming off.</li>

            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>just Swype this over top</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re perfect the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work since I have no eye brows at all.</li>
            <li>, I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny brow trail, nor does it alter the color of the brow product like SheLaq did;</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it however some of the product leaked out of the bottle during shipment.</li>
            <li>I DECIDED TO TRY IT BECAUSE I&#x27;M ALWAYS SHAPING MY BROWS, AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I need to draw on most of my eyebrows since chemo therapy.  </li>
            <li>Love the flexibility of the 2 brush styles.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>but the company does not make it any more.  </li>
            <li>I tried to see if also it works for the eye liner to help it stay on, but it didnt, but that was ok....</li>
            <li>love this product and would recommend this eyebrow sealer.</li>
            <li>How else was I to seal my color and make sure that my eyebrows were smudgeproof?</li>
            <li>In a Bottle adds even MORE hours to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>If you have to pencil in your brows like me this stuff is like magic</li>
            <li>Try it you will love it.  </li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Pleased to say that she loves it and has ordered 2 more since then.</li>
            <li>I use a cream product to fill in my brows and then i apply this over top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with this product</li>
            <li>I have to say the more I use this product,</li>
            <li>the more I appreciate it.</li>
            <li>In the evening when I go to wash my face for bed, most of my foundation is gone, my blush &amp; bronzer has faded, eyeliner evaporated</li>
            <li>I like shine and it has more of a matte finish</li>
            <li>This worked OK...</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li>Like so many women I over plucked &amp;</li>
            <li>Now I can sweat and wipe in peace, take a nap and continue with my day, and most importantly, SCRATCH MY EYBROWS, without them being under my nails and no longer on my face!</li>
            <li>I love the way I go to work for 8 hrs and come home</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I started coloring in my brows after many mishaps with shaving them with razors.</li>
            <li>It withstands sweat, touching, rain, whatever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I hope they continue to make this product because for the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have to worry about eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li>I first got it, it took a couple times to figure out how much to use and which brush worked best for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have something that I can put on and not worry about, I am super happy with my purchase and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>GREAT PURCHASE HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>With great reviews on here, I had my hopes up too high.</li>
            <li>A VERY CLEAN LOOK BECAUSE OF THE SHINE.</li>
            <li>THE BEST PURCHASE EVER MADE FAR AS MY NAKED BROWS LOL.</li>
            <li>About 5 years ago I decided to get the permanent eyebrows done and they came out pretty good</li>
            <li>but i wasn&#x27;t too impressed to use long term.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>It works pretty good, it keeps the eyebrow fillers or pencil in place and do not move.  </li>
            <li>Now my brows look pretty darned good, if I do say so</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Its pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>This purchase is definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and looks okay on.</li>
            <li>If I apply two coats instead of one, it works better for me as it doesn&#x27;t seem to smear as easily AND even in the pool my eyebrows stayed put.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and very happy with product!!, thanks</li>
            <li>This is the best of the best, the only problem is that sometimes it flakes a little</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I get to enjoy the summer w/o worrying.</li>
            <li>Good merchandise and fast shipping</li>
            <li>This product was price reasonably, shipped in timely manner, received in good condition.</li>
            <li>Ok, I am excited to have this product, I have been searching for years for something that will keep my brows on and this is it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product it last a good while too!</li>
            <li>Great for the price will last a pretty good while.</li>
            <li>but, I can easily wear it for 8-10 hours without ANY smudging</li>
            <li>but, I can easily wear it for 8-10 hours without ANY smudging</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s invisible and easily washes off when I wash my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to take it off maybe because I oily skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t give 5 stars out easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, affordable, and does everything it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Easily lasts all day, and a nap.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>But removes easily with eye makeup remover or makeup remover wipes.  </li>
            <li>Model in the Bottle wipes off too easy.</li>
            <li>and it wipes off really easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, lasts all day, keeps your brow make-up from smudging and keeps eyebrow hairs in place.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with makeup remover</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Be sure not to apply too much, or it can get kind of flakey.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as strong by night almost as when I put it on at 7am.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a really strong chemical nail polish like smell.</li>
            <li>Just use a strong hair spray or hair gel in stead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price, and you don&#x27;t need much so this bottle has already lasted me right at 6 months</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price, and you don&#x27;t need much so this bottle has already lasted me right at 6 months</li>
            <li>BUT I NEED A FULL COVERAGE BECAUSE MOST OF MY EYEBROW IS COLORED</li>
            <li>Ok well this stuff was supposed to be my dream come true, but it was not.</li>
            <li>Then It rubs off easier with a cotton ball or washcloth just fine.</li>
            <li>My brows are fine, so I use pencil so the will appear thicker.</li>
            <li>(I have fine medium-brown hair).  </li>
            <li>I ran a half marathon and sweated copiously for two hours and my brows STILL looked perfect at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, I wear over eyeliner surfing 1-2hours and pretty much stays on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have noticed, however, that without the sealer the beginning of my brows would &#x27;bleed&#x27; into the fine lines between my eyes and with the sealer I did not have this problem, so that&#x27;s a plus for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll continue to use this to keep my brow pencil from bleeding into those fine</li>
            <li>Lol funny now, not so much then.</li>
            <li>and it has helped tremendously!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced the white flakiness others described but realized I needed to take it easy on the sealer.  </li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s hot outside nothing is better at keeping your eyebrows in tact!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased by the free 2-day fast shipping :) bought this because of Carli Bybel from YouTube and so far I am loving it!</li>
            <li>and it dries very, very fast!!</li>
            <li>Best money ever spent!!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this, after having read many positive reviews on the seeming magical waterproofing abilities of Model in a Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, they do not look shiny at all, which was a huge problem I had with She-Law.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;ve even used it on my eyeshadow a few times and it works great there, too!</li>
            <li>I recommend not drenching your brows in it - just a light coat does for the day.</li>
            <li>I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SOMEHOW USE SOME LIGHT TRANSPARENT POWDER TO DAB ON IT</li>
            <li>I was so happy to receive this item, because when I do my eyebrows I wanted to let them last.</li>
            <li>product comes with a mini mascara type brush or a paint type brush which glides smoothly over powder or pencil.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are so light it looks like I have none.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of product and is such a great deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just the tiniest amount is needed (I use the brush applicator) - everything&#x27;s smooth, no flakes,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the brows &amp;#34;running&amp;#34; or wiping off with accidental light brushes against something.  </li>
            <li>This seals your brows in place perfectly,i can put on a cheap brow pencil</li>
            <li>Works great for keeping drawn in lashes looking the same until it is time to be removed.</li>
            <li>Amazing really works put it on even in the california heat and at the beach</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps my filled in brows in place all day.  </li>
            <li>This product is great because you can use any inexpensive drug store brow pencil and this will make it last ALL DAY!</li>
            <li>Great product, it last all day</li>
            <li>But still overall a really great prodcut</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure it just wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>I brush the excess off on the bottle rim and lightly run it over my brows.</li>
            <li>Great product, brows actually last all day, without smearing all over the place.</li>
            <li>When I tried this Model in a Bottle, for the eyebrows, it works fabulous.  </li>
            <li>the service was fast and packed nicely.</li>
            <li>What do you have to lose when it&#x27;s so damn cheap????</li>
            <li>This item was a great find several years ago</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolute gold!!!</li>
            <li>This really works!!!  </li>
            <li>Very nice product and especially for the price.</li>
            <li>and it is overall very nice</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that does exactly what it says it will, and more.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find the glass bottle with a built-in brow sealer wand and a separate brow brush inside.  </li>
            <li>But today was my first time trying Model in a Bottle, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Once I used it for the first time I was in love.</li>
            <li>It works great at sealing my eye brow powder all day and gel eye liner (when needed for humid days or long evenings).</li>
            <li>So I was excited when I received my Model In A Bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps if you have natural brows, it helps to seal the eyebrow pencil on them, but as me and my best friend do not have brows, and instead prefer to draw ours on each day, we needed a GOOD waterproof sealer to keep them looking fresh and crisp.&lt;br /&gt;Model in a Bottle worked for only so many hours before succumbing to facial oils and sweat, which made them start to feather and look fuzzy, in spite of our ongoing care to dab at our faces with powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in a region of the country renowned for warm weather, so this is a fact of life.  </li>
            <li>I then clean up with a q-tip and sometimes concealer.</li>
            <li>But once I brush them with a dry eyebrow brush, they look great.</li>
            <li>I can not live with out this lol.</li>
            <li>Every Christmas I give my  adult daughters &amp;#34;moms favorite things&amp;#34; in their stockings, and this will be in their stocking this year!</li>
            <li>I use it for when I&#x27;m gonna sweat a lot or be out somewhere all day, or special occasions.</li>
            <li>You can train your eyebrows to grow right and can use it to keep your eyebrow makeup to stay put!  </li>
            <li>I apply it whenever I put on a full face to seal in my brows.  </li>
            <li>So really u could say I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product it really locks in the color when you fill in your brows.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse brows after many years of tweezing and waxing.  </li>
            <li>and this has been my tried and true.</li>
            <li>The bottle basically looks like it&#x27;s completely full.</li>
            <li>However, it does a good job of having the makeup last all day.</li>
            <li>trying to find more pros, but I really can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I have to fill in my brow every day with a combo of liner and powder to create a full brow</li>
            <li>Really wanted to love this product but the flaking wouldn&#x27;t let me.  </li>
            <li>I teach very sweaty power yoga classes ( sometimes as many as six a day) and this works miraculously.</li>
            <li>~  At least it does work for the eyebrows and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>product lived up to its claim my eyebrows lasted for 2 days without any erasing or smudging what a cool product.  </li>
            <li>I have very sparse eyebrows that are all but invisible, but I&#x27;ve found using an eye primer and setting them with powder works much better than model in a bottle.</li>
            <li>and it is still almost full.</li>
            <li>The powder in particular, is lent a sort of lifelike very gentle sheen that eyebrows normally have, before dense, matte pigmented eyebrow powders are applied, totally thanks to this products excellent design.</li>
            <li>QUICK, SWEET, AND TO THE POINT:&lt;br</li>
            <li>read the many good reviews prior to ordering this product which provided high hopes on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d have to re-up quickly</li>
            <li>However I go through the gel rather quickly.</li>
            <li>product washes off quickly with a cleanser of your choice and water.</li>
            <li>This will even keep your brows in place during a mild workout.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this product, I did some quick googling to read its reviews</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin and</li>
            <li>I need more and will be back soon to hopefully be able to get it.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>So without this product I would be super self conscience that my brows were smeared halfway my face.</li>
            <li>Love it love it finally</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, locks in makeup, and it&#x27;s water AND sweat proof.</li>
            <li>I love it, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is if you leave it on there for more than a day your eyebrows build up crust from the liquid drying</li>
            <li>Package received quickly.</li>
            <li>This is like super hold Hairspray for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>As we get older, many of us lose our eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I mean &#x27;top model&#x27;  on fleek type brows...until they rub off!!!</li>
            <li>The product I had been using a high end for years that had been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I searched many sites and came upon this.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>Love this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The top of the bottle came apart from the brush, but I was still able to hold onto the tip of the brush part where it was supposed to be glued in, and was able to apply the product with a little difficulty at holding it.</li>
            <li>use a Rimmel Eyebrow Pencil and it is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Lovely product made me feel normal and not about my trich.</li>
            <li>I have struggled to find cheap and most importantly, sealers that actually work.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and purchased model in a bottle and it came very fast!</li>
            <li>all of you enjoy it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>(yeah, that&#x27;s no way to live), so I was on a mission to find a product comparable to She-Laq or better, if that was even possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and the first lasted a good 6 months.</li>
            <li>If you want smudge &amp; budge proof brows that last &amp; look just as good as when you first did them</li>
            <li>so be careful not to overdo it because it will drip all over you and can get into your eyes which would not be pleasant.</li>
            <li>I feel a little more normal now, lol.</li>
            <li>I chose 2nd option and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>It absolutely works!!</li>
            <li>I actually like this better because it doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny coat over the make up!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re planning on running around outside on a hot summer&#x27;s day be sure to check your brows in the mirror on occasion to make sure they don&#x27;t crust over on account of your sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my brows stay put even in hot humid weather!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims!  </li>
            <li>This product never fails!  </li>
            <li>What a great little problem solver.</li>
            <li>when you consider I can run to the supermarket, get home and still have two pretty eyebrows right where they belong!  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;ve even used it on my eyeshadow a few times and it works great there</li>
            <li>this stuff ,am out ,need to reorder, use everyday works great</li>
            <li>I have very sparse, light brows that I spend five minutes filling in every morning</li>
            <li>This Model in a Bottle stuff doesn&#x27;t have She Laq&#x27;s staying power, but it&#x27;s better than clear mascara or hair gel or anything else that might be used to seal eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde, which is nice, but that means my brows and lashes are totally transparent, which is not so nice.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I finally have my own that I can use at any given time.</li>
            <li>and my eyebrows stay fresh and in shape throughout the day without smearing or smudging.</li>
            <li>it worth the price?</li>
            <li>Love this product, it is clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it considering the price.</li>
            <li>clear mascara gel works way better than this product.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>was the last I was going to own -- they discontinued it who knows when.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Great product last all day until i wash it off...and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>ITS WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>Since MiaLLES doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows shine or glisten in the sun, they end up looking much more natural.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny....</li>
            <li>I love it, and I have purchased bottle for other people who equally love it.</li>
            <li>So next I go stand over the hot stove and prepare dinner, surely this will do the bows in!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right...</li>
            <li>Afterwards I use the nail polish looking tip and rub it right over my eyebrow.</li>
            <li>Application does have a bit of a learning curve to figure out the right method and amount of product.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re washing the brow product right out of your brow.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a formula that you have to get just right so that it will work.  </li>
            <li>I apply this right after I draw and fill in with my brow powder and shape.</li>
            <li>Now I know why and those women are 100% right.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it thru a hot summer but for this price, I definitely am satisfied with results so far.</li>
            <li>Less is more most times.</li>
            <li>This product really works, my eyebrows remain intact for the whole day, I am definitely impressed and would repurchase even though I believe this product will last a very very long time.</li>
            <li>I am SO HAPPY that I purchased this eyebrow sealer - it is a HOLY GRAIL product for me - this definitely seals my eyebrow color in place when I use the white sealing brush</li>
            <li>This is just as good and a lot less $$$ than SheLaq.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, dries clear, and removes easily.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live with out this product!!!</li>
            <li>and I use actual eyeshadow and a very cheap eyebrow pencil,</li>
            <li>I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good purchase if you keep your brows a little thicker.</li>
            <li>so many others, I am happy to report that whenever I use this product, my brows are intact wherever I go, even following a hard day on my hands and knees in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleopatra...</li>
            <li>If you apply a small amount and evenly it works amazingly!</li>
            <li>Exactly as the picture.</li>
            <li>This potion does exactly what its meant to do sans flaking, stiffness etc.</li>
            <li>I apply this first, wait until it dries, and then apply my brow powder over it.  </li>
            <li>I have to first use tea tree oil around my brows because I have super-ridiculously oily skin.</li>
            <li>It does EXACTLY what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>it really works!  </li>
            <li>I like the price, not expensive.</li>
            <li>sure enough - my brows stayed on all day and all thru the night!</li>
            <li>And my package came soo fast!</li>
            <li>I was already nervous the first time I got them done</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the pain and healing process I had to endure the first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such hell shopping for heatproof/melt proof products that I sincerely hope they make this eyebrow sealer forever.</li>
            <li>it works, and it&#x27;s not difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li>this is so much better than Anastasia Beverly Hills!&lt;br /&gt;The brush is tiny</li>
            <li>Thanks a million!</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;ve been using it consistently</li>
            <li>Great product and extremely long lasting!</li>
            <li>tried putting more, different brushes etc</li>
            <li>This sadly is not it.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will, keeps your eyebrows and any color you added in place all day.  </li>
            <li>This product last ALL DAY &amp; NIGHT,absolutely will recommend:)</li>
            <li>Boy, this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says--</li>
            <li>Stays on pretty well even with swimming.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I felt a burning sensation on my brows, which worried me</li>
            <li>This product helps to keep my penciled in brows exactly where I put them.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t last more than 4 hours; 2 on another day.  </li>
            <li>The product worked exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I bought this eyebrow sealer in hopes that it would be better than the current one I was using (LeFemme).</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are basically non-existant (thanks to years of over plucking!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a gardener - working outside most every day which means perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m sure it can last the whole year!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best eyebrow sealer I&#x27;ve used after trying multiple, &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; &amp; more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have this, my brows stay in place no matter how hot it gets.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it states.  </li>
            <li>i was in cancun for twoweeks and my eyebrows stayed on after a whole day of swimming and overnight!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This seems to hold my brow make up in place pretty well.  </li>
            <li>whats not...this product is my favorite its finish texture it gives to the brow hairs are similar to the anastasia beverly hills</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;waterproof gels and pencils&amp;#34;  nothing has worked better or kept my brows from smudging and smearing than this product.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this and not a different product.</li>
            <li>eyebrows stay on for the whole day!</li>
            <li>If there is a better brand similar to Benefits</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>The second brush not all that good and the one that comes with it in the bottle doesn&#x27;t work on bare skin.</li>
            <li>No shiny finish, no weird flaking.</li>
            <li>I am do glad I finally bought this product.</li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>This eyebrow sealer preformed for me exactly as described.</li>
            <li>its quite liquid-y like a nail polish , but not sticky or anything....it does give a shine for the first 30 mins or so.....but</li>
            <li>It even lasts through a night of hot salsa dancing, and anything that might come afterwards.</li>
            <li>like the nail polish application for the ends of my eyebrows which is more penciled on than actual hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m buying it again because I&#x27;ve already run through a whole bottle!</li>
            <li>It never smears my eyebrow shadow off and it dries fast!</li>
            <li>I need to order another for myself, all of my friends took mine ;)</li>
            <li>This sealer holds up pretty well to perspiration.</li>
            <li>Also, dont bother spending money on the waterproof brow gels, they dont last any better than inexpensive brow pencils with this product.</li>
            <li>This works really well but do not use a lot!</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>This produce does exactly what it claims to.</li>
            <li>It has worked perfectly, lasting until I go to bed most days.</li>
            <li>Model in a bottle eyebrow sealer is definitely a miracle worker as many customers who have purchased this product reported.</li>
            <li>Really keeps eyebrows in place!</li>
            <li>First thing is I like it comes with two ways to apply the product onto your brows.</li>
            <li>I actually really need the brush!</li>
            <li>My solution: I use a good eyebrow powder and a stiff angled brush to fill in sparse areas of my eyebrows</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I am fair skinned and without my eyebrows in the morning I look very scary,this product does not work even a little bit</li>
            <li>Ok, so I have been a loyal user of Benefit&#x27;s She Laq for years to keep my brows at bay, and had almost a full bottle left to last me until one day</li>
            <li>I ride a motorcycle and constantly worry about not having any makeup on when I take off my helmet, this reduces that significantly !</li>
            <li>No flakes, drys fast, only remove able when applied with washing your face with make up remover.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s necessary to make sure you really wipe the wand off on the bottle before applying.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that you really need to get most of the product off the brush or else</li>
            <li>My skin is super oily and my eyebrows never last a full day...</li>
            <li>After reading a lot of positive reviews on this product I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this product so I decided to buy it because so many people gave it 5 stars, especially the people who have sparse brows, oily skin and live where the weather gets pretty hot and humid.</li>
            <li>And if you apply too much... when it dries, it flakes.&lt;br /&gt;It works well over the Anastasia Brow Pomade (another god send) which I apply first with an angled brush.</li>
            <li>This really works, I have hot flashes</li>
            <li>Now that Benefit doesn&#x27;t make Shelaq any more and my cat spilled my last bottle, I had to find something similar and this actually turned out to be better!</li>
            <li>First time putting it on it burn my eyebrows but it works very well</li>
            <li>and I stay cute all day long.</li>
            <li>But most of them that claimed long wearing &amp; waterproof still isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the secret weapon of all beautiful brows.</li>
            <li>I have long Dreadlocks, my issue was when my hair would sweep across my face trough out the day it would wipe away my perfect brows that I worked so hard to create.  </li>
            <li>AND WASHES OFF EASY WITH MY OLAY FACIAL WASH</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, matte and clear.  </li>
            <li>As someone with sparse brows, I have tried so many so called long wearing or waterproof brow pencils/powders/etc and have never found one that really lasts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely re-purchase!ter for me as it doesn&#x27;t seem to smear as easily AND even in the pool my eyebrows stayed put.</li>
            <li>It has easily become an HG product and I will definitely be repurchasing when it runs out.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pure</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d be using the spooly, but this stuff is pure</li>
            <li>the only problem is that it is easy to apply to much and then get some flaking.</li>
            <li>so I have to double wash my eyebrows, which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>have to use the regular brush, but it also includes a comb if you&#x27;re one of those fortunate ones who still has real eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This definitely does its job, but if you put too much it on it WILL flake lightly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product daily for a few months now &amp; it works GREAT.  </li>
            <li>My brows stays in place and don&#x27;t come off until I&#x27;m ready to take them off.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully really holds the eyebrows in place.</li>
            <li>An absolute friggin&#x27; miracle.</li>
            <li>If you use too much it builds up and flakes</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>It really does make your eyebrows smudge-proof and waterproof.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>This really helps to keep the liner on (whichever type you use).  </li>
            <li>SEEMS TO LEAVE A VERY DEFINED SHINY RESIDUE</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I recommend not putting too much on at a time and even using and eyebrow brush after to sort of comb the sealer through the eyebrow.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE IT</li>
            <li>It works well, but it can get crusty if you add too much on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It really makes my eyebrows stay in place all day and doesn&#x27;t fade the makeup.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very sticky however and too liquidy.</li>
            <li>If you apply too much, it will drip or cause your make-up to run.</li>
            <li>have an oily face, so by night time, my She Laq would stop working so much and</li>
            <li>However, with Model in a Bottle&#x27;s stuff, I haven&#x27;t noticed the product really wearing off.  </li>
            <li>(As a beauty consultant, I know that your eyebrows make your whole face</li>
            <li>but it really truly helps keep my eye brow color on, even through workout sweat</li>
            <li>I have very sparse eyebrows and therefore always need  powder on them to make them show.  </li>
            <li>but it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I really dig this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this so much</li>
            <li>Really keeps the eyebrows from sweating off in the heat.</li>
            <li>THIS REALLY WORKS..</li>
            <li>If it worked, I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much</li>
            <li>And unlike the model in a bottle make-up setting spray, this didn&#x27;t really hold my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>If that bothers you, do as I do, simply dust a translucent face powder lightly over the brows after the product dries.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really seal the eyeliner drawn on my eyebrows like I thought.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>I feel like I can now enjoy summer without constantly worrying about my disappearing brows.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>But at the end of the day my eyebrows doesn&#x27;t really look like I have drawn them in the morning.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t use to much your brows stay in place and</li>
            <li>I really like this product because my brows never fade when I use it.</li>
            <li>This product really keeps your brow lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>This really does help to &#x27;seal in&#x27; your brows.</li>
            <li>I really like this one</li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>they just aren&#x27;t really into conforming.</li>
            <li>This product coupled with an eyebrow pencil really saves the day.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, after you have your eyebrows</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sssssoooooo much cheaper than Shelaq.  </li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seal the brow very well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery&lt;</li>
            <li>and my eyebrows are really patchy.</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;eyebrows&amp;#34; don&#x27;t rub off thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>I saw this used on youtube from some of the makeup bloggers , and i really wanted to try it because i have braids</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve got very sparse eyebrows</li>
            <li>Litterly makes your eyebrows perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anybody that wants their eyebrows to stay in place all day.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It really does keep my brow makeup in place all day.</li>
            <li>AND IT DONT TAKE MUCH TO USE</li>
            <li>This really locks my eyebrows in place, holds the product in place and lasts all day</li>
            <li>This product  works very well.........</li>
            <li>Dries fast.  </li>
            <li>Does not take much to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I am putting too much on</li>
            <li>If you apply too much it will look shiny</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve learned that you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>It absolutely does just what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>I found YouTube very helpful in getting reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic, works the same!!!</li>
            <li>It works really well-</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t apply too much, or it will harden and make your eyebrows feel like bricks,</li>
            <li>It real works.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smear as much as it would&#x27;ve without the sealer though.</li>
            <li>But again, not as much as it would&#x27;ve without the sealer.</li>
            <li>Maybe this product doesn&#x27;t work as well for me because, as I mentioned, I really DON&#x27;T have any brows to speak of.</li>
            <li>Thus stuff really does work</li>
            <li>I was ready to pay $40-$50 for some shopping network waterproof pencil/powder product.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows stay in place the whole night even if I sweat this stuff</li>
            <li>Sets my eyebrows really well for the whole day until I wash it off.</li>
            <li>I live where it&#x27;s hot and very humid but this keeps them in place.</li>
            <li>Even when it is super HOT outside &amp; my oily skin starts oiling up in my T-zone or if I&#x27;m sweating...</li>
            <li>I researched other customer reviews from various websites &amp; they all had good things to say about this stuff.</li>
            <li>So because, like most women, I pencil in half my eyebrows, I need a product that will remain in place at all times, particularly during the summer months when it&#x27;s hot and the make-up just doesn&#x27;t stay where it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>I bought my original bottle in 2014, three years later I ran out and reordered.</li>
            <li>but before I found this amazing product the powder wouldn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product it actually lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>The two products work exactly the same but Model in a Bottle is half the price for 2x more product!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this item for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>I normally use a wax pencil from Ziba for my eyebrows, but this stuff works really well.  </li>
            <li>so I shape them with an eyeliner pencil and apply a dark brown eyeshaodw on top, then seal them in.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;ve changed the formulation as it dries more clear and matte than clear and shiny as it used to, which s definitely a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Until I find something better, this will have to due!</li>
            <li>In one little bottle that it is design to last you a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>And if I do rub my eyebrows after I have sweated,  the part where there is less hair to grab onto will wipe off BUT for the most part my eyebrows are at attention and in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I still have more then half</li>
            <li>Model in a Bottle is a better product at half the price.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve found that less really is more with this</li>
            <li>Once I draw them on (with half the brow penciled in), I just paint over my work of art like a top coat of nail polish.</li>
            <li>You have to apply apply with a light hand and let it dry, but over all I do like it.</li>
            <li>Laq had more shine to it and if you applied it more than once, it would leave a weird residue on your brows or get flakey.  </li>
            <li>Mainly hardens the hair already on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I dab inside the neck of the bottle with the brush a few times to make sure I don&#x27;t put too much on as I think it will flake.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to order this after reading mostly highly favorable reviews.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was a bit high</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through all sorts of high- and low-end brow products</li>
            <li>Works in high humidity, on oily skin, over pencil or powder.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have tried high end and drug store brands and they still rub off after an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a plastered down look.&lt;br /&gt;You can re brush your brows after they dry and all is good</li>
            <li>, I would recommend it, although as you apply you run the risk of smearing a little bit of your drawn brows off so be sure to pat it on instead of gliding it on your face.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff works!!  </li>
            <li>I think this may be better suited for eyebrows that are drawn on or at the very least, not as full as mine.</li>
            <li>This is about as natural as you&#x27;ll get to having natural lush brows!!I absolutely recommend, without hesitation!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had to reduce how much filling I do in order to maintain a natural look.</li>
            <li>so you all know, it really hardens your brows (feels like you put a bunch of hair spray on them) and doesn&#x27;t feel natural at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t comb it through, I just lightly dab the wet brush over my brows.  </li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter looooves it just as much as i do...</li>
            <li>This will hold your brows in place if you have a normal desk job and that is all you can expect.  </li>
            <li>I feel like for the most part I can get by walking around on a hot day and at least have some backup and not worry as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At long last a way to confidently put on my brows and keep them on without fear of brushing them away or smearing them all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted to buy something like this for a long time now, and I&#x27;m so glad I finally did.</li>
            <li>Love this eyebrow sealer use it everyday</li>
            <li>A little strong when you put it around the eyes but dries fast.</li>
            <li>well by the end of the day, my brows would look like they were melting off, but with this, it keeps them in place most of the day, I would say all day and it does, but I do start to have some eyebrow fade once it gets closer to bedtime, but other than that, this stuff is amazing and a little goes a long ways with this stuff.</li>
            <li>The Model In a Bottle Long Lasting Eyebrow Sealer I ordered from First Class Supply came with a spooly, but no brush!!!</li>
            <li>not stickly and not hard to wash away at the end of the day...</li>
            <li>Normally within a couple of hours of applying my eyebrows &amp; getting them right they would smudge, budge, &amp; totally rub off...</li>
            <li>It removes easily with any facial soap or regular soap and water.</li>
            <li>I have found that plain hairspray works better than this.  </li>
            <li>dries quickly and my eye brows do not look smudged at the end of a long work day.</li>
            <li>*does not* fully live up to expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A NEW INGREDIENT.</li>
            <li>My wife did an eyebrow hair transplant procedure end of 2013 and this product was recommended to her by the hospital to help her in getting all the new hair go into one direction couple of months after the procedure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for two years and just now need to buy a new bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m new to the product</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this stuff...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product...</li>
            <li>I have VERY sparse eyebrows, thanks to my Asian heritage, and have to use an eyebrow pencil to fill in my brows every day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really though, there isn&#x27;t much of a problem at all, I just wanted to state the fact that (for me at least) it isn&#x27;t magic, and just still be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used this a few times and it was okay at first, but really glopped up and when it dried I had to peel it off like cooled hot glue.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s really good and will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>It give my brows a very natural look.  </li>
            <li>Thus far, it&#x27;s kept pencil, powder and wax on eyebrows, like a charm, right where I applied it hours earlier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly skin with very little hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely clear, with no residue so you can&#x27;t even see it&#x27;s there!</li>
            <li>I opened it and it literally looked like clear nail polish!</li>
            <li>I USE THIS WITH MY  Wet n Wild Ultimate Brow Kit C963 Ash BROWN KIT AND LOVE IT</li>
            <li>LAST ALL DAY DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Well the first day I figured I&#x27;d try it on naked skin and</li>
            <li>I first found out about it when my mom did a commercial and the make-up artist</li>
            <li>My brows last all day even on those hot days</li>
            <li>If your a natural girl it will work for you too!</li>
            <li>but glad those days are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>I knocked over my first bottle and the entire thing spilled out)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Funny how this product says it doesn&#x27;t flake and and then later realize at the end of the day your eyebrows are flaking everywhere.</li>
            <li>But after using this, not only are my brows smudge proof they are also pretty water proof.</li>
            <li>I have tried so far!</li>
            <li>Model in a bottle far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>Actually works pretty well , even after falling asleep one night.</li>
            <li>Not only do my brows last the whole day (and still look &#x27;fresh&#x27;)</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  </li>
            <li>Second bottle!!!!Took me a year to run out the first bottle...</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>So, I removed my make-up and tried a different pencil, thinking perhaps maybe the first pencil&#x27;s formula was the culprit.</li>
            <li>It looks really natural, fills in all the blank spots, and stays on well all by itself if you&#x27;re not melting away in the extreme heat  :)</li>
            <li>I ordered a bottle and I received it half filled because it spilled.</li>
            <li>It will do the job for a few hours but after that it will easily wear off.</li>
            <li>My own brows had become almost nonexistent in the last few years, so pencil makeup is a must!  </li>
            <li>I have thick eyebrows and this really helps keep them in place without becoming shiny, crunchy or flaky.  </li>
            <li>My brows look clean, sharp, and natural, all day.</li>
            <li>I fill in my brows daily and love the fact that they look the same way ALL day long.</li>
            <li>The shine isn&#x27;t really noticeable unless you look really close or apply it super thick or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As soon as I brushed it on to my half day old eyebrows the immediately looked better, I did lawn work and sweat my ass off in the humidity.</li>
            <li>worth every single penny!</li>
            <li>Might as well use clear nail polish on your brows.</li>
            <li>It is a clear liquid and does not show at all.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this again, cover girl clear mascara and maybelline</li>
            <li>clear brow gel</li>
            <li>It goes on clear, no shiny kid stuff, and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear.</li>
            <li>This is actually for making eyebrows that you have painted on or applied with makeup, NOT a fixative for your real eyebrows which I don&#x27;t think is clear in the description.</li>
            <li>BUT AS FAR AS EVERYTHING ELSE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 27 years old.</li>
            <li>I even thought maybe I was using too much product, and wiped the brush off as much as possible before applying, and it still happened.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely watery.  </li>
            <li>The shine is also relative to how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trick to getting by with it for those of you who are trying to figure out what to do with this waste of money is to shake off all excess product and to apply lightly.</li>
            <li>Use sparingly because if you put on too much it will flake and look like tiny dandruff.</li>
            <li>I use this this product after I have shaded in my eyebrows with a eyebrow pencil and powder and this product help pop out the hairs making my brows look natural.</li>
            <li>This one won by far.  </li>
            <li>May be because my Shelaq is way old.  </li>
            <li>It did not bother my sensitive skin in any way.</li>
            <li>I draw my eyebrows almost completely in.</li>
            <li>This took the place of Benefit SheLaq which as far as I can tell has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>It also makes them look natural.</li>
            <li>The box itself looked old and like it has been reused.</li>
            <li>I always use a brow brush after to direct my brows.</li>
            <li>eyebrows grow in patchy: there&#x27;s small spots of hair that grow above the general patchy line that looks kind of like an eyebrow &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; so I do feel like I need to draw mine on.</li>
            <li>this works really well when I can&#x27;t get it open</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this because when you put it on it can actually take off the eyebrow makeup you put on.  </li>
            <li>I draw my eyebrows on completely, with a pencil.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I really wish benefit would bring back their sealent.</li>
            <li>so my eyebrows would be melting off my face after a long hot, humid day.</li>
            <li>I have a medical condition so my eyebrows can be very scarce.  </li>
            <li>I have very sparse brows plus a rather sizeable scar that goes across my left brow and temple, so hair doesn&#x27;t grow there.  </li>
            <li>my eyebrows are nearly gone by 5 pm.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped that this product would really seal my eyebrow makeup so that it would last in humidity</li>
            <li>No harsh odor.  </li>
            <li>When Benefit stopped making Shelaq I was in complete panic.  </li>
            <li>and it dries completely invisible.  </li>
            <li>I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have been drawing my eyebrows on since mid-high and im 23years old now.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product for making it possible!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about them smudging.</li>
            <li>Model in a bottle Is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that actually keeps them looking fresh all day without melting or smearing.</li>
            <li>Sorry to those who like me loved that Benefit product that is now discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No matter how many times over the yearsI&#x27;ve told her &#x27;I want them thick&#x27; or &#x27;I&#x27;m trying to re-grow them&#x27;, I would leave the salon with crescent moon eyebrows on my roundish face.</li>
            <li>I used a little and it flaked, used more and it flaked, used even less than the first time flaked.  </li>
            <li>am sold on this product and I am actually ordering more for back up because I dont know of any other product that does what this one does.</li>
            <li>This stuff has no more holding power than a strong hair gel.  </li>
            <li>As a woman with very little body hair, I have to make due with powder and liner for my eyebrows and this little bottle of joy has given me the confidence to do all things that used to make me cringe because of fear that my steady hand and symmetric art would be destroyed!</li>
            <li>I use Brow Zing or MAC eyebrow pencil in black and every once in a while it would melt a little if I tanned or living in Las Vegas, sweated, so this is fabulous and makes everything stay where it should!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and have been using it daily for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure the first time I looked at it that the nailpolish applicator was useless</li>
            <li>so I usually add just a tiny bit of my Razac perm repair on top on it just to give my eyebrow that shine.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wipe off the excess product before applying to your brows-a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so you don&#x27;t need to over-apply to get the full benefit, and it lasts practically the whole day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, it certainly won&#x27;t really hold them ALL DAY LONG....</li>
            <li>, too!tainly won&#x27;t really hold them ALL DAY LONG....</li>
            <li>When I filled them in in the past the pencil or powder I would use would fade or rub off after a while.</li>
            <li>and normally they start wearing off by the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what I expected it to.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE TOO MUCH WILL DRY</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I ran to the supermarket after working outside all day, got home and looked in the mirror to see only half of my eyebrows staring back at me!  </li>
            <li>So this bottle will last me a pretty long time before I have to order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>even though she was trying to remove it very gently from her eyebrows with water and make up removal tissues, she lost few of her new hair because of this product.</li>
            <li>I have major oily skin, this helped with keeping my brows on until I take it off</li>
            <li>I go about my nightly routine and finally take a shower and the hot shower was the only thing that made my brows finally come off.  </li>
            <li>I love this and because you only need so little it will last you so long.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it, and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it, and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>soon will be ordering more, but im thankful that such a small bottle has lasted this long.</li>
            <li>Even on my very oily skin and the heat, it lasted all day till i had to scrub it with a wet rag.</li>
            <li>Also will spill easily if not careful.</li>
            <li>Lost my eyebrows to chemo ten years ago and they grew back white and very sparse and scattered.</li>
            <li>I have been using pencil/powder combo on my barely there brows for 10+ years</li>
            <li>I live in Southern California where the humidity is low this time of year (December).</li>
            <li>I live in the middle of the Mojave Desert and my brows wouldn&#x27;t last in the molten heat without this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spend so much money on the better brow liners because of their lasting power, but having to drop on average $25 every month or so was getting ridiculous</li>
            <li>, my eyebrows do fade slightly over the course of the day depending upon the hot weather/humidity factor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works ok to seal in make up, but no better than any other face setting powder or mist--</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand all the other glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple of weeks, and with oily skin and in extreme heat, it really held up.</li>
            <li>and when I do, I still tend to put my hands on my face and scratch or whatever, only to find that I&#x27;ve smudged, smeared or completely removed my make up, especially in my eye area.  </li>
            <li>IN A LITTLE FOR EXACT SHAPE</li>
            <li>Pretty waterproof but smudges a little after wearing for a while.</li>
            <li>The outer half is pretty much nonexistent and most brow pencils don&#x27;t really stay on through Texas&#x27; summers, especially when I&#x27;m working outside and sweating :(  </li>
            <li>When she used it for the first time it was extremely difficult to remove and was like a super glue.</li>
            <li>Since BeneFit randomly discontinued She Laq, I&#x27;ve been hunting for a suitable alternative.  </li>
            <li>i was disappointed in the \\&quot;performance\\&quot; of this product after i heard from some one that it worked great for them.</li>
            <li>but in general it will last through humidity</li>
            <li>The tail of my eyebrow had never grown hair, it is now full of thick hair.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows didn&#x27;t smudge at all, and I like the little shine it leaves behind, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a third of the price, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to without any odd side effects, and there&#x27;s just as much in the bottle as She-Laq.</li>
            <li>A LITTLE FLAKY, HOW MUCH YOU NEED IS TRIAL AND ERROR</li>
            <li>It leaves a little shine on and around your eyebrow which I don&#x27;t care to much for.</li>

            <li> and I must say its amazing!!</li>
            <li> This is the answer to beautiful eye brows,put your pencil on and go over your brows with this product and Your Brows are set perfect until you take it off!</li>

            <li> So I was very happy to find this product at Amazon and see all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> The brush applicator is great because it allows you to control the amount of the sealer and the brush which is included is wonderful to comb eyebrows.</li>
            <li> it works perfectly and the price os great.  </li>
            <li> Very effective in completing a great eyebrow shaping job!</li>
            <li> Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Keeps my eyebrows looking good all day!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good for the day!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is indeed good stuff, but NOT the all-out best in the way of waterproofing.</li>
            <li> What made my perfected eyebrow fall by the wayside is my oily skin which in turn causes my beautifully faux created arches fade into obscurity.</li>
            <li> Great stuff</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> It was great getting two applicators</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I just received my product and this is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li> I have never been one to write reviews but this product is amazing</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously amazing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> and it looks amazing all day.</li>
            <li> I truly wish they made their own product remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled to have this</li>
            <li> I think of all the times this would have come in handy</li>
            <li> In the morning, I can perfect my arch and in the evening when I get ready to wash my face for the night, the arch is still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also loving the &#x27;IT&#x27; eyebrow pencil from QVC or ULTA.  </li>
            <li> brush is kind of flimsy when applying&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like applying gel.</li>
            <li> I am DELIGHTED to have tried Model in a Bottle...it works so much better than SheLaq</li>
            <li> This brow sealer is amazing, it really keeps my brows looking perfect all day.</li>
            <li> Keeps my eyebrows looking flawless all day and it is super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to get more !!!</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow sealer and it is perfect for hot days when you have a make-up \\&quot;meltdown\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> New to wearing make up and found this perfect</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on as easy as one would like, but once you play with it a while it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> easy to apply, lasted all day, loved it and would buy again.  </li>
            <li> plus my oily skin softens it very easily.</li>
            <li> I will for sure buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I use brow pomade and a pencil most times to color in/thicken my eyebrows and find that when applied sparingly, MIAB is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found thus far</li>
            <li> Anyone who has to draw their brows on knows how embarrassing it is to never be able to touch your own eyebrows, or exercise, or play with your kids, or even have sex without worrying if your eyebrows will rub off.</li>
            <li> I immediately went to the internet looking for a replacement product and I can honestly say Model in a Bottle is BETTER than Shelaq.  </li>
            <li> I can wash it off about as easily as any good eyeliner, and it IS able to rub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love love love model in a bottle!</li>
            <li> (powder looks more natural than using an eyebrow pencil), and then I seal the powder with a dab of this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> I am a very honest person and will definitely recommend the products to all those girlfriends in need of a great color sealer.  </li>
            <li> BUT IT IS SO GREAT FOR KEEPING MY DIVA BROW IN CHECK ;)</li>
            <li> Great product which really works!</li>
            <li> The sealer goes on very smoothly and never flakes.</li>
            <li> I have very light eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have very light and sparse eyebrows</li>
            <li> Then I VERY lightly ran my finger through a brow.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t disturb your brow makeup when you apply it and the nail polish type brush is extremely easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> It comes off easily with soap and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But with just a light stroke of the brush on top of any eyebrow makeup and it&#x27;s locked on until you take it off!  </li>
            <li> Great replacement for my Anastasia clear brow gel, which I also love!</li>
            <li> This is way cheaper and works BETTER in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so, let me start by saying...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like when MOST people say they have no eyebrows,</li>
            <li> Then on top of that, I fill it in with an eyebrow powder.</li>
            <li> I am PLEASED to announce that this product has been a MIRACLE.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> ITS MAGIC IN A BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I LOVE this eyebrow sealer.</li>
            <li> I appreciate being able to have this -</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> TRY IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have tried so many products out there.</li>
            <li> so then you have to put more on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this productüëå in my opinion</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be more of a gel consistency but to my surprise</li>
            <li> but it works credibly well!</li>
            <li> love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I actually love it...</li>
            <li> Love the way it conceals the eye brows.  </li>
            <li> I use it on top of my eyebrow makeup</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I think I like it better than the product I was using before.  </li>
            <li> it just bought me more time throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> and it also contains a spoolie brush that I can use to groom the hairs I do have and make sure none of them sticking out of place.</li>
            <li> It works fabulously!  </li>
            <li> and then I just switched to something better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and would recommend it to anyone who ask.</li>
            <li> I sure think so.</li>
            <li> So definitely a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Lost most of my eye brows and had to draw them on.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was just okay.  </li>
            <li> However, I have a friend who does really like it and says it works great for her.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I get for trying to be inventive.  </li>
            <li> Now I feel confident if I brush my hair away from my eyes, or accidentally touch them, or if it rains or snows.</li>
            <li> Worth it and have kept my eyebrows looking good</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> packaging I received was more purple/nailpolish bottle looking.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> But it works and using it for now. :)</li>
            <li> love this stuff&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a chronic illness and lost most of my brows so summer time is stressful for me because my penciled brows sweat off.</li>

            <li> Well I&#x27;m so glad I did because I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;When in doubt, check it out\\&quot; Model in a Bottle works :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I saw this on YouTube.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for those of us who are hairless in the brow zone.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will work on brow powder better.</li>
            <li> I love this bottle now</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry that I have rubbed off or smeared my brows when touching my face without thinking.  </li>
            <li> + Came in faster than I thought it would. :)</li>
            <li> so I love Model in a Bottle, don&#x27;t have to worry about pencil coming off.</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> just Swype this over top</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re perfect the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work since I have no eye brows at all.</li>
            <li> , I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny brow trail, nor does it alter the color of the brow product like SheLaq did;</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it however some of the product leaked out of the bottle during shipment.</li>
            <li> I DECIDED TO TRY IT BECAUSE I&#x27;M ALWAYS SHAPING MY BROWS, AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I need to draw on most of my eyebrows since chemo therapy.  </li>
            <li> Love the flexibility of the 2 brush styles.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> but the company does not make it any more.  </li>
            <li> I tried to see if also it works for the eye liner to help it stay on, but it didnt, but that was ok....</li>
            <li> love this product and would recommend this eyebrow sealer.</li>
            <li> How else was I to seal my color and make sure that my eyebrows were smudgeproof?</li>
            <li> In a Bottle adds even MORE hours to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> If you have to pencil in your brows like me this stuff is like magic</li>
            <li> Try it you will love it.  </li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> Pleased to say that she loves it and has ordered 2 more since then.</li>
            <li> I use a cream product to fill in my brows and then i apply this over top</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with this product</li>
            <li> I have to say the more I use this product,</li>
            <li> the more I appreciate it.</li>
            <li> In the evening when I go to wash my face for bed, most of my foundation is gone, my blush &amp; bronzer has faded, eyeliner evaporated</li>
            <li> I like shine and it has more of a matte finish</li>
            <li> This worked OK...</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li> Like so many women I over plucked &amp;</li>
            <li> Now I can sweat and wipe in peace, take a nap and continue with my day, and most importantly, SCRATCH MY EYBROWS, without them being under my nails and no longer on my face!</li>
            <li> I love the way I go to work for 8 hrs and come home</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I started coloring in my brows after many mishaps with shaving them with razors.</li>
            <li> It withstands sweat, touching, rain, whatever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I hope they continue to make this product because for the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have to worry about eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li> I first got it, it took a couple times to figure out how much to use and which brush worked best for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have something that I can put on and not worry about, I am super happy with my purchase and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> GREAT PURCHASE HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> With great reviews on here, I had my hopes up too high.</li>
            <li> A VERY CLEAN LOOK BECAUSE OF THE SHINE.</li>
            <li> THE BEST PURCHASE EVER MADE FAR AS MY NAKED BROWS LOL.</li>
            <li> About 5 years ago I decided to get the permanent eyebrows done and they came out pretty good</li>
            <li> but i wasn&#x27;t too impressed to use long term.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, it keeps the eyebrow fillers or pencil in place and do not move.  </li>
            <li> Now my brows look pretty darned good, if I do say so</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> This purchase is definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on and looks okay on.</li>
            <li> If I apply two coats instead of one, it works better for me as it doesn&#x27;t seem to smear as easily AND even in the pool my eyebrows stayed put.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and very happy with product!!, thanks</li>
            <li> This is the best of the best, the only problem is that sometimes it flakes a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I get to enjoy the summer w/o worrying.</li>
            <li> Good merchandise and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This product was price reasonably, shipped in timely manner, received in good condition.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am excited to have this product, I have been searching for years for something that will keep my brows on and this is it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product it last a good while too!</li>
            <li> Great for the price will last a pretty good while.</li>
            <li> but, I can easily wear it for 8-10 hours without ANY smudging</li>
            <li> but, I can easily wear it for 8-10 hours without ANY smudging</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s invisible and easily washes off when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to take it off maybe because I oily skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give 5 stars out easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, affordable, and does everything it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Easily lasts all day, and a nap.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> But removes easily with eye makeup remover or makeup remover wipes.  </li>
            <li> Model in the Bottle wipes off too easy.</li>
            <li> and it wipes off really easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, lasts all day, keeps your brow make-up from smudging and keeps eyebrow hairs in place.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with makeup remover</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Be sure not to apply too much, or it can get kind of flakey.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as strong by night almost as when I put it on at 7am.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has a really strong chemical nail polish like smell.</li>
            <li> Just use a strong hair spray or hair gel in stead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price, and you don&#x27;t need much so this bottle has already lasted me right at 6 months</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price, and you don&#x27;t need much so this bottle has already lasted me right at 6 months</li>
            <li> BUT I NEED A FULL COVERAGE BECAUSE MOST OF MY EYEBROW IS COLORED</li>
            <li> Ok well this stuff was supposed to be my dream come true, but it was not.</li>
            <li> Then It rubs off easier with a cotton ball or washcloth just fine.</li>
            <li> My brows are fine, so I use pencil so the will appear thicker.</li>
            <li> (I have fine medium-brown hair).  </li>
            <li> I ran a half marathon and sweated copiously for two hours and my brows STILL looked perfect at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great, I wear over eyeliner surfing 1-2hours and pretty much stays on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have noticed, however, that without the sealer the beginning of my brows would &#x27;bleed&#x27; into the fine lines between my eyes and with the sealer I did not have this problem, so that&#x27;s a plus for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll continue to use this to keep my brow pencil from bleeding into those fine</li>
            <li> Lol funny now, not so much then.</li>
            <li> and it has helped tremendously!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced the white flakiness others described but realized I needed to take it easy on the sealer.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s hot outside nothing is better at keeping your eyebrows in tact!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased by the free 2-day fast shipping :) bought this because of Carli Bybel from YouTube and so far I am loving it!</li>
            <li> and it dries very, very fast!!</li>
            <li> Best money ever spent!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this, after having read many positive reviews on the seeming magical waterproofing abilities of Model in a Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , they do not look shiny at all, which was a huge problem I had with She-Law.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;ve even used it on my eyeshadow a few times and it works great there, too!</li>
            <li> I recommend not drenching your brows in it - just a light coat does for the day.</li>
            <li> I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SOMEHOW USE SOME LIGHT TRANSPARENT POWDER TO DAB ON IT</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive this item, because when I do my eyebrows I wanted to let them last.</li>
            <li> product comes with a mini mascara type brush or a paint type brush which glides smoothly over powder or pencil.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are so light it looks like I have none.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of product and is such a great deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just the tiniest amount is needed (I use the brush applicator) - everything&#x27;s smooth, no flakes,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the brows &amp;#34;running&amp;#34; or wiping off with accidental light brushes against something.  </li>
            <li> This seals your brows in place perfectly,i can put on a cheap brow pencil</li>
            <li> Works great for keeping drawn in lashes looking the same until it is time to be removed.</li>
            <li> Amazing really works put it on even in the california heat and at the beach</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my filled in brows in place all day.  </li>
            <li> This product is great because you can use any inexpensive drug store brow pencil and this will make it last ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> Great product, it last all day</li>
            <li> But still overall a really great prodcut</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure it just wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> I brush the excess off on the bottle rim and lightly run it over my brows.</li>
            <li> Great product, brows actually last all day, without smearing all over the place.</li>
            <li> When I tried this Model in a Bottle, for the eyebrows, it works fabulous.  </li>
            <li> the service was fast and packed nicely.</li>
            <li> What do you have to lose when it&#x27;s so damn cheap????</li>
            <li> This item was a great find several years ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolute gold!!!</li>
            <li> This really works!!!  </li>
            <li> Very nice product and especially for the price.</li>
            <li> and it is overall very nice</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that does exactly what it says it will, and more.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find the glass bottle with a built-in brow sealer wand and a separate brow brush inside.  </li>
            <li> But today was my first time trying Model in a Bottle, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Once I used it for the first time I was in love.</li>
            <li> It works great at sealing my eye brow powder all day and gel eye liner (when needed for humid days or long evenings).</li>
            <li> So I was excited when I received my Model In A Bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps if you have natural brows, it helps to seal the eyebrow pencil on them, but as me and my best friend do not have brows, and instead prefer to draw ours on each day, we needed a GOOD waterproof sealer to keep them looking fresh and crisp.&lt;br /&gt;Model in a Bottle worked for only so many hours before succumbing to facial oils and sweat, which made them start to feather and look fuzzy, in spite of our ongoing care to dab at our faces with powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in a region of the country renowned for warm weather, so this is a fact of life.  </li>
            <li> I then clean up with a q-tip and sometimes concealer.</li>
            <li> But once I brush them with a dry eyebrow brush, they look great.</li>
            <li> I can not live with out this lol.</li>
            <li> Every Christmas I give my  adult daughters &amp;#34;moms favorite things&amp;#34; in their stockings, and this will be in their stocking this year!</li>
            <li> I use it for when I&#x27;m gonna sweat a lot or be out somewhere all day, or special occasions.</li>
            <li> You can train your eyebrows to grow right and can use it to keep your eyebrow makeup to stay put!  </li>
            <li> I apply it whenever I put on a full face to seal in my brows.  </li>
            <li> So really u could say I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really locks in the color when you fill in your brows.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse brows after many years of tweezing and waxing.  </li>
            <li> and this has been my tried and true.</li>
            <li> The bottle basically looks like it&#x27;s completely full.</li>
            <li> However, it does a good job of having the makeup last all day.</li>
            <li> trying to find more pros, but I really can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have to fill in my brow every day with a combo of liner and powder to create a full brow</li>
            <li> Really wanted to love this product but the flaking wouldn&#x27;t let me.  </li>
            <li> I teach very sweaty power yoga classes ( sometimes as many as six a day) and this works miraculously.</li>
            <li> ~  At least it does work for the eyebrows and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> product lived up to its claim my eyebrows lasted for 2 days without any erasing or smudging what a cool product.  </li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyebrows that are all but invisible, but I&#x27;ve found using an eye primer and setting them with powder works much better than model in a bottle.</li>
            <li> and it is still almost full.</li>
            <li> The powder in particular, is lent a sort of lifelike very gentle sheen that eyebrows normally have, before dense, matte pigmented eyebrow powders are applied, totally thanks to this products excellent design.</li>
            <li> QUICK, SWEET, AND TO THE POINT:&lt;br</li>
            <li> read the many good reviews prior to ordering this product which provided high hopes on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d have to re-up quickly</li>
            <li> However I go through the gel rather quickly.</li>
            <li> product washes off quickly with a cleanser of your choice and water.</li>
            <li> This will even keep your brows in place during a mild workout.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this product, I did some quick googling to read its reviews</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin and</li>
            <li> I need more and will be back soon to hopefully be able to get it.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> So without this product I would be super self conscience that my brows were smeared halfway my face.</li>
            <li> Love it love it finally</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, locks in makeup, and it&#x27;s water AND sweat proof.</li>
            <li> I love it, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is if you leave it on there for more than a day your eyebrows build up crust from the liquid drying</li>
            <li> Package received quickly.</li>
            <li> This is like super hold Hairspray for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> As we get older, many of us lose our eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I mean &#x27;top model&#x27;  on fleek type brows...until they rub off!!!</li>
            <li> The product I had been using a high end for years that had been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I searched many sites and came upon this.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Love this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The top of the bottle came apart from the brush, but I was still able to hold onto the tip of the brush part where it was supposed to be glued in, and was able to apply the product with a little difficulty at holding it.</li>
            <li> use a Rimmel Eyebrow Pencil and it is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Lovely product made me feel normal and not about my trich.</li>
            <li> I have struggled to find cheap and most importantly, sealers that actually work.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and purchased model in a bottle and it came very fast!</li>
            <li> all of you enjoy it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> (yeah, that&#x27;s no way to live), so I was on a mission to find a product comparable to She-Laq or better, if that was even possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and the first lasted a good 6 months.</li>
            <li> If you want smudge &amp; budge proof brows that last &amp; look just as good as when you first did them</li>
            <li> so be careful not to overdo it because it will drip all over you and can get into your eyes which would not be pleasant.</li>
            <li> I feel a little more normal now, lol.</li>
            <li> I chose 2nd option and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It absolutely works!!</li>
            <li> I actually like this better because it doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny coat over the make up!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning on running around outside on a hot summer&#x27;s day be sure to check your brows in the mirror on occasion to make sure they don&#x27;t crust over on account of your sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my brows stay put even in hot humid weather!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims!  </li>
            <li> This product never fails!  </li>
            <li> What a great little problem solver.</li>
            <li> when you consider I can run to the supermarket, get home and still have two pretty eyebrows right where they belong!  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;ve even used it on my eyeshadow a few times and it works great there</li>
            <li> this stuff ,am out ,need to reorder, use everyday works great</li>
            <li> I have very sparse, light brows that I spend five minutes filling in every morning</li>
            <li> This Model in a Bottle stuff doesn&#x27;t have She Laq&#x27;s staying power, but it&#x27;s better than clear mascara or hair gel or anything else that might be used to seal eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde, which is nice, but that means my brows and lashes are totally transparent, which is not so nice.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I finally have my own that I can use at any given time.</li>
            <li> and my eyebrows stay fresh and in shape throughout the day without smearing or smudging.</li>
            <li> it worth the price?</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it considering the price.</li>
            <li> clear mascara gel works way better than this product.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> was the last I was going to own -- they discontinued it who knows when.</li>
            <li> Its worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Great product last all day until i wash it off...and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> ITS WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> Since MiaLLES doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows shine or glisten in the sun, they end up looking much more natural.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny....</li>
            <li> I love it, and I have purchased bottle for other people who equally love it.</li>
            <li> So next I go stand over the hot stove and prepare dinner, surely this will do the bows in!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right...</li>
            <li> Afterwards I use the nail polish looking tip and rub it right over my eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Application does have a bit of a learning curve to figure out the right method and amount of product.</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re washing the brow product right out of your brow.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a formula that you have to get just right so that it will work.  </li>
            <li> I apply this right after I draw and fill in with my brow powder and shape.</li>
            <li> Now I know why and those women are 100% right.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it thru a hot summer but for this price, I definitely am satisfied with results so far.</li>
            <li> Less is more most times.</li>
            <li> This product really works, my eyebrows remain intact for the whole day, I am definitely impressed and would repurchase even though I believe this product will last a very very long time.</li>
            <li> I am SO HAPPY that I purchased this eyebrow sealer - it is a HOLY GRAIL product for me - this definitely seals my eyebrow color in place when I use the white sealing brush</li>
            <li> This is just as good and a lot less $$$ than SheLaq.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, dries clear, and removes easily.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with out this product!!!</li>
            <li> and I use actual eyeshadow and a very cheap eyebrow pencil,</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good purchase if you keep your brows a little thicker.</li>
            <li> so many others, I am happy to report that whenever I use this product, my brows are intact wherever I go, even following a hard day on my hands and knees in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleopatra...</li>
            <li> If you apply a small amount and evenly it works amazingly!</li>
            <li> Exactly as the picture.</li>
            <li> This potion does exactly what its meant to do sans flaking, stiffness etc.</li>
            <li> I apply this first, wait until it dries, and then apply my brow powder over it.  </li>
            <li> I have to first use tea tree oil around my brows because I have super-ridiculously oily skin.</li>
            <li> It does EXACTLY what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> it really works!  </li>
            <li> I like the price, not expensive.</li>
            <li> sure enough - my brows stayed on all day and all thru the night!</li>
            <li> And my package came soo fast!</li>
            <li> I was already nervous the first time I got them done</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the pain and healing process I had to endure the first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such hell shopping for heatproof/melt proof products that I sincerely hope they make this eyebrow sealer forever.</li>
            <li> it works, and it&#x27;s not difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> this is so much better than Anastasia Beverly Hills!&lt;br /&gt;The brush is tiny</li>
            <li> Thanks a million!</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve been using it consistently</li>
            <li> Great product and extremely long lasting!</li>
            <li> tried putting more, different brushes etc</li>
            <li> This sadly is not it.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will, keeps your eyebrows and any color you added in place all day.  </li>
            <li> This product last ALL DAY &amp; NIGHT,absolutely will recommend:)</li>
            <li> Boy, this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says--</li>
            <li> Stays on pretty well even with swimming.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I felt a burning sensation on my brows, which worried me</li>
            <li> This product helps to keep my penciled in brows exactly where I put them.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last more than 4 hours; 2 on another day.  </li>
            <li> The product worked exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I bought this eyebrow sealer in hopes that it would be better than the current one I was using (LeFemme).</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are basically non-existant (thanks to years of over plucking!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gardener - working outside most every day which means perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m sure it can last the whole year!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best eyebrow sealer I&#x27;ve used after trying multiple, &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; &amp; more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have this, my brows stay in place no matter how hot it gets.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it states.  </li>
            <li> i was in cancun for twoweeks and my eyebrows stayed on after a whole day of swimming and overnight!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This seems to hold my brow make up in place pretty well.  </li>
            <li> whats not...this product is my favorite its finish texture it gives to the brow hairs are similar to the anastasia beverly hills</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;waterproof gels and pencils&amp;#34;  nothing has worked better or kept my brows from smudging and smearing than this product.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this and not a different product.</li>
            <li> eyebrows stay on for the whole day!</li>
            <li> If there is a better brand similar to Benefits</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> The second brush not all that good and the one that comes with it in the bottle doesn&#x27;t work on bare skin.</li>
            <li> No shiny finish, no weird flaking.</li>
            <li> I am do glad I finally bought this product.</li>
            <li> it really works!</li>
            <li> This eyebrow sealer preformed for me exactly as described.</li>
            <li> its quite liquid-y like a nail polish , but not sticky or anything....it does give a shine for the first 30 mins or so.....but</li>
            <li> It even lasts through a night of hot salsa dancing, and anything that might come afterwards.</li>
            <li> like the nail polish application for the ends of my eyebrows which is more penciled on than actual hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m buying it again because I&#x27;ve already run through a whole bottle!</li>
            <li> It never smears my eyebrow shadow off and it dries fast!</li>
            <li> I need to order another for myself, all of my friends took mine ;)</li>
            <li> This sealer holds up pretty well to perspiration.</li>
            <li> Also, dont bother spending money on the waterproof brow gels, they dont last any better than inexpensive brow pencils with this product.</li>
            <li> This works really well but do not use a lot!</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> This produce does exactly what it claims to.</li>
            <li> It has worked perfectly, lasting until I go to bed most days.</li>
            <li> Model in a bottle eyebrow sealer is definitely a miracle worker as many customers who have purchased this product reported.</li>
            <li> Really keeps eyebrows in place!</li>
            <li> First thing is I like it comes with two ways to apply the product onto your brows.</li>
            <li> I actually really need the brush!</li>
            <li> My solution: I use a good eyebrow powder and a stiff angled brush to fill in sparse areas of my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I am fair skinned and without my eyebrows in the morning I look very scary,this product does not work even a little bit</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have been a loyal user of Benefit&#x27;s She Laq for years to keep my brows at bay, and had almost a full bottle left to last me until one day</li>
            <li> I ride a motorcycle and constantly worry about not having any makeup on when I take off my helmet, this reduces that significantly !</li>
            <li> No flakes, drys fast, only remove able when applied with washing your face with make up remover.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s necessary to make sure you really wipe the wand off on the bottle before applying.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that you really need to get most of the product off the brush or else</li>
            <li> My skin is super oily and my eyebrows never last a full day...</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of positive reviews on this product I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this product so I decided to buy it because so many people gave it 5 stars, especially the people who have sparse brows, oily skin and live where the weather gets pretty hot and humid.</li>
            <li> And if you apply too much... when it dries, it flakes.&lt;br /&gt;It works well over the Anastasia Brow Pomade (another god send) which I apply first with an angled brush.</li>
            <li> This really works, I have hot flashes</li>
            <li> Now that Benefit doesn&#x27;t make Shelaq any more and my cat spilled my last bottle, I had to find something similar and this actually turned out to be better!</li>
            <li> First time putting it on it burn my eyebrows but it works very well</li>
            <li> and I stay cute all day long.</li>
            <li> But most of them that claimed long wearing &amp; waterproof still isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the secret weapon of all beautiful brows.</li>
            <li> I have long Dreadlocks, my issue was when my hair would sweep across my face trough out the day it would wipe away my perfect brows that I worked so hard to create.  </li>
            <li> AND WASHES OFF EASY WITH MY OLAY FACIAL WASH</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, matte and clear.  </li>
            <li> As someone with sparse brows, I have tried so many so called long wearing or waterproof brow pencils/powders/etc and have never found one that really lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely re-purchase!ter for me as it doesn&#x27;t seem to smear as easily AND even in the pool my eyebrows stayed put.</li>
            <li> It has easily become an HG product and I will definitely be repurchasing when it runs out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d be using the spooly, but this stuff is pure</li>
            <li> the only problem is that it is easy to apply to much and then get some flaking.</li>
            <li> so I have to double wash my eyebrows, which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li> have to use the regular brush, but it also includes a comb if you&#x27;re one of those fortunate ones who still has real eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This definitely does its job, but if you put too much it on it WILL flake lightly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product daily for a few months now &amp; it works GREAT.  </li>
            <li> My brows stays in place and don&#x27;t come off until I&#x27;m ready to take them off.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully really holds the eyebrows in place.</li>
            <li> An absolute friggin&#x27; miracle.</li>
            <li> If you use too much it builds up and flakes</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> It really does make your eyebrows smudge-proof and waterproof.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> This really helps to keep the liner on (whichever type you use).  </li>
            <li> SEEMS TO LEAVE A VERY DEFINED SHINY RESIDUE</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I recommend not putting too much on at a time and even using and eyebrow brush after to sort of comb the sealer through the eyebrow.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE IT</li>
            <li> It works well, but it can get crusty if you add too much on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It really makes my eyebrows stay in place all day and doesn&#x27;t fade the makeup.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very sticky however and too liquidy.</li>
            <li> If you apply too much, it will drip or cause your make-up to run.</li>
            <li> have an oily face, so by night time, my She Laq would stop working so much and</li>
            <li> However, with Model in a Bottle&#x27;s stuff, I haven&#x27;t noticed the product really wearing off.  </li>
            <li> (As a beauty consultant, I know that your eyebrows make your whole face</li>
            <li> but it really truly helps keep my eye brow color on, even through workout sweat</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyebrows and therefore always need  powder on them to make them show.  </li>
            <li> but it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I really dig this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this so much</li>
            <li> Really keeps the eyebrows from sweating off in the heat.</li>
            <li> THIS REALLY WORKS..</li>
            <li> If it worked, I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much</li>
            <li> And unlike the model in a bottle make-up setting spray, this didn&#x27;t really hold my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> If that bothers you, do as I do, simply dust a translucent face powder lightly over the brows after the product dries.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really seal the eyeliner drawn on my eyebrows like I thought.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> I feel like I can now enjoy summer without constantly worrying about my disappearing brows.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> But at the end of the day my eyebrows doesn&#x27;t really look like I have drawn them in the morning.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t use to much your brows stay in place and</li>
            <li> I really like this product because my brows never fade when I use it.</li>
            <li> This product really keeps your brow lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> This really does help to &#x27;seal in&#x27; your brows.</li>
            <li> I really like this one</li>
            <li> THANKS.</li>
            <li> they just aren&#x27;t really into conforming.</li>
            <li> This product coupled with an eyebrow pencil really saves the day.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, after you have your eyebrows</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sssssoooooo much cheaper than Shelaq.  </li>
            <li> , I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seal the brow very well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery&lt;</li>
            <li> and my eyebrows are really patchy.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;eyebrows&amp;#34; don&#x27;t rub off thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I saw this used on youtube from some of the makeup bloggers , and i really wanted to try it because i have braids</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got very sparse eyebrows</li>
            <li> Litterly makes your eyebrows perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anybody that wants their eyebrows to stay in place all day.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It really does keep my brow makeup in place all day.</li>
            <li> AND IT DONT TAKE MUCH TO USE</li>
            <li> This really locks my eyebrows in place, holds the product in place and lasts all day</li>
            <li> This product  works very well.........</li>
            <li> Dries fast.  </li>
            <li> Does not take much to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am putting too much on</li>
            <li> If you apply too much it will look shiny</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve learned that you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> It absolutely does just what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> I found YouTube very helpful in getting reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, works the same!!!</li>
            <li> It works really well-</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t apply too much, or it will harden and make your eyebrows feel like bricks,</li>
            <li> It real works.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smear as much as it would&#x27;ve without the sealer though.</li>
            <li> But again, not as much as it would&#x27;ve without the sealer.</li>
            <li> Maybe this product doesn&#x27;t work as well for me because, as I mentioned, I really DON&#x27;T have any brows to speak of.</li>
            <li> Thus stuff really does work</li>
            <li> I was ready to pay $40-$50 for some shopping network waterproof pencil/powder product.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows stay in place the whole night even if I sweat this stuff</li>
            <li> Sets my eyebrows really well for the whole day until I wash it off.</li>
            <li> I live where it&#x27;s hot and very humid but this keeps them in place.</li>
            <li> Even when it is super HOT outside &amp; my oily skin starts oiling up in my T-zone or if I&#x27;m sweating...</li>
            <li> I researched other customer reviews from various websites &amp; they all had good things to say about this stuff.</li>
            <li> So because, like most women, I pencil in half my eyebrows, I need a product that will remain in place at all times, particularly during the summer months when it&#x27;s hot and the make-up just doesn&#x27;t stay where it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> I bought my original bottle in 2014, three years later I ran out and reordered.</li>
            <li> but before I found this amazing product the powder wouldn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product it actually lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> The two products work exactly the same but Model in a Bottle is half the price for 2x more product!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this item for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I normally use a wax pencil from Ziba for my eyebrows, but this stuff works really well.  </li>
            <li> so I shape them with an eyeliner pencil and apply a dark brown eyeshaodw on top, then seal them in.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;ve changed the formulation as it dries more clear and matte than clear and shiny as it used to, which s definitely a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Until I find something better, this will have to due!</li>
            <li> In one little bottle that it is design to last you a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> And if I do rub my eyebrows after I have sweated,  the part where there is less hair to grab onto will wipe off BUT for the most part my eyebrows are at attention and in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I still have more then half</li>
            <li> Model in a Bottle is a better product at half the price.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve found that less really is more with this</li>
            <li> Once I draw them on (with half the brow penciled in), I just paint over my work of art like a top coat of nail polish.</li>
            <li> You have to apply apply with a light hand and let it dry, but over all I do like it.</li>
            <li> Laq had more shine to it and if you applied it more than once, it would leave a weird residue on your brows or get flakey.  </li>
            <li> Mainly hardens the hair already on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I dab inside the neck of the bottle with the brush a few times to make sure I don&#x27;t put too much on as I think it will flake.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to order this after reading mostly highly favorable reviews.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was a bit high</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through all sorts of high- and low-end brow products</li>
            <li> Works in high humidity, on oily skin, over pencil or powder.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried high end and drug store brands and they still rub off after an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a plastered down look.&lt;br /&gt;You can re brush your brows after they dry and all is good</li>
            <li> , I would recommend it, although as you apply you run the risk of smearing a little bit of your drawn brows off so be sure to pat it on instead of gliding it on your face.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff works!!  </li>
            <li> I think this may be better suited for eyebrows that are drawn on or at the very least, not as full as mine.</li>
            <li> This is about as natural as you&#x27;ll get to having natural lush brows!!I absolutely recommend, without hesitation!!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had to reduce how much filling I do in order to maintain a natural look.</li>
            <li> so you all know, it really hardens your brows (feels like you put a bunch of hair spray on them) and doesn&#x27;t feel natural at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t comb it through, I just lightly dab the wet brush over my brows.  </li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter looooves it just as much as i do...</li>
            <li> This will hold your brows in place if you have a normal desk job and that is all you can expect.  </li>
            <li> I feel like for the most part I can get by walking around on a hot day and at least have some backup and not worry as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At long last a way to confidently put on my brows and keep them on without fear of brushing them away or smearing them all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to buy something like this for a long time now, and I&#x27;m so glad I finally did.</li>
            <li> Love this eyebrow sealer use it everyday</li>
            <li> A little strong when you put it around the eyes but dries fast.</li>
            <li> well by the end of the day, my brows would look like they were melting off, but with this, it keeps them in place most of the day, I would say all day and it does, but I do start to have some eyebrow fade once it gets closer to bedtime, but other than that, this stuff is amazing and a little goes a long ways with this stuff.</li>
            <li> The Model In a Bottle Long Lasting Eyebrow Sealer I ordered from First Class Supply came with a spooly, but no brush!!!</li>
            <li> not stickly and not hard to wash away at the end of the day...</li>
            <li> Normally within a couple of hours of applying my eyebrows &amp; getting them right they would smudge, budge, &amp; totally rub off...</li>
            <li> It removes easily with any facial soap or regular soap and water.</li>
            <li> I have found that plain hairspray works better than this.  </li>
            <li> dries quickly and my eye brows do not look smudged at the end of a long work day.</li>
            <li> *does not* fully live up to expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A NEW INGREDIENT.</li>
            <li> My wife did an eyebrow hair transplant procedure end of 2013 and this product was recommended to her by the hospital to help her in getting all the new hair go into one direction couple of months after the procedure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for two years and just now need to buy a new bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m new to the product</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this stuff...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product...</li>
            <li> I have VERY sparse eyebrows, thanks to my Asian heritage, and have to use an eyebrow pencil to fill in my brows every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really though, there isn&#x27;t much of a problem at all, I just wanted to state the fact that (for me at least) it isn&#x27;t magic, and just still be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used this a few times and it was okay at first, but really glopped up and when it dried I had to peel it off like cooled hot glue.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s really good and will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> It give my brows a very natural look.  </li>
            <li> Thus far, it&#x27;s kept pencil, powder and wax on eyebrows, like a charm, right where I applied it hours earlier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly skin with very little hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely clear, with no residue so you can&#x27;t even see it&#x27;s there!</li>
            <li> I opened it and it literally looked like clear nail polish!</li>
            <li> I USE THIS WITH MY  Wet n Wild Ultimate Brow Kit C963 Ash BROWN KIT AND LOVE IT</li>
            <li> LAST ALL DAY DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li> Well the first day I figured I&#x27;d try it on naked skin and</li>
            <li> I first found out about it when my mom did a commercial and the make-up artist</li>
            <li> My brows last all day even on those hot days</li>
            <li> If your a natural girl it will work for you too!</li>
            <li> but glad those days are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I knocked over my first bottle and the entire thing spilled out)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Funny how this product says it doesn&#x27;t flake and and then later realize at the end of the day your eyebrows are flaking everywhere.</li>
            <li> But after using this, not only are my brows smudge proof they are also pretty water proof.</li>
            <li> I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> Model in a bottle far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Actually works pretty well , even after falling asleep one night.</li>
            <li> Not only do my brows last the whole day (and still look &#x27;fresh&#x27;)</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  </li>
            <li> Second bottle!!!!Took me a year to run out the first bottle...</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> So, I removed my make-up and tried a different pencil, thinking perhaps maybe the first pencil&#x27;s formula was the culprit.</li>
            <li> It looks really natural, fills in all the blank spots, and stays on well all by itself if you&#x27;re not melting away in the extreme heat  :)</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle and I received it half filled because it spilled.</li>
            <li> It will do the job for a few hours but after that it will easily wear off.</li>
            <li> My own brows had become almost nonexistent in the last few years, so pencil makeup is a must!  </li>
            <li> I have thick eyebrows and this really helps keep them in place without becoming shiny, crunchy or flaky.  </li>
            <li> My brows look clean, sharp, and natural, all day.</li>
            <li> I fill in my brows daily and love the fact that they look the same way ALL day long.</li>
            <li> The shine isn&#x27;t really noticeable unless you look really close or apply it super thick or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As soon as I brushed it on to my half day old eyebrows the immediately looked better, I did lawn work and sweat my ass off in the humidity.</li>
            <li> worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> Might as well use clear nail polish on your brows.</li>
            <li> It is a clear liquid and does not show at all.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this again, cover girl clear mascara and maybelline</li>
            <li> clear brow gel</li>
            <li> It goes on clear, no shiny kid stuff, and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear.</li>
            <li> This is actually for making eyebrows that you have painted on or applied with makeup, NOT a fixative for your real eyebrows which I don&#x27;t think is clear in the description.</li>
            <li> BUT AS FAR AS EVERYTHING ELSE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 27 years old.</li>
            <li> I even thought maybe I was using too much product, and wiped the brush off as much as possible before applying, and it still happened.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely watery.  </li>
            <li> The shine is also relative to how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trick to getting by with it for those of you who are trying to figure out what to do with this waste of money is to shake off all excess product and to apply lightly.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly because if you put on too much it will flake and look like tiny dandruff.</li>
            <li> I use this this product after I have shaded in my eyebrows with a eyebrow pencil and powder and this product help pop out the hairs making my brows look natural.</li>
            <li> This one won by far.  </li>
            <li> May be because my Shelaq is way old.  </li>
            <li> It did not bother my sensitive skin in any way.</li>
            <li> I draw my eyebrows almost completely in.</li>
            <li> This took the place of Benefit SheLaq which as far as I can tell has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> It also makes them look natural.</li>
            <li> The box itself looked old and like it has been reused.</li>
            <li> I always use a brow brush after to direct my brows.</li>
            <li> eyebrows grow in patchy: there&#x27;s small spots of hair that grow above the general patchy line that looks kind of like an eyebrow &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; so I do feel like I need to draw mine on.</li>
            <li> this works really well when I can&#x27;t get it open</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this because when you put it on it can actually take off the eyebrow makeup you put on.  </li>
            <li> I draw my eyebrows on completely, with a pencil.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I really wish benefit would bring back their sealent.</li>
            <li> so my eyebrows would be melting off my face after a long hot, humid day.</li>
            <li> I have a medical condition so my eyebrows can be very scarce.  </li>
            <li> I have very sparse brows plus a rather sizeable scar that goes across my left brow and temple, so hair doesn&#x27;t grow there.  </li>
            <li> my eyebrows are nearly gone by 5 pm.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped that this product would really seal my eyebrow makeup so that it would last in humidity</li>
            <li> No harsh odor.  </li>
            <li> When Benefit stopped making Shelaq I was in complete panic.  </li>
            <li> and it dries completely invisible.  </li>
            <li> I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been drawing my eyebrows on since mid-high and im 23years old now.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product for making it possible!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about them smudging.</li>
            <li> Model in a bottle Is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that actually keeps them looking fresh all day without melting or smearing.</li>
            <li> Sorry to those who like me loved that Benefit product that is now discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter how many times over the yearsI&#x27;ve told her &#x27;I want them thick&#x27; or &#x27;I&#x27;m trying to re-grow them&#x27;, I would leave the salon with crescent moon eyebrows on my roundish face.</li>
            <li> I used a little and it flaked, used more and it flaked, used even less than the first time flaked.  </li>
            <li> am sold on this product and I am actually ordering more for back up because I dont know of any other product that does what this one does.</li>
            <li> This stuff has no more holding power than a strong hair gel.  </li>
            <li> As a woman with very little body hair, I have to make due with powder and liner for my eyebrows and this little bottle of joy has given me the confidence to do all things that used to make me cringe because of fear that my steady hand and symmetric art would be destroyed!</li>
            <li> I use Brow Zing or MAC eyebrow pencil in black and every once in a while it would melt a little if I tanned or living in Las Vegas, sweated, so this is fabulous and makes everything stay where it should!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and have been using it daily for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure the first time I looked at it that the nailpolish applicator was useless</li>
            <li> so I usually add just a tiny bit of my Razac perm repair on top on it just to give my eyebrow that shine.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wipe off the excess product before applying to your brows-a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so you don&#x27;t need to over-apply to get the full benefit, and it lasts practically the whole day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, it certainly won&#x27;t really hold them ALL DAY LONG....</li>
            <li> , too!tainly won&#x27;t really hold them ALL DAY LONG....</li>
            <li> When I filled them in in the past the pencil or powder I would use would fade or rub off after a while.</li>
            <li> and normally they start wearing off by the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what I expected it to.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE TOO MUCH WILL DRY</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I ran to the supermarket after working outside all day, got home and looked in the mirror to see only half of my eyebrows staring back at me!  </li>
            <li> So this bottle will last me a pretty long time before I have to order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> even though she was trying to remove it very gently from her eyebrows with water and make up removal tissues, she lost few of her new hair because of this product.</li>
            <li> I have major oily skin, this helped with keeping my brows on until I take it off</li>
            <li> I go about my nightly routine and finally take a shower and the hot shower was the only thing that made my brows finally come off.  </li>
            <li> I love this and because you only need so little it will last you so long.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it, and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it, and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> soon will be ordering more, but im thankful that such a small bottle has lasted this long.</li>
            <li> Even on my very oily skin and the heat, it lasted all day till i had to scrub it with a wet rag.</li>
            <li> Also will spill easily if not careful.</li>
            <li> Lost my eyebrows to chemo ten years ago and they grew back white and very sparse and scattered.</li>
            <li> I have been using pencil/powder combo on my barely there brows for 10+ years</li>
            <li> I live in Southern California where the humidity is low this time of year (December).</li>
            <li> I live in the middle of the Mojave Desert and my brows wouldn&#x27;t last in the molten heat without this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spend so much money on the better brow liners because of their lasting power, but having to drop on average $25 every month or so was getting ridiculous</li>
            <li> , my eyebrows do fade slightly over the course of the day depending upon the hot weather/humidity factor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works ok to seal in make up, but no better than any other face setting powder or mist--</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand all the other glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of weeks, and with oily skin and in extreme heat, it really held up.</li>
            <li> and when I do, I still tend to put my hands on my face and scratch or whatever, only to find that I&#x27;ve smudged, smeared or completely removed my make up, especially in my eye area.  </li>
            <li> IN A LITTLE FOR EXACT SHAPE</li>
            <li> Pretty waterproof but smudges a little after wearing for a while.</li>
            <li> The outer half is pretty much nonexistent and most brow pencils don&#x27;t really stay on through Texas&#x27; summers, especially when I&#x27;m working outside and sweating :(  </li>
            <li> When she used it for the first time it was extremely difficult to remove and was like a super glue.</li>
            <li> Since BeneFit randomly discontinued She Laq, I&#x27;ve been hunting for a suitable alternative.  </li>
            <li> i was disappointed in the \\&quot;performance\\&quot; of this product after i heard from some one that it worked great for them.</li>
            <li> but in general it will last through humidity</li>
            <li> The tail of my eyebrow had never grown hair, it is now full of thick hair.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows didn&#x27;t smudge at all, and I like the little shine it leaves behind, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a third of the price, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to without any odd side effects, and there&#x27;s just as much in the bottle as She-Laq.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE FLAKY, HOW MUCH YOU NEED IS TRIAL AND ERROR</li>
            <li> It leaves a little shine on and around your eyebrow which I don&#x27;t care to much for.</li>
            <li> Also if you apply to much, once it dries your brows will feel stiff and might flake if you scratch at them.</li>
            <li> The price is right, shipping fees are a bit excessive, but as long as they make it, I&#x27;ll buy and recommend it!  </li>
            <li> I have very sparse brows and hoped this product would allow me to go a few days without having to draw them in, but it doesn&#x27;t last quite that long (only if you don&#x27;t shower and sleep standing up)</li>
            <li> Just watch how much you put because a little goes a long way and it does make you eyebrows harden.</li>
            <li> It really works and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product came with high recommendations from YouTube but my  experience this product offered little to no sealant power.</li>
            <li> I found it very \\&quot;wet\\&quot; relative to a Merle Norman product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Model in a Bottle Long Lasting Eyebrow Sealer is my daily!</li>
            <li> Anyway, due to pulling them out for so long, they completely stopped growing back.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to people who have to fill their eyebrows in everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in San Diego and a couple weeks ago the temps were in the high 90&#x27;s and a few days we got into the 100&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It is wet&amp; thin like water, so go easy with it.  </li>
            <li> Then throughout the day you start to notice dry white stuff on your eyebrows (similar to hairspray).</li>
            <li> This stuff works ok at keeping your eyebrows in place, but it gets very crispy and hard which can make your eyebrows look really fake.  </li>
            <li> Typically, after the first 1-2 hours of applying my eyebrows, they ALREADY start looking like they&#x27;re just WAITING to slide down my face.</li>
            <li> I usually use a brow gel like Anastasias that has real holding power.</li>
            <li> A TINY BIT GOES A LONG WAYYYY TRUST ME.</li>
            <li> so this is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> led me to Model in a Bottle&#x27;s Long Lasting Eyebrow Sealer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item because I needed a product that would provide long lasting brows.</li>
            <li> product seems to last a long time as well; I&#x27;ve had mine for a month</li>
            <li> If your brows lose their color after you fill them in, this is the key to keeping them on all day long.</li>
            <li> This is the gold standard for  keeping brows in place all day long.  </li>
            <li> use this product daily and it lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have been such a problem for so long.  </li>
            <li> This product helps seal my brow makeup for a long lasting look</li>
            <li> so it will last a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like it, its long lasting like it said.</li>
            <li> Normally I have to use concealer, powder, then do my brows and a few</li>
            <li> It comes with 2 different applicators, bottle is the size of an average nail polish bottle, so it will last forever, as you only use a tiny bit.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well with brow powder and it CAN get clumpy and dry white</li>
            <li> I draw my eyebrows on daily, and there is nothing more infuriating than forgetting and accident</li>
            <li> So I penciled in my brows, brushed model in a bottle on, let it dry and took a nap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it multiple times and it flakes every single time (work, yoga,</li>
            <li> It did keep it on very well but also left a shiny coat like nail polish on my brows which was not very attractive.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably the most annoying part and the reason this stuff is stiff sitting in my bathroom almost full.  </li>
            <li> My guess is that the people who are leaving negative reviews probably are applying too much.  </li>
            <li> MY BROWS ALL DAY LONG</li>
            <li> This product keeps my eyebrows intact all day long.</li>
            <li> bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so your saving money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> keeps penciled/ filled-in brows in place for long wear.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> It holds, but don&#x27;t expect it to hold for a long time.</li>
            <li> My brows are never complete without this.</li>
            <li> Holds my brows in place all day long.  </li>
            <li> And it will save you money in the long run.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have disappeared, but I can rely on my brow makeup staying on as long as I apply the Model in a Bottle sealer.</li>
            <li> NOTE: be extra careful when sealing eye liner.</li>
            <li> Yes, a 1000 x yes I can&#x27;t believe I lived this long without this product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my brows intact all day long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, Benefit&#x27;s She-Laq was discontinued not too long ago.</li>
            <li> It holds my brow hairs in place all day long.</li>
            <li> Works well but flakes after a long day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my sister who is a personal trainer so she needed a long lasting, &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; product to keep her eyebrows on during extreme workouts!</li>
            <li> half my eyebrows are only penciled in as the hair left sometime ago.</li>
            <li> when what they really mean is, their eyebrows just aren&#x27;t very visible.</li>
            <li> When I take my makeup off at night I have to rub pretty hard with a makeup remover wipe to get my brows off!  </li>
            <li> The only small criticism I have is that the applicator didn&#x27;t attach too well initially, however, currently it&#x27;s in place.</li>
            <li> I placed a small sample on the back of my hand and 5 hours later and after four to five hand washes, AND IT IS STILL ON THE BACK OF MY HAND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My days are extremely long!</li>
            <li> This product will keep your brows in place all day long!</li>
            <li> Of course I was a victim of over plucking, so I have to fill in my brows to avoid looking strange.</li>
            <li> and lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how I happened to stumble across it - but it works miracles for my shaded brows!  </li>
            <li> As you will see in the picture attached, I applied this to one eyebrow and left the other one without it</li>
            <li> It works and it sets my eyebrows in place all day long!</li>
            <li> Wish I had this LONG TIME AGO!</li>
            <li> This product seals the deal so my brows last and look natural after a hard days work.</li>
            <li> also dry&#x27;s with out</li>
            <li> Let this stuff set and dry.</li>
            <li> So I penciled my brows, applied the sealer and waited for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I again applied the sealer and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Granted, I didn&#x27;t WIPE my eyebrows dry</li>
            <li> but I did pat them dry with a towel.</li>
            <li> Granted, I didn&#x27;t WIPE my eyebrows dry</li>
            <li> but I did pat them dry with a towel.</li>
            <li> They are thick near the bridge of my nose, and then at the arch, they suddenly taper off to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> I can not live without this stuff</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really hold down my brows as well as a past product that has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> So, here is what I have to do EVERY SINGLE DAY of my life in order to have eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I will use this every single day.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY DOWN SIDE TO IT</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s seriously like using clear nolish as a topcoat for your brows, but they feel VERY stiff, and almost shiny if you put too much.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows stay intact and dry!</li>
            <li> and I still have half a bottle left....</li>
            <li> Previously I had used Shelac by Benefit to keep the powder lasting all day.  </li>
            <li> It does produce a gloss that I&#x27;m not particularly fond of, but it does work.</li>
            <li> And it is half or a third of the price of the Shelaq was.</li>
            <li> The bottle last for a long time if used correctly,it doesnt make my brow feel heavy at all</li>
            <li> so i went in search of a similar product and found this which is half the price and does the job.</li>
            <li> half asian and in the heat my face always sweats a LOT</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only half way through it.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like using this when I know I&#x27;m working long days at the office</li>
            <li> Since you only brush on a little amount, the little bottle will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thin, watery formula that dries quickly.</li>
            <li> You only need a little .  </li>
            <li> and you only need a little bit and IT WORKS.  </li>
            <li> And since I shave my eyebrows off and draw them back on, the alcohol did sting a little</li>
            <li> and I wiped both eyebrows with a little pressure at the same time with my fingers and it stayed on!</li>
            <li> Leaves little white flakes that look like dandruff</li>
            <li> Instead I ended up getting this hard white film on my eyebrows later that night.</li>
            <li> Yes, the bottle is small, but I can imagine it is going to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL WITH THE AMOUNT OF LAYERS</li>
            <li> SO I NEED TO COVER A LARGER AREA INSTEAD OF JUST A FEW UNRULY EYEBROWS.MAYBE</li>
            <li> I used Benefit&#x27;s She Laq for the last few years on my eyebrows, but when they quit making it</li>
            <li> my penciled-in brows would get smudged if I wasn&#x27;t careful -</li>
            <li> it make my eye brow all wet and</li>
            <li> I work outside doing a manual labor job all year round.</li>
            <li> not allow the product to escape beneath the brow or you will see what looks like dried glue on your upper lids.  </li>
            <li> I received an empty bottle...</li>
            <li> I have missing hair in my eyebrows and when I put eyebrow pencil on them, this makes the pencil last longer.  </li>
            <li> After I put on my eyebrow makeup then I apply this, the brush is too wet that my eyebrow makeup comes off.</li>
            <li> It was twenty dollars cheaper than She-Laq was, and after I read a few reviews (especially compelled by people who had also used She-Laq)</li>
            <li> After that I carefully apply this product.</li>
            <li> I put it on one Saturday night, went out dancing and sweat a lot, then spent Sunday at the beach without ever having to reapply.</li>
            <li> If you want your eyebrow color/powder to last even longer, use Shiseido Extra Smooth Sun Protection Lotion SPF 34 PA --100ml/3.4oz for Women as a base BEFORE you start working on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I tried it with a few different pencils and varying amounts of product from almost nothing to a lot.</li>
            <li> Warning before you use the brush shake the brush so that you do not use to much product, it can make you have stiff, hard eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Can NOT live without!!</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount, so the bottle lasts a VERY long time, making this an extremely affordable product.  </li>
            <li> I used it twice and each time around 4-5 hours later all of my penciled eyebrows have disappeared and I wear my eyebrows dark and heavy</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s the thing: a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I little bit goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> but this little bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I recommend it and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Affordable, and a little bit goes a  long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way in this case.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I believe if you have eyebrows</li>
            <li> Hairspray on a brush will work have similar if not better results.</li>
            <li> And, a little product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> There are other products out there that do work - but not this one.</li>
            <li> It does keep my eyebrows on all day and I have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> , as one if the other reviewers said..</li>
            <li> This is just as expected!</li>
            <li> Also try other Model in a Bottle products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brow sealers</li>
            <li> A spoolie/mascara wand, and the other is like a nail polish brush.</li>
            <li> My brows do not smudge or rub off in the middle of the day like it usually does.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> No glossy look like other products.</li>
            <li> So I  cannot compare it to any other brand.</li>
            <li> I will.try other products by this company.</li>
            <li> must have to all the women other there that fills in their eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It even holds up in extreme conditions like the pool.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> and it dries, I may do a slight touch up of powder or pencil for extra color, but I usually don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> However, waterproof lipstick removers w/ a oil base, baby oil, and my favorite technique due to my acne prone skin...</li>
            <li> Its half the cost of other sealers.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really hard to open after a while.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I also have very oily skin, which makes my makeup slide</li>
            <li> But I am sad to say that it doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;seal\\&quot; my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and you get a mini dark brown pencil, mini gel and tweezers.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and doesn&#x27;t get weirdly shiny like Shelaq did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday for the last few weeks and swear by it now!</li>
            <li> Anyway It&#x27;s better than any trick (powder, base..)</li>
            <li> My only caution is don&#x27;t apply it too thick, it will flake.</li>
            <li> After a while it calmed down.</li>
            <li> To cut down on the shine you can get I pat it after putting it on.</li>
            <li> But it runs down my face if I don&#x27;t wipe the brush off on the edge of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to water it down as I did Shelaq</li>
            <li> I use it every morning to keep my eyebrows on and it never lets me down.</li>
            <li> (Creating glass art in extreme temperatures makes you sweat too much.)&lt;br /&gt;Anyways!</li>
            <li> and i mean they stay put until u take it off with your regular cleanser...</li>
            <li> Sometimes it stings a little, like some other reviews have mentioned, but it doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it stings a little, like some other reviews have mentioned, but it doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it.</li>
            <li> After penciling in my eyebrows, I brush on a small amount of this eyebrow sealer and let it dry for a minute.</li>
            <li> It comes with a spoolie brush and a paint brush (like in a nail poilsh), but I prefer the spoolie as it gets less product on your brows.  </li>
            <li> - typically I have to go without eyebrow pencil when there because it just melts off.</li>
            <li> ; I have black eyebrows and never had a problem.</li>
            <li> I used black, and would always make the mistake of rubbing my face, and taking off half of my eyebrow with the wipe.</li>
            <li> Of course my face is still an oily mess by the end of the day but my eyebrows?</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t, the product is a little too shiney (gives it a slightly plastered look)</li>
            <li> and I live in fear of my eyebrow pencil wearing off--especially while swimming or sweating a lot--and showing the world my imperfect brows (silly as that sounds).</li>
            <li> , this is my new got to have beauty secret!</li>
            <li> I really do not have anything bad to say about this product, this is the first time I have ever used eyebrow concealer.</li>
            <li> I have very little hair due to over plucking and draw my eyebrows on every day.</li>
            <li> I spray a little on my finger, and tap it over my brow area.</li>
            <li> I use the mascara-looking brush and dab a little of the liquid off</li>
            <li> My trick is A little moisturizer slathered across the brow...</li>
            <li> I sometimes dab a little after I apply my eyeliner (it does sting a little) but it helps keep it in place all day.</li>
            <li> It dries a little shiny</li>
            <li> My only warning is don&#x27;t make the dumb mistake I made by trying to see if the &amp;#34;lash brush&amp;#34; would make this product work on eye lashes; oh BOY did my eyes burn within 2 seconds of application</li>
            <li> With Model in a Bottle, I just apply a little bit to my eyebrows after applying the pencil, and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little to watery for me.</li>
            <li> Not shiny like other things I&#x27;ve used it the past.</li>
            <li> I use a gel based eyebrow pencil that seems to fade a little throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> There is a little crumbling sometimes, but not often.</li>
            <li> Had to put a little oil on my brows to hide the flaking.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is it flaked some!</li>
            <li> and I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, as I&#x27;ve been drawing my brows on for 20+ yrs due to a cold wax mishap in high school.</li>
            <li> Whether I put on a lot or a little after a few minutes my eyes brows have flakes of dried product on them.</li>
            <li> If you have oily or combo skin, and you have to use brow pencil or powder to not look crazy, this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Of course, common sense will tell you that if you rub your eyebrows while you seal them with MiaLLES, then DUH, you will definitely experience flaking.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I get dried flakes and don&#x27;t know until I look in a mirror.</li>
            <li> This is a must to product for me to use everyday.</li>
            <li> (liquid is thin and will leak if you dont close the lid properly.</li>
            <li> (I use it everyday)</li>
            <li> I have Trich and have NO eyebrows, so I paint them on everyday</li>
            <li> I draw mine on everyday.</li>
            <li> But either way it doesnt matter, because Shelaq is not available anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have had an irritating problem with eyebrow pencil rubbing off several times during the day and having to be reapplied.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it a few days a week.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on it and watched a few videos</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> My brows made it through a few laps and dives  </li>
            <li> I draw my eyebrows on everyday and they would be almost gone by midday.</li>
            <li> The downside of that was within a few hours</li>
            <li> I got this a few weeks ago at IMATS NYC</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it makes my skin itch after it&#x27;s been on a few hours.  </li>
            <li> but the only problem that I have, one of the brushes were broken.</li>
            <li> I had tried this Model in a Bottle a few months ago, just to see how it was.  </li>
            <li> Then I used it to go to the beach, because there&#x27;s nothing worse then your eyebrows falling/sweating off in public.</li>
            <li> This product made my eyebrows flake within a few hours after applying.</li>
            <li> I wasted money getting this,  </li>
            <li> what a WASTE.</li>
            <li> I bought it around 3 months ago use it almost everyday</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wear it every day because it feels a little stiff, but if you know you&#x27;re going to need eyebrow insurance (on a night out or something)</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s even more of a nightmare knowing that BECAUSE I have such terribly oily skin, I walk around all day long in fear that my fake \\&quot;eyebrows\\&quot; will come melting down my face at the slightest sign of humidity, and God forbid, rain...and that it will expose my eyebrowless face.</li>
            <li> , so usually my makeup brows will come off and drip down my face.</li>
            <li> I must note that you should not be heavy handed with this product as it will give your eyebrows a severely stiff almost tacky look.</li>
            <li> half the price as my past sealer</li>
            <li> I can put it on before bed and wake up looking way less alien like.</li>
            <li> I put less on and my eyebrows will not stay in place!</li>
            <li> By the end of my work day (Normally 10 hours) I‚Äôm an oily mess and my eyebrows look like two dirty grease stains.</li>
            <li> Due to over-tweezing in the late 80&#x27;s my eyebrows are almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> plus, my brows aren&#x27;t stiff.  </li>
            <li> It does keep the brow in place and not easily rubbed off.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it A LOT less expensive than the Shelac</li>
            <li> No more missing eyebrows.</li>
            <li> So far this is possibly the second worst purchase I have ever made online.  </li>
            <li> I have always had thick dark eyebrows that need taming...even after years of electrolysis.</li>
            <li> I then brush my eyebrows with a thin layer and let dry.</li>
            <li> Keeps brows in place...makes them a little hard though.</li>
            <li> I live in New England and it does 100% of the time stay put for me in the nasty humidity here.</li>
            <li> You have to apply VERY little so the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I have very little eyebrows, and pencil them</li>
            <li> Save your money by just using a small brush and some hairspray out of a pump bottle (not aerosol).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I can get two days from just a small smear on both eyebrows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging: Identical to the picture, its a glass nail polis looking bottle with a thin translucent pink liquid that comes with 2 applicator options.</li>
            <li> A small square tip plastic bristled brush and a spoolie.</li>
            <li> I workout every day and unfortunately, this sealer does not last through a sweat</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small for on the go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it advertises as being waterproof</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the same problems as others with She-Laq; it dries to a shiny finish, after six hours it starts to flake and get this weird powdery effect</li>
            <li> No more disappearing eyebrows in the afternoon....</li>
            <li> and I look like an alien without filling them in.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> No more rubbing off with your hand or shirt accidentally.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> The bottle is small but you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
            <li> my eyebrows feel too slick,</li>
            <li> But no more worrying about my eyebrows being gone halfway throughout the day...</li>
            <li> This product also comes with a a small spooly brush for thoes who want  to tame thick unruly brows.</li>
            <li> Then after this stuff is applied, touch ups to your brow are impossible, the powder just doesn&#x27;t sit normally.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows and color them in on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It certainly works, but it leaves your eyebrows so stiff and it&#x27;s difficult to apply without removing the eyebrow powder/cream, pencil you have just applied!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little afraid to try swimming with this as I noticed that my eyebrow pencil/shadow combination comes off at least a little when I get my face wet.</li>
            <li> it will lock them eyebrows down, without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve been penciling my brows for a very long time.</li>
            <li> but it hardly looks like I&#x27;ve made a dent in the bottle</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve hardly put a dent in it.  </li>
            <li> Once I started doing that, I still had to learn not to press it too hard against my brow--or it took my eyebrow pencil off with it.  </li>
            <li> No more stiff shiny brows here!!  </li>
            <li> Helps to keep my eyebrow makeup on for at least a day, sometimes longer.  </li>
            <li> thats common sense</li>
            <li> know some reviewers complained about it flaking</li>
            <li> Any negative reviews has to be that they were not using it correctly, I swear by this stuff.</li>
            <li> so I fill mine in everday and throughout the day, the pencil slowly starts to wear off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However... and I don&#x27;t mean to be nit-picky here in the least - it</li>
            <li> When I say I have no eyebrows, I mean it.</li>
            <li> No more disappearing brows!</li>
            <li> I use it over my usual brow powder and it keeps everything in place all day - even in heat and humidity!</li>
            <li> and I mean ALL day..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased and waiting for my brush!</li>
            <li> I have a really stupid hair pulling disorder, and in high school</li>
            <li> Ill put it on if im just laying down for a min</li>
            <li> The only con I can think of is that it&#x27;s almost impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> and I do not worry about having a random half eyebrow.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive option to hold my &amp;#34;Brooke Shield&amp;#34; type eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I was seriously considering having permanent makeup tattooed on my brows</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously-</li>
            <li> Whether to tame unruly brows or to set them like I have, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I used a little, and a lot, either way, this stuff flaked, and stung, AND my eyebrows STILL smudged!!!</li>
            <li> Like from sun up to late night!</li>
            <li> Just after I received it and used it for the first time, I came down with a horrible cold that kept me in bed for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very thinly so you need very little</li>
            <li> If not BETTER!!  </li>
            <li> A waste of time and money!!!</li>
            <li> My brows are fairly thin, so I have to fill them in quite a bit to get the look I want.</li>
            <li> AND WOULD PROBABLY LOOK EVEN WORSE?</li>
            <li> So tap off the brush and apply a thin layer and you&#x27;ll be set.</li>
            <li> I have thin eyebrows</li>
            <li> and it was a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> Im one of those girls that unfortunately over plucked her eyebrows and now have to draw them on daily :(&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> However, while this product does have a little shine, I don&#x27;t find this product to be nearly as bad.  </li>
            <li> I am so self conscious of this and have had terrible experiences of accidentally wiping them off or smugging them during work...</li>
            <li> I just look terrible without complete eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it is NOT ideal as an eyeliner sealant.  </li>
            <li> For gals who draw on their eyebrows EVERYDAY like it&#x27;s their job (like myself), this was simply tragic.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it&#x27;s a nightmare.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was sold fake</li>
            <li> It flakes and turns white, which is especially annoying.  </li>
            <li> I read that this worked for keeping drawn on eyebrows in place &amp; was skeptical at 1st</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s difficult to remove either.  </li>
            <li> and I get random compliments</li>
            <li> I was also sorry to find the product did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> You will not be sorry with  this.</li>
            <li> the color ( auburn for me...very difficult) doesn&#x27;t move.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s nothing compared to those expensive eye brow pencils.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not a good look!!  </li>
            <li> Applied it to one eyebrow and within an hour, my eyebrow felt weird</li>
            <li> It does have staying power but the flaking makes it useless for me.</li>
            <li> and I never have to worry about my brows smudging at an uncomfortable time.</li>
            <li> Not happy!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows and use pencil and powder to make up for the lack of density.</li>
            <li> very thin and sparse eyebrows and this sealer works well with my Anastasia eyebrow pencil and powder.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible always wondering if some had wiped off or melted away and wondered what odd shape my brows had ended up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try because, quite frankly, I was desperate.</li>
            <li> Also, before finding this product, I was always scared that when my boyfriend touched my face, he&#x27;d wipe an eyebrow off by accident, which would be REALLY awkward.</li>
            <li> In the heat of the summer it doesn&#x27;t smear or run, and in the cold of the winter it doesn&#x27;t let my eyebrows get rubbed off by my hat.</li>
            <li> I was desperately looking for something that would keep my eyebrow pencil on for extended periods.</li>
            <li> Since I have crazy oily skin</li>
            <li> No smell, no sticky weird feeling!</li>
            <li> Because it is USELESS!  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this because I have tried everything when it comes to eyebrows.</li>
            <li> When I finally got to a mirror to see how horrible I looked, I found I did look horrible</li>
            <li> These bad boys don&#x27;t move until I cleanse my face at the end of the day...</li>
            <li> Since the price wasn&#x27;t bad, I decided to try it</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve heard that one problem with these type of products is the shine it sometimes leaves or a residue of some sort, but I don&#x27;t find it all that bad with this product.</li>
            <li> (Yes, it was that bad.)</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch or a knock off.</li>
            <li> NOTHING BAD TO SAY.</li>
            <li> Too bad Benefit discountined</li>
            <li> It works, but it burns really bad from the alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I sifted through the reviews,despite some people with bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I am so mad I stupidly believed this works</li>
            <li> If you are expecting this to be the wonder replacement product, you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what it feels and looks like. :(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> All FAIL!!</li>
            <li> I know, it&#x27;s just as stupid as it sounds, but I can&#x27;t help it.</li>
            <li> I even wore it in Vegas one summer when I stupidly walked from Circus Circus to the Venetian.</li>
            <li> Stupid.</li>
            <li> but this was crap.  </li>
            <li> I hate disappearing brows and this product takes care of that.  </li>
            <li> I have lost all my eyebrow hairs and hate having to draw my brows on each day.  </li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> I hate that they changed the formula, I can tell because when I go to put on my eyebrow pencil</li>
            <li> Too bad it wasn&#x27;t around in her day!</li>
            <li> I was shocked, but relieved I found something!</li>
            <li> Try it you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed when they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyebrows look horrible.  </li>
            <li> Eyeliner &amp; eyebrow pencil seem to get the worst of it, and eyebrow wax melts before your front doors even locked to leave home.</li>
            <li> It is horrible on keeping even waterproof liner in place.  </li>
            <li> my brows are melting off by the end of the day with the awful humidity we have in Washington D.C. during the summer months.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible prodouct to use if you are using eyebrow pencil or brush-on eyebrow makeup and wish to seal it in place.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s disgusting and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I would apply eyebrow pencil and by mid-morning the eyebrow pencil would start to melt and look horrible.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wash or cleanse my face for two days since I was so miserable.  </li>
            <li> It runs awful and makes my brows come out patchy</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s second purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> It does what it says. My brows stays in place and don&#x27;t come off until I&#x27;m ready to take them off.</li>
            <li> Exactly as the picture. Very nice product and especially for the price. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff - I use it every day!</li>
            <li> Save your money by just using a small brush and some hairspray out of a pump bottle (not aerosol).</li>
            <li> Fabu ....  this product rocks it works.....it last&#x27;s I will buy this again..</li>
            <li> I USE THIS WITH MY  Wet n Wild Ultimate Brow Kit C963 Ash BROWN KIT AND LOVE IT I GOT SOAKED IN THE RAIN AND MY BROWS ARE STILL THERE I NEED TO USE IT IN THE POOL BUT AS FAR AS EVERYTHING ELSE I HAVENT HAD A PROBLEM FLAKING OR ANYTHING. A TINY BIT GOES A LONG WAYYYY TRUST ME. THIS BOTTLE WILL LAST ME FOREVER...LOL</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing!  This potion does exactly what its meant to do sans flaking, stiffness etc. It also enhances the brow colour so I&#x27;ve had to reduce how much filling I do in order to maintain a natural look. My definite go to for my brows</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several eyebrow sealers from Urban Decay and Anastasia. This is way cheaper and works BETTER in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that holds my brows in place all day!  I love this product.  A little goes a long way.  Be sure not to apply too much, or it can get kind of flakey.  I apply this first, wait until it dries, and then apply my brow powder over it.  Yes, the bottle is small, but I can imagine it is going to last a long time.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It works wonderfully really holds the eyebrows in place. Just watch how much you put because a little goes a long way and it does make you eyebrows harden. But other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Okay, so, let me start by saying...although this is embarrassing to admit...I have no eyebrows. That&#x27;s right...none. When I say I have no eyebrows, I mean it. It&#x27;s not like when MOST people say they have no eyebrows, when what they really mean is, their eyebrows just aren&#x27;t very visible. No, that&#x27;s not me. I DO NOT have eyebrows. No hairs. At ALL. I have a really stupid hair pulling disorder, and in high school I-naturally-pulled them all out. I know, it&#x27;s just as stupid as it sounds, but I can&#x27;t help it. Anyway, due to pulling them out for so long, they completely stopped growing back. I&#x27;m now 27 years old. I have not touched my eyebrows in over 3 years in hopes to let them grow up, but not even a hair comes through. So, here is what I have to do EVERY SINGLE DAY of my life in order to have eyebrows. I have to first use tea tree oil around my brows because I have super-ridiculously oily skin. Then, I have to use a primer. I then apply cornstarch (another oil fighting tradition). THEN, I draw THE eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil. Then on top of that, I fill it in with an eyebrow powder. This takes a good 30 minutes of my make-up applying time. Needless to say, it&#x27;s a nightmare. But, it&#x27;s even more of a nightmare knowing that BECAUSE I have such terribly oily skin, I walk around all day long in fear that my fake \\&quot;eyebrows\\&quot; will come melting down my face at the slightest sign of humidity, and God forbid, rain...and that it will expose my eyebrowless face. I decided to give this a try because, quite frankly, I was desperate. I just needed SOMETHING that could keep my eyebrow make-up in place enough to lift SOME of my anxiety about them washing or melting off. I am PLEASED to announce that this product has been a MIRACLE. An absolute friggin&#x27; miracle. It does EXACTLY what it says it will do. Typically, after the first 1-2 hours of applying my eyebrows, they ALREADY start looking like they&#x27;re just WAITING to slide down my face. But, not with this stuff. I&#x27;ll admit, it certainly won&#x27;t really hold them ALL DAY LONG....but, I can easily wear it for 8-10 hours without ANY smudging AT ALL. I&#x27;ve even TRIED to make it smudge after 30 minutes to an hour after applying...at that point, since it&#x27;s still relatively new-on-face, it won&#x27;t even come off on your finger! It&#x27;s amazing. So, go for it. It&#x27;s a great price, and you don&#x27;t need much so this bottle has already lasted me right at 6 months and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it, and it works wonders. You can&#x27;t go wrong. I won&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;ve even used it on my eyeshadow a few times and it works great there, too!tainly won&#x27;t really hold them ALL DAY LONG....but, I can easily wear it for 8-10 hours without ANY smudging AT ALL.

            <li> I purchased MIAB some time ago (not from Amazon) after seeing a YouTuber use it.  I dont wear makeup often and when I do, I still tend to put my hands on my face and scratch or whatever, only to find that I&#x27;ve smudged, smeared or completely removed my make up, especially in my eye area.  I use brow pomade and a pencil most times to color in/thicken my eyebrows and find that when applied sparingly, MIAB is amazing.  If you use too much it builds up and flakes and/or looks like you have tried to shellac your brows.  My guess is that the people who are leaving negative reviews probably are applying too much.  A little goes a very long way. I swear by this stuff.  Would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I do a lot of sweating during the day and my eyebrows are still on by the end of the day!! This product is perfect!! No flaws!! This is one product that I make sure I don&#x27;t run out of!! It&#x27;s a must have for the ladies who like to use a pencil for their eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Normally within a couple of hours of applying my eyebrows &amp; getting them right they would smudge, budge, &amp; totally rub off...That was before I discovered Model in a Bottle...OMG!!!...This stuff TRULY keeps my brows in place ALL DAY!!!....These bad boys don&#x27;t move until I cleanse my face at the end of the day...4REAL!!!...Even when it is super HOT outside &amp; my oily skin starts oiling up in my T-zone or if I&#x27;m sweating...My brows stay put...Being that it&#x27;s such a tiny bottle I thought I&#x27;d have to re-up quickly but this stuff last FOREVER...I&#x27;ve had it since April &amp; it&#x27;s now July &amp; it looks like there&#x27;s still the same amount of product in the bottle as when I bought it....LOVE THIS STUFF!!!</li>
            <li> Since BeneFit randomly discontinued She Laq, I&#x27;ve been hunting for a suitable alternative.  This is the closest I&#x27;ve found. I was sold fake She Laq twice on eBay, so I decided to give something else a try. This Model in a Bottle stuff doesn&#x27;t have She Laq&#x27;s staying power, but it&#x27;s better than clear mascara or hair gel or anything else that might be used to seal eyebrows.  It flakes and turns white, which is especially annoying.  Still, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found thus far so it&#x27;ll have to do.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sealer for a month and it works. I have practically no brows so must pencil them in plus I have very oily skin. Prior to using the sealer I would have to touch up my brows during the day but no longer need to do that. It was great getting two applicators but I only use the brush. The sealer goes on very smoothly and never flakes. If you are looking for an eyebrow sealer you should try this one.</li>
            <li> THE BEST PURCHASE EVER MADE FAR AS MY NAKED BROWS LOL. LOVE THIS STUFF ITS MAGIC IN A BOTTLE. LAST ALL DAY DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS. GREAT PURCHASE HIGHLY RECOMMEND. WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Keeps brows in place...makes them a little hard though. Definitely a good purchase if you keep your brows a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this, after having read many positive reviews on the seeming magical waterproofing abilities of Model in a Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However... and I don&#x27;t mean to be nit-picky here in the least - it *does not* fully live up to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps if you have natural brows, it helps to seal the eyebrow pencil on them, but as me and my best friend do not have brows, and instead prefer to draw ours on each day, we needed a GOOD waterproof sealer to keep them looking fresh and crisp.&lt;br /&gt;Model in a Bottle worked for only so many hours before succumbing to facial oils and sweat, which made them start to feather and look fuzzy, in spite of our ongoing care to dab at our faces with powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is indeed good stuff, but NOT the all-out best in the way of waterproofing.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff.. it really works!  Will order again,</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow sealer and it is perfect for hot days when you have a make-up \\&quot;meltdown\\&quot;...and it dries very, very fast!! A must have for anyone that grooms their eyebrows daily!</li>
            <li> Works great. I use it every day</li>
            <li> Awesome! It really does make your eyebrows smudge-proof and waterproof. Highly recommend to people who have to fill their eyebrows in everyday.</li>
            <li> Best thing for brows love it</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that does exactly what it says it will, and more. I&#x27;m a blonde, which is nice, but that means my brows and lashes are totally transparent, which is not so nice. I use brow color and powder eye liner EVERY day, no matter what. This sealer keeps my brow color on all day with no fading away. It&#x27;s invisible and easily washes off when I wash my face. I&#x27;m also using it on my liner, which causes a tiny bit of stinging, but that stops in a second or so, and my liner is also in place for the day. I was a faithful She-lac user for years and regretted its demise, but Model in a Bottle is a perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> This did not work well at all.  I was trying to find a cheaper alternative to Lasting Lips but this was crap.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works... My eyebrows are almost non-existent so I draw them on with powder and an eyebrow pencil. My skin is super oily and my eyebrows never last a full day... The bottle comes with 2 brushes, it comes with the one in the photo that looks like a mascara brush, and another one that looks like a nail polish brush. I use both. I put the sealer over my eyebrows and they stayed on ALL DAY, from 8 am until midnight. I kept rubbing my fingers over my brows to test them out and they still stayed on! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I&#x27;m so happy I found this, it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been looking for for years. Anyone who has to draw their brows on knows how embarrassing it is to never be able to touch your own eyebrows, or exercise, or play with your kids, or even have sex without worrying if your eyebrows will rub off. I feel a little more normal now, lol.</li>
            <li> Works well, but flakes.  After reading some of the other reviews, I believe if you have eyebrows it flakes, but if you pencil on brows it works well.  It will keep your brows in place all day.</li>
            <li> I have tried using this multiple times, and it does not work as it should.  It puts a white powdery film on my eyebrows that flakes off.  It makes my eyebrows look horrible.  I have experimented by using this various ways.  I even thought maybe I was using too much product, and wiped the brush off as much as possible before applying, and it still happened.  No matter what I do, I get the same result.  I have found that plain hairspray works better than this.  I spray a little on my finger, and tap it over my brow area.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 5 years.  I use a pencil on my eyebrows and seal it with this product. Works really well.  I will continue to use this item for as long as it is available. I like the price, not expensive.</li>
            <li> Incredible!!!! Etty Farrell (wife of Perry Farrell from Jane&#x27;s Addiction) recommended this product on her FB and I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, as I&#x27;ve been drawing my brows on for 20+ yrs due to a cold wax mishap in high school. Well, let me tell you - it&#x27;s amazing stuff! Normally I have to use concealer, powder, then do my brows and a few hrs later they look not so-so. Well the first day I figured I&#x27;d try it on naked skin and sure enough - my brows stayed on all day and all thru the night! (Figured I&#x27;d try a sleep test lol) I recommend not drenching your brows in it - just a light coat does for the day. No issues w flaking or skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I can not live with out this lol. I made the mistake of only ordering one last time and when I ran out I went three days without having it and felt so naked and incomplete lol. This time I ordered two! And my package came soo fast!</li>
            <li> I read that this worked for keeping drawn on eyebrows in place &amp; was skeptical at 1st but it works AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and it works that keep my brows stay all day. It&#x27;s easy to take it off maybe because I oily skin. I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I LOVE this eyebrow sealer. I first found out about it when my mom did a commercial and the make-up artist spoke about it. I instantly did a Google search because I&#x27;ve struggled with nonexistent eyebrows ever since I started paying attention to my appearance. About 5 years ago I decided to get the permanent eyebrows done and they came out pretty good but now they are faded. I was already nervous the first time I got them done and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the pain and healing process I had to endure the first time. So Model in a Bottle has been a life saver!!! I use the mascara-looking brush and dab a little of the liquid off so it doesn&#x27;t come out too shiny. This stuff lasts from the time I put it on the morning until the time I wash it off at night. I hope they continue to make this product because for the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have to worry about eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li> Here where we have summer 8 months a year, make up melts swiftly. Eyeliner &amp; eyebrow pencil seem to get the worst of it, and eyebrow wax melts before your front doors even locked to leave home. Enter model in a bottle! Thus far, it&#x27;s kept pencil, powder and wax on eyebrows, like a charm, right where I applied it hours earlier. The powder in particular, is lent a sort of lifelike very gentle sheen that eyebrows normally have, before dense, matte pigmented eyebrow powders are applied, totally thanks to this products excellent design. The only con I can think of is that it&#x27;s almost impossible to remove. I truly wish they made their own product remover. However, waterproof lipstick removers w/ a oil base, baby oil, and my favorite technique due to my acne prone skin... My trick is A little moisturizer slathered across the brow... Left 2 Sit  while I&#x27;m removing the eye make, mascara &amp; lipstick. Then It rubs off easier with a cotton ball or washcloth just fine. It&#x27;s such hell shopping for heatproof/melt proof products that I sincerely hope they make this eyebrow sealer forever. I give this an Arizona sun approved 5 stars!</li>
            <li> QUICK, SWEET, AND TO THE POINT:&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows don&#x27;t grow and throughout the day I notice the ones I draw on be fading away or disappearing. This stuff SAVED ME! My eyebrows stay on all day!!! ALL DAY!! I love it and won&#x27;t go without it anymore!</li>
            <li> I find that the problem with eyebrow liners (of all types) is that they come off through the course of the day.  This really helps to keep the liner on (whichever type you use).  I appreciate being able to have this - it works, and it&#x27;s not difficult to apply.  A good buy.  :)</li>
            <li> If you are expecting this to be the wonder replacement product, you will be disappointed.  This will hold your brows in place if you have a normal desk job and that is all you can expect.  It is horrible on keeping even waterproof liner in place.  It will no do anything for lashes.  It will no survive a cardio workout at the gym. Hairspray on a brush will work have similar if not better results.</li>
            <li> Save your money. It&#x27;s easy to put on and looks okay on. The idea of it sounded great but it&#x27;s not. Whether I put on a lot or a little after a few minutes my eyes brows have flakes of dried product on them. If I scratch my brow I get dried flakes and don&#x27;t know until I look in a mirror. I think I am returning it.</li>
            <li> This is a must to product for me to use everyday. My brows last all day even on those hot days</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get crusty or accumulate residue. I use it for when I&#x27;m gonna sweat a lot or be out somewhere all day, or special occasions. I get to keep my eyebrows! Comes with two brushes- one like mascara brush, one like nail-polish brush. Either works great.</li>
            <li> THIS WILL BE MY SECOND ORDER OF MODEL IN A BOTTLE!!! I ORDERED IT LAST DEC JUST TO TRY IT AFTER I SAW A LOT OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS (MUFFINISMYLOVERS, TWINKEEZ2000)ABOUT THIS PRODUCT!!! TRY IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT. MODEL IN A BOTTLE SEALS MY BROWS ALL DAY LONG AND WASHES OFF EASY WITH MY OLAY FACIAL WASH AT NIGHT. BE CAREFUL WITH THE AMOUNT OF LAYERS BECAUSE TOO MUCH WILL DRY A LITTLE FLAKY, HOW MUCH YOU NEED IS TRIAL AND ERROR BUT IT IS SO GREAT FOR KEEPING MY DIVA BROW IN CHECK ;)</li>
            <li> My brows are fairly thin, so I have to fill them in quite a bit to get the look I want. Powders and pencils can wear off during the day. When there is rain?... Forget about it! This product has saved me. It keeps my brows in place with confidence. Whether to tame unruly brows or to set them like I have, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have tried so many products out there. This is by far my favorite. It also comes with 2 applicators. I brush, similar to nail polish and another similar to a mascara wand. I chose 2nd option and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Flakes...did not like this product at all</li>
            <li> because it makes your eyebrow liner comes off when you put it on so then you have to put more on. Not as great as she laq which you can&#x27;t find.</li>
            <li> THIS DOES WORK AS THEY SAY IT DOES. THE ONLY DOWN SIDE TO IT FOR ME I FIND IS THAT ONCE YOU APPLY THIS TO YOUR EYE BROWS OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO USE IT ON IT SEEMS TO LEAVE A VERY DEFINED SHINY RESIDUE WHEREVER YOU APPLIED IT TO! SO IF YOU HAVE SPARSE EYE BROWS LIKE I DO THEN YOU WILL HAVE GREAT LOOKING EYEBROWS BUT WITH A SHINY AREA FROM THIS LOL. I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SOMEHOW USE SOME LIGHT TRANSPARENT POWDER TO DAB ON IT BUT THEN I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE THE POWDER STICKING TO THE SHINY AND WOULD PROBABLY LOOK EVEN WORSE? MAYBE YOU JUST NEED TO DAB IT ON BUT I NEED A FULL COVERAGE BECAUSE MOST OF MY EYEBROW IS COLORED IN SO I NEED TO COVER A LARGER AREA INSTEAD OF JUST A FEW UNRULY EYEBROWS.MAYBE I WILL TRY TO JUST USE THE END OF THE BRUSH AND DAB IT ONTO THE COLORED PENCIL INSTEAD OF BRUSHING IT ON? OR MAYBE TRY USING THE MASCARA WAND THAT CAME WITH IT INSTEAD OF THE BRISTLE BRUSH LIKE A PAINT BRUSH? I SUPPOSE THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES TO USE THIS WITH BUT I JUST FOUND THAT USING THE BRUSH APPLICATION DIDNT SEEM TO LEAVE YOU A VERY CLEAN LOOK BECAUSE OF THE SHINE.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this productüëå in my opinion this is so much better than Anastasia Beverly Hills!&lt;br /&gt;The brush is tiny which is awesome &amp; works out for meüëçüòä</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. When u use it, I dont have to refresh my brows during the day. This product is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive this item, because when I do my eyebrows I wanted to let them last.When I get them done I saw the bottle but it was turned backwoods or covered with the hand when it&#x27;s applied. I finally have my own that I can use at any given time. Arrived on time! Thanks a million!</li>
            <li> I usually use a brow gel like Anastasias that has real holding power. However I go through the gel rather quickly. I saw the Model in a Bottle sealer and thought I&#x27;d try it. I was expecting it to be more of a gel consistency but to my surprise it&#x27;s completely watery.  I was concerned it wouldn&#x27;t do the job but it works credibly well! Your brows aren&#x27;t going anywhere when you put this stuff on. Also I&#x27;ve been using it consistently but it hardly looks like I&#x27;ve made a dent in the bottle so this is going to last a long time. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Might as well use clear nail polish on your brows. That&#x27;s what it feels and looks like. :(</li>
            <li> If you are looking to grow your eyebrow, use this product. The tail of my eyebrow had never grown hair, it is now full of thick hair. This is not only a sealer but hair growth product</li>
            <li> Great product and extremely long lasting! Make sure you wipe off the excess product before applying to your brows-a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> This product came with high recommendations from YouTube but my  experience this product offered little to no sealant power. I fill in my eyebrows so when i swipe around that area, my eyebrow makeup comes off. You can notice the residue so it does shine. It does flake occasionally. If you&#x27;re oily skinned then you&#x27;ll find yourself reapplying constantly.</li>
            <li> This is my 5th bottle. love the stuff. Eyebrows stay put all day. I have to wash my face in order to remove my brows and the product.</li>
            <li> This product is EXCELLENT!!!! This is the best of the best, the only problem is that sometimes it flakes a little but I take the flakes off with my nails and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> This stuff is everything it claims to be. After I fill in my eyebrows I use this product to keep  them intact and my eyebrows stay fresh and in shape throughout the day without smearing or smudging. The staying power is awesome and it can go beyond 12hours. Ladies if you use pencil or powder to shape and set your brows this a must! If your a natural girl it will work for you too!</li>
            <li> One of the best products for my eyebrow makeup.  Stays on all day until I remove it at night.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and have been using it daily for the past 6 months. Some people have said that they didn&#x27;t like this product because it gets white and flakes off. I recommend not putting too much on at a time and even using and eyebrow brush after to sort of comb the sealer through the eyebrow. I&#x27;ve experienced the white flakiness others described but realized I needed to take it easy on the sealer.  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s the only thing I have found that keeps my eyebrow liner pencil on. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE IT BUT IT MAKES MY EYEBROWS ITCH!!!! BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT WHEN I PURCHASED IT IN 2011 I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM.  THEY MUSTVE ADDED A NEW INGREDIENT.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it can get crusty if you add too much on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to order this after reading mostly highly favorable reviews. My brows are there but light and kinda thin.  I use pencil and eyebrow powder and although I don&#x27;t have oily skin my brows are melting off by the end of the day with the awful humidity we have in Washington D.C. during the summer months. So I did my test. Yesterday took a nap and woke up brows were there and still intact! Today it&#x27;s over 80 degrees and I went for a walk, then came in and cleaned up. Worked up a good sweat and looked at my brows still there, noticed sweat on my brows wiped it off with my fingers. .brows still there and still flawless. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s difficult to remove either.  I rub coconut oil across my brows gingerly rub them and it&#x27;s off. I also experimented with the two different brushes and I think I prefer the mail polish type brush.  I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled to have this and geez I think of all the times this would have come in handy but glad those days are a thing of the past. This is definitely a must have in my book.</li>
            <li> The product is as its stated....I actually love it...not stickly and not hard to wash away at the end of the day...delivery was also great</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!! It really makes my eyebrows stay in place all day and doesn&#x27;t fade the makeup. If you tint your eyebrows, becareful because it does fade the tint. I sometimes dab a little after I apply my eyeliner (it does sting a little) but it helps keep it in place all day. I have oily skin and makeup tends to not stick well and this definitely helps alot!!! I&#x27;ve had the product since December 2014 and I still have half a bottle left.... soon will be ordering more, but im thankful that such a small bottle has lasted this long.</li>
            <li> this is no different for my brows than if I put water on them&lt;br /&gt;crazy because so many great reviews&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s like nothing is on them at all&lt;br /&gt;I tried putting more, different brushes etc&lt;br /&gt;nope...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this FOREVER. i had my eyebrows tattoed but now they are fading so i draw them in. I use powder and pencil and MAN this stuff kept it there. Even on my very oily skin and the heat, it lasted all day till i had to scrub it with a wet rag. WHERE has this been all my life!! It doesnt flake itch smell and it is not shiny.</li>
            <li> I have perfected the perfect eyebrow, so I am NOT a novice. I have practiced religiously almost daily for over a decade and I get random compliments but I digress..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What made my perfected eyebrow fall by the wayside is my oily skin which in turn causes my beautifully faux created arches fade into obscurity. I had no idea a product such as this existed until I typed in waterproof eyebrows in google and this product appeared. I was still a bit sketical so I turned to youtube for reviews; all of which were glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works point blank. In the morning, I can perfect my arch and in the evening when I get ready to wash my face for the night, the arch is still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there is a caveat, my eyebrows do fade slightly over the course of the day depending upon the hot weather/humidity factor. I live in a region of the country renowned for warm weather, so this is a fact of life.  And if I do rub my eyebrows after I have sweated,  the part where there is less hair to grab onto will wipe off BUT for the most part my eyebrows are at attention and in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes with a mini mascara type brush or a paint type brush which glides smoothly over powder or pencil. I use it with Make Up For Ever&#x27;s eyebrow corrector for staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After I brush it on and it dries, I may do a slight touch up of powder or pencil for extra color, but I usually don&#x27;t have to. I must note that you should not be heavy handed with this product as it will give your eyebrows a severely stiff almost tacky look. And yes it will make your eyebrows shine a bit, but not in a manner that will throw your look off. It actually enhances it if your ask me. The shine is also relative to how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product washes off quickly with a cleanser of your choice and water. It lasts a while as well. If you are an eyebrow queen who has perfected the perfect arch that you want to stay in place, then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s kept my over tweezed brows, that I have to fill in, in place very nicely! The only small criticism I have is that the applicator didn&#x27;t attach too well initially, however, currently it&#x27;s in place. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for your eyebrow routine. Your eyebrows will stay in place and won&#x27;t fade all day!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Very sticky however and too liquidy.</li>
            <li> If you have oily or combo skin, and you have to use brow pencil or powder to not look crazy, this is the real deal.  This will even keep your brows in place during a mild workout.  I&#x27;m about to purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> Love the way it conceals the eye brows.  This is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> After reading the great reviews I decided to try this product. It is way watery and I now only use it when I run out of my MAC eyebrow gel. The trick to getting by with it for those of you who are trying to figure out what to do with this waste of money is to shake off all excess product and to apply lightly. I then clean up with a q-tip and sometimes concealer. For those of you who haven&#x27;t purchased this, RUN!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Anastasia Beverly Hills eyebrow gel and it wouldn&#x27;t hold my eyebrows  into place until I tried this and it works amazing !</li>
            <li> This product keeps my eyebrows intact all day long. I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking in the mirror to see that my fill has smeared or rubbed off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give 5 stars out easily. I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this stuff and hope I never have to. I have oily skin and sparse eyebrows. I have to fill them in with powder but before I found this amazing product the powder wouldn&#x27;t last long. It was horrible always wondering if some had wiped off or melted away and wondered what odd shape my brows had ended up throughout the day. If you have this same problem, buy this now you will not regret  it.  I don&#x27;t have to worry at all anymore. After I fill in my eyebrows I swipe this over them with the mascara-type brush it comes with and they last all day no matter what- even all night if I forget to wash my face. It&#x27;s a very thin, watery formula that dries quickly. You have to apply VERY little so the bottle lasts forever. If you apply too much, it will drip or cause your make-up to run. Also if you apply to much, once it dries your brows will feel stiff and might flake if you scratch at them. So tap off the brush and apply a thin layer and you&#x27;ll be set.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I was worried it may  cause break out but it didnt. The only reason I no longer use it is because I dont need it. I got permanent makeup done for my brows now. But if I didn&#x27;t this would be a staple!!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are so light it looks like I have none. I color them in and fear they will rub off. This stuff is a great product that protects them and I do not worry about having a random half eyebrow. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff.  I use it on top of my eyebrow makeup so it stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t rub off.  This is the best thing I have found to help with my thinning eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a while&amp; it works well</li>
            <li> Geniuuuus I loveeee it , know Im adicted to it, this thing its AMAAAZING!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive option to hold my &amp;#34;Brooke Shield&amp;#34; type eyebrows. This sadly is not it. I think this may be better suited for eyebrows that are drawn on or at the very least, not as full as mine. I was hoping to find a replacement for the more expensive Anastasia brow gel I currently use. I have not found anything to date, that has come close to that hold yet!</li>
            <li> I used Benefit&#x27;s She Laq for the last few years on my eyebrows, but when they quit making it I had to find a replacement and all the searching led me to Model in a Bottle&#x27;s Long Lasting Eyebrow Sealer.  Since the price wasn&#x27;t bad, I decided to try it and I love it.  I think I like it better than the product I was using before.  It has plenty of product and is such a great deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an oily face, so by night time, my She Laq would stop working so much and my penciled-in brows would get smudged if I wasn&#x27;t careful - it just bought me more time throughout the day.  However, with Model in a Bottle&#x27;s stuff, I haven&#x27;t noticed the product really wearing off.  It&#x27;s just as strong by night almost as when I put it on at 7am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve heard that one problem with these type of products is the shine it sometimes leaves or a residue of some sort, but I don&#x27;t find it all that bad with this product. She Laq had more shine to it and if you applied it more than once, it would leave a weird residue on your brows or get flakey.  However, while this product does have a little shine, I don&#x27;t find this product to be nearly as bad.  The shine isn&#x27;t really noticeable unless you look really close or apply it super thick or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this stuff is great!  I use it every day and it&#x27;s a must-have item!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!!! I have VERY sparse eyebrows, thanks to my Asian heritage, and have to use an eyebrow pencil to fill in my brows every day. (As a beauty consultant, I know that your eyebrows make your whole face so I&#x27;m a perfectionist when it comes to them.) Unfortunately, I also have very oily skin, which makes my makeup slide and I&#x27;ve always had to touch up my eyebrows every couple of hours. (If I didn&#x27;t, my eyebrows would be non-existent by the end of the day.) Also, before finding this product, I was always scared that when my boyfriend touched my face, he&#x27;d wipe an eyebrow off by accident, which would be REALLY awkward. I also always avoided dipping my head in the water at the pool or beach because I knew that if I did, my eyebrows would be gone when I resurfaced. (Yes, it was that bad.) I was seriously considering having permanent makeup tattooed on my brows so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about having an eyebrow wiped off all the time. When I saw this product, I did some quick googling to read its reviews and it has rave reviews everywhere. I am SO HAPPY that I purchased this eyebrow sealer - it is a HOLY GRAIL product for me - this definitely seals my eyebrow color in place when I use the white sealing brush and it also contains a spoolie brush that I can use to groom the hairs I do have and make sure none of them sticking out of place. I definitely recommend this product to anyone and everyone who colors in their eyebrows and doesn&#x27;t want to worry about having their brows fade, smear, or smudge anymore. A+++++++++!!!!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will, keeps your eyebrows and any color you added in place all day.  No one will notice you are wearing it.  Use sparingly because if you put on too much it will flake and look like tiny dandruff.</li>
            <li> I apply and shape my brows with powder, and would often feel rather embarrassed when the tails of my brows would totally fade or wipe off - or come off because I wore my hat too low on my forehead - oye!!  Always a worry, but not once I got this product!  It works fabulously!  Now, the brows stay put all day - it&#x27;s awesome!  Also, this one bottle should last me for AGES!  Just the tiniest amount is needed (I use the brush applicator) - everything&#x27;s smooth, no flakes, no stiffness - I truly, truly love this product!!</li>
            <li> Been using it for a while. Absolutely love it! Keeps my eyebrows on all day and sometimes even thru the night sleeping.</li>
            <li> This product does keep eyebrows in place but it is not waterproof and it does flake somewhat. Only used twice and then I just switched to something better.</li>
            <li> I have heard reviews about this product, but never tryed tried it until now.  I LOVE this product and would recommend it to anyone who ask.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t leave the house without this on my brows&lt;br /&gt;IG; Paije.a for Mua tips</li>
            <li> This product last ALL DAY &amp; NIGHT,absolutely will recommend:) My eyebrows didn&#x27;t smudge at all, and I like the little shine it leaves behind, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the NYX Eyebrow Marker [[ASIN:B004AJ5DMC NYX Cosmetics Eyebrow Marker, Deep Brown, EBM02]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used an eyebrow sealer before but thought it might be a help, since I have to draw in my brows (nothing there at all). I figured this would keep them from fading for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worked out great. I can get two days from just a small smear on both eyebrows. And that&#x27;s the thing: a little goes a long way. So this bottle will last me a pretty long time before I have to order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to use the regular brush, but it also includes a comb if you&#x27;re one of those fortunate ones who still has real eyebrows. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth the price? I sure think so.</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a shine where I place it.  It does keep the brow in place and not easily rubbed off.  I find by putting some powder over the shine......it all but dulls-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace the discontinued She Laq. The product goes on well, dries invisibly, doesn&#x27;t flake. But I am sad to say that it doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;seal\\&quot; my eyebrows. I conducted a test between this product and the remaining bit of my She Laq and She Laq won by a mile.  My eyebrow powder rubbed off on my finger with this product. I really don&#x27;t understand all the other glowing reviews. My search for a good eyebrow sealer continues.</li>
            <li> My wife did an eyebrow hair transplant procedure end of 2013 and this product was recommended to her by the hospital to help her in getting all the new hair go into one direction couple of months after the procedure. When she used it for the first time it was extremely difficult to remove and was like a super glue. even though she was trying to remove it very gently from her eyebrows with water and make up removal tissues, she lost few of her new hair because of this product.</li>
            <li> Boy, this stuff really works! I little bit goes a long way too. I almost always wash my face before sleeping, but once in a while I fall asleep without doing so. This product is so good that it stays on after a night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li> This definitely does its job, but if you put too much it on it WILL flake lightly. But it definitely does the job &amp; it last all day. I put it on in the morning and I work outside and my eyebrows are always in tact. So definitely a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Im one of those girls that unfortunately over plucked her eyebrows and now have to draw them on daily :(&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a god send. Not only does it last all day but I don&#x27;t have to worry if I smudged an eyebrow. I even work out with it (my face sweats a lot) and when I pat my face with a towel... my eyebrows don&#x27;t come off! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Identical to the picture, its a glass nail polis looking bottle with a thin translucent pink liquid that comes with 2 applicator options. A small square tip plastic bristled brush and a spoolie. (liquid is thin and will leak if you dont close the lid properly. Also will spill easily if not careful. I knocked over my first bottle and the entire thing spilled out)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle lasts a long time. (I use it everyday) Its been 3 months since I bought it and I still have more then half the bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price. Its half the cost of other sealers. And the bottle lasts awhile so your saving money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, it took a couple times to figure out how much to use and which brush worked best for me. I didn&#x27;t like the square tipped brush. I found that I over applied the product when I used it. And if you apply too much... when it dries, it flakes.&lt;br /&gt;It works well over the Anastasia Brow Pomade (another god send) which I apply first with an angled brush. Then I dip the spoolie and as i pull it out of the bottle I slide it over the rim to knock the excess off. I then brush my eyebrows with a thin layer and let dry. It dries a little shiny so I use my Anastasia brow duo powder to make it matte. And thats it! Im set until I wash it off with face cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product through YouTube. I&#x27;ve always drawn my eyebrows well over 10years. Buying this product was the best decision I&#x27;ve made. It&#x27;s easy to apply, affordable, and does everything it&#x27;s suppose to do. No flakes, drys fast, only remove able when applied with washing your face with make up remover. This product works great, don&#x27;t knock it till you try it!</li>
            <li> I have thin eyebrows so I fill mine in everday and throughout the day, the pencil slowly starts to wear off. With this product they stay on all day!! Like from sun up to late night! Love this. It doesnt flake or anything. Glad i made this purchase!</li>
            <li> yes this works.. but i wasn&#x27;t too impressed to use long term.&lt;br /&gt;but it does its job and works to keep those eyebrows on.</li>
            <li> Lost most of my eye brows and had to draw them on.  This product helped me never to have an embarrassing  &amp;#34;missing eyebrow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is clear. I do try to get some of the product off the brush before applying but it really truly helps keep my eye brow color on, even through workout sweat</li>
            <li> I practically have no eyebrows.  This helps the pencil stay on.  And, a little product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It goes on and stays on. Purchase this product for lasting eye brows.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have brows at all and you need something to hold your color, I would recommend it, although as you apply you run the risk of smearing a little bit of your drawn brows off so be sure to pat it on instead of gliding it on your face.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible prodouct to use if you are using eyebrow pencil or brush-on eyebrow makeup and wish to seal it in place.  Using this product over the brow makeup will cause the brow makeup to darken and make your brows look totally unnatural.  There are other products out there that do work - but not this one.</li>
            <li> I thought this was just okay.  It didn&#x27;t really hold down my brows as well as a past product that has been discontinued.  However, I have a friend who does really like it and says it works great for her.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am excited to have this product, I have been searching for years for something that will keep my brows on and this is it. I have super oily skin and well by the end of the day, my brows would look like they were melting off, but with this, it keeps them in place most of the day, I would say all day and it does, but I do start to have some eyebrow fade once it gets closer to bedtime, but other than that, this stuff is amazing and a little goes a long ways with this stuff. It&#x27;s great to have something that I can put on and not worry about, I am super happy with my purchase and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I use this this product after I have shaded in my eyebrows with a eyebrow pencil and powder and this product help pop out the hairs making my brows look natural. Warning before you use the brush shake the brush so that you do not use to much product, it can make you have stiff, hard eyebrows.I can not live without this stuff this is my 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyebrows and therefore always need  powder on them to make them show.  Previously I had used Shelac by Benefit to keep the powder lasting all day.  It did keep it on very well but also left a shiny coat like nail polish on my brows which was not very attractive.  I tried Model In A Bottle after seeing it advertised in a magazine.  Not only was it A LOT less expensive than the Shelac but it worked very well.  The consistency was thinner &amp; did not not look shiny on my brows.</li>
            <li> Eyebrow sealer? I never even thought of it! I fill my eyebrows in every day. By the end of my work day (Normally 10 hours) I‚Äôm an oily mess and my eyebrows look like two dirty grease stains. So I figured I‚Äôd try this eyebrow sealer and it has helped tremendously! My eyebrows stay intact and dry! Of course my face is still an oily mess by the end of the day but my eyebrows? They are FAB all day. I think I‚Äôll try their makeup setting spray next.</li>
            <li> It was too liquidity...it make my eye brow all wet and my eyebrow shadow smudge off when I apply it on.  It feels like I have hair gel on my eyebrows and sometimes it flakes just like hair gel.</li>
            <li> I heard about this stuff from a girl on YouTube.  It is a must have for anyone that fills in their eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I really dig this product.  It does exactly what it says-- keeps penciled/ filled-in brows in place for long wear.  I apply it whenever I put on a full face to seal in my brows.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the brows &amp;#34;running&amp;#34; or wiping off with accidental light brushes against something.  The &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; once it dries is undetectable. I would recommend to make-up enthusiasts.  My only warning is don&#x27;t make the dumb mistake I made by trying to see if the &amp;#34;lash brush&amp;#34; would make this product work on eye lashes; oh BOY did my eyes burn within 2 seconds of application LOL.  That&#x27;s what I get for trying to be inventive.  Brow use only please. *smiley*</li>
            <li> This sealer is great. Eyebrows stay in place until you remove it and it doesn&#x27;t flake. I thought the price was a bit high but this little bottle lasts a long time. I also like that you get two brushes with it (mascara /nail polish brush style).</li>
            <li> I have Trich and have NO eyebrows, so I paint them on everyday and normally they start wearing off by the middle of the day.  I started using this and I am in LOVE!!!!  This keeps my eyebrows in place all day and is even still on after I wash my face so I have to double wash my eyebrows, which is fine with me.  Now I feel confident if I brush my hair away from my eyes, or accidentally touch them, or if it rains or snows.</li>
            <li> I just received my product and this is AMAZING.  My eyebrows have not moved nor smudged.  This stuff is amazing.  I wish i would have ordered the finishing spray and the lipstick sealant also. You only need a little .  I placed a small sample on the back of my hand and 5 hours later and after four to five hand washes, AND IT IS STILL ON THE BACK OF MY HAND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this so much I&#x27;m ready to get more !!! Worth it and have kept my eyebrows looking good</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Really keeps the eyebrows from sweating off in the heat. Stays on pretty well even with swimming.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful</li>
            <li> It does keep my eyebrows on all day and I have extremely oily skin. So really u could say I love this product.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this product! it works like a charmmmm, i promise try it!! :D It lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> She laq replacement this is not, ladies. Sorry to those who like me loved that Benefit product that is now discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this does not hold unruly brows in place -- why I bought it -- but ends up crinkling up into white flakey crust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works ok to seal in make up, but no better than any other face setting powder or mist-- try the E.L.F. $3 version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging I received was more purple/nailpolish bottle looking. didn&#x27;t look like the picture, if that is a factor.</li>
            <li> THE REASON I GAVE 4 STAR...THIS REALLY WORKS..MY PROBLEM IS GOING THRU MENOPAUSE, LOST ALL EYE-BROWS, GOT THEM TATOO ON AND THEN I FILL-IN A LITTLE FOR EXACT SHAPE THAT I WHAT THAT DAY.  BUT, MY SKIN IS OILY SO I PAT THRU-OUT THE DAY...THIS PRODUCT HELPS EYE PENCIL TO STAY ON... OH...IT HAS A SHEEN LOOK TO IT.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I needed a product that would provide long lasting brows. My brows are fine, so I use pencil so the will appear thicker. After continuously searching, I came across \\&quot;Model In A Bottle\\&quot;. It had good reviews so I decided to give it a try. When I first used it, I felt a burning sensation on my brows, which worried me but I continued use. After a while it calmed down. It does produce a gloss that I&#x27;m not particularly fond of, but it does work.</li>
            <li> Product works awesome! No more disappearing brows! Great price</li>
            <li> My brow powder and/or pencil stays put, as does my brow hairs. It&#x27;s completely clear, with no residue so you can&#x27;t even see it&#x27;s there! Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This product really works, my eyebrows remain intact for the whole day, I am definitely impressed and would repurchase even though I believe this product will last a very very long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really locks in the color when you fill in your brows. It wont budge even when you go to the hair salon for a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a punk rock girl with no eyebrows. I draw mine on everyday. I work outside doing a manual labor job all year round. This stuff works! In the heat of the summer it doesn&#x27;t smear or run, and in the cold of the winter it doesn&#x27;t let my eyebrows get rubbed off by my hat. It&#x27;s absolute gold!!! I&#x27;ve stocked up just in case it goes off the market! Love model in a bottle !!</li>
            <li> I like this product because I can go hours without my drawn on eyebrows rubbing off.  I get super-duper oily in my brows anyway.  I have very sparse eyebrows and have to fill them in with powder and pencil, applied this model in a bottle and it helps keep them in place for a few hours.  I would re purchase it.</li>
            <li> I nornally dont do reviews.  But couldnt resist this.  I have been searching for years to replace the discontinued Shelaq.  And THIS is it!!  I put it to the test, next to the bit of Shelaq i have left. This one won by far.  May be because my Shelaq is way old.  But either way it doesnt matter, because Shelaq is not available anymore.  And this works just as well.  If not BETTER!!  And it is half or a third of the price of the Shelaq was.</li>
            <li> love n this stuff ,am out ,need to reorder, use everyday works great would recommend to anyone wanting to lock eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have very sparse brows after many years of tweezing and waxing.  This product helps to keep my penciled in brows exactly where I put them.  I hate disappearing brows and this product takes care of that.  A mus have for me.</li>
            <li> No more missing eyebrows. Easily lasts all day, and a nap.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find the glass bottle with a built-in brow sealer wand and a separate brow brush inside.  I was also sorry to find the product did not work for me.  The &amp;#34;sealer&amp;#34; must only be put on the brow area solely;&lt;br /&gt;do not allow the product to escape beneath the brow or you will see what looks like dried glue on your upper lids.  If it worked, I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much but it didn&#x27;t last more than 4 hours; 2 on another day.  I live in Southern California where the humidity is low this time of year (December).</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I only gave it 4 stars because it was like putting liquid hairspray on my eyebrows. And unlike the model in a bottle make-up setting spray, this didn&#x27;t really hold my eyebrows. I have very thin eyebrows so it&#x27;s not like I have a bush growing above my eyes to where it won&#x27;t stay. One night I was going out and I put some one, put on some make-up and then reapplied again to see if it would hold. Instead I ended up getting this hard white film on my eyebrows later that night. My friend pointed it out to me. It&#x27;s as if I had a flakes/clumps of gel in my eyebrows. Kinda embarrassing. So if you do get this do not reapply it! LOL  It holds, but don&#x27;t expect it to hold for a long time. Like I said maybe an hour or two.</li>
            <li> It does work my eyebrows stayed on all night.  However try to only apply on the brow not the face it will leave a shine</li>
            <li> I normally use a wax pencil from Ziba for my eyebrows, but this stuff works really well.  It last until you take it out, and it does not need reaplying.  It give my brows a very natural look.  Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and very happy with product!!, thanks</li>
            <li> Did not feel this product worked that great</li>
            <li> The product worked exactly as advertised.  I was very pleased.  It did not bother my sensitive skin in any way.</li>
            <li> Seriously. This is the best product. I draw my eyebrows almost completely in. I used to shave mine and draw them totally in and this has been my tried and true. I&#x27;ve had it for two years and just now need to buy a new bottle. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t feel gross. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have very sparse, light brows that I spend five minutes filling in every morning (I have fine medium-brown hair).  I&#x27;ve gone through all sorts of high- and low-end brow products and I found that the Rimmel eyebrow pencil in Hazel, MAC eyeshadow in Cork, and now, the holy grail of all eyebrow products: Model in a Bottle Eyebrow Sealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff WORKS.  It comes with a spoolie brush and a paint brush (like in a nail poilsh), but I prefer the spoolie as it gets less product on your brows.  Apply it sparingly or it will harden with a whiteish crust--this seems to be the product&#x27;s only flaw.  When I take my makeup off at night I have to rub pretty hard with a makeup remover wipe to get my brows off!  I ran a half marathon and sweated copiously for two hours and my brows STILL looked perfect at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems to last a long time as well; I&#x27;ve had mine for a month and I&#x27;ve hardly put a dent in it.  I will definitely be repurchasing--maybe even stocking up--I would be devestated if this product was ever discontinued!</li>
            <li> as advertised, no issues</li>
            <li> Perfect if u want your brows to stay in place.</li>
            <li> Model in a Bottle Long Lasting Eyebrow Sealer is my daily! I live in the middle of the Mojave Desert and my brows wouldn&#x27;t last in the molten heat without this stuff! This is my second bottle and the first lasted a good 6 months. It&#x27;s worth it considering the price. If your brows lose their color after you fill them in, this is the key to keeping them on all day long. It&#x27;s AHHHHH MAZING! :) They better never stop making this!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!! I was desperately looking for something that would keep my eyebrow pencil on for extended periods. My own brows had become almost nonexistent in the last few years, so pencil makeup is a must!  I also wanted something where I could actually even sleep and still have eyebrows on waking. This is that product!!!!!  If you want your brows to remain even overnight, simply DO NOT put moisturizer on the brow area, then do your pencil and apply this product. You WILL wake up with eyebrows. Someone in a review said they did not like that this product made their brows appear shiny. If that bothers you, do as I do, simply dust a translucent face powder lightly over the brows after the product dries. It removes all trace of shine and doesn&#x27;t show on the brows at all. I will order more to have a spare bottle on hand!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!! My days are extremely long! At the end of the day not a smear or smudge...This is my staple product!!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really seal the eyeliner drawn on my eyebrows like I thought.  Mainly hardens the hair already on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have had an irritating problem with eyebrow pencil rubbing off several times during the day and having to be reapplied.  With Model in a Bottle, I just apply a little bit to my eyebrows after applying the pencil, and it lasts all day.  It is a clear liquid and does not show at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used English Solutions for years, they no longer make it, this is about a 6 compared to EI (10)....</li>
            <li> I bought this eyebrow sealer in hopes that it would be better than the current one I was using (LeFemme). My eyebrows are basically non-existant (thanks to years of over plucking!) so I shape them with an eyeliner pencil and apply a dark brown eyeshaodw on top, then seal them in. I have oily skin as well. I workout every day and unfortunately, this sealer does not last through a sweat session.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly and my eye brows do not look smudged at the end of a long work day. It&#x27;s no SheLaq, but it will have to do until they bring the SheLaq back!</li>
            <li> This eyebrow sealer works quite well. Had never used a sealer before. Read about this and decided to give it a try. It does keep your brows in place and good looking. Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> This took the place of Benefit SheLaq which as far as I can tell has been discontinued. This is just as good and a lot less $$$ than SheLaq.  I need more and will be back soon to hopefully be able to get it.</li>
            <li> This product is a lifesaver as I can do my eyebrows in the morning and they stay the same way all day. It also makes them look natural. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product will keep your brows in place all day long! Even after a workout! I recommend this product it last a good while too!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. No flakes. Set and go.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product. With great reviews on here, I had my hopes up too high. Unlike some reviewers claim this does not flake for them, it definitely flakes after it dries. Maybe I got a bad batch or a knock off. The box itself looked old and like it has been reused. All the barcodes were crossed off with permanent marker or had a sticker over it. This is liquid, not gel. I would not buy this again, cover girl clear mascara and maybelline clear mascara gel works way better than this product.</li>
            <li> This does nothing that it states., as one if the other reviewers said.. It flakes, rubs off.. I tried atop of waterproof eyebrow pencil, I tried atop of eyebrow gel kit and stop of just regular pencil.. All FAIL!! I am a cancer survivor and need drawn brows kept in place longer ... This isn&#x27;t it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I am very pleased that I purchased this. Very effective in completing a great eyebrow shaping job!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Best product ever!!!! My brows look perfect allllllll day love it!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this!!! Of course I was a victim of over plucking, so I have to fill in my brows to avoid looking strange. I would constantly worry about smudging or sweating and losing a portion of my &amp;#34;eyebrow&amp;#34;. With the Model in a Bottle, I can fill in once in the morning, swipe the sealer over it, and forget about them for the rest of the day! I don&#x27;t recommend swimming and expecting your brows to stay put, but in 109 degree humid weather, they still hold up great! Highly recommend this product! Can NOT live without!!</li>
            <li> omg is this a joke? I received an empty bottle...</li>
            <li> So because, like most women, I pencil in half my eyebrows, I need a product that will remain in place at all times, particularly during the summer months when it&#x27;s hot and the make-up just doesn&#x27;t stay where it&#x27;s supposed to.  By mid-day the penciled-in part of my brow just isn&#x27;t there. I&#x27;m a gardener - working outside most every day which means perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the many good reviews prior to ordering this product which provided high hopes on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like so many others, I am happy to report that whenever I use this product, my brows are intact wherever I go, even following a hard day on my hands and knees in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleopatra...with all that paint on her face, could&#x27;ve used this product after a steamy evening!  Too bad it wasn&#x27;t around in her day!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of weeks, and with oily skin and in extreme heat, it really held up.</li>
            <li> Love, Love it!! Works well! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have alopicia areatta and I lost all my eyebrows. :( I have since been getting treatment from my dermatologist and using Latisse. I have some fuzzies growing back but there is no color to the hairs so I still need to draw on my eyebrows. I am so self conscious of this and have had terrible experiences of accidentally wiping them off or smugging them during work... Also, I would be so paranoid when I would go swimming I would never dunk my head underwater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been such a blessing for me! It absolutely works!! I use all my regular face products &amp; moisturizer and then apply makeup. Afterwards I use the nail polish looking tip and rub it right over my eyebrow. It dries quickly and lasts all day. I do not retouch or anything through out the day. And if I accidentally touch it w my fingers it stays put!! I have even gone swimming for hours and the makeup stays on!!! (Might need a tiny touch up after swimming) This stuff is awesome!!! I&#x27;m so glad I get to enjoy the summer w/o worrying. &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this over 3 months ago and I&#x27;ve used it everyday. The bottle basically looks like it&#x27;s completely full. So I&#x27;m sure it can last the whole year! Get it!!</li>
            <li> This is just as expected!</li>
            <li> This product deserves the hype. :)  It&#x27;s the best eyebrow sealer I&#x27;ve used after trying multiple, &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; &amp; more expensive brands.  It dries quickly, matte and clear.  It truly stays on until intentionally removed without smearing.  Works in high humidity, on oily skin, over pencil or powder.  I&#x27;m ordering more - wondering if the mascara wand it comes with would waterproof my mascara!  The price is right, shipping fees are a bit excessive, but as long as they make it, I&#x27;ll buy and recommend it!  It&#x27;s the &amp;#34;Holy Grail&amp;#34; of sealers, not to be outdone by Anastasia or LaFemme products.</li>
            <li> As someone with sparse brows, I have tried so many so called long wearing or waterproof brow pencils/powders/etc and have never found one that really lasts. But with just a light stroke of the brush on top of any eyebrow makeup and it&#x27;s locked on until you take it off!  It wears through perspiration, rain and even swimming.  But removes easily with eye makeup remover or makeup remover wipes.  It doesn&#x27;t disturb your brow makeup when you apply it and the nail polish type brush is extremely easy to use and effective.  It doesn&#x27;t effect the color of whatever brow product you&#x27;re sealing in.  You only need a small amount, so the bottle lasts a VERY long time, making this an extremely affordable product.  If you use any eyebrow makeup, this is a must have product!!</li>
            <li> I did not know such a product existed before.  I have lost all my eyebrow hairs and hate having to draw my brows on each day.  Planning to get tattooed brows because it is so embarrassing when perspiration makes my brows disappear.  Now that I have this, my brows stay in place no matter how hot it gets.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I ran out of the gel from my Smashbox Brow Tech To Go. I still had the actual waterproof pencil on the one end, but unfortunately I still needed more gel. I bought this eyebrow sealer thinking it would do the trick, but all it does is flake. It looks like my eyebrows have dandruff...it&#x27;s disgusting and embarrassing. Funny how this product says it doesn&#x27;t flake and and then later realize at the end of the day your eyebrows are flaking everywhere. I&#x27;ve tried it multiple times and it flakes every single time (work, yoga, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you all know, it really hardens your brows (feels like you put a bunch of hair spray on them) and doesn&#x27;t feel natural at all. I recommend using the Smashbox Brow Tech To Go, it&#x27;s my favorite. I also purchased the Anastasia Beverly Hills Go Brow Kit from Sephora and that works well too. It&#x27;s only $16 and you get a mini dark brown pencil, mini gel and tweezers. I didn&#x27;t need the pencil and tweezers, but I bought this kit anyways since I wanted to try the mini gel. Works really well and it&#x27;s small for on the go.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow sealer ever!!!! Love it!!! Try it you will not be disappointed! Will buy another one soon.</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully to shape your eyebrows and keep them tamed.  If you use a lot it will harden but I like that plus my oily skin softens it very easily.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It does exactly what it states.  My brows have thinned over time. When I filled them in in the past the pencil or powder I would use would fade or rub off after a while. However with this I put it on at 6 in the morning and my brows are still in place 12 hours later. I&#x27;ve bought one for my mom as well. I highly recommend this product and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> HOLY GRAIL HERE!! There shouldn&#x27;t be a doubt in your mind about getting this. i was in cancun for twoweeks and my eyebrows stayed on after a whole day of swimming and overnight! its a must get!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on as easy as one would like, but once you play with it a while it&#x27;s good. This is NOT what you&#x27;re looking for if you&#x27;re looking for waterproof. I&#x27;m still searching for that one.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows don&#x27;t disappear! I live where it&#x27;s hot and very humid but this keeps them in place. Even when the rest of my makeup is melting. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Once I apply my eyebrow pencil, I brush Model in a Bottle on and my brows last until I wash them off. I always use a brow brush after to direct my brows. If I don&#x27;t, the product is a little too shiney (gives it a slightly plastered look) But once I brush them with a dry eyebrow brush, they look great. I will buy again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for about 2 years.  It works pretty good, it keeps the eyebrow fillers or pencil in place and do not move.  I will recommended it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and holds alllll day! It does not flake up like some have said. To take shine off use powder in eyebrow shade and it goes away. Love! Thanks!</li>
            <li> My prior eyebrow sealer was she laq from benefit, but it has been discontinued. So in comparison to that, I like this product but it&#x27;s a little to watery for me. But it works and using it for now. :)</li>
            <li> This seems to hold my brow make up in place pretty well.  I use it a few days a week.</li>
            <li> love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;works even if i&#x27;m all sweaty from working out at the gym. and lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> This stuff is thee best...I can&#x27;t remember how I happened to stumble across it - but it works miracles for my shaded brows!  Truly keeps brows in place...worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> AWESOME product, works fantastic. I have a chronic illness and lost most of my brows so summer time is stressful for me because my penciled brows sweat off. I have tried wax, gel, hairspray, etc, nothing worked.  I was googling trying to find something that worked, this popped up and thought I would give it a try.  Boy am I glad I did.  It comes with 2 different applicators, bottle is the size of an average nail polish bottle, so it will last forever, as you only use a tiny bit.  It doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, it is not sticky or oily. It is wet&amp; thin like water, so go easy with it.  It dries in seconds and works, works, works. To remove use wash cloth with face cleaner or soap. I tried splashing water on forhead and rubbing off like you would if you were sweating, the brows didn&#x27;t smudge. I blotted with tissue and blotting sheets, brows stayed put.  You will not be sorry with  this. I feel like I can now enjoy summer without constantly worrying about my disappearing brows.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I use it over my usual brow powder and it keeps everything in place all day - even in heat and humidity!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little afraid to try swimming with this as I noticed that my eyebrow pencil/shadow combination comes off at least a little when I get my face wet. I can wash it off about as easily as any good eyeliner, and it IS able to rub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to the product and I use actual eyeshadow and a very cheap eyebrow pencil, so maybe that&#x27;s my problem?&lt;br /&gt;Really though, there isn&#x27;t much of a problem at all, I just wanted to state the fact that (for me at least) it isn&#x27;t magic, and just still be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, however, very good stuff. I&#x27;d rather be with it than without. I feel like for the most part I can get by walking around on a hot day and at least have some backup and not worry as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows grow in patchy: there&#x27;s small spots of hair that grow above the general patchy line that looks kind of like an eyebrow &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; so I do feel like I need to draw mine on. I just look terrible without complete eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m happy to have come across this product, it&#x27;s good to have some backup and it is overall very nice and I haven&#x27;t had any legit problems with it at all.</li>
            <li> Keeps by brows in place all day.</li>
            <li> The product works but dries like a shellac over the brow. It makes them look...shellacked. It also has a really strong chemical nail polish like smell. I can&#x27;t imagine that it is good for the eyes. I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> I tried this about a year ago when I could NO longer find She-Laq by Benefits!  I actually like this better because it doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny coat over the make up!</li>
            <li> A must have for all makeup junkie. Well worth it. Great customer service. Fast delivery.Also try other Model in a Bottle products.</li>
            <li> Omg this stuff is a miracle!!! Ever since i shaved off my brows for cosplays ive had problems with keeping my drawn on eyebrows where they belong, not smeared on my face. But after using this, not only are my brows smudge proof they are also pretty water proof.</li>
            <li> I bought my original bottle in 2014, three years later I ran out and reordered. I hate it. This product does not set my brows. I have oily skin, and this doesn&#x27;t help these brows stay pass lunch.</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase. Works as described, and is long-lasting. I use this product regularly.</li>
            <li> Love it! So glad my cousin introduced me to this product. I have very little eyebrows, and pencil them in.&lt;br /&gt;With model in a bottle, I don&#x27;t have to worry about them smudging, or accidentally rubbing my eyebrows away.</li>
            <li> Im a brow makeup junky so i know whats good whats not...this product is my favorite its finish texture it gives to the brow hairs are similar to the anastasia beverly hills clear brow gel</li>
            <li> Works great!! Especially on hot humid days!!! Worked good for me at the beach! :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Keeps my eyebrows put all day!</li>
            <li> It does work actually. I&#x27;m happy I found it. But at the end of the day my eyebrows doesn&#x27;t really look like I have drawn them in the morning. Anyway It&#x27;s better than any trick (powder, base..) I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sealer on my eyebrows, after applying gel to set them in position, for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;I just feel more comfortable applying this sealer; it holds them in the arched position all day!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BOMB!!! I wish that I&#x27;ve known about this stuff years ago!!!! It flakes just a tiny bit but nothing to noticeable. You just can&#x27;t put alot on your eyebrows. It leaves a little shine on and around your eyebrow which I don&#x27;t care to much for. All in all it&#x27;s a good sealer to keep eyebrow in place.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with out this product!!! Keeps your brows on even if you go swimming!!! üëçüëç‚ù§üòç</li>
            <li> I find my powdered in eyebrows last longer.  I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> The product I had been using a high end for years that had been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I searched many sites and came upon this.&lt;br /&gt;At half the price as my past sealer I am very pleased so far.&lt;br /&gt;still working out different ways to use it and use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t use to much your brows stay in place and the color ( auburn for me...very difficult) doesn&#x27;t move.&lt;br /&gt;It also dry&#x27;s with out a plastered down look.&lt;br /&gt;You can re brush your brows after they dry and all is good&lt;br /&gt;I think it will last almost a year</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;waterproof gels and pencils&amp;#34;  nothing has worked better or kept my brows from smudging and smearing than this product.  I&#x27;ve tried other brow sealers but they all seem to have a shiny appearance afterwards. Which is not what I would want to have because I&#x27;m lacking brow hairs towards the tail end. So without this product I would be super self conscience that my brows were smeared halfway my face. LOLg</li>
            <li> Best sealer ever.  I have tattooed eyebrows and over the time the color faded.  I have to define the shape of the brows with pencil and hours later was a messed.  With this product, I have to worry NOT!!!!  I am a very honest person and will definitely recommend the products to all those girlfriends in need of a great color sealer.  By the way, it can be used to seal the lip liner if you wish.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this stuff...half my eyebrows are only penciled in as the hair left sometime ago. So I pencil, cover over, and even when I take a nap I wake up with eyebrows. Also, the product does not add shine to the brow...absolutely invisible. on my second bottle now...</li>
            <li> Not shiny like other things I&#x27;ve used it the past. Pretty waterproof but smudges a little after wearing for a while.</li>
            <li> This product along with the setting spray is awesome ! Makes my makeup last up to 10 + hours</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I can go swimming or workout with worrying about my eyebrows washing off.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because my brows never fade when I use it. I wear loupes at work and sweat  but my brows always are there at the end of the day</li>
            <li> this works really well when I can&#x27;t get it open but the lid feels like it&#x27;s glued on and it&#x27;s really hard to open after a while.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product it actually lasted a long time. I would definitely recommend, word if caution always have your brows defined before using this product.</li>
            <li> I have missing hair in my eyebrows and when I put eyebrow pencil on them, this makes the pencil last longer.  I had another brand that was not as good.  But this one seems just great!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After I put on my eyebrow makeup then I apply this, the brush is too wet that my eyebrow makeup comes off. However, it does a good job of having the makeup last all day.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow sealer is great, does not budge! One of my favorite products from model in a bottle. Glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> This seals your brows in place perfectly,i can put on a cheap brow pencil an this stuff helps it stay on! The bottle last for a long time if used correctly,it doesnt make my brow feel heavy at all</li>
            <li> Love it love it finally I don&#x27;t have to worry about my eyebrows  I have oily skin and when I put this on my eyebrow I don&#x27;t have to worry if they are going to smear thank you FINALLY something that works!!!</li>
            <li> This product really keeps your brow lasts the whole day. I also used this when swimming still good just don&#x27;t rub it off in the water.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot it helps keep my Eyebrows in place and it does not shine.</li>
            <li> This is great! My brows are never complete without this. This really does help to &#x27;seal in&#x27; your brows. It comes with two brushes, for whichever you prefer. A spoolie/mascara wand, and the other is like a nail polish brush. I use the nail polish looking brush because I don&#x27;t even have enough brow hair to even use the spoolie brush. So it&#x27;s great! My brows do not smudge or rub off in the middle of the day like it usually does. Since you only brush on a little amount, the little bottle will last you a very long time. If anything, I will make sure to buy a backup so I will never run out. It&#x27;s that great!</li>
            <li> I really like this one it&#x27;s my favorite  it keeps the eyebrows in place and does what it says.I&#x27;m not sure if it advertises as being waterproof but it definitely is for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect thing to keep your hairs in place AND keep makeup from sweating off.</li>
            <li> I am extremely impressed with this product. It is in a way like holding hair spray for eyebrows.  It makes any brow wax or gel obsolete.  This is the gold standard for  keeping brows in place all day long.  I am glad I purchased this and not a different product. Highly recommended!!!!!!</li>
            <li> HOOKED, I&#x27;ve been using this over 4 years now.  Great if you pencil in your brows and sweat.</li>
            <li> I love &amp;#34;Model in a Bottle&amp;#34; and will purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> IT WORKED WONDER&#x27;S. JUST AS DESCRIBED IN THE INFO. GREAT PACKAGING. I GOT IT IN TIME, NOTHING BAD TO SAY. THANKS.</li>
            <li> Works great for keeping drawn in lashes looking the same until it is time to be removed. Would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Keeps my unruly eyebrows and powder in place all day! Application does have a bit of a learning curve to figure out the right method and amount of product. Don&#x27;t touch your brows after or a white residue will flake off!</li>
            <li> It truly works!! Great guy</li>
            <li> Very pleased. It is an excellent product (Model in a Bottle Eyebrow Sealer). My eyebrows have always been a problem for me. They are thick near the bridge of my nose, and then at the arch, they suddenly taper off to almost nothing.  My solution: I use a good eyebrow powder and a stiff angled brush to fill in sparse areas of my eyebrows (powder looks more natural than using an eyebrow pencil), and then I seal the powder with a dab of this wonderful product.  Now my brows look pretty darned good, if I do say so myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for over a year now. This is my second purchase, which I am buying for backup in case they ever stop making it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased by the free 2-day fast shipping :) bought this because of Carli Bybel from YouTube and so far I am loving it! Great replacement for my Anastasia clear brow gel, which I also love! The two products work exactly the same but Model in a Bottle is half the price for 2x more product! Love how it holds my brows in place all day, it&#x27;s like hairspray for my brows!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this because when you put it on it can actually take off the eyebrow makeup you put on.  Then throughout the day you start to notice dry white stuff on your eyebrows (similar to hairspray).</li>
            <li> I would give this 10 stars if it was possible. It dries quickly, locks in makeup, and it&#x27;s water AND sweat proof. Love this product.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are unruly. They&#x27;re not like giant caterpillar brows or anything like that.. they just aren&#x27;t really into conforming. They&#x27;d rather attempt to grow downwards and maybe have a chat with my eyelashes on occasion. This product coupled with an eyebrow pencil really saves the day. Following application don&#x27;t touch your brows for awhile! Let this stuff set and dry. Also, during the day don&#x27;t be rubbing and fussing with your brows or they&#x27;ll get crusty. Just avoid any sort of contact with your eyebrows and they&#x27;ll stay in place no problem. If you&#x27;re planning on running around outside on a hot summer&#x27;s day be sure to check your brows in the mirror on occasion to make sure they don&#x27;t crust over on account of your sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product daily and it lasts a long time... I&#x27;d say a year?</li>
            <li> If you want smudge &amp; budge proof brows that last &amp; look just as good as when you first did them ......then you so need this in your life. Everytime I&#x27;ve used this product my brows stay put even in hot humid weather! Will def be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Holds my brows in place all day long.  I have been ordering it for several years not.  I refuse to be without it.</li>
            <li> It is summer time, and I accidently plucked my eyebrows way too much.&lt;br /&gt;I glass blow, so usually my makeup brows will come off and drip down my face. (Creating glass art in extreme temperatures makes you sweat too much.)&lt;br /&gt;Anyways! I went on YouTube to find a good product that can leave my eyebrows on without those embarrassing moments.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product, and talk about a holy grail. This stuff is pure genius.&lt;br /&gt;I use a Rimmel Eyebrow Pencil and it is pretty cheap. About six bucks but that&#x27;s nothing compared to those expensive eye brow pencils.&lt;br /&gt;I did not think this liquid would work but it definitely does!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows stay on for the whole day! No touch ups! No dripped eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I have sparse eyebrows and oily skin. I would apply eyebrow pencil and by mid-morning the eyebrow pencil would start to melt and look horrible. I discovered this and it was a game changer for me. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product and am so glad I found it. I went to Florida for vacation - typically I have to go without eyebrow pencil when there because it just melts off. This year I took my model in a bottle with me and OMG - even with the sun, humidity, etc. my eyebrows actually stayed put. I could not believe it. I did find with this product that it does seem to darken my current eyebrow pencil color to about a shade darker, so will probably try a shade lighter and see if it darkens to what I currently have, but even with this I will never be without this product - EVER!!  Best money ever spent!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the purchase. It works very well.</li>
            <li> Model in a bottle far exceeded my expectations! 100% waterproof/smudge proof. After applying this product I have showered, slept, rubbed my face, &amp; my eyebrows are still there as if I had just done them! I absolutely love this product! It doesn&#x27;t take much, after you have your eyebrows the way you like them apply model in a bottle rt over them.Product comes w a wandbrush &amp; a paintbrush type which is the one I use. Arrived on time! I will not run out of this product.</li>
            <li> I have major oily skin, this helped with keeping my brows on until I take it off</li>
            <li> Too bad Benefit discountined She Laq.  It was the best sealer on the market.  Model in the Bottle wipes off too easy. Although I love that it doesn&#x27;t shine. If there is a better brand similar to Benefits She Laq, please holla back.</li>
            <li> Since, for whatever reason, Sephora stopped making their Shelaq, I thought I&#x27;d give this one a whirl.  It has a lighter feel than Shelaq had but unfortunately it is NOT ideal as an eyeliner sealant.  Getting this stuff close to your eye stings.  It washes off easier and holds the makeup in place just as well.  Bottom line: not for eyeliner.  Ouch.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t amazing. It will do the job for a few hours but after that it will easily wear off. Don&#x27;t expect this to be a life changer maybe just an added bonus to life.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! The second brush not all that good and the one that comes with it in the bottle doesn&#x27;t work on bare skin.</li>
            <li> I started out using Shelaq as an eyebrow sealer, when I discovered that the product (Shelaq) was discontinued, I was devastated.  I went on line and goggled eyebrow sealer and this Model in a Bottle came up.  I read the reviews on it and watched a few videos and I said let me give it a try.  Well I&#x27;m so glad I did because I absolutely love it.  It does the job and you only need a little bit and IT WORKS.  It&#x27;s sssssoooooo much cheaper than Shelaq.  I&#x27;m so happy I discovered this product.  It&#x27;s a great eyebrow sealer and I use a pencil to fill in my eyebrows.  \\&quot;When in doubt, check it out\\&quot; Model in a Bottle works :-)</li>
            <li> I draw my eyebrows on completely, with a pencil. I used to use Benefit&#x27;s She-Laq to seal them and was upset to discover my quickly-draining bottle was the last I was going to own -- they discontinued it who knows when. So of course, I went to Amazon to see if I could find anyone still selling it, and then I stumbled upon Model in a Bottle. It was twenty dollars cheaper than She-Laq was, and after I read a few reviews (especially compelled by people who had also used She-Laq) I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the same problems as others with She-Laq; it dries to a shiny finish, after six hours it starts to flake and get this weird powdery effect and it wipes off really easily. But today was my first time trying Model in a Bottle, and I love it. No shiny finish, no weird flaking. And since I shave my eyebrows off and draw them back on, the alcohol did sting a little but that wasn&#x27;t anything I couldn&#x27;t handle. It comes with two brushes; a mascara-like brush and a nail polish-like brush. I use the latter one for my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a replacement to She-Laq or need an eyebrow sealer for whatever reason, I highly recommend this one! It&#x27;s a third of the price, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to without any odd side effects, and there&#x27;s just as much in the bottle as She-Laq.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I saw this on YouTube. I fill in my brows daily and love the fact that they look the same way ALL day long.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s easy to apply, lasts all day, keeps your brow make-up from smudging and keeps eyebrow hairs in place.</li>
            <li> This sealer has made all the difference on my brows, which I struggled to get to hold color or shape. A little goes a long way, so you don&#x27;t need to over-apply to get the full benefit, and it lasts practically the whole day. Very happy!</li>
            <li> What a great little problem solver. You can train your eyebrows to grow right and can use it to keep your eyebrow makeup to stay put!  Seriously- no joke- I used the stencil and eyebrow powder (got a perfect line with the stencils by the way). and used this sealant on top, lasted for 2 days even after sleeping with it there-amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing really works put it on even in the california heat and at the beach it did not budge I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is truly a fantastic product!!!!  My eyebrows have been such a problem for so long.  The outer half is pretty much nonexistent and most brow pencils don&#x27;t really stay on through Texas&#x27; summers, especially when I&#x27;m working outside and sweating :(  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I ran to the supermarket after working outside all day, got home and looked in the mirror to see only half of my eyebrows staring back at me!  Not a good look!!  So I was very happy to find this product at Amazon and see all the great reviews.  I did find I have to brush through the product once I&#x27;ve applied it with my brow brush to avoid any of the flaking on my skin when I  mistakenly apply it outside the eyebrow area.  That&#x27;s no problem though when you consider I can run to the supermarket, get home and still have two pretty eyebrows right where they belong!  I&#x27;m ordering my 2nd bottle today.  I&#x27;m also loving the &#x27;IT&#x27; eyebrow pencil from QVC or ULTA.  It looks really natural, fills in all the blank spots, and stays on well all by itself if you&#x27;re not melting away in the extreme heat  :)</li>
            <li> Great product which really works! The only problem I had was the shape of bottle. I knocked bottle accidentally over and spilled some. So I wrapped a pony tail band on it and have a non slippery bottle. I slept w product on 1st night and woke up with brows intact. Love this and highly recommend it. Yay!</li>
            <li> I have no eyebrows so have to fill in, right?  This stuff keeps my filled in brows in place all day.  Works well and at a great price!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Keeps my eyebrows looking good all day!</li>
            <li> Lasts all day and I mean ALL day..</li>
            <li> Bough for my wife. She loves it.</li>
            <li> This product does the job. I have always had thick dark eyebrows that need taming...even after years of electrolysis. However, it&#x27;s necessary to make sure you really wipe the wand off on the bottle before applying. You only need a small amount. I found it very \\&quot;wet\\&quot; relative to a Merle Norman product I have used in the past. However, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I prefer using the nail polish looking applicator. It&#x27;s better for those of us who are hairless in the brow zone.  Four stars and not five? Because it doesn&#x27;t last through a night of sleep. Regardless, I will use this every single day.</li>
            <li> Where do I begin? I will start with the cons (I&#x27;ve used this product daily for 5 mos before posting this review)&lt;br /&gt;1) Flakes after it dries&lt;br /&gt;2) Rubs off easily&lt;br /&gt;3) It sometimes burn when applied&lt;br /&gt;4) brush is kind of flimsy when applying&lt;br /&gt;5) Takes a bit of time to dry&lt;br /&gt;6) Doesn&#x27;t seal the brow very well. Hair still moves and makeup/pencil rubs off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1) Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;2) Enough product to last a while for those that like it&lt;br /&gt;3) Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to find more pros, but I really can&#x27;t. If I find another product, I would not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I have trich and my eyebrows are really patchy. I was embarrassed waking up in the morning next to my boyfriend with no eyebrows. I can put it on before bed and wake up looking way less alien like. To cut down on the shine you can get I pat it after putting it on. Lovely product made me feel normal and not about my trich.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like filling in your brows for it to disappear by the end of the day. Model in a bottle prevents this! I am do glad I finally bought this product.</li>
            <li> definitely seals brow powder to last all day. I recommend using the wand applicator instead of the brush because the brush will wipe away the makeup. doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, dries clear, and removes easily.</li>
            <li> it really works! I was very skeptical about this because I have tried everything when it comes to eyebrows. I have very little hair due to over plucking and draw my eyebrows on every day. As you will see in the picture attached, I applied this to one eyebrow and left the other one without it and I wiped both eyebrows with a little pressure at the same time with my fingers and it stayed on! I was shocked, but relieved I found something!</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;eyebrows&amp;#34; don&#x27;t rub off thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow sealer preformed for me exactly as described. After filling in eyebrows,no smudging also no shiny cast after applied. Short drying time as well. This product also comes with a a small spooly brush for thoes who want  to tame thick unruly brows. Lasting time is all day comes off when you wash it off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good. I cannot complain!</li>
            <li> Love  it! Lost my eyebrows to chemo ten years ago and they grew back white and very sparse and scattered. I have to pluck what&#x27;s left and start over. Model in a bottle Is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that actually keeps them looking fresh all day without melting or smearing. Thank you model in a bottle</li>
            <li> Ladies - if you use a brow pencil, this is a must! Not only that, this is an investment. I&#x27;ve spend so much money on the better brow liners because of their lasting power, but having to drop on average $25 every month or so was getting ridiculous (many of the expensive wax pencils don&#x27;t give you a lot of product). This product is great because you can use any inexpensive drug store brow pencil and this will make it last ALL DAY! No more disappearing eyebrows in the afternoon....this is a lifesaver. And it will save you money in the long run. It removes easily with any facial soap or regular soap and water. Finally, a solution.</li>
            <li> I saw this used on youtube from some of the makeup bloggers , and i really wanted to try it because i have braids and sometimes my braids fall on my face and brush up against my brows and move the hairs ..... Well this helps a ton!! its quite liquid-y like a nail polish , but not sticky or anything....it does give a shine for the first 30 mins or so.....but its awesome.....FYI don&#x27;t play with your eyebrows and try to brush it off, use water/soap or a makeup cloth remover ..... TRUST ME  lol</li>
            <li> I have very light eyebrows so I pencil them in &amp; this product keeps it in tact ALL Day! No glossy look like other products.</li>
            <li> Applied it to one eyebrow and within an hour, my eyebrow felt weird so I reached up to touch it and it was crusted and my eyebrow had turned red and bumped up.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works, lasts all day.</li>
            <li> product came via postal mail on time. Once I used it for the first time I was in love. This product really works. I recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got very sparse eyebrows and I look like an alien without filling them in. This product keeps them in place all day and I work retail. Lots of sweating and stressing etc lol. I even wore it in Vegas one summer when I stupidly walked from Circus Circus to the Venetian. Brows did not budge.</li>
            <li> Good merchandise and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Ok well this stuff was supposed to be my dream come true, but it was not. It will flake up, and will not keep your brows in place through the night. I use a pencil. Maybe it will work on brow powder better. Not sure. Ill put it on if im just laying down for a min but its not 100% reliable</li>
            <li> I love this bottle now I dont have to wonder if my eyebrows are still on. Once I put this product on, my brows will always be there thank model in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I use a gel based eyebrow pencil that seems to fade a little throughout the day.  I was carrying an extra pencil in my handbag to fill in my brows and decided to find something to keep from having to check my brows all day.  This seems to do the trick and I don&#x27;t have to worry that I have rubbed off or smeared my brows when touching my face without thinking.  I recommend it and a little goes a long way.  I dab inside the neck of the bottle with the brush a few times to make sure I don&#x27;t put too much on as I think it will flake.  Less is more most times.</li>
            <li> Have had difficulty keeping on my brow makeup through the course of the day.  This really works!!!  My eyebrows have disappeared, but I can rely on my brow makeup staying on as long as I apply the Model in a Bottle sealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product daily for a few months now &amp; it works GREAT.  I used Benefit&#x27;s She-laq for years until it was discontinued.  Model in a Bottle is a better product at half the price. It works great at sealing my eye brow powder all day and gel eye liner (when needed for humid days or long evenings). NOTE: be extra careful when sealing eye liner. There is alcohol in this product that will sting the eyes.</li>
            <li> I took a while to review this product because it took a while to learn how to apply it.  It goes on clear, no shiny kid stuff, and it lasts all day.  But it runs down my face if I don&#x27;t wipe the brush off on the edge of the bottle.  Once I started doing that, I still had to learn not to press it too hard against my brow--or it took my eyebrow pencil off with it.  Now that I got the hang of it, I like it.  It even lasts through a night of hot salsa dancing, and anything that might come afterwards.</li>
            <li> Litterly makes your eyebrows perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anybody that wants their eyebrows to stay in place all day. It really works. Even when I took it off in the shower they were staying in place! I loved it. Thank you so much. + Came in faster than I thought it would. :)</li>
            <li> I love it, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is if you leave it on there for more than a day your eyebrows build up crust from the liquid drying</li>
            <li> Leaves little white flakes that look like dandruff</li>
            <li> Great job! Keeps brows in place</li>
            <li> Keeps my eyebrows looking flawless all day and it is super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> At long last a way to confidently put on my brows and keep them on without fear of brushing them away or smearing them all day. Wow.  Works great on  unruly brows as well, let my sister try it for that reason and she loves it.  Ordered her a bottle and another formself.  Great product.</li>
            <li> It did not stop my eyebrow from coming off.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use eyebrow shadows to enhance my eyebrows. The brush applicator is great because it allows you to control the amount of the sealer and the brush which is included is wonderful to comb eyebrows. I got many compliments on my eyebrows! Excellent product. Would order again once I run out of it!</li>
            <li> I have no eyebrows so I love Model in a Bottle, don&#x27;t have to worry about pencil coming off.</li>
            <li> Definintely seals the makeup in. No more rubbing off with your hand or shirt accidentally. I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome all the way!!!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I expected it to. After penciling in my eyebrows, I brush on a small amount of this eyebrow sealer and let it dry for a minute. It goes on clear. I think they&#x27;ve changed the formulation as it dries more clear and matte than clear and shiny as it used to, which s definitely a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I like the nail polish application for the ends of my eyebrows which is more penciled on than actual hair.</li>
            <li> Actually works pretty well , even after falling asleep one night. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> LOVE. LOVE. LOVE! It&#x27;s kind of like applying gel. It goes on feeling like a gel-like substance, but it leaves no residue. My brows stay in place and I love it.</li>
            <li> I used Benefit&#x27;s shelaq fort years until they discontinued it so i went in search of a similar product and found this which is half the price and does the job. If your like me and fill in your eyebrows but by the end of the day they&#x27;re almost gone- just Swype this over top and you&#x27;re good for the day!</li>
            <li> I use this for sealing my eyebrows.  It works, but it burns really bad from the alcohol.  I really wish benefit would bring back their sealent.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It really does keep my brow makeup in place all day.</li>
            <li> Works great for sealing on powder and pencil eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Keeps my eyebrow makeup in place, all day! Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. Affordable, and a little bit goes a  long way. I would recommend this to anyone that has unruly brow hair, or fill in their brows like I do.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that likes to do or fill in their eyebrows.  This works as a great seal to prevent my eyebrows from getting messed up</li>
            <li> It certainly works, but it leaves your eyebrows so stiff and it&#x27;s difficult to apply without removing the eyebrow powder/cream, pencil you have just applied!! That&#x27;s probably the most annoying part and the reason this stuff is stiff sitting in my bathroom almost full.  It comes with an applicator that looks like a nailpolish applicator, BUT it also comes with a spooly applicator.  I thought for sure the first time I looked at it that the nailpolish applicator was useless and I&#x27;d be using the spooly, but this stuff is pure liquid- so there&#x27;s no way to get a &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; amount of product on EITHER applicator without over saturating it and when you use the brush it doesn&#x27;t get through each hair, and when you use the spooly it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re washing the brow product right out of your brow.  Then after this stuff is applied, touch ups to your brow are impossible, the powder just doesn&#x27;t sit normally.  I&#x27;ve tried different eyebrow products and different ways to apply.  Like I said, it definitely works, it&#x27;s seriously like using clear nolish as a topcoat for your brows, but they feel VERY stiff, and almost shiny if you put too much.  Also, if you can get this stuff on without taking off your eyebrow makeup congratulations.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly to set eyebrow pencil for all day wear. My brows look clean, sharp, and natural, all day.</li>
            <li> Package received quickly. Product leaked through box. Product doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Yes, a 1000 x yes I can&#x27;t believe I lived this long without this product. I always like to trim my eyebrows so I can draw them back on again in various ways/color them in to match my hair color...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m half asian and in the heat my face always sweats a LOT so my eyebrows would be melting off my face after a long hot, humid day. With this product I&#x27;ve found i can even go to sleep somedays with my eyebrows drawn on and they&#x27;re perfect the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I draw the brows on and then shape them with concealer. After that I carefully apply this product. It doesn&#x27;t work as well with brow powder and it CAN get clumpy and dry white so I&#x27;ve found that less really is more with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying it again because I&#x27;ve already run through a whole bottle! love it.</li>
            <li> Great product, it last all day</li>
            <li> I have never been one to write reviews but this product is amazing so of course i had to give my opinion.I have very thin eyebrows and color them in on a daily basis. I have struggled to find cheap and most importantly, sealers that actually work. You can go to bed with this product on and wake up with them still in place!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, I wear over eyeliner surfing 1-2hours and pretty much stays on my eyes. A little strong when you put it around the eyes but dries fast.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have a medical condition so my eyebrows can be very scarce.  I have to fill in my brow every day with a combo of liner and powder to create a full brow and then I dust them with powder to get them to stay.  Of course I had to touch up through out the day and worry if my brow work had slid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Model in a Bottle keeps everything on with no budging. I dont even bother to check them once Ive put this on over my liner or brow powder. I have gone swimming with it on and it does have some staying power. My brows made it through a few laps and dives  but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest totally soaking my face and expecting brows to survive. I live in New England and it does 100% of the time stay put for me in the nasty humidity here. If it can survive the humidity, rain, sleet and snow that speaks volumes to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed a sheen like some people have said in their reviews. Nor have I had any flaking. It comes off easily with soap and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on this product and I am actually ordering more for back up because I dont know of any other product that does what this one does. I&#x27;d be lost without it at this point.</li>
            <li> I was torn by the reviews but when this stuff dries it leaves white flakes anywhere it touched the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so embarrassed to look in the mirror after walking around like that! Used it once and threw it away.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work since I have no eye brows at all. I draw my eyebrows on everyday and they would be almost gone by midday. I was always worried about them and had to always try my hardest to not touch them. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore. This works great! I could not be happier! Thank you for helping my confidence!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love model in a bottle! This product is amazing. Sets your eyebrows all day. This purchase is definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> I have very sparse brows plus a rather sizeable scar that goes across my left brow and temple, so hair doesn&#x27;t grow there.  I have been using Benefit SheLaq for years to seal brow color. That product leaves brows shiny.  It&#x27;s also been discontinued by Benefit.  I am DELIGHTED to have tried Model in a Bottle...it works so much better than SheLaq and it&#x27;s a fraction of the price.  No more stiff shiny brows here!!  I cannot tell you how happy I am to have tried this...it&#x27;s going to become a staple from now on, I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny brow trail, nor does it alter the color of the brow product like SheLaq did; plus, my brows aren&#x27;t stiff.  This is about as natural as you&#x27;ll get to having natural lush brows!!I absolutely recommend, without hesitation!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously amazing. I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this for quite some time and am proud to say it lives up to the hype. I will definitely continue to re purchase!!</li>
            <li> froze my eyebrows! loved it</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of positive reviews on this product I decided to give it a try.  It does exactly what it claims!  My brows last all day and the product doesn&#x27;t flake.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally rubbing off my brows.  I have very sparse brows and hoped this product would allow me to go a few days without having to draw them in, but it doesn&#x27;t last quite that long (only if you don&#x27;t shower and sleep standing up) lol.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I fill in my eyebrows with powder and pencil so after I just apply it and my eyebrows stay on all day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I am fair skinned and without my eyebrows in the morning I look very scary,this product does not work even a little bit</li>
            <li> Helps to keep my eyebrow makeup on for at least a day, sometimes longer.  The top of the bottle came apart from the brush, but I was still able to hold onto the tip of the brush part where it was supposed to be glued in, and was able to apply the product with a little difficulty at holding it.</li>
            <li> Love it however some of the product leaked out of the bottle during shipment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting use to using it.  There&#x27;s a formula that you have to get just right so that it will work.  But all in all, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> The best eyebrow sealer out there!! I have tried tons.</li>
            <li> I used a little, and a lot, either way, this stuff flaked, and stung, AND my eyebrows STILL smudged!!! A waste of time and money!!!</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff works!!  I have very light and sparse eyebrows so I use a pencil and powder to fill them in. Since I have crazy oily skin my eyebrows are nearly gone by 5 pm.  Last night I still had my eyebrows when I went to wash my face before bed.  This is a WIN for me!! Happy I found this product!!</li>
            <li> I had hoped that this product would really seal my eyebrow makeup so that it would last in humidity and when I swim. It did not.</li>
            <li> I have just learned how to fill in my eyebrows with eyebrow shadow. The downside of that was within a few hours I would look in the mirror and the brown from my eyebrows would \\&quot;flake\\&quot; on my face. I was so bummed out because My eyebrows looked perfect in the morning! Anyways, I came across this product on Amazon. I sifted through the reviews,despite some people with bad reviews. I try to ignore those till I have tried it myself. I went ahead and purchased model in a bottle and it came very fast! Even with standard shipping! I opened it and it literally looked like clear nail polish! I was kinda nervous to try it. I use the brush that looks like the mascara brush. I LOVE IT! It never smears my eyebrow shadow off and it dries fast! No smell, no sticky weird feeling! I use this everyday! I will for sure buy more when I run out! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is great. It definitely keeps your eyebrows in place. the only problem is that it is easy to apply to much and then get some flaking. If you apply a small amount and evenly it works amazingly!</li>
            <li> I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF YOUTUBE REVIEWS ON THIS MODEL IN BOTTLE FOR YOUR BROWS. I DECIDED TO TRY IT BECAUSE I&#x27;M ALWAYS SHAPING MY BROWS, AND I LOVE IT. WHEN I APPLIED THE SEALER TO MY BROWS I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH MY BROWS THEY WERE LIKE A FREEZE STAND STILL. WOWWW!! I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND IT DONT TAKE MUCH TO USE SO I WILL BE HAVING THIS ONE BOTTLE TO LAST ME A WHILE.  2 THUMBS UP ON THIS ONE</li>
            <li> This really locks my eyebrows in place, holds the product in place and lasts all day</li>
            <li> Good, effective without being waxy or shiney.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive</li>
            <li> Its pretty good stuff. I&#x27;d recommend it. Its worth the money.  I&#x27;ve been using it for months.  Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love it, and I have purchased bottle for other people who equally love it. When it&#x27;s hot outside nothing is better at keeping your eyebrows in tact!!! Love it! I need to order another for myself, all of my friends took mine ;)</li>
            <li> I need to draw on most of my eyebrows since chemo therapy.  But if I sweat the eyebrows disappear.  This sealer holds up pretty well to perspiration. There is a little crumbling sometimes, but not often.</li>
            <li> This product  works very well.........my eyebrows look perfect and polished. Will definitely purchase this product again. I don&#x27;t think I can do without it.</li>
            <li> I got this a few weeks ago at IMATS NYC and I must say its amazing!! My brows last all day through rain, sweat, and oil!! I wouldn&#x27;t say sit there and scratch your brows because of course then its going to come off thats common sense but in general it will last through humidity this stuff works!!</li>
            <li> Really wanted to love this product but the flaking wouldn&#x27;t let me.  I used a little and it flaked, used more and it flaked, used even less than the first time flaked.  Tried with eyeshadow, eyeliner and my Anastasia brow pencil; still flaked.  Had to put a little oil on my brows to hide the flaking.  It does have staying power but the flaking makes it useless for me.</li>
            <li> Great product last all day until i wash it off...and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin...i would recommend this product to friends</li>
            <li> This stuff has no more holding power than a strong hair gel.  Don&#x27;t bother spending the $$ on it.  Just use a strong hair spray or hair gel in stead.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and use it regularly. I really do not have anything bad to say about this product, this is the first time I have ever used eyebrow concealer. So I  cannot compare it to any other brand. This product was price reasonably, shipped in timely manner, received in good condition. Yes I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Dries fast.  Actually allows your brows to retain overnight.  No harsh odor.  Love the flexibility of the 2 brush styles.  Does not take much to do the job.  I have long Dreadlocks, my issue was when my hair would sweep across my face trough out the day it would wipe away my perfect brows that I worked so hard to create.  This product helps seal my brow makeup for a long lasting look</li>
            <li> I teach very sweaty power yoga classes ( sometimes as many as six a day) and this works miraculously. I have a thyroid condition that has made my brows sparse so I use brow pencil every day and this enables me to have confidence that my brows last. My only caution is don&#x27;t apply it too thick, it will flake. Also, dont bother spending money on the waterproof brow gels, they dont last any better than inexpensive brow pencils with this product. Every Christmas I give my  adult daughters &amp;#34;moms favorite things&amp;#34; in their stockings, and this will be in their stocking this year!</li>
            <li> Model in a bottle has become a staple product of my beauty routine. I brought it because I needed something for an uncoming trip and it worked perfectly. Before getting this eyebrow sealer I had to walk around with my brow pencil, not anymore. I absolutely love this stuff. My eyebrows survived Mexico, an east coast heat wave and clorine pools. The bottle is small but you don&#x27;t need a lot so it will last a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> LOVE! This stuff works so well to keep my brows in place.</li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews and did some research on this product! The concept is great but it needs some revising. When I put it on my face it dries with a sheen and it leaves white marks across my eyebrows. All of this and I have oily skin. Maybe I am putting too much on I thought. I put less on and my eyebrows will not stay in place! I ordered a bottle and I received it half filled because it spilled. I called customer service and they were pleasant and immediately sent out another bottle. One of the best customer service experiences I have ever had! I will continue to use the product because I have eyebrow issues and I have to use an eyebrow pencil and need it to stay in pace. Until I find something better, this will have to due!</li>
            <li> This is actually for making eyebrows that you have painted on or applied with makeup, NOT a fixative for your real eyebrows which I don&#x27;t think is clear in the description.</li>
            <li> Best thing so for!!!!</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s like everyone says, this a very good product.  It goes on very thinly so you need very little and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This really works, I have hot flashes and I fill in my eyebrows and with this stuff all year around the eyebrow pencil stays on. Great stuff</li>
            <li> When Benefit stopped making Shelaq I was in complete panic.  I&#x27;d used the product for decades and loved how it kept my make-up in place for hours and hours.  I immediately went to the internet looking for a replacement product and I can honestly say Model in a Bottle is BETTER than Shelaq.  I don&#x27;t have to water it down as I did Shelaq so it wouldn&#x27;t leave a shiney look where I applied it, Model glides on and sticks in the hottest weather.  I use it on liner and brows and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> love it. it works perfectly and the price os great.  this product exveeded my expectations. I will.try other products by this company.</li>
            <li> This product works great. It does keep my brows in place all day. If you apply too much it will look shiny but I&#x27;ve learned that you don&#x27;t need much. I love this and because you only need so little it will last you so long.</li>
            <li> It works and it sets my eyebrows in place all day long!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  It absolutely does just what it says it will do.  Just after I received it and used it for the first time, I came down with a horrible cold that kept me in bed for a couple of days.  I didn&#x27;t wash or cleanse my face for two days since I was so miserable.  When I finally got to a mirror to see how horrible I looked, I found I did look horrible but my eyebrows were still perfect.  I was amazed that they didn&#x27;t fade or melt away (and I have oily skin).  I use a combination of eyebrow pencil and powder to fill in my sparse brows and I follow by just dabbing the spooly brush over my brows to set them.  I don&#x27;t comb it through, I just lightly dab the wet brush over my brows.  That way I don&#x27;t brush off the product I just applied.  There is no flaking like some gel products I&#x27;ve used and it dries completely invisible.  And it stays!  After 11-hour days in the office and a nightly trip to the gym.  I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product never fails!  It&#x27;s a staple in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Holds all day no problem, does make eyebrows a bit crunchy. Will flake if scratched. But still overall a really great prodcut</li>
            <li> This stuff is a godsend. I draw my eyebrows on daily, and there is nothing more infuriating than forgetting and accident my smearing my eyebrow across my face. This stuff lasts all day and seals my eyebrows on. Looks great and works great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely happy with model in a bottle. Works great. I will order again when need.</li>
            <li> HAVE YOU EVER WORRIED ABOUT YOUR EYE BROW PENCIL OR CREAM RUBBING OFF DURING A WORKOUT .. WELL IF YOU APPLY THIS ON THEM PRIOR TO A WORKOUT. THIS WILL SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM. I READ REVIEWS AND WATCHED VIDEOS ON YOU TUBE BEFORE I DECIDED TO BUY. YES ITS WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product! I have been drawing my eyebrows on since mid-high and im 23years old now. My eyebrows grow like a 1\\&quot; out then stop. I have had every embarassing moment you can think of. Smears on my someones face, on wash cloths after a workout, etc... This product is a God send Literaly! Im hooked and you will be too, even got my friends enterested in buying. It really works and a little goes a long way. I apply this right after I draw and fill in with my brow powder and shape. I found YouTube very helpful in getting reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li> This works really well but do not use a lot! I dab the solution on my finger and then dab it on my eyebrows after I draw them on...</li>
            <li> Wow.  This is like super hold Hairspray for eyebrows.  Once you apply it, nothing is budging.  It will last even while you swim.</li>
            <li> I like it so far. I forget to apply it sometimes, especially when I&#x27;m in a rush. But when I do apply it it last all day. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love how the product glides on so perfectly.... It is absolutely, perfectly amazing! :)</li>
            <li> This stuff works ok at keeping your eyebrows in place, but it gets very crispy and hard which can make your eyebrows look really fake.  I also noticed that it makes my skin itch after it&#x27;s been on a few hours.  I won&#x27;t be trying it again that&#x27;s for sure it just wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> easy to apply, lasted all day, loved it and would buy again.  New to wearing make up and found this perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to buy something like this for a long time now, and I&#x27;m so glad I finally did. I use a waterproof eyebrow pencil and this keeps it on and my brows in place.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product for sealing in your eyebrows.  A little goes a long way so be careful not to overdo it because it will drip all over you and can get into your eyes which would not be pleasant.</li>
            <li> The product was good, it works, i would recommend this........but the only problem that I have, one of the brushes were broken. The company have told me that they would send another brush to me. So I&#x27;m still waiting for the company to send me a replacement brush. I&#x27;m not pleased and waiting for my brush!</li>
            <li> Now that Benefit doesn&#x27;t make Shelaq any more and my cat spilled my last bottle, I had to find something similar and this actually turned out to be better! I use my anastasia brow powder, then use the &#x27;paint on&#x27; applicator (not the mascara like brush in the pic)and I brush the excess off on the bottle rim and lightly run it over my brows. Dries fast and doesn&#x27;t get weirdly shiny like Shelaq did. Way cheaper too!</li>
            <li> Great product, brows actually last all day, without smearing all over the place. I would definitely buy this product again...</li>
            <li> My clients love the fact that they can keep their eyebrows on for 2 days! Thanks to this product for making it possible!</li>
            <li> I have sort of patchy eyebrows and I live in fear of my eyebrow pencil wearing off--especially while swimming or sweating a lot--and showing the world my imperfect brows (silly as that sounds). This stuff is amazing! I put it on one Saturday night, went out dancing and sweat a lot, then spent Sunday at the beach without ever having to reapply. My eyebrows were intact the entire time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear it every day because it feels a little stiff, but if you know you&#x27;re going to need eyebrow insurance (on a night out or something) this is definitely the way to go!</li>
            <li> i was disappointed in the \\&quot;performance\\&quot; of this product after i heard from some one that it worked great for them.</li>
            <li> Keeps them in place, even my bf out of  control brows, who I swear grow by the minute. ..</li>
            <li> I had tried this Model in a Bottle a few months ago, just to see how it was.  I use to use SheLaq but the company does not make it any more.  When I tried this Model in a Bottle, for the eyebrows, it works fabulous.  I tried to see if also it works for the eye liner to help it stay on, but it didnt, but that was ok....~  At least it does work for the eyebrows and I am very happy with it.  I just ordered another 2 bottles, just to have incase this product is cancelled. One never knows.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled</li>
            <li> love this product and would recommend this eyebrow sealer. The only negative thing I have to say is it flaked some!</li>
            <li> The best eyebrow sealer ever. Keeps my brows intact all day long. Even when in sweating. Great Product. Plz Try</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! My brows are sealed until I wash off my makeup for the day. This is a must have in your make-up kit.</li>
            <li> I am too a former Benefit Shelaq user. Was very disappointed when they stopped selling it. This product is fantastic, works the same!!! I use Brow Zing or MAC eyebrow pencil in black and every once in a while it would melt a little if I tanned or living in Las Vegas, sweated, so this is fabulous and makes everything stay where it should!!</li>
            <li> It works really well- definitely keeps the eyebrow makeup &amp; hairs in place. Just don&#x27;t apply too much, or it will harden and make your eyebrows feel like bricks, haha! Other than that, I like using this when I know I&#x27;m working long days at the office and my makeup would otherwise fade throughout the hours.</li>
            <li> I ride a motorcycle and constantly worry about not having any makeup on when I take off my helmet, this reduces that significantly !</li>
            <li> product lived up to its claim my eyebrows lasted for 2 days without any erasing or smudging what a cool product.  i can take my time now deciding whether or not i would want to schedule a permanent makeup brow tattoo. the service was fast and packed nicely. i will order a second bottle this week. this is a must have and a staple.</li>
            <li> A friend at my job recomended this product. I tried it and loved it . It keeps my brows in place when I fill them in as well. Great for the price will last a pretty good while.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have no eye brows and have to pencil them in every morning!</li>
            <li> No sealed, a lot of flakes and residues.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> Used this a few times and it was okay at first, but really glopped up and when it dried I had to peel it off like cooled hot glue.  Then I used it to go to the beach, because there&#x27;s nothing worse then your eyebrows falling/sweating off in public. Got sunburned. Came home. Have a white, unsunburned arch where the Model in a Bottle took ahold. Stupid. Have a pic to share but don&#x27;t know how.</li>
            <li> My oh my where do I begin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, Benefit&#x27;s She-Laq was discontinued not too long ago. For gals who draw on their eyebrows EVERYDAY like it&#x27;s their job (like myself), this was simply tragic. How else was I to seal my color and make sure that my eyebrows were smudgeproof? My biggest nightmare is them rubbing off or melting in the rain (yeah, that&#x27;s no way to live), so I was on a mission to find a product comparable to She-Laq or better, if that was even possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you - MiaLLES is 100xs better than She-Laq!!! Not only do my brows last the whole day (and still look &#x27;fresh&#x27;), they do not look shiny at all, which was a huge problem I had with She-Law. Since MiaLLES doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows shine or glisten in the sun, they end up looking much more natural. Of course, I&#x27;m estatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some reviewers complained about it flaking; I have black eyebrows and never had a problem. Of course, common sense will tell you that if you rub your eyebrows while you seal them with MiaLLES, then DUH, you will definitely experience flaking. So try not to rub your eyebrows at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If She-Laq was brought back, I probably wouldn&#x27;t go back to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*TIP* If you want your eyebrow color/powder to last even longer, use Shiseido Extra Smooth Sun Protection Lotion SPF 34 PA --100ml/3.4oz for Women as a base BEFORE you start working on your eyebrows. For reasons I can&#x27;t explain, my eyebrows stay looking fresher for double the time (about 12-16 hours from application) and so does my make up. Sealing my eyebrows with Model In a Bottle adds even MORE hours to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope all of you enjoy it as much as I do! You won&#x27;t regret buying it. What do you have to lose when it&#x27;s so damn cheap????</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have been a loyal user of Benefit&#x27;s She Laq for years to keep my brows at bay, and had almost a full bottle left to last me until one day while cleaning I spilled it and was horrified to find out it had been discontinued! After doing some research I came across this product and SWOON! The staying power is just as great and you get a lot of product for a great price! I would definitely recommend and will be buying again!</li>
            <li> This item was a great find several years ago and I have been using it ever since.  It holds my brow hairs in place all day long.</li>
            <li> Did not do what it says it does</li>
            <li> Love this eyebrow sealer use it everyday only thing I can say is that it doesn&#x27;t last the entire day but I would still order it again</li>
            <li> This Model in a Bottle sealer is the best! if you sweat and want your eyebrows to not tell on you, this is all you need. In one little bottle that it is design to last you a good amount of time. I just love it. Totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great product! It real works. I love it</li>
            <li> i reccommend this product to anyone my brows stay on all day even when i walk on the tredmill....I love this stuff and the price is perfect.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  I repeat, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  I used it twice and each time around 4-5 hours later all of my penciled eyebrows have disappeared and I wear my eyebrows dark and heavy so something should be there but nothing.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff.  I fist got it home and I decided to see if it was going to work.  So I penciled in my brows, brushed model in a bottle on, let it dry and took a nap.  Woke up from the nap brows still in place as if I had just done them!  So next I go stand over the hot stove and prepare dinner, surely this will do the bows in!  NOPE I go about my nightly routine and finally take a shower and the hot shower was the only thing that made my brows finally come off.  If you have to pencil in your brows like me this stuff is like magic I tell you I keep at lease 2 extra bottles on hand and recommend it to all my girlfriends.  Try it you will love it.  Any negative reviews has to be that they were not using it correctly, I swear by this stuff.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it said it would do. Keeps your eyebrow in place even when you sweat. This is a staple product for me now.</li>
            <li> I use this on nights I know I&#x27;m going to be out all night.  Works great.  I will recommend this.</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever used</li>
            <li> It does as it says. will buy it again. Was packaged well and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This product does work. Just be careful if you have any sensitive area around your eyebrows, like plucking, it will sting somewhat.</li>
            <li> love this product. Keeps my brows in place even during exercise.</li>
            <li> Wish I had this LONG TIME AGO! Keeps eyebrow shaping all day, and almost stays on even after working out</li>
            <li> As we get older, many of us lose our eyebrows. This helps keep on the powder or pencil that I use. You have to dab it however, or it will leave a noticeable line.</li>
            <li> mannnnn I hate that they changed the formula, I can tell because when I go to put on my eyebrow pencil my eyebrows feel too slick, Where as before I could literally draw them on, now I don&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my sister who is a personal trainer so she needed a long lasting, &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; product to keep her eyebrows on during extreme workouts! Pleased to say that she loves it and has ordered 2 more since then. It keeps eyebrows on despite sweat, face wiping, etc. I would recommend to anyone who needs their brows intact!</li>
            <li> Lasts all day. Great sealer</li>
            <li> First time putting it on it burn my eyebrows but it works very well I like it, its long lasting like it said.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent if you have oily skin and suffer from brow products sliding and smudging throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have thick eyebrows and this really helps keep them in place without becoming shiny, crunchy or flaky.  Very glad I bought this.  I used to use brow wax before, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with model in a bottle.</li>
            <li> This product works!! I use a cream product to fill in my brows and then i apply this over top and i mean they stay put until u take it off with your regular cleanser... But no more worrying about my eyebrows being gone halfway throughout the day... My 16 year old daughter looooves it just as much as i do... I&#x27;m very happy that i tried it... It lasts along time too... Worth every penny....</li>
            <li> Second bottle!!!!Took me a year to run out the first bottle...I work in a warehouse my brows never smudge</li>
            <li> Due to over-tweezing in the late 80&#x27;s my eyebrows are almost non-existent. To say they&#x27;re sparse is an understatement. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve been penciling my brows for a very long time. I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this product so I decided to buy it because so many people gave it 5 stars, especially the people who have sparse brows, oily skin and live where the weather gets pretty hot and humid. Some said their eyebrows stay put even when they wipe their hands across them accidentally. Wow! If this is true, how awesome would that be? I&#x27;m in San Diego and a couple weeks ago the temps were in the high 90&#x27;s and a few days we got into the 100&#x27;s. So I was excited when I received my Model In A Bottle. Let me just say I&#x27;ve used different pencils, from drugstore brands to high-end pencils. So I penciled my brows, applied the sealer and waited for it to dry. Then I VERY lightly ran my finger through a brow. It smeared. It didn&#x27;t smear as much as it would&#x27;ve without the sealer though. So, I removed my make-up and tried a different pencil, thinking perhaps maybe the first pencil&#x27;s formula was the culprit. I again applied the sealer and let it dry. Keep in mind that my brows had not had a chance to get oily yet. The same thing happened, it smeared. But again, not as much as it would&#x27;ve without the sealer. I have noticed, however, that without the sealer the beginning of my brows would &#x27;bleed&#x27; into the fine lines between my eyes and with the sealer I did not have this problem, so that&#x27;s a plus for me. Maybe this product doesn&#x27;t work as well for me because, as I mentioned, I really DON&#x27;T have any brows to speak of. It&#x27;s mostly skin with very little hair. All in all I&#x27;m okay with this product and I&#x27;ll continue to use this to keep my brow pencil from bleeding into those fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/25/14: I changed my rating from 3 stars to 4! I have to say the more I use this product, the more I appreciate it. If I apply two coats instead of one, it works better for me as it doesn&#x27;t seem to smear as easily AND even in the pool my eyebrows stayed put. Granted, I didn&#x27;t WIPE my eyebrows dry but I did pat them dry with a towel. When I looked in the mirror, they were still there. Some reviews have stated that the liquid gets white and flaky, but I haven&#x27;t had this problem. Sometimes it stings a little, like some other reviews have mentioned, but it doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it. I&#x27;ll definitely re-purchase!ter for me as it doesn&#x27;t seem to smear as easily AND even in the pool my eyebrows stayed put.

            <li> This exceeded my expectations.  I have tried lots of brow gels and even hairspray, and nothing else has kept my eye brows in perfect place all day. I&#x27;ve been using it 6 months now and I&#x27;m only half way through it. I will definitely reorder!!</li>
            <li> Thus stuff really does work</li>
            <li> This produce does exactly what it claims to. I researched other customer reviews from various websites &amp; they all had good things to say about this stuff. Now I know why and those women are 100% right. I have very thin eyebrows and use pencil and powder to make up for the lack of density. I&#x27;ve mastered getting them to look \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but the problem was by mid afternoon, they&#x27;d be fading away! I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday for the last few weeks and swear by it now! In the evening when I go to wash my face for bed, most of my foundation is gone, my blush &amp; bronzer has faded, eyeliner evaporated but my brows still look picture perfect, it&#x27;s amazing. If you fill in your brows with pencil or powder or both (like me) get this stuff - it works, it works, it works!</li>
            <li> This product made my eyebrows flake within a few hours after applying. I tried it with a few different pencils and varying amounts of product from almost nothing to a lot. They all had the same effect. Cracked and flaking eyebrows. I have very sparse eyebrows that are all but invisible, but I&#x27;ve found using an eye primer and setting them with powder works much better than model in a bottle.</li>
            <li> So far this is possibly the second worst purchase I have ever made online.  Why?  Because it is USELESS!  I wasted money getting this,  does not work,  does not help,  does NOTHING but hurts.  I am so mad I stupidly believed this works and you cannot return it --  what a WASTE.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!. It didn&#x27;t tighten my eyebrow like some people said. It just kept them brows in place. I like shine and it has more of a matte finish so I usually add just a tiny bit of my Razac perm repair on top on it just to give my eyebrow that shine. However, this product does what it says it does. Keeps dem brows check!</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have never heard of a product like this until recently. I have been using pencil/powder combo on my barely there brows for 10+ years and I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about them smudging. This product is AMAZING! I apply it in the AM and it lasts until the next morning! It comes off easily with makeup remover and I never have to worry about my brows smudging at an uncomfortable time. I am over the moon happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years as an&amp;#34;eye brow stay don&#x27;t stray&amp;#34; product. My eye brow hair has a mind of its own and tend to get &amp;#34;out of line&amp;#34; and so this works like the &amp;#34;hairspray of eyebrows&amp;#34; as it keeps my eyebrow hairs in line!</li>
            <li> This worked OK...although it held throughout the day, it did not stay over night.  I resulted in a different product that even lasts through being splashed at the pool and at the beach.</li>
            <li> This products seals your fill in, draw in, touch up make up eyebrows. It&#x27;s a sealer, comes with two brushes. One swipe on each eyebrow should do. I sleep with my draw on eyebrows and they last. This sealer is good. Should last about 6 mths</li>
            <li> Two words... HOLY GRAIL.  I cannot live without this product... (Please don&#x27;t ever stop making it).  This is the ONLY thing I have ever found that will keep my eyebrows in place at all times, even overnight.  Love, love, love.  Enough said.  BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! I was ready to pay $40-$50 for some shopping network waterproof pencil/powder product. Like so many women I over plucked &amp; my nail salon wax lady has no idea how to shape eyebrows. No matter how many times over the yearsI&#x27;ve told her &#x27;I want them thick&#x27; or &#x27;I&#x27;m trying to re-grow them&#x27;, I would leave the salon with crescent moon eyebrows on my roundish face. Not happy!!! Well, I now know how use a charcoal &amp; brown pencil to draw in perfect &#x27;Brooke Shields&#x27; with an arch eyeyebrows. I mean &#x27;top model&#x27;  on fleek type brows...until they rub off!!! Well, Model in Bottle to the rescue. Once I draw them on (with half the brow penciled in), I just paint over my work of art like a top coat of nail polish. It has worked perfectly, lasting until I go to bed most days. I haven&#x27;t used it thru a hot summer but for this price, I definitely am satisfied with results so far.</li>
            <li> I have to draw my eyebrows on, since I don&#x27;t have any. By the end of theday, I either rubbed them off, or they just melted off.&lt;br /&gt;Model in a Bottle is just what I&#x27;ve always needed. Works Great.</li>
            <li> Model in a bottle eyebrow sealer is definitely a miracle worker as many customers who have purchased this product reported. I have very thin and sparse eyebrows and this sealer works well with my Anastasia eyebrow pencil and powder.  No smearing or fading.</li>
            <li> If you are filling in your brows, you must use bottle in a bottle to set your brow makeup.  waterproof and invisible.</li>
            <li> Love this  product to life!!! As a woman with very little body hair, I have to make due with powder and liner for my eyebrows and this little bottle of joy has given me the confidence to do all things that used to make me cringe because of fear that my steady hand and symmetric art would be destroyed! Now I can sweat and wipe in peace, take a nap and continue with my day, and most importantly, SCRATCH MY EYBROWS, without them being under my nails and no longer on my face! LOL. For any makeup wearer, you MUST add this to your repertoire!!</li>
            <li> My brows stay in place and I stay cute all day long. Easy to use and there&#x27;s no flaking. It does what is says it will. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. This stuff is the secret weapon of all beautiful brows. As soon as I brushed it on to my half day old eyebrows the immediately looked better, I did lawn work and sweat my ass off in the humidity. They still look perfect. I&#x27;m a customer for life now, this is my new got to have beauty secret! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Kept brows on longer than I would have if I didn&#x27;t use it but after a lapse of time, my brows still faded some.</li>
            <li> Really keeps eyebrows in place!</li>
            <li> Not great. It does not keep make up in place all day.</li>
            <li> Stop! and buy this! This is the answer to beautiful eye brows,put your pencil on and go over your brows with this product and Your Brows are set perfect until you take it off! There is nothing any better on the market for brows! I own a skincare company,and have used everything on the market!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to feel about this. No matter what I use pencil, gel, powder when I use this for a brow sealer I cannot get any product to stay in place. It runs awful and makes my brows come out patchy</li>
            <li> Works well but flakes after a long day.</li>
            <li> Keeps eyebrows in place</li>
            <li> I draw on my eyebrows and I swear by this stuff. I use it every morning to keep my eyebrows on and it never lets me down. Even when I go to the pool!</li>
            <li> I have been in search for a good heat/sweat/humidity proof eye brown pencil. But most of them that claimed long wearing &amp; waterproof still isn&#x27;t. I have tried high end and drug store brands and they still rub off after an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I found this. My brows stayed on for 8hrs. or until I take em at night. I have no problem removing when I remove my waterproof mascara with Sonia Kashuk eye makeup remover (from Target) I wipe off my brows too.&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have to all the women other there that fills in their eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This brow sealer is amazing, it really keeps my brows looking perfect all day. It even holds up in extreme conditions like the pool. It has easily become an HG product and I will definitely be repurchasing when it runs out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is noooooo joke it will lock them eyebrows down, without irritating the skin. I love the way I go to work for 8 hrs and come home and my eyebrows are still the same. I definitely will buy again! !</li>
            <li> I fill in my brows with a pencil. This product seals the deal so my brows last and look natural after a hard days work.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! My eyebrows stay in place the whole night even if I sweat this stuff still stays on. i would purchase again</li>
            <li> Would not buy again or recommend product. It doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Work at all. Just a gimmick. Use hairspray on an&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow brush nested.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Sets my eyebrows really well for the whole day until I wash it off. The only thing is that you really need to get most of the product off the brush or else it makes your brows feel crispy. Other than that, it&#x27;s really good and will last you a long time. I recommend buying disposable mascara spoolies if you don&#x27;t want this to turn a muddy color or if you plan on using this on clients.</li>
            <li> First thing is I like it comes with two ways to apply the product onto your brows. You have to apply apply with a light hand and let it dry, but over all I do like it.</li>
            <li> Love it I bought it around 3 months ago use it almost everyday and it is still almost full. A little goes a long way in this case.</li>
            <li> I am giving this 5 star rating because it works! I can put it on in the morning, go to the gym for a workout and it keeps my eyebrows on even with my sweat.</li>
            <li> I use a $3 eyebrow powder and coat it with this and it looks amazing all day.</li>
            <li> I started coloring in my brows after many mishaps with shaving them with razors. I used black, and would always make the mistake of rubbing my face, and taking off half of my eyebrow with the wipe. Lol funny now, not so much then. Found this product, and have not had to worry about a smudged eyebrow at all. It withstands sweat, touching, rain, whatever. It&#x27;s definitely magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> The Model In a Bottle Long Lasting Eyebrow Sealer I ordered from First Class Supply came with a spooly, but no brush!!! I don&#x27;t understand why. There was supposed to be a spare white cap with a brush attached to it, that comes with the sealer!!! I actually really need the brush! Would you please, send it to me? I hope it was just an accident</li>
            <li> Only problem is at the end of the day it cracks</li>
