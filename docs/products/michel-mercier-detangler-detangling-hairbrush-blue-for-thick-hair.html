            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Am now able to brush my granddaughter&#x27;s hair without tears and screams!</li>
            <li>Simply amazing..</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 9 months now and still works amazing</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This brush is absolutely amazing it works so well on my hair</li>
            <li>I thought it would be amazing because I saw it on TV</li>
            <li>it has been amazing.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;ll even brush her own hair.  </li>
            <li>Now he brushes his own hair and loves that the bristles glide through his hair instead of pulling it out.</li>
            <li>and she liked it and stated that it did help get the tangles out</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t that impressed w, it.&lt;br /&gt;Still too much hair loss.\</li>
            <li>but if its not snarly then its really nice.</li>
            <li>This is not an effective detangling brush for a child.</li>
            <li>I was kind of suspicious about this brush, because I thought I&#x27;d have to always deal with the pain.</li>
            <li>It doesnt feel nice on the scalp as well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would be effective in getting out my knots.</li>
            <li>but it was nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s customary to want to pull through or apply some kind of pressure when passing the brush through your hair, but trust me...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>She is very happy wth her new brush.</li>
            <li>My hair tangles very easily but this brush does the trick.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this wonderful brush, we will be ordering more.. :-)</li>
            <li>I can honestly say it work 1000 times better than a wig brush for detangleing in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think this brush eats more hair then detangles it.</li>
            <li>She is now able to brush her own hair without tears or frustration.</li>
            <li>Now mornings and hair brushing are easy!</li>
            <li>if very fine</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s too good to be true...</li>
            <li>So gentle on hair and Easily gets out knots!!!</li>
            <li>I love this brush</li>
            <li>But over all I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li>She brushes her hair more often now that it doesn&#x27;t rip it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given one away, and referred it to many woman.  </li>
            <li>It gets the hair underneath and leaves it looking silky and healthy.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my hair and it pulled and I didn&#x27;t have many knots.</li>
            <li>I refused to buy it for many months.  </li>
            <li>and I said ok</li>
            <li>she is growing for Locks of Love.  </li>
            <li>This brush makes the tangles come out better.  </li>
            <li>Am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>works mostly but brush is getting beat up trying to go through my daughters wavy/curly puerto rican hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looked glossy and smooth after that!</li>
            <li>I think I like it more than she does.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to brush her tangles out without tears until now.</li>
            <li>Love the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>but it just goes over the top of my hair and it always is still pulling hair out..</li>
            <li>It also adds static electricity to my hair.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the prototype was a better product than the mass produced brush.</li>
            <li>she cries more trying to brush her hair with this</li>
            <li>but, I love mine.</li>
            <li>My $5 brush from the hair salon works better.</li>
            <li>I freakin&#x27; love this brush.</li>
            <li>The hairbrush we had at home worked better than this one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not 100% tangle free!</li>
            <li>He carries them around the house with him and throws them in the bath tub (he throws all his favorite things in the bath tub...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I will gladly buy one every 8-12 months.</li>
            <li>she saw it on TV and was sure it would be the answer to her tangled hair each morning.  </li>
            <li>When the brush arrived there was no return label in the box &amp; to top it off customer service</li>
            <li>keeps calling me and wanting to charge my debit card more for some sort of club</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to buy a couple more</li>
            <li>I saw some videos on you tube that said it was ok.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>For the price, it should be a much better handle.</li>
            <li>Neither of us care for it and it often causes more tangles than it solves.</li>
            <li>, I can get a brush from the 99 cent store that works better</li>
            <li>I love this brush and use it every day, as does my mother and sister.</li>
            <li>We all love it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>It does nothing that it advertised and  to top it off</li>
            <li>my son needs the thicker styled brusj but the normal works great for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried it on myself and it does tug pretty good.  </li>
            <li>When it came out, I was excited!</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean and wash.</li>
            <li>Great product for the natural girls!</li>
            <li>works great on my daughters hair, which happens to be fine, not thick.</li>
            <li>It just brushes the top layer and makes it smooth.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter used it for 2 month and worked great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially effective with wet hair.</li>
            <li>It really does a good job.</li>
            <li>We are very picky around here and always on the hunt for a good brush.</li>
            <li>in all, I am very happy with my purchase, this brush is a hair saver, and I will not use any other brush.</li>
            <li>Did a real good job where other brushes just came apart.</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>oh so easily.  </li>
            <li>I also have a feeling the bristles are going to wear out very quickly as some are bent already in a week.</li>
            <li>My hair gets tangled easily, but this brush brushes through those tangles with ease.</li>
            <li>Tons of fine hair that easily gets tangled and knotted.</li>
            <li>It came out of the plastic box full of static electricity.</li>
            <li>works fine after you have torn through all the tangles.</li>
            <li>( in the store there was also one version for fine hair to choose from)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair, and it tangles</li>
            <li>The handle on the brush is fine.</li>
            <li>I finely had to block their number....</li>
            <li>I also ordered another brush for my fine hair and there was still no difference between it and a brush from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this cheap product.</li>
            <li>This brush is like light plastic.</li>
            <li>My two friends also bought the brush (at the same time I did), and they have experienced bristle breakage also.</li>
            <li>amazing how much it makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Not mention I ordered one set (one buy and one free) and at checkout it appeared 2 sets instead of 1 set.  </li>
            <li>It feels like a cheap toy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even work as well as a cheap brush.</li>
            <li>It make your hair smooth and it is now a pleasure to brush my hair after a shower or at night.</li>
            <li>It feels like its breaking  your hair and the sound</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a flimsy , cheap made product.  </li>
            <li>it does have the sound effect of someone ripping out your hair</li>
            <li>I was at Walgreens waiting to have a prescription filled</li>
            <li>They feel cheap</li>
            <li>The material it&#x27;s made of is a cheap plastic</li>
            <li>,IT&#x27;S FABULOUS,.</li>
            <li>She used it once with wet hair and loved it!  </li>
            <li>Therefore it gets tangled super easily.</li>
            <li>And my hair tangles super easily.  </li>
            <li>one get one free special.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to buy this brush.</li>
            <li>and I made a deal with my daughter who has super fine hair that turns into an animal nest each night, to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this brush.</li>
            <li>I now am actually excited to get out of the bath and brush my hair.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see it there, as I&#x27;ve been wanting to try it.</li>
            <li>I ordered the pink brush for fine hair and thought this would be great since I ride motorcycles &amp; my hair is always tangled afterwards.</li>
            <li>The Brush is a lot easier to clean.</li>
            <li>How else would I clean it?</li>
            <li>.. Make sure you get the right color brush for the right type of hair...</li>
            <li>There is nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li>It glided right through!</li>
            <li>However this brush works great when the hair is wet.  </li>
            <li>Love it so much</li>
            <li>The good thing about this brush is that it did not pull her hair when I brushed it.</li>
            <li>I think a while back) would be good to use.</li>
            <li>Deep conditioners are good for your hair too, something that works for you.</li>
            <li>and it was full of hair.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush, worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Use shampoo, cheap if you want, and hot water to clean it well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll be super tangled.</li>
            <li>When I used the brush it didn&#x27;t hurt Detangling and it works quick.</li>
            <li>am going to submit a photo of my brush after just a quick re-brush through my hair.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair any better that normal brushes.</li>
            <li>After I use this brush, I use my normal one just to make sure that my hair is knot-free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her new favorite</li>
            <li>My daughter tried it first and sent it back to me saying it did nothing worthwhile and added lots of static to the hair.  </li>
            <li>The first week I started using it, I noticed significant amount of hairfall after brushing.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li>This brush does work better than anything else I&#x27;ve bought so far.</li>
            <li>However... I don&#x27;t think it is worth the $20</li>
            <li>well worth it.  </li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t made for mixed hair to be honest.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Right</li>
            <li>We really needed the fine hair brush, but this works pretty well.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Both me and my boyfriend used it right away, and it didn&#x27;t yank our hair at all.  </li>
            <li>and she brushes the tangles right out with no pain.</li>
            <li>I paid way too much for this.......hope the company comes up with something of better quality, like a normal brush is made of.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my own (short) hair and they really do hurt your head!  </li>
            <li>For decades I have had a wonderful brush that reached all through my hair to the scalp, but my luggage was lost on an airline a few months ago, and I have been buying hairbrushes ever since then, trying to find one that would penetrate my difficult hair and give me that wonderful brushing action.</li>
            <li>I received it very fast</li>
            <li>It is cheaper and it actually works on wet and dry hair!!:) happy shopping!</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t hurt to comb thru tangles!</li>
            <li>Ready to order another, soon!</li>
            <li>It pulls more than my regular brush does ..</li>
            <li>it is not well made and the bristles started breaking or falling out within the first day of use.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a joke when I first saw this on TV.  </li>
            <li>yes it was pain physically and mentality since her hair become more tangle than ever</li>
            <li>even the ones that are supposed to be &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I love this brush because I have such tangle hair because its bushy but ever sins</li>
            <li>The brushes brissels should be a bit longer, &amp; possible more softer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not only did U buy this brush for me I bought 4 more for friends.</li>
            <li>Guess my hair&#x27;s too thick for it or something lol.</li>
            <li>Do you really want to pay $26 for a couple of plastic brushes?!</li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t actually detangle my hair, it just makes the top look pretty.</li>
            <li>Once I started using it though I am totally willing to forgive all the flaws.</li>
            <li>and I was concerned at first, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in effectiveness</li>
            <li>first brush</li>
            <li>It only untangles the top layer.</li>
            <li>for the price paid plus the delivery charge I regret buying it Not only because after brushing it&#x27;s so many hair on the brush</li>
            <li>no where on her website does it let you see the shipping first)</li>
            <li>The brush works at detangling my hair, but makes my hair very frizzy!</li>
            <li>I really like it and think it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says!</li>
            <li>Thanks Michel Mercier!</li>
            <li>This is a great hair brush for thick hair.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the first thing I learned.</li>
            <li>(Just frizzy most of the time unless I flat iron it a lot.)</li>
            <li>it did not detangle the knots easily and actually hur her hair more than her regular brush...</li>
            <li>On top of that it was very misleading about the actual cost.</li>
            <li>My hair was dry, with hair spray (not that super strong stuff thats like glue but suave in the pump bottle)</li>
            <li>It worked fine for about 3 or 4 weeks, then it was pulling out my granddaughter&#x27;s hair just like any other cheap brush.</li>
            <li>Ordered this brush for fine and for normal hair for my 6 year old granddaughter....</li>
            <li>I have also used these brushes on my own curly, super thick hair, and they really do reduce the amount of tangles and pain!  </li>
            <li>but it makes brushing my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s super curly hair tolerable.  </li>
            <li>If I neglect to brush it after she sleeps, then she ends up with large dreadlocks.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>all, I think that the Hair Bean is better for children to use and for shorter hair, but if you have thick, long hair, this brush is a good choice.</li>
            <li>It  worked fine when I brush my hair in tiny segments...who has the time or patience for that?</li>
            <li>Even though I have fine hair, I bought the brush for coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I have three daughters with three different types of hair; wavy, angel fine, and curly.</li>
            <li>This was the perfect brush, I had such a hard time trying to get my 7 year old daughter to brush her hair.</li>
            <li>, a lot of products that are shown on TV through infomercials tend to get bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;However, I found after researching reviews that there are several happy customers who loved this brush.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>and it does not go thure straight and smothe</li>
            <li>I got a brush from a hair stylist called &amp;#34;The wet brush&amp;#34; works much better</li>
            <li>this brush really works.</li>
            <li>My hair sweats a lot at work and some times I won&#x27;t even really do my hair so by the end of the week</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>It gently untangles.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really seem to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>I was just really upset about the tangling of my hair all of the time.</li>
            <li>Now that I have this, combing my hair is so much smoother.</li>
            <li>but this brush really helps.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product because my daughter&#x27;s hair gets very tangled.  </li>
            <li>This brush works really well in the shower.</li>
            <li>Very upset with fiance for wasting $14 on a hairbrush that needs replacing every 8 months.</li>
            <li>Much better results with The Wet Brush.</li>
            <li>My kids don&#x27;t really complain about it hurting their hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>This brush works very well.</li>
            <li>It really detangles my hair.</li>
            <li>naturally straight</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves that one</li>
            <li>This brush works very well for me.</li>
            <li>mom loves it too so, now she wants one.</li>
            <li>Now it doesn&#x27;t do much anymore, it won&#x27;t even brush the hair anymore....</li>
            <li>It gets very tangled.</li>
            <li>However, I was very dissapointed when it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>It was a miracle, it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well and pulled my hair &amp; breakage..</li>
            <li>My daughter is really benefiting from it and grateful.</li>
            <li>It is also very slippery.</li>
            <li>My hair feels softer and it really helps with the knots, I dont rip out so much hair when Im brushing.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really detangle that well.</li>
            <li>It really works the way it says.  </li>
            <li>Use it gently on your hair, there&#x27;s NO NEED to pull.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>What ever happened to being prosecuted for FALSE ADVERTISING here these great United States?</li>
            <li>$30, it&#x27;s the most expensive brush I own, maybe ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Rips hair out also,  more so than any other brush on the market.  </li>
            <li>It pulled more than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>it is VERY cheaply made and not worth 1.00.$$  </li>
            <li>I spent of fortune on so called good shampoos and conditioners and still had to spend a long time to comb my hair.</li>
            <li>There are different lengths of bristles and that is supposed to be what makes the brush special.  </li>
            <li>with much less pain and effort than a regular brush&lt;br /&gt;-Large surface area for quicker brushing&lt;br /&gt;-Feels good on the scalp</li>
            <li>It gives a good scalp message, detangles wet and dry hair</li>
            <li>So great concept very poorly designed for the price, I&#x27;ve gotten higher quality at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>(the brush only pretends to brush the whole hair, but only does it on the top part of it, so the rest of the hair is untouched).  </li>
            <li>The commercial claims that it leaves no hair in the brush--not true.</li>
            <li>Just brush from the top of your scalp all the way down to the hair tip.  </li>
            <li>I have large combs and I have bought many creams and sprays and none of them prevent or remove tangles without her crying, but this brush does.</li>
            <li>I told her I got a new brush that is not supposed to hurt so much.</li>
            <li>In fact, a regular hairbrush would do a better job, so we&#x27;ll probably go back to that.</li>
            <li>the main problem is quality and longevity.</li>
            <li>Same story as many folks on here-Not only does the brush NOT work, but I ended up with paying $54 for TWO brushes..</li>
            <li>I have no interest in and high pressure trying to get me to go along...</li>
            <li>High price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It offers 2 brushes for the cost of one - but then it charges almost $6 for shipping and handling - for EACH brush!!</li>
            <li>So, for a product meant to be used on and around children, I wish it was a little more</li>
            <li>Sometimes you get those wide tooth combs that are cheap, plastic</li>
            <li>So my search for an old fashioned real brush continues.</li>
            <li>Normal brushes were not helping her at all.</li>
            <li>I brush just like I normally would.</li>
            <li>One of ours broke after being thrown in the tub a few too many times...</li>
            <li>so amazon sent me normal insyead</li>
            <li>We got these in the mail today and tried with very low hopes of success.  </li>
            <li>It worked ok for the first couple of days, but now it only pulls my hair out when I try to use it, and it started breaking in half after just a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>I have super long, curly hair that tangles to a point that makes me want to cut it all off.  </li>
            <li>She was using her new brush which she says she loves.  </li>
            <li>The short cheap plastic bristles do not untangle hair any easier than a regular tortoise comb.</li>
            <li>To top it off, I ordered the pink, but they sent me the blue.</li>
            <li>brushed it underneath, something that would lead to pain and several strands being ripped from my scalp, but it was as if I had tangle free hair to begin</li>
            <li>Not bad if you wanna brush your hair dry though!</li>
            <li>First of all the handle is too short.</li>
            <li>It works only if you detangle first, but if you need help detangling don&#x27;t use this brush.</li>
            <li>Her hair was still full of tangles after I spent 5 minutes trying to brush it.</li>
            <li>when I took my shower that night and use the brush for the first time I was shocked at how great it works.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the bristles bent over right away within the first few seconds of brushing.</li>
            <li>This brush did not detangle my ample hair any better than my other brushes--in fact I have other regular brushes that work better on my wet hair.</li>
            <li>You would get more use out of your money by flushing it down the toilet.</li>
            <li>and it really helps detangle my wild lion&#x27;s mane, especially just out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush to use on my 8 year old&#x27;s natural African-American hair.</li>
            <li>My young daughter dropped it on our laminate floor and it broke.</li>
            <li>after 2 weeks the brush &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; became soft and 10-15 of them fell of.</li>
            <li>She tells me it hurts just as much as her regular brush.</li>
            <li>I have a 4 year old daughter with about 26 inches of hair, medium thickness.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bristles are soft and it doesn&#x27;t pull a bit.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush for my 5 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It goes thru the hair much faster than a traditional brush.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>I would just stick to my old detangling paddle brush that I already had.</li>
            <li>I was forced to spend more then fifty bucks.</li>
            <li>more for thick wavy/straight hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has thick hair and this brush helps me to brush her hair and maintain it a lot better</li>
            <li>she has been able to get through her thick hair without yells of Ohhhhhhhhhh.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter has really thick hair and no brush that we have bought has been able to go through her hair ,we seen this on TV</li>
            <li>Wow, on top of it all I have been getting telemarketing calls ever since from them to buy other products...it never ends!!!!  </li>
            <li>The brush not only gets the tangles out easier than a normal brush but her hair is not as frizzy!</li>
            <li>There is no brush in the world that will comb the natural curls out of any hair and the hair results turns flat iron straight.</li>
            <li>I writing a review for the first time ever because I could not see my 8 year old child crying due to the ineffectiveness of this cheap brush.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many less expensive brushes that are much better.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s basically just a regular hairbrush, except for some reason, the bristles are pretty short (</li>
            <li>so not sure if it&#x27;s better  than a regular  brush or</li>
            <li>Not only do it not detangle, it creates more of a mess with the ends of the hair (puts actually knots in the ends.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been irrationally afraid of combing my hair since I was a kid, because it tangles VERY quickly and easily to the point where I can barely keep up with it.</li>
            <li>To our absolute surprise her knotty hair was transformed into silky long locks</li>
            <li>do still use a normal brush if I am blow-drying my hair because this brush does not lift enough hair at a time to use with a hairdryer.</li>
            <li>and I brushed through it without all the pulling my normal brush does.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last very long broke right way, didn&#x27;t hurt their hair when combing just didn&#x27;t handle the pressure</li>
            <li>Also, I selected the brush for fine hair but when the TWO brushed that I paid for (no free one</li>
            <li>and it worked a little better but not much....</li>
            <li>(green is for normal hair) and (pink is for fine hair)..</li>
            <li>I could not believe it worked on my daughter&#x27;s hair.she&#x27;s African American with very curly kinky hair</li>
            <li>Hopefully how much hair is left in the brush will be visible enough in the photo.</li>
            <li>First of all the bristles on this brush aren&#x27;t long enough and when they did catch her hair, it pulled, hair stuck in the brush and didn&#x27;t help in removing the knots.  </li>
            <li>My daughter did not cry for the first time in a long time when I brushed her hair.  </li>
            <li>The brush went right down their hair from their scalp to the ends.</li>
            <li>it was very soft and manageable, and I credit the brush to that because that was the only change I made to my hair regimen.</li>
            <li>Causes major breakage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a weird looking brush, but the moment I used it on my hair, I fell in love!</li>
            <li>I am discovering that most brushes on the market these days are too soft and will not stand up to going through my long thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry to read the other reviews about people not being happy with it</li>
            <li>I got one for fine hair and one for thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t use to as a all over brush or as a complete brush replacement because its not for blow drying and it wont remove the loose hairs in my head like a normal brush.</li>
            <li>My eldest had to have one of these - however,despite their claims I find as much hair left in the brush as I did in any other brush - fine (for my youngest), normal (for me) or thick (for the one who begged for this brush) ...</li>
            <li>I was shocked again at how  great</li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t like the brush in general,  </li>
            <li>The one brush out of the dozens we&#x27;ve tried that really does work is the Wet Brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are rigid and thin so they do run through her thick hair more easily than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>Order it from somewhere other than their official website--they charge you way too much for shipping, it takes forever to arrive, and they made me make an account for the site that sent me a ton of spam</li>
            <li>Hard to clean</li>
            <li>This brush works better for my 9 year old&#x27;s very long, VERY thick hair than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Used to be a major chore in the morning to get their hair brushed</li>
            <li>This brush makes a mess of my thick, curly hair - bought the comb from the same company - it&#x27;s great - use it on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered it for my 11 yer old granddaughter who has long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Since I paid for it, I gave it another few weeks and my hair falls SO MUCH evry day!  </li>
            <li>this product is a good idea however there&#x27;s no real grip on the handle and the brush constantly falls out of your hand as I stated it&#x27;s a good idea very poorly constructed very hollow plastic very weak bristles but the idea make sense</li>
            <li>my daughter has fine thick hair!</li>
            <li>brush worked OK on long and very thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>the fine one pink is less stiff than the normal.</li>
            <li>I am happy and disappointed at the same time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need a brush for dry hair since I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I bought the green one from Walgreens a few months ago and loved it, so I bought the blue one when I found it at a different store a few weeks later.  </li>
            <li>The only thing this brush has going for it is it is easy to clean out the clumps of hair it rips out. :(</li>
            <li>I ordered these directly from her website and paid $11 shipping which I would normally not do</li>
            <li>She won&#x27;t let us cut it (outside of a trim), so it is very long and naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I have an 8 year old girl who has very long hair that has been a  nightmare trying to brush daily.  </li>
            <li>Still removes hair, but any brush will remove the old loose hair.</li>
            <li>It was better at pulling less on my step-daughter, but even though I got the Thick Hair one, it doesn&#x27;t go all the way through; we have to section it.  </li>
            <li>even contacted them and asked if they could make one for extra thick hair, as I think this one isn&#x27;t adequate for the thickness of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This works better than other brushes but not nearly as good as portrayed on the infomercial.</li>
            <li>It really does work with little tugging pain especially when your hair is damp</li>
            <li>it feels a little strange at first, but after a couple days you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li>out of the shower with wet tangled hair I grabbed this brush and, amazingly, it slide through my hair with hardly any trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Hardly any trouble&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If your product is so good, you wouldn&#x27;t have to use bad processes to get it sold.</li>

            <li> my mother in law was very pleased with it.</li>

            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Am now able to brush my granddaughter&#x27;s hair without tears and screams!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing..</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 9 months now and still works amazing</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely amazing it works so well on my hair</li>
            <li> I thought it would be amazing because I saw it on TV</li>
            <li> it has been amazing.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;ll even brush her own hair.  </li>
            <li> Now he brushes his own hair and loves that the bristles glide through his hair instead of pulling it out.</li>
            <li> and she liked it and stated that it did help get the tangles out</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t that impressed w, it.&lt;br /&gt;Still too much hair loss.\</li>
            <li> but if its not snarly then its really nice.</li>
            <li> This is not an effective detangling brush for a child.</li>
            <li> I was kind of suspicious about this brush, because I thought I&#x27;d have to always deal with the pain.</li>
            <li> It doesnt feel nice on the scalp as well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would be effective in getting out my knots.</li>
            <li> but it was nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s customary to want to pull through or apply some kind of pressure when passing the brush through your hair, but trust me...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> She is very happy wth her new brush.</li>
            <li> My hair tangles very easily but this brush does the trick.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this wonderful brush, we will be ordering more.. :-)</li>
            <li> I can honestly say it work 1000 times better than a wig brush for detangleing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think this brush eats more hair then detangles it.</li>
            <li> She is now able to brush her own hair without tears or frustration.</li>
            <li> Now mornings and hair brushing are easy!</li>
            <li> if very fine</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too good to be true...</li>
            <li> So gentle on hair and Easily gets out knots!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush</li>
            <li> But over all I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li> She brushes her hair more often now that it doesn&#x27;t rip it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given one away, and referred it to many woman.  </li>
            <li> It gets the hair underneath and leaves it looking silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair and it pulled and I didn&#x27;t have many knots.</li>
            <li> I refused to buy it for many months.  </li>
            <li> and I said ok</li>
            <li> she is growing for Locks of Love.  </li>
            <li> This brush makes the tangles come out better.  </li>
            <li> Am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> works mostly but brush is getting beat up trying to go through my daughters wavy/curly puerto rican hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looked glossy and smooth after that!</li>
            <li> I think I like it more than she does.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to brush her tangles out without tears until now.</li>
            <li> Love the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> but it just goes over the top of my hair and it always is still pulling hair out..</li>
            <li> It also adds static electricity to my hair.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the prototype was a better product than the mass produced brush.</li>
            <li> she cries more trying to brush her hair with this</li>
            <li> but, I love mine.</li>
            <li> My $5 brush from the hair salon works better.</li>
            <li> I freakin&#x27; love this brush.</li>
            <li> The hairbrush we had at home worked better than this one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not 100% tangle free!</li>
            <li> He carries them around the house with him and throws them in the bath tub (he throws all his favorite things in the bath tub...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I will gladly buy one every 8-12 months.</li>
            <li> she saw it on TV and was sure it would be the answer to her tangled hair each morning.  </li>
            <li> When the brush arrived there was no return label in the box &amp; to top it off customer service</li>
            <li> keeps calling me and wanting to charge my debit card more for some sort of club</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to buy a couple more</li>
            <li> I saw some videos on you tube that said it was ok.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> For the price, it should be a much better handle.</li>
            <li> Neither of us care for it and it often causes more tangles than it solves.</li>
            <li> , I can get a brush from the 99 cent store that works better</li>
            <li> I love this brush and use it every day, as does my mother and sister.</li>
            <li> We all love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> It does nothing that it advertised and  to top it off</li>
            <li> my son needs the thicker styled brusj but the normal works great for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried it on myself and it does tug pretty good.  </li>
            <li> When it came out, I was excited!</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean and wash.</li>
            <li> Great product for the natural girls!</li>
            <li> works great on my daughters hair, which happens to be fine, not thick.</li>
            <li> It just brushes the top layer and makes it smooth.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter used it for 2 month and worked great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially effective with wet hair.</li>
            <li> It really does a good job.</li>
            <li> We are very picky around here and always on the hunt for a good brush.</li>
            <li> in all, I am very happy with my purchase, this brush is a hair saver, and I will not use any other brush.</li>
            <li> Did a real good job where other brushes just came apart.</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> oh so easily.  </li>
            <li> I also have a feeling the bristles are going to wear out very quickly as some are bent already in a week.</li>
            <li> My hair gets tangled easily, but this brush brushes through those tangles with ease.</li>
            <li> Tons of fine hair that easily gets tangled and knotted.</li>
            <li> It came out of the plastic box full of static electricity.</li>
            <li> works fine after you have torn through all the tangles.</li>
            <li> ( in the store there was also one version for fine hair to choose from)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair, and it tangles</li>
            <li> The handle on the brush is fine.</li>
            <li> I finely had to block their number....</li>
            <li> I also ordered another brush for my fine hair and there was still no difference between it and a brush from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this cheap product.</li>
            <li> This brush is like light plastic.</li>
            <li> My two friends also bought the brush (at the same time I did), and they have experienced bristle breakage also.</li>
            <li> amazing how much it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Not mention I ordered one set (one buy and one free) and at checkout it appeared 2 sets instead of 1 set.  </li>
            <li> It feels like a cheap toy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even work as well as a cheap brush.</li>
            <li> It make your hair smooth and it is now a pleasure to brush my hair after a shower or at night.</li>
            <li> It feels like its breaking  your hair and the sound</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a flimsy , cheap made product.  </li>
            <li> it does have the sound effect of someone ripping out your hair</li>
            <li> I was at Walgreens waiting to have a prescription filled</li>
            <li> They feel cheap</li>
            <li> The material it&#x27;s made of is a cheap plastic</li>
            <li> ,IT&#x27;S FABULOUS,.</li>
            <li> She used it once with wet hair and loved it!  </li>
            <li> Therefore it gets tangled super easily.</li>
            <li> And my hair tangles super easily.  </li>
            <li> one get one free special.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this brush.</li>
            <li> and I made a deal with my daughter who has super fine hair that turns into an animal nest each night, to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this brush.</li>
            <li> I now am actually excited to get out of the bath and brush my hair.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see it there, as I&#x27;ve been wanting to try it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink brush for fine hair and thought this would be great since I ride motorcycles &amp; my hair is always tangled afterwards.</li>
            <li> The Brush is a lot easier to clean.</li>
            <li> How else would I clean it?</li>
            <li> .. Make sure you get the right color brush for the right type of hair...</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li> It glided right through!</li>
            <li> However this brush works great when the hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> Love it so much</li>
            <li> The good thing about this brush is that it did not pull her hair when I brushed it.</li>
            <li> I think a while back) would be good to use.</li>
            <li> Deep conditioners are good for your hair too, something that works for you.</li>
            <li> and it was full of hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush, worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Use shampoo, cheap if you want, and hot water to clean it well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll be super tangled.</li>
            <li> When I used the brush it didn&#x27;t hurt Detangling and it works quick.</li>
            <li> am going to submit a photo of my brush after just a quick re-brush through my hair.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair any better that normal brushes.</li>
            <li> After I use this brush, I use my normal one just to make sure that my hair is knot-free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s her new favorite</li>
            <li> My daughter tried it first and sent it back to me saying it did nothing worthwhile and added lots of static to the hair.  </li>
            <li> The first week I started using it, I noticed significant amount of hairfall after brushing.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> This brush does work better than anything else I&#x27;ve bought so far.</li>
            <li> However... I don&#x27;t think it is worth the $20</li>
            <li> well worth it.  </li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t made for mixed hair to be honest.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Right</li>
            <li> We really needed the fine hair brush, but this works pretty well.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Both me and my boyfriend used it right away, and it didn&#x27;t yank our hair at all.  </li>
            <li> and she brushes the tangles right out with no pain.</li>
            <li> I paid way too much for this.......hope the company comes up with something of better quality, like a normal brush is made of.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my own (short) hair and they really do hurt your head!  </li>
            <li> For decades I have had a wonderful brush that reached all through my hair to the scalp, but my luggage was lost on an airline a few months ago, and I have been buying hairbrushes ever since then, trying to find one that would penetrate my difficult hair and give me that wonderful brushing action.</li>
            <li> I received it very fast</li>
            <li> It is cheaper and it actually works on wet and dry hair!!:) happy shopping!</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t hurt to comb thru tangles!</li>
            <li> Ready to order another, soon!</li>
            <li> It pulls more than my regular brush does ..</li>
            <li> it is not well made and the bristles started breaking or falling out within the first day of use.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a joke when I first saw this on TV.  </li>
            <li> yes it was pain physically and mentality since her hair become more tangle than ever</li>
            <li> even the ones that are supposed to be &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I love this brush because I have such tangle hair because its bushy but ever sins</li>
            <li> The brushes brissels should be a bit longer, &amp; possible more softer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not only did U buy this brush for me I bought 4 more for friends.</li>
            <li> Guess my hair&#x27;s too thick for it or something lol.</li>
            <li> Do you really want to pay $26 for a couple of plastic brushes?!</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t actually detangle my hair, it just makes the top look pretty.</li>
            <li> Once I started using it though I am totally willing to forgive all the flaws.</li>
            <li> and I was concerned at first, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in effectiveness</li>
            <li> first brush</li>
            <li> It only untangles the top layer.</li>
            <li> for the price paid plus the delivery charge I regret buying it Not only because after brushing it&#x27;s so many hair on the brush</li>
            <li> no where on her website does it let you see the shipping first)</li>
            <li> The brush works at detangling my hair, but makes my hair very frizzy!</li>
            <li> I really like it and think it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says!</li>
            <li> Thanks Michel Mercier!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair brush for thick hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the first thing I learned.</li>
            <li> (Just frizzy most of the time unless I flat iron it a lot.)</li>
            <li> it did not detangle the knots easily and actually hur her hair more than her regular brush...</li>
            <li> On top of that it was very misleading about the actual cost.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry, with hair spray (not that super strong stuff thats like glue but suave in the pump bottle)</li>
            <li> It worked fine for about 3 or 4 weeks, then it was pulling out my granddaughter&#x27;s hair just like any other cheap brush.</li>
            <li> Ordered this brush for fine and for normal hair for my 6 year old granddaughter....</li>
            <li> I have also used these brushes on my own curly, super thick hair, and they really do reduce the amount of tangles and pain!  </li>
            <li> but it makes brushing my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s super curly hair tolerable.  </li>
            <li> If I neglect to brush it after she sleeps, then she ends up with large dreadlocks.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> all, I think that the Hair Bean is better for children to use and for shorter hair, but if you have thick, long hair, this brush is a good choice.</li>
            <li> It  worked fine when I brush my hair in tiny segments...who has the time or patience for that?</li>
            <li> Even though I have fine hair, I bought the brush for coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I have three daughters with three different types of hair; wavy, angel fine, and curly.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect brush, I had such a hard time trying to get my 7 year old daughter to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> , a lot of products that are shown on TV through infomercials tend to get bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;However, I found after researching reviews that there are several happy customers who loved this brush.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> and it does not go thure straight and smothe</li>
            <li> I got a brush from a hair stylist called &amp;#34;The wet brush&amp;#34; works much better</li>
            <li> this brush really works.</li>
            <li> My hair sweats a lot at work and some times I won&#x27;t even really do my hair so by the end of the week</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> It gently untangles.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really seem to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I was just really upset about the tangling of my hair all of the time.</li>
            <li> Now that I have this, combing my hair is so much smoother.</li>
            <li> but this brush really helps.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product because my daughter&#x27;s hair gets very tangled.  </li>
            <li> This brush works really well in the shower.</li>
            <li> Very upset with fiance for wasting $14 on a hairbrush that needs replacing every 8 months.</li>
            <li> Much better results with The Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> My kids don&#x27;t really complain about it hurting their hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush</li>
            <li> This brush works very well.</li>
            <li> It really detangles my hair.</li>
            <li> naturally straight</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves that one</li>
            <li> This brush works very well for me.</li>
            <li> mom loves it too so, now she wants one.</li>
            <li> Now it doesn&#x27;t do much anymore, it won&#x27;t even brush the hair anymore....</li>
            <li> It gets very tangled.</li>
            <li> However, I was very dissapointed when it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It was a miracle, it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well and pulled my hair &amp; breakage..</li>
            <li> My daughter is really benefiting from it and grateful.</li>
            <li> It is also very slippery.</li>
            <li> My hair feels softer and it really helps with the knots, I dont rip out so much hair when Im brushing.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really detangle that well.</li>
            <li> It really works the way it says.  </li>
            <li> Use it gently on your hair, there&#x27;s NO NEED to pull.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> What ever happened to being prosecuted for FALSE ADVERTISING here these great United States?</li>
            <li> $30, it&#x27;s the most expensive brush I own, maybe ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Rips hair out also,  more so than any other brush on the market.  </li>
            <li> It pulled more than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> it is VERY cheaply made and not worth 1.00.$$  </li>
            <li> I spent of fortune on so called good shampoos and conditioners and still had to spend a long time to comb my hair.</li>
            <li> There are different lengths of bristles and that is supposed to be what makes the brush special.  </li>
            <li> with much less pain and effort than a regular brush&lt;br /&gt;-Large surface area for quicker brushing&lt;br /&gt;-Feels good on the scalp</li>
            <li> It gives a good scalp message, detangles wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> So great concept very poorly designed for the price, I&#x27;ve gotten higher quality at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> (the brush only pretends to brush the whole hair, but only does it on the top part of it, so the rest of the hair is untouched).  </li>
            <li> The commercial claims that it leaves no hair in the brush--not true.</li>
            <li> Just brush from the top of your scalp all the way down to the hair tip.  </li>
            <li> I have large combs and I have bought many creams and sprays and none of them prevent or remove tangles without her crying, but this brush does.</li>
            <li> I told her I got a new brush that is not supposed to hurt so much.</li>
            <li> In fact, a regular hairbrush would do a better job, so we&#x27;ll probably go back to that.</li>
            <li> the main problem is quality and longevity.</li>
            <li> Same story as many folks on here-Not only does the brush NOT work, but I ended up with paying $54 for TWO brushes..</li>
            <li> I have no interest in and high pressure trying to get me to go along...</li>
            <li> High price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It offers 2 brushes for the cost of one - but then it charges almost $6 for shipping and handling - for EACH brush!!</li>
            <li> So, for a product meant to be used on and around children, I wish it was a little more</li>
            <li> Sometimes you get those wide tooth combs that are cheap, plastic</li>
            <li> So my search for an old fashioned real brush continues.</li>
            <li> Normal brushes were not helping her at all.</li>
            <li> I brush just like I normally would.</li>
            <li> One of ours broke after being thrown in the tub a few too many times...</li>
            <li> so amazon sent me normal insyead</li>
            <li> We got these in the mail today and tried with very low hopes of success.  </li>
            <li> It worked ok for the first couple of days, but now it only pulls my hair out when I try to use it, and it started breaking in half after just a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> I have super long, curly hair that tangles to a point that makes me want to cut it all off.  </li>
            <li> She was using her new brush which she says she loves.  </li>
            <li> The short cheap plastic bristles do not untangle hair any easier than a regular tortoise comb.</li>
            <li> To top it off, I ordered the pink, but they sent me the blue.</li>
            <li> brushed it underneath, something that would lead to pain and several strands being ripped from my scalp, but it was as if I had tangle free hair to begin</li>
            <li> Not bad if you wanna brush your hair dry though!</li>
            <li> First of all the handle is too short.</li>
            <li> It works only if you detangle first, but if you need help detangling don&#x27;t use this brush.</li>
            <li> Her hair was still full of tangles after I spent 5 minutes trying to brush it.</li>
            <li> when I took my shower that night and use the brush for the first time I was shocked at how great it works.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the bristles bent over right away within the first few seconds of brushing.</li>
            <li> This brush did not detangle my ample hair any better than my other brushes--in fact I have other regular brushes that work better on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> You would get more use out of your money by flushing it down the toilet.</li>
            <li> and it really helps detangle my wild lion&#x27;s mane, especially just out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to use on my 8 year old&#x27;s natural African-American hair.</li>
            <li> My young daughter dropped it on our laminate floor and it broke.</li>
            <li> after 2 weeks the brush &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; became soft and 10-15 of them fell of.</li>
            <li> She tells me it hurts just as much as her regular brush.</li>
            <li> I have a 4 year old daughter with about 26 inches of hair, medium thickness.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bristles are soft and it doesn&#x27;t pull a bit.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 5 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It goes thru the hair much faster than a traditional brush.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> I would just stick to my old detangling paddle brush that I already had.</li>
            <li> I was forced to spend more then fifty bucks.</li>
            <li> more for thick wavy/straight hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick hair and this brush helps me to brush her hair and maintain it a lot better</li>
            <li> she has been able to get through her thick hair without yells of Ohhhhhhhhhh.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has really thick hair and no brush that we have bought has been able to go through her hair ,we seen this on TV</li>
            <li> Wow, on top of it all I have been getting telemarketing calls ever since from them to buy other products...it never ends!!!!  </li>
            <li> The brush not only gets the tangles out easier than a normal brush but her hair is not as frizzy!</li>
            <li> There is no brush in the world that will comb the natural curls out of any hair and the hair results turns flat iron straight.</li>
            <li> I writing a review for the first time ever because I could not see my 8 year old child crying due to the ineffectiveness of this cheap brush.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many less expensive brushes that are much better.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s basically just a regular hairbrush, except for some reason, the bristles are pretty short (</li>
            <li> so not sure if it&#x27;s better  than a regular  brush or</li>
            <li> Not only do it not detangle, it creates more of a mess with the ends of the hair (puts actually knots in the ends.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been irrationally afraid of combing my hair since I was a kid, because it tangles VERY quickly and easily to the point where I can barely keep up with it.</li>
            <li> To our absolute surprise her knotty hair was transformed into silky long locks</li>
            <li> do still use a normal brush if I am blow-drying my hair because this brush does not lift enough hair at a time to use with a hairdryer.</li>
            <li> and I brushed through it without all the pulling my normal brush does.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long broke right way, didn&#x27;t hurt their hair when combing just didn&#x27;t handle the pressure</li>
            <li> Also, I selected the brush for fine hair but when the TWO brushed that I paid for (no free one</li>
            <li> and it worked a little better but not much....</li>
            <li> (green is for normal hair) and (pink is for fine hair)..</li>
            <li> I could not believe it worked on my daughter&#x27;s hair.she&#x27;s African American with very curly kinky hair</li>
            <li> Hopefully how much hair is left in the brush will be visible enough in the photo.</li>
            <li> First of all the bristles on this brush aren&#x27;t long enough and when they did catch her hair, it pulled, hair stuck in the brush and didn&#x27;t help in removing the knots.  </li>
            <li> My daughter did not cry for the first time in a long time when I brushed her hair.  </li>
            <li> The brush went right down their hair from their scalp to the ends.</li>
            <li> it was very soft and manageable, and I credit the brush to that because that was the only change I made to my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> Causes major breakage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird looking brush, but the moment I used it on my hair, I fell in love!</li>
            <li> I am discovering that most brushes on the market these days are too soft and will not stand up to going through my long thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to read the other reviews about people not being happy with it</li>
            <li> I got one for fine hair and one for thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t use to as a all over brush or as a complete brush replacement because its not for blow drying and it wont remove the loose hairs in my head like a normal brush.</li>
            <li> My eldest had to have one of these - however,despite their claims I find as much hair left in the brush as I did in any other brush - fine (for my youngest), normal (for me) or thick (for the one who begged for this brush) ...</li>
            <li> I was shocked again at how  great</li>
            <li> but I just don&#x27;t like the brush in general,  </li>
            <li> The one brush out of the dozens we&#x27;ve tried that really does work is the Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rigid and thin so they do run through her thick hair more easily than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Order it from somewhere other than their official website--they charge you way too much for shipping, it takes forever to arrive, and they made me make an account for the site that sent me a ton of spam</li>
            <li> Hard to clean</li>
            <li> This brush works better for my 9 year old&#x27;s very long, VERY thick hair than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Used to be a major chore in the morning to get their hair brushed</li>
            <li> This brush makes a mess of my thick, curly hair - bought the comb from the same company - it&#x27;s great - use it on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my 11 yer old granddaughter who has long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Since I paid for it, I gave it another few weeks and my hair falls SO MUCH evry day!  </li>
            <li> this product is a good idea however there&#x27;s no real grip on the handle and the brush constantly falls out of your hand as I stated it&#x27;s a good idea very poorly constructed very hollow plastic very weak bristles but the idea make sense</li>
            <li> my daughter has fine thick hair!</li>
            <li> brush worked OK on long and very thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> the fine one pink is less stiff than the normal.</li>
            <li> I am happy and disappointed at the same time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a brush for dry hair since I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I bought the green one from Walgreens a few months ago and loved it, so I bought the blue one when I found it at a different store a few weeks later.  </li>
            <li> The only thing this brush has going for it is it is easy to clean out the clumps of hair it rips out. :(</li>
            <li> I ordered these directly from her website and paid $11 shipping which I would normally not do</li>
            <li> She won&#x27;t let us cut it (outside of a trim), so it is very long and naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I have an 8 year old girl who has very long hair that has been a  nightmare trying to brush daily.  </li>
            <li> Still removes hair, but any brush will remove the old loose hair.</li>
            <li> It was better at pulling less on my step-daughter, but even though I got the Thick Hair one, it doesn&#x27;t go all the way through; we have to section it.  </li>
            <li> even contacted them and asked if they could make one for extra thick hair, as I think this one isn&#x27;t adequate for the thickness of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This works better than other brushes but not nearly as good as portrayed on the infomercial.</li>
            <li> It really does work with little tugging pain especially when your hair is damp</li>
            <li> it feels a little strange at first, but after a couple days you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> out of the shower with wet tangled hair I grabbed this brush and, amazingly, it slide through my hair with hardly any trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Hardly any trouble&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If your product is so good, you wouldn&#x27;t have to use bad processes to get it sold.</li>
            <li> so it is hard for me to find the right product.</li>
            <li> They are not even stiff, they are very flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles hurt because they are so hard and have no soft round tips like most brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually find time to go out of my way to write a review, but this time I felt people really should know this product simply does not work.</li>
            <li> Wasted money on this particular brush.  </li>
            <li> And a lot less hair left in the brush than my old brush.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old granddaughters fine hair is to thick!!!</li>
            <li> Usually she screams and cries the whole time</li>
            <li> so I was really hoping for no more OUCH....</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes of attempting to brush, the bristles were mostly flat as a pancake.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived quickly, but unfortunately it is no better than any detangling brush you can buy in a drugstore for half the price.  </li>
            <li> I would Never recommend this brush to anyone !, especially anyone with long hair !.  </li>
            <li> I thought this brush would be fantastic, I was wrong, it only pulled her hair out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all plastic, the first time I tried brushing my long, thick, curly hair with it the brush slipped from my hand and was flung to the floor.</li>
            <li> It works on wet hair, it works on tangled hair, it works on dry hair, which has been majorly hair sprayed...</li>
            <li> My daughter said it was no better than a regular brush, and she actually prefers a soft bristle brush to this one.</li>
            <li> I m in my mid 40&#x27;s and not ready to cut off my very long color treated blonde hair.</li>
            <li> So just beware, if you order this product buy from somewhere other than the actual site, this has been a big headache!</li>
            <li> My children really have a hard time getting regular brushed through hair, these work wonders even if we do still have to use other products to help.  </li>
            <li> I commented on another review that complained the bristles were loose/bending too much.</li>
            <li> I measured the bristles and the &amp;#34;tallest&amp;#34; was 1/4 inch long.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and tangles like no tomorrow after a shower.</li>
            <li> This brush is heavily advertised during shows that my 5-year old daughter watches.</li>
            <li> I will say I use it like a wide tooth comb to ONLY take out the tangles</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It still takes me just as long to brush my hair as it did before.</li>
            <li> The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t work as well on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have a daughter with long hair...</li>
            <li> reason I gave it four stars is that the different color brushes have absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> , I have a two year old, autistic son, who LOVES anything</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t detangled this easily is a LONG time.</li>
            <li> and it took my a long time to get it out</li>
            <li> he has long hair, teenagers......best brush ever</li>
            <li> it detangles good and does not hurt as bad as the bristles are slightly softer.</li>
            <li> It popped in half, which has happened before and we were able to put it back together, however this time the bristle pad came out and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get the bristles back through those tiny holes.  </li>
            <li> A white film did developed on the brush after a while, that is due to dead skin from the scalp.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for natural black hair wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel any different from other brushes.</li>
            <li> 46 inches long, i need something that will not pull and hurt my head!</li>
            <li> my hair is very long.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 8-year-old granddaughter with very long hair</li>
            <li> I use this brush on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> This brush melts if you use it to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> The commercial seriously mentioned that the brush could comb thick naturally kinky hair to straight.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money if you really have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> Other brushes/combs, either in or out of the shower, made his hair really frizzy and they are really hard to use.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that I absolutely cannot get a brush through wet or dry, although wet is worse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so i can say how durable the bristles are, but it seems like it will last a average brushes life.</li>
            <li> The brush is no big deal - certainly not worth the $14.95 the web site charges.</li>
            <li> thinking that the blue is to stiff, with my type of hair any less stiff and it would just give to much.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it would help detangle my thick and long hair (I have hair to my rear, and it&#x27;s super thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it while it was wet and when her hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry</li>
            <li> It does detangle but sounds like it&#x27;s ripping my hair as I brush either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> use this brush on my hair both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> It also breaks my hair noticeably less than a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This brush works on dry o wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I use the Goody on dry hair and the Michele on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 8-yr old daughter who has long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My son has  very long, very thick, very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, wavy, long, naturally blond hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair that is damaged from bleaching, dyeing, and highlights and was an absolute nightmare to brush even after using heavy conditioner.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old has very long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because my 6 year old has very long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I also have dry scalp, so it&#x27;s even more painful trying to brush out tangles.</li>
            <li> It combs through my daughters tangles wet or dry without snagging and pain!  </li>
            <li> I have short, dry, thick and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> , she has super thick hair and cries every morning when i attempt to brush her hair, not only is this brush horrific, she cried more.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit awkward to brush with and is made of cheap hollow plastic.</li>
            <li> It is made of cheap plastic that I was afraid would break.</li>
            <li> I think this is why some people give it negative reviews, they are expecting to replace their old brush</li>
            <li> Be very cautious about this product, which will only steal your money because this product is useless.</li>
            <li> She prefers this brush over the wet brush.</li>
            <li> Well, of course it does not really.</li>
            <li> I have tried wide tooth combs, detangling sprays, so on and so on</li>
            <li> Also, her feelings were crushed because she has put her faith on this brush to solve her hair issue.  </li>
            <li> and I was curious about trying the brush made for that hair type.  </li>
            <li> Even with conditioner it&#x27;s a challenge to brush when wet.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use brushes while my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use a tool on your hair wet, use a shower comb or a wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> So a wide tooth comb like a Conair one for example (I have a Conair purple one I bought from Walmart</li>
            <li> Wide tooth combs will keep your hair from breaking off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this wet.</li>
            <li> A total waste of $15 - works about as well as a dollar store brush when it comes to &amp;#34;easily detangling&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Whatever you use brush/comb on your hair, the secret is to ALWAYS brush gently from the ends UP to your scalp.</li>
            <li> Thought it would work on wet hair</li>
            <li> Not what i expected.  </li>
            <li> This definitely was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Brushing her hair is ten minutes of her crying and trying to run from me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have not tried it wet yet.</li>
            <li> The handle is just plastic no grip on it, also it is hollow inside.</li>
            <li> Both of which might be a problem for wet use.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The wet brush... Search for it...</li>
            <li> Hollow plastic</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in green from my local Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I suggest wet brush.</li>
            <li> I have the blue brush for thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> cant actually go through my hair even though I got the blue one for thick hair.</li>
            <li> We all have different textures of very thick African American Hair (long and curly, longer and wavy, and coarser and extra thick).</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long (below my waist), curly coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this big time for anyone who has thick and long hair for those snarls.</li>
            <li> This is an awful brush!!!Cannot even brush your hair very well or very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is no better than a regular brush...</li>
            <li> I bought it because my daughter wanted it due to having problem hair with curls and tangles.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a waste of money!</li>
            <li> brush is the miracle I have been looking for, and if I have to replace it often like other commenters are saying, then that is what I will do.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Barbie&#x27;s pink hairbrush!</li>
            <li> Most disappointed.</li>
            <li> There is no difference, that I could find, other than the color.  </li>
            <li> Pulled and snags now like any other brush.      </li>
            <li> is a 95% improvement compared to other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, thick hair (half asian) and therefor we bought the alternative for normal/thicker hair</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and it would take me about 20 min with the regular hair brushes, with this one it takes about half the time.</li>
            <li> pain, very few strands left on the brush, but not ripped.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this brush only goes through a tiny portion of my hair at a time.</li>
            <li> It still pulls a little bit, but not a whole lot.</li>
            <li> The normal one green is less stiff than the thick &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old woman who was undeservedly born with shiny, very thick, wavy hair that is currently mid-back length.</li>
            <li> In fact, it only manages to break your hair pretty badly.</li>
            <li> Pricing is about average considering</li>
            <li> NOT not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I called the customer service to complaint about the second set, however I was told the product was already shipped.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I guess you can say it&#x27;s a bit short, but at least it has a handle versus Tangle Teezer</li>
            <li> The blue brush is for thick hair.. and works immediately...</li>
            <li> Purchased blue brush for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have the blue one for thick hair</li>
            <li> I love it, get it if you hate combing your hair this will change your mind</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly/wavy, red hair.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for moms thick Greek hair..</li>
            <li> the pink and the green.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a Michele Mercier Dentangling Brush -- the blue one that is supposed to be for thick hair.</li>
            <li> ALL of pulling a brush through my extremely thick hair and not fighting tangles or finding enough hair in the bristles to make a wig...</li>
            <li> We tried this brush after leaving her hair down for the day and we could not begin to brush through it.</li>
            <li> I have long color treated fine hair that tangles terribly when it&#x27;s wet and underneath when it&#x27;s dry .</li>
            <li> It works very well on ethnic hair (wet) and has helped reduce the time it takes for me to do all of my children&#x27;s hair by at least 1/2 the time!!!</li>
            <li> If I could give less than 1 star, I would.</li>
            <li> But I prefer the Goody brand brush for curly hair which gets the knots out with less pain.</li>
            <li> Had to pry half of it out of my hair while the handle stayed in my hand.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this brush, but will try it on the horses as previously suggested.</li>
            <li> In one of the you tube reviews that showed a girl saying the blue one for thick hair was to stiff.</li>
            <li> We bought for 7year old daughter who always wakes up with a rats nest and it hurts her bad, last week we bought wet brush from salon</li>
            <li> That was the first disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually brush my wet hair</li>
            <li> Every morning it is a snarly mess.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Following the heels of a WubbleBubble Ball fiasco, my 5 year olds are learning that commercials are not true.</li>
            <li> I have long thick course hair</li>
            <li> It broke not even after a two weeks having it I have thick hair and long</li>
            <li> got this for a friend that has long thick hair</li>
            <li> I does work on thick hair and it does not take a long time to brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and it glides through and detangles it.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone with long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 2 with tight curls, no matter what I do by the end of the day her hair is matted together and tangled.</li>
            <li> i never had tangles and it doesn&#x27;t ever hurt taking out the the tangles and when its super tangy it just has a little pain not that bad of a pain.</li>
            <li> I wish the brisles could have been a little longs and firmer.</li>
            <li> Pro: Detangling seems to work as described online &amp; on tv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: a little flimsy in construction for a brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but</li>
            <li> This brush works a little, but not as well as claimed.</li>
            <li> She said it was no better than any other brush she has used.</li>
            <li> to me.&lt;br /&gt;I got these for my little girl to help because she is tender headed</li>
            <li> My son has very thick curly mixed hair.</li>
            <li> Not great when your battling a little girl that doesn&#x27;t want to sit still to have her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, so naturally bought thick hair one.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> , It does take a few strands of hair when you brush</li>
            <li> This brush still pulls out the dead hair, but it is not overflowing...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> After several months of using the brush my hair has become extremely broken and damaged.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush because my hair tangles when blow dried, so I thought it would help.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not one of them - it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money at all.</li>
            <li> Seems after I&#x27;ve washed it a few times it has no glide at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on beauty products - especially gimmicky ones like this brush -</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I dried my hair</li>
            <li> I wasted a lot of money, the site was misleading and they over charged and didn&#x27;t help out when I called.</li>
            <li> This brush is crap, if you want pain free brush</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> False advertising to the moon and back.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that takes forever to brush because it is usually always so tangled and pulls my hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still not without a little pain from the tugging because there is really no give to the bristles as they are really stiff because this is the brush for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have so much less hair than I used to!</li>
            <li> We ordered the thick brush, and our hair is not particularly challenging to  brush, so it appears that the brush is not very well made.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but I had really been wanting to try it for awhile now.</li>
            <li> After few weeks of using this, I realized one day when I was making my usual ponytail</li>
            <li> My daughter has very tight curls</li>
            <li> I do wish the one for thick hair had slightly longer bristles though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick hair but less wavy and frizzy than mine.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh its super annoying.</li>
            <li> I was able to try it myself this morning on my granddaughter and was very disappointed....</li>
            <li> i have very long hair and kinda thick not like horse tail thick but thick..</li>
            <li> I keep two in case one gets misplaced!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Heavy, thick, it was like rats nests.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money !.</li>
            <li> My brushes usually pull on my hair but, this brush glides through.</li>
            <li> Spark Innovators Hair Bean Hair Detangling Comb]], which worked well for me but was too small and awkwardly-shaped to use.</li>
            <li> No change in shampoo or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I can have the worst hair day and still be able to get a brush through</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful, as the fight with my daughter to brush her long, curly her is daily, so I put out the $15 for a hairbrush - and was completely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money on this brush, it does not detangle the hair with ease, and is made from a cheap plastic, worthless product!!!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has thick curly hair and hated having his hair brushed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the construction for the high price...</li>
            <li> IMO a huge disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> That horrible ripping sound as you try to brush out the tangles.</li>
            <li> IT SUCKS.</li>
            <li> Before this brush, I would spend at least 20 to 30 minutes some days getting tangles out after washing.</li>
            <li> Oh well, at least I got it on sale.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a one way ticket to hair loss (at least for me).</li>
            <li> I recomend it for people with thick hair</li>
            <li> The brush for thick hair does not work.</li>

            <li> she can do it herself with very little help!</li>
            <li> No grip on the handle and the slick plastic along with the odd &#x27;V&#x27; shape makes it difficult to hold.</li>
            <li> i mean its simple..one peice..</li>
            <li> Then we dried her hair with a blow drier and it melted the bristles!!  </li>

            <li> Not good for thick hair</li>
            <li> This brush pulled and broke off a ridiculous amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is impossible to put it back together by hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Find a less expensive one.</li>
            <li> it seriously saved my hair</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The handle part is so small it is very hard to hold and the handle is a poor shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good brush.</li>
            <li> It barely catches on the horrible snarls in my damaged hair, even when wet, even if I haven&#x27;t used conditioner.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for a toddler that has long thick wavy hair , she screamed bloody murder every time we tried to use it</li>

            <li> so you can&#x27;t feel the poor quality.</li>
            <li> We were not happy with this brush...</li>
            <li> really this brush is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly as great as the ads claim.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It turns out that this is seriously a miracle brush!  </li>
            <li> This brush is terrible it hurts, unlike what the commercial said, it has hard as rock brussels  </li>
            <li> I have long course thick hair and this brush ripped and pulled my hair something awful.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters hated to get their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> Just to be clear the brush will NOT help de-tangle your hair; It will NOT help stop pulling your hair out and it IS WORTHLESS when trying to style!</li>
            <li> This type of business process is just wrong.</li>
            <li> and it is useless.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with it at all.</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s eyes on TV, so he is obsessed with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to brush through if it is not kept braided, which she hates.</li>
            <li> The handle is difficult to grip well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes her mood for the entire day was set by how horrific her hair brushing experience was.  </li>
            <li> and I thought ill try it and to my surprise</li>
            <li> Its also expensive.  </li>
            <li> My hair goes to my butt, and it&#x27;s very thin.</li>
            <li> It has a very poor design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of its detangling capabilities because the bristles make it too painful for her to brush her hair!  </li>
            <li> The handle is an awkward shape to hold.</li>
            <li> Once again this brush is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> It does not detangle like I thought it would, and it was very expensive to purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very sad.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s nearly impossible to brush.</li>
            <li> I agree w all the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> My daughter was always complaining about painful knots when brushing her hair after showering.&lt;br /&gt;this</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll just end up frustrated.</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really disappointed and even if the brush still works (the teeth continues to break)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This brush detangles well but did not penetrate my hair and it does not go thure straight and smothe so yea</li>
            <li> this brush isn&#x27;t what it says it does detangle but it hurts doing so. I got a brush from a hair stylist called &amp;#34;The wet brush&amp;#34; works much better</li>
            <li> Not bad. Brushes well and does the job</li>
            <li> So easy to use and it really doesn&#x27;t hurt to comb thru tangles! My g-daughter loves it as well! Great for lil ones!</li>
            <li> Use it every day, several times a day. Still removes hair, but any brush will remove the old loose hair. Ready to order another, soon!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick hair that will get matted after swimming and this brush is magic! The best brush ever!</li>
            <li> this brush really works. my hair is very long.</li>
            <li> This brush truly does what it says.. It works on wet hair, it works on tangled hair, it works on dry hair, which has been majorly hair sprayed... It truly Works.. Make sure you get the right color brush for the right type of hair... The blue brush is for thick hair.. and works immediately... (green is for normal hair) and (pink is for fine hair).. Don&#x27;t just pick the color you like.. Simply amazing.. Thank you so much for this wonderful brush, we will be ordering more.. :-)</li>
            <li> This brush did work for me like it claims to.  I have super long, curly hair that tangles to a point that makes me want to cut it all off.  This brush does work better than anything else I&#x27;ve bought so far.</li>
            <li> I love this brush I have brown thick thick thick thick THICK! Hair I received it very fast I have been using it for 9 months now and still works amazing I recomend it for people with thick hair</li>
            <li> My son has very thick curly mixed hair. This in combination  with my detangling comb works great. I use it with Shea moisture detangling  moisture  spray.</li>
            <li> This has to be the cheapest hairbrush ever made. Just hold it once and you&#x27;ll come to the same conclusion. The handle is an awkward shape to hold. It doesn&#x27;t feel any different from other brushes. I was very disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. Don&#x27;t buy this cheap product.</li>
            <li> I have the blue brush for thick coarse hair. I can honestly say it work 1000 times better than a wig brush for detangleing in my opinion. My hair sweats a lot at work and some times I won&#x27;t even really do my hair so by the end of the week it&#x27;ll be super tangled. When I used the brush it didn&#x27;t hurt Detangling and it works quick. My only con is the bristles are kinda flimsy and short. I wish the brisles could have been a little longs and firmer. But over all I love this brush.</li>
            <li> The brush for thick hair does not work. It pulls chunks of hair out as you are brushing. Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Wish I could leave 0 stars! I was so excited to buy this brush. I have thick, long (below my waist), curly coarse hair. The bristles don&#x27;t even go part way through the thickness! I measured the bristles and the &amp;#34;tallest&amp;#34; was 1/4 inch long. My 2 year old granddaughters fine hair is to thick!!! I am so so disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Stopped at my daughter&#x27;s tonight and Tara was brushing her hair.  she never does that.  She was using her new brush which she says she loves.  it does not hurt when she brushes.  She is very happy wth her new brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to use on my 8 year old&#x27;s natural African-American hair. She prefers this brush over the wet brush. The handle can become slippery when you have hair products on your hands.</li>
            <li> this product is a good idea however there&#x27;s no real grip on the handle and the brush constantly falls out of your hand as I stated it&#x27;s a good idea very poorly constructed very hollow plastic very weak bristles but the idea make sense</li>
            <li> The brush does nothing it claims. When it came out, I was excited! My hair is long and tangles like no tomorrow after a shower. In the commercials the ladies are just brushing with ease, pointing out that there was no hair in the brush. Honestly, I think this brush eats more hair then detangles it. I followed the directions, and to no avail... That horrible ripping sound as you try to brush out the tangles. :( works fine after you have torn through all the tangles. The only thing this brush has going for it is it is easy to clean out the clumps of hair it rips out. :( Do not fall for it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this brush was going to be made of such cheap, thin plastic. That was the first disappointment.  It came out of the plastic box full of static electricity. I had to wash it to get rid of that. The bristles hurt because they are so hard and have no soft round tips like most brushes. It claims not to pull out your hair, but yet it does. My young daughter dropped it on our laminate floor and it broke. I paid way too much for this.......hope the company comes up with something of better quality, like a normal brush is made of. Now I know why it comes in a plastic box....so you can&#x27;t feel the poor quality.</li>
            <li> This brush is heavily advertised during shows that my 5-year old daughter watches. She asked for the brush because the ad promises that it will get rid of tangles with no pain or pulling. Well, of course it does not really. The bristles are rigid and thin so they do run through her thick hair more easily than a regular brush. However... I don&#x27;t think it is worth the $20+. My daughter does prefer using this brush over others, though.</li>
            <li> This brush is like light plastic. It&#x27;s almost like a pretend hairbrush. I bought it because it looked like it wouldn&#x27;t collect dust, but it&#x27;s awful. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It really works. Both my daughter and I love it. She brushes her hair more often now that it doesn&#x27;t rip it out.</li>
            <li> good product good seller works</li>
            <li> This brush is awful and did not work for my hair. It did a great job at pulling it out though. Definitely does not work like the commercials.</li>
            <li> I could not believe it worked on my daughter&#x27;s hair.she&#x27;s African American with very curly kinky hair n she use to cry all the time untiI got this brush.I could not believe it.I&#x27;ve tried it while it was wet and when her hair is dry.I would definitely recommend this to the everybody.it got tangles right out.and if u saw my daughter hair.u wouldn&#x27;t believe it worked on it.wish I could post a picture.</li>
            <li> This is a scam. The short cheap plastic bristles do not untangle hair any easier than a regular tortoise comb. In fact, it only manages to break your hair pretty badly. I got two brushes from that tv promotion and the two brushes went to the trash can. I don&#x27;t usually find time to go out of my way to write a review, but this time I felt people really should know this product simply does not work. This revi ew in the Examiner is spot on.http://www.examiner.com/article/review-of-the-michel-mercier-ultimate-detangling-brush.</li>
            <li> I have tried wide tooth combs, detangling sprays, so on and so on and THIS is the only thing that works!!! I will say I use it like a wide tooth comb to ONLY take out the tangles and then I switch to my regular paddle brush. I think this is why some people give it negative reviews, they are expecting to replace their old brush entirely.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use to as a all over brush or as a complete brush replacement because its not for blow drying and it wont remove the loose hairs in my head like a normal brush. using it in tandem with another brush will also make this one last longer. so keep that in mind. over all its a great product! and i&#x27;m happy to have found it!</li>
            <li> Garbage, keep your money in your pocket!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! It works very well on ethnic hair (wet) and has helped reduce the time it takes for me to do all of my children&#x27;s hair by at least 1/2 the time!!! Love it so much I keep two in case one gets misplaced! Great product for the natural girls!</li>
            <li> I have long thick course hair this brush does not work on my hair at all ... It pulls more than my regular brush does ..</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been struggling with my daughter&#x27;s hair for 8 years now.  She won&#x27;t let us cut it (outside of a trim), so it is very long and naturally wavy.  Everything causes her hair to knot up.  Brushing her hair was such a chore.  She would scream and cry.  That is all gone now.  This brush is amazing.  No complaints ever.  She&#x27;ll even brush her own hair.  Best purchase we&#x27;ve made for her to date.</li>
            <li> It broke not even after a two weeks having it I have thick hair and long and it didn&#x27;t help at Ali go through like 30 brushes a year Becuz they break I really think it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
            <li> We were not happy with this brush...it is not well made and the bristles started breaking or falling out within the first day of use. We ordered the thick brush, and our hair is not particularly challenging to  brush, so it appears that the brush is not very well made. My two friends also bought the brush (at the same time I did), and they have experienced bristle breakage also.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best brush ever invented in my opinion, it works like advertised. I have hair that reaches below  my waist line and it&#x27;s very thick, I had to use a pick before this brush and hours of time to take care of my hair now I can do it in 30 minutes. I&#x27;ve given one away, and referred it to many woman.  [[ASIN:B0087IVSV2 Michel Mercier Detangling Hair Brush for Thick Hair]]</li>
            <li> The varying sizes of flexible bristles work, good idea</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this brush. It worked fine for about 3 or 4 weeks, then it was pulling out my granddaughter&#x27;s hair just like any other cheap brush. What a gimmick! False advertising to the moon and back. What ever happened to being prosecuted for FALSE ADVERTISING here these great United States?</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money. I was forced to spend more then fifty bucks. I didn&#x27;t want two sets. All I wanted was to help my daughter. This company is predatory and nasty customer service. The brush worked well for one week then wore out and became worthless. Save your money. You would get more use out of your money by flushing it down the toilet.</li>
            <li> My daughter was always complaining about painful knots when brushing her hair after showering.&lt;br /&gt;this brush, unlike others, doesn&#x27;t just brush the surface.  It gets the hair underneath and leaves it looking silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> I got this in store. My daughter is 2 with tight curls, no matter what I do by the end of the day her hair is matted together and tangled. I thought this brush would be fantastic, I was wrong, it only pulled her hair out! I tried it on my hair and it pulled and I didn&#x27;t have many knots. What a joke. Will be taking back to the store.</li>
            <li> This is the worst brush EVER! Wet or dry it ripped my granddaughters hair out!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this brush only goes through a tiny portion of my hair at a time. It  worked fine when I brush my hair in tiny segments...who has the time or patience for that? Not me!</li>
            <li> It really does work with little tugging pain especially when your hair is damp, It does take a few strands of hair when you brush but it&#x27;s nothing I would worry about personally, there&#x27;s no pain or lost hair when it is damp so that&#x27;s a solution to some people&#x27;s worries over pain and hair loss. Shipping was on time and it came in it&#x27;s box, all the bristles are in tacked when i received it, 3 days I&#x27;ve been using it so i can say how durable the bristles are, but it seems like it will last a average brushes life. Pricing is about average considering I did have it shipped instead of store bought.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. my daughter has fine thick hair! Tons of fine hair that easily gets tangled and knotted. After brushing she would end up pulling out alot of her hair. This brush still pulls out the dead hair, but it is not overflowing...it does a Great job of detangling And without the pain!</li>
            <li> I agree w all the bad reviews. I got this as an xmas gift form myself and my sister ( thick hair) and it does not slide through knots in my hair at all. It is no better than a regular brush...I actually found the bristles a tad harsh on my head too.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed and now that I&#x27;ve spent almost $12.00 on S&amp;H there&#x27;s no point in sending it back for return.&lt;br /&gt;Def wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect brush, I had such a hard time trying to get my 7 year old daughter to brush her hair. Well this works!</li>
            <li> does not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> Worst brush ever.  I bought this for my daughter, she has super thick hair and cries every morning when i attempt to brush her hair, not only is this brush horrific, she cried more.  it is VERY cheaply made and not worth 1.00.$$  Save your money,  really this brush is horrible.  Does not work at all.  Rips hair out also,  more so than any other brush on the market.  Beware.</li>
            <li> Junk.&lt;br /&gt;Works after already brushed out hair.</li>
            <li> my granddaughter loves hers.  it was horrible before and then we tried this.  amazing how much it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I wanted to know the total cost of the product plus,packing,shipping,handling etc. The website required a credit card to get this info. I got the info but didn&#x27;t order the product, so I thought. Within a week I found out that 2 orders had been placed on my credit card. I called Michel Mercier Detangling Brush customer service and Brian told me there is no \\&quot;order submit\\&quot; button. Once you input your credit card info they assume its an order. THIS IS FRAUDULENT. I returned the boxes, unopened. I received a refund for the product only, not the shipping. After a lengthy phone call, they agreed to refund the shipping. Still waiting for the credit on my credit card. This type of business process is just wrong. If your product is so good, you wouldn&#x27;t have to use bad processes to get it sold.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a joke when I first saw this on TV.  I refused to buy it for many months.  Finally one day we saw it in the department store and I said ok and I made a deal with my daughter who has super fine hair that turns into an animal nest each night, to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that this is seriously a miracle brush!  It combs through my daughters tangles wet or dry without snagging and pain!  It is absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Michael Mercier for stopping the pain from tangles!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 8-year-old granddaughter with very long hair she is growing for Locks of Love.  The brush did not work as shown on television and actually pulled as we tried to brush her hair.  so...never believe what you see on television.  If it&#x27;s too good to be true...it probably is!</li>
            <li> This brush is terrible it hurts, unlike what the commercial said, it has hard as rock brussels  and docent detangle your hair.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves this hair brush! If you have lots of hair get one..</li>
            <li> My daughter has really thick hair. Normal brushes were not helping her at all. When I seen this I had to get it for her. It works great. I recommend this big time for anyone who has thick and long hair for those snarls.</li>
            <li> The shipping and condition of the brush were good but I just don&#x27;t like the brush in general,  doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair any better that normal brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush.  That&#x27;s about it.  There is nothing special about it.  I bought it because my daughter wanted it due to having problem hair with curls and tangles.  Well it didn&#x27;t help.  And it pulled out my hair as well and I don&#x27;t have problem hair.  IT SUCKS.</li>
            <li> after 2 weeks the brush &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; became soft and 10-15 of them fell of. My daughter has long, thick hair (half asian) and therefor we bought the alternative for normal/thicker hair ( in the store there was also one version for fine hair to choose from)&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed and even if the brush still works (the teeth continues to break) it´s  NOT not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Dont waist your money!  Not even a brush.  Defiantly not for thick hair. Do not recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li> My children really have a hard time getting regular brushed through hair, these work wonders even if we do still have to use other products to help.  This brush makes the tangles come out better.  Begged me to order them!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my tender headed daughter and she loved it!!! It does NOT pull her hair. It gently untangles.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush for the very thick hair she has.  Am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I writing a review for the first time ever because I could not see my 8 year old child crying due to the ineffectiveness of this cheap brush.  My child was using this brush for about 3 weeks and the only thing she had in return was pain, yes it was pain physically and mentality since her hair become more tangle than ever (the brush only pretends to brush the whole hair, but only does it on the top part of it, so the rest of the hair is untouched).  Also, her feelings were crushed because she has put her faith on this brush to solve her hair issue.  Not mention I ordered one set (one buy and one free) and at checkout it appeared 2 sets instead of 1 set.  I called the customer service to complaint about the second set, however I was told the product was already shipped.  Be very cautious about this product, which will only steal your money because this product is useless.</li>
            <li> This hairbrush needs some work</li>
            <li> After seeing the commercials on TV for this product, I was intrigued.  My 8-year-old daughter has very thick hair and I was curious about trying the brush made for that hair type.  There are different lengths of bristles and that is supposed to be what makes the brush special.  Other than that, it&#x27;s basically just a regular hairbrush, except for some reason, the bristles are pretty short (even the ones that are supposed to be &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;) and it doesn&#x27;t really seem to get the job done.  In fact, a regular hairbrush would do a better job, so we&#x27;ll probably go back to that.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my thick haired daughter. It doesn&#x27;t brush all the way through the hair since the bristles are very short. She tells me it hurts just as much as her regular brush.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has thick curly hair and hated having his hair brushed. He asked for this brush specifically. Now he brushes his own hair and loves that the bristles glide through his hair instead of pulling it out.</li>
            <li> I was just really upset about the tangling of my hair all of the time. Now that I have this, combing my hair is so much smoother.</li>
            <li> Pro: Detangling seems to work as described online &amp; on tv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: a little flimsy in construction for a brush.</li>
            <li> Purchased blue brush for thick hair. It snagged my daughter&#x27;s hair and contributed to breakage. After trying the brush for one week the bristles began to bend.</li>
            <li> If I could give less than 1 star, I would. This brush is AWFUL! It&#x27;s such a waste of money! It doesn&#x27;t work at all. All it does is rip my hair out. What a joke!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 8-yr old daughter who has long, thick hair.  I&#x27;m not sure of its detangling capabilities because the bristles make it too painful for her to brush her hair!  I tried it on my own (short) hair and they really do hurt your head!  Perhaps I should&#x27;ve purchased the children&#x27;s brush?  Are the bristles softer on that one?</li>
            <li> I have two girls (6 and 7) with thick hair.  Used to be a major chore in the morning to get their hair brushed but this brush really helps.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth it.  We&#x27;ve got three of them now.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long broke right way, didn&#x27;t hurt their hair when combing just didn&#x27;t handle the pressure</li>
            <li> My wife has been very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> got this for a friend that has long thick hair and she liked it and stated that it did help get the tangles out</li>
            <li> it do just what the commercial say, only problem my sister have is when she rinse it of water do get in the bush and she got to shake it out.</li>
            <li> even i hurt when using this brush. isn&#x27;t made for mixed hair to be honest. more for thick wavy/straight hair. works mostly but brush is getting beat up trying to go through my daughters wavy/curly puerto rican hair.</li>
            <li> good brush, it just does not seem to work like it showed on tv. hair gets caught in brush</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair. I also have dry scalp, so it&#x27;s even more painful trying to brush out tangles. This brush works a little, but not as well as claimed. It still takes me just as long to brush my hair as it did before. I still have a lot of hair in my brush when I am done. I bought the brush at a store so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay shipping and handling in addition to the price of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even contacted them and asked if they could make one for extra thick hair, as I think this one isn&#x27;t adequate for the thickness of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to submit a photo of my brush after just a quick re-brush through my hair. Hopefully how much hair is left in the brush will be visible enough in the photo.</li>
            <li> I have long course thick hair and this brush ripped and pulled my hair something awful. It is a joke and nobody should even try it. I chucked it in the garbage immediately it was not even worth my time to return it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tween who has incredibly thick hair. It takes about 2 hours to get my hair trimmed about an inch. And I can never keep it brushed. All of my brushes always hurt me by pulling my hair. They also rip out my hair.  And my mother has to assist me to get it brushed out fully. And lemme tell you, IT HURTS. Just yesterday I went to the store with my grandmother and we had found this brush. I had remembered seeing this on a commercial a month or so ago. I asked my grandma about them. She told me I could try one. So I got it. It costs $14.95 where I go. I bought the thick hair brush. I got to the car and tried it out on my hair I hadn&#x27;t brushed that morning. It glided right through! It was incredible! My hair looked glossy and smooth after that! I am digging this hair brush!! I totally reccomend it!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product because my daughter&#x27;s hair gets very tangled.  The brush not only gets the tangles out easier than a normal brush but her hair is not as frizzy!</li>
            <li> My son has  very long, very thick, very curly hair. Being a boy he refuses to take care of it so it started to mat and look disgusting. Other brushes/combs, either in or out of the shower, made his hair really frizzy and they are really hard to use. This brush works really well in the shower. Only problem is it holds water. He opened it up to drain the water and it can not be put back together.</li>
            <li> Great service product is junk!</li>
            <li> I love this brush because I have such tangle hair because its bushy but ever sins I got it i never had tangles and it doesn&#x27;t ever hurt taking out the the tangles and when its super tangy it just has a little pain not that bad of a pain.</li>
            <li> The brushes brissels should be a bit longer, &amp; possible more softer.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t that impressed w, it.&lt;br /&gt;Still too much hair loss.\</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this brush does not get rid of the tangles. Causes major breakage. Not only did U buy this brush for me I bought 4 more for friends. After using it I called each of them to apologize. Out of 5 people there wasn&#x27;t a compliment to be had.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter asked me to buy this for her -- I think I like it more than she does.  We really needed the fine hair brush, but this works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I saw this at Walgreens and decided to give it a try. I have a 4 year old daughter with about 26 inches of hair, medium thickness. Before this brush, I would spend at least 20 to 30 minutes some days getting tangles out after washing. She also needs to be brushed as soon as she wakes up because her tossing in bed causes lots of tangles. If I neglect to brush it after she sleeps, then she ends up with large dreadlocks.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is the miracle I have been looking for, and if I have to replace it often like other commenters are saying, then that is what I will do. I have never been able to brush her tangles out without tears until now. It always breaks my heart having to brush through her tears and pain. She does not cry when I use this brush. I have large combs and I have bought many creams and sprays and none of them prevent or remove tangles without her crying, but this brush does.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Not nearly as great as the ads claim. I have purchased many less expensive brushes that are much better. My daughter has very thick hair that&#x27;s nearly impossible to brush. I was hoping this brush would solve our morning battle. It didn&#x27;t. The one brush out of the dozens we&#x27;ve tried that really does work is the Wet Brush. It really does a good job.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick hair and this brush helps me to brush her hair and maintain it a lot better</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it would help detangle my thick and long hair (I have hair to my rear, and it&#x27;s super thick. It&#x27;s been compared to a horse&#x27;s mane if that helps anyone reading this picture it lol). It worked ok for the first couple of days, but now it only pulls my hair out when I try to use it, and it started breaking in half after just a couple of uses. I don&#x27;t suggest this brush to anyone. Definitely not something I&#x27;ll be buying again!!! Guess my hair&#x27;s too thick for it or something lol.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has really thick hair and this brush worked wonders on it.  Love the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product not what the commercial say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very good about getting out tangles with out a lot of hair loss. I did get some hair in the brush that came out while I was brushing. A white film did developed on the brush after a while, that is due to dead skin from the scalp. I does work on thick hair and it does not take a long time to brush. I have long thick hair and it would take me about 20 min with the regular hair brushes, with this one it takes about half the time. The Brush is a lot easier to clean.</li>
            <li> i got this as a gift since my hair neasures 46 inches long, i need something that will not pull and hurt my head! Boy was I DISAPPOINTED! It pulled more than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried. Very upset with fiance for wasting $14 on a hairbrush that needs replacing every 8 months. HATE IT!  Do not waste your money...</li>
            <li> My advice is to stay away from the web site that sells this brush.The brush is no big deal - certainly not worth the $14.95 the web site charges. I bought the brush because it said it wouldn&#x27;t pull out my hair. Not true. I&#x27;m pulling out the same amount of hair when I brush as I did with my boar bristle brush. On top of that it was very misleading about the actual cost. It offers 2 brushes for the cost of one - but then it charges almost $6 for shipping and handling - for EACH brush!! C&#x27;mon! Do you really want to pay $26 for a couple of plastic brushes?! To top it off, I ordered the pink, but they sent me the blue. And within 2 days of ordering, I got a hard-sell phone call from the company trying to sell me something else. Ugh! Don&#x27;t do what I did. Stay away from the web site selling this brush. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> It feels like a cheap toy. Thin, light weight plastic. I have the blue one for thick hair and it is useless. It just brushes the top layer and makes it smooth. The brush doesn&#x27;t actually detangle my hair, it just makes the top look pretty.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Barbie&#x27;s pink hairbrush! It&#x27;s all plastic, the first time I tried brushing my long, thick, curly hair with it the brush slipped from my hand and was flung to the floor. No grip on the handle and the slick plastic along with the odd &#x27;V&#x27; shape makes it difficult to hold. It does detangle but sounds like it&#x27;s ripping my hair as I brush either wet or dry. I don&#x27;t usually brush my wet hair but I thought I&#x27;d try to see if the result improved. And why blue? Oh well, at least I got it on sale. I think I&#x27;ll try that mason brush I heard about... maybe not, the mason brush is $80-$120+. Guess I&#x27;ll keep searching for the perfect brush. That or chop it all off again. :(</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair, and it tangles oh so easily.  This is the only hairbrush that I&#x27;ve every used that didn&#x27;t feel like it was tearing my hair out from the roots...OUCH!  Even though I have fine hair, I bought the brush for coarse hair.  It&#x27;s an excellent product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my daughter who has VERY thick hair. She said it was no better than any other brush she has used. I returned it.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that takes forever to brush because it is usually always so tangled and pulls my hair. I Hated brushing my hair before I got this brush. I was very skeptical, but I had really been wanting to try it for awhile now. SO glad I did. Both me and my boyfriend used it right away, and it didn&#x27;t yank our hair at all.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This brush is a scam. It has one star because that&#x27;s the minimum for review. I have long color treated fine hair that tangles terribly when it&#x27;s wet and underneath when it&#x27;s dry . Even with conditioner it&#x27;s a challenge to brush when wet.  This brush pulled and broke off a ridiculous amount of hair.  Much better results with The Wet Brush. It&#x27;s bristles are soft and it doesn&#x27;t pull a bit. So gentle on hair and Easily gets out knots!!!</li>
            <li> This brush works better for my 9 year old&#x27;s very long, VERY thick hair than anything else we&#x27;ve tried. She is now able to brush her own hair without tears or frustration. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 5 year old daughter. She always seems to have &amp;#34;Albert Einstein&amp;#34; hair. The good thing about this brush is that it did not pull her hair when I brushed it. That&#x27;s because it didn&#x27;t do anything. Her hair was still full of tangles after I spent 5 minutes trying to brush it. I&#x27;ve tried it several times. It doesn&#x27;t even work as well as a cheap brush. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Her hair is terrible to manage and was always painful to brush when she was a child. Heavy, thick, it was like rats nests. I could braid it the night before but it would come out and snarl - ARGH! I saw this and decided I needed to make up for years of torture so I sent her one and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I gave this review a 4 because I was expecting it to be a &amp;#34;miracle brush&amp;#34; for my kids. It still pulls a little bit, but not a whole lot. It goes thru the hair much faster than a traditional brush. I did notice that it makes my kids&#x27; hair shiny too. This is a great buy for those kids who fuss when you brush their hair. My kids don&#x27;t really complain about it hurting their hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work ony grandaughtet&#x27;s thick hair.  Needed a brush for thick hair.  Wasted money on this particular brush.  Most disappointed.</li>
            <li> This brush can do it all! I have curly thick hair and it really helps detangle my wild lion&#x27;s mane, especially just out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The handle on the brush is fine. I saw some reviews stating the handle is short. I guess you can say it&#x27;s a bit short, but at least it has a handle versus Tangle Teezer so you can&#x27;t complain there. I don&#x27;t use brushes while my hair is wet. That&#x27;s a one way ticket to hair loss (at least for me). If you&#x27;re going to use a tool on your hair wet, use a shower comb or a wide tooth comb that&#x27;s soft. Sometimes you get those wide tooth combs that are cheap, plastic and it&#x27;s garbage. So a wide tooth comb like a Conair one for example (I have a Conair purple one I bought from Walmart I think a while back) would be good to use. Wide tooth combs will keep your hair from breaking off. Deep conditioners are good for your hair too, something that works for you. I use this brush on my dry hair. I have short, dry, thick and coarse hair. I&#x27;ve never used this wet. Use shampoo, cheap if you want, and hot water to clean it well. I really like this brush and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I adore this brush. I have kept my hair in my head and not in my comb or on the floor. It make your hair smooth and it is now a pleasure to brush my hair after a shower or at night. My hair tangles very easily but this brush does the trick. Thank you Michel!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush over a year ago off their website after a friend recommended it online and THAT was a mistake. Order it from somewhere other than their official website--they charge you way too much for shipping, it takes forever to arrive, and they made me make an account for the site that sent me a ton of spam emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this brush (the blue one) for about a year now. I was disappointed with the construction for the high price... it&#x27;s a bit awkward to brush with and is made of cheap hollow plastic. Once I started using it though I am totally willing to forgive all the flaws. I have long thick wavy hair that is damaged from bleaching, dyeing, and highlights and was an absolute nightmare to brush even after using heavy conditioner. It would literally take me 45 minutes to brush out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this brush on my hair both wet and dry. It barely catches on the horrible snarls in my damaged hair, even when wet, even if I haven&#x27;t used conditioner. It takes, like, 30 seconds to brush my hair. I commented on another review that complained the bristles were loose/bending too much. I noticed mine were doing this too after a while and I was concerned at first, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in effectiveness so it isn&#x27;t an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the bristles would be too short to get through all of my hair or even reach my scalp, but it&#x27;s not a problem. I brush just like I normally would. It also breaks my hair noticeably less than a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still use a normal brush if I am blow-drying my hair because this brush does not lift enough hair at a time to use with a hairdryer.</li>
            <li> It kinda works but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t work. If your hair is snarly then it hurts but if its not snarly then its really nice. It feels like its breaking  your hair and the sound oh my gosh its super annoying. I feel like my hair is going to all come out.. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brand of brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well. It really detangles my hair. I have very thick hair so it is hard for me to find the right product. I have finally found it. The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t work as well on wet hair.</li>
            <li> my kid screams when coming her hair because it is so thick now she can do it herself with very little help!</li>
            <li> its like any regular brush I got it for my wife and its nothing like it say it brings the hair out inside the brush like it said it wouldn&#x27;t but it did and it does not make you hair naturally straight</li>
            <li> I thought this brush worked great in getting tangles out.  After several months of using the brush my hair has become extremely broken and damaged.  I have a puff of fizzed hair.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product. The commercial seriously mentioned that the brush could comb thick naturally kinky hair to straight. There is no brush in the world that will comb the natural curls out of any hair and the hair results turns flat iron straight.</li>
            <li> This is not an effective detangling brush for a child. We are very picky around here and always on the hunt for a good brush. This is not it, save your money!</li>
            <li> works great on my daughters hair, which happens to be fine, not thick.</li>
            <li> I would Never recommend this brush to anyone !, especially anyone with long hair !.  It&#x27;s a flimsy , cheap made product.  Wasted my money !.</li>
            <li> I bought one for me and one for me and one for each of my two daughters....they threw theirs away and I&#x27;m using mine for the dogs.</li>
            <li> Good brush. But I prefer the Goody brand brush for curly hair which gets the knots out with less pain.</li>
            <li> We were a bit disappointed. It is not as great a brush as the commercials say it is. Still catches snarls and pulls. My daughter said it was no better than a regular brush, and she actually prefers a soft bristle brush to this one.</li>
            <li> I love it, get it if you hate combing your hair this will change your mind</li>
            <li> i just bought the brush cuz i am always ripping my hair out i have very long hair and kinda thick not like horse tail thick but thick..well i hate the brush i have no idea how its suppose to work..i mean its simple..one peice..but it just goes over the top of my hair and it always is still pulling hair out..i just do not like it..i just tried it again and its ripping my hair and you can hear it breaking it wish i could take it back</li>
            <li> This works better than other brushes but not nearly as good as portrayed on the infomercial. It does not go through all of my hair and I still have to hold my hair above the point of where I am brushing to keep it from pulling. It also adds static electricity to my hair. I wonder if the prototype was a better product than the mass produced brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my 11 yer old granddaughter who has long curly hair.  She loves it as it works as advertised...first brush she has been able to get through her thick hair without yells of Ohhhhhhhhhh.</li>
            <li> A total waste of $15 - works about as well as a dollar store brush when it comes to &amp;#34;easily detangling&amp;#34;.  I was so hopeful, as the fight with my daughter to brush her long, curly her is daily, so I put out the $15 for a hairbrush - and was completely disappointed.  Their commercial and their claims are total lies in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Whatever you use brush/comb on your hair, the secret is to ALWAYS brush gently from the ends UP to your scalp. This prevents split ends through out your hair shaft. Conditioner helps too!</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely amazing it works so well on my hair and it barley even hurts it does have the sound effect of someone ripping out your hair but it does not hurt</li>
            <li> brush worked OK on long and very thick curly hair. It just can&#x27;t get deep enough into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;But the main problem is quality and longevity. It fell off the bathroom counter once, and broke into 3 pieces.&lt;br /&gt;It is impossible to put it back together by hand.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Amazon took it back and refunded the purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t even look like it can detangle African American hair. Once again, a product made only for white people -_-</li>
            <li> Makes noises like it&#x27;s ripping  your  hair, scares  my child  so not sure if it&#x27;s better  than a regular  brush or not I used it does not hurt.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush EVER!!!  My daughter has long thick hair.  Every morning it is a snarly mess.  What used to take an hour to brush with lots of ouch and tears and now been reduced to 5 minutes of brushing!  No ouch, tears or pulling away.  This brush works on dry o wet hair.  I LOVE this brush!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this from their website and shipping took almost a month! Wow, on top of it all I have been getting telemarketing calls ever since from them to buy other products...it never ends!!!!  So just beware, if you order this product buy from somewhere other than the actual site, this has been a big headache!</li>
            <li> I have a daughter with long hair...it did not detangle the knots easily and actually hur her hair more than her regular brush...she cries more trying to brush her hair with this</li>
            <li> I have three daughters with three different types of hair; wavy, angel fine, and curly. Saw the commercials and jumped on the band wagon. Not only do it not detangle, it creates more of a mess with the ends of the hair (puts actually knots in the ends.)</li>
            <li> The brush does not work. My 9 year old has very long and thick hair. We got the brush for thick hair. It would not work to get the tangles out at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this for Christmas.  She used it once with wet hair and loved it!  Then we dried her hair with a blow drier and it melted the bristles!!  She is so disappointed and I am out money because a refund/return/replacement is not available because it is over 30 days!!  Of course it has been over 30 days, I bought it as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she cries when getting her hair brushed, so she saw the commercial and begged me to buy it.  It detangles good but it&#x27;s still not without a little pain from the tugging because there is really no give to the bristles as they are really stiff because this is the brush for thick hair. I&#x27;ve even tried it on myself and it does tug pretty good.  However this brush works great when the hair is wet.  I went to target and bought a Goody brand detangler and she absolutely loves that one and I paid maybe $8 for it, so it detangles good and does not hurt as bad as the bristles are slightly softer. I use the Goody on dry hair and the Michele on wet hair.  Hope this review helps.&lt;br /&gt;  For reference her heritage is African American/Puerto Rican/Guamanian mix so her hair type is a 2B like Chili from TLC. Follow link for hair type chart.  [...]</li>
            <li> Detangles my hair somewhat but I don&#x27;t notice it being any different than a regular brush. Not impressed with it at all. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well for me. I have thick, curly/wavy, red hair. My brushes usually pull on my hair but, this brush glides through. I&#x27;m sorry to read the other reviews about people not being happy with it but, I love mine. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My mom loves it too so, now she wants one. XD)</li>
            <li> Amazing product that has been great.</li>
            <li> This brush did not detangle my ample hair any better than my other brushes--in fact I have other regular brushes that work better on my wet hair. The commercial claims that it leaves no hair in the brush--not true. The brush is made by putting 3 plastic pieces together. I should know, because I accidentally dropped the brush on my tile floor and it came apart and I can&#x27;t put it back together again. I would not recommend this over-priced and ineffective brush.</li>
            <li> We bought this brush as we saw it on TV. My 8 year old daughter used it for 2 month and worked great. After that, the teeth of the brush became softer and bended. Now it doesn&#x27;t do much anymore, it won&#x27;t even brush the hair anymore....you think it would last longer then 2 months.</li>
            <li> My eldest had to have one of these - however,despite their claims I find as much hair left in the brush as I did in any other brush - fine (for my youngest), normal (for me) or thick (for the one who begged for this brush) ... IMO a huge disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> First of all the handle is too short. I have extremely thick tangely hair and this brush just dosent cut it. It only untangles the top layer. My $5 brush from the hair salon works better.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.  It does not detangle like I thought it would, and it was very expensive to purchase.</li>
            <li> for the price paid plus the delivery charge I regret buying it Not only because after brushing it&#x27;s so many hair on the brush I didn&#x27;t like that a bit</li>
            <li> great for hair extensions...but you can get it cheaper at bed bath and beyond with a coupon.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very tight curls and we fight every morning to brush her hair.  Now mornings and hair brushing are easy!</li>
            <li> I ordered these directly from her website and paid $11 shipping which I would normally not do but my daughters hair if very fine and she cries when I brush it.  It gets very tangled. (BTW I didn&#x27;t know it was $11 until after I placed the order. no where on her website does it let you see the shipping first) First of all the bristles on this brush aren&#x27;t long enough and when they did catch her hair, it pulled, hair stuck in the brush and didn&#x27;t help in removing the knots.  Even thought I pay to ship them back (aggravating) I am returning them.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this brush. I have long thick hair and I was hopeful that with this brush it would help with the tangles and all the hair I lose when tring to comb it out. However, I was very dissapointed when it didn&#x27;t work and it was full of hair. I was very sad. I can&#x27;t even get the brush through my hair until I have it all combed out and even then there is still a lot of hair in the brush.</li>
            <li> I freakin&#x27; love this brush. It detangles my rat&#x27;s nest of a hair like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. It&#x27;s especially effective with wet hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this brush for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair and it did not work. The hairbrush we had at home worked better than this one. Don&#x27;t even buy it!</li>
            <li> It was better at pulling less on my step-daughter, but even though I got the Thick Hair one, it doesn&#x27;t go all the way through; we have to section it.  Not great when your battling a little girl that doesn&#x27;t want to sit still to have her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> My hair goes to my butt, and it&#x27;s very thin. Therefore it gets tangled super easily. I was kind of suspicious about this brush, because I thought I&#x27;d have to always deal with the pain. It was a miracle, it really doesn&#x27;t hurt. I now am actually excited to get out of the bath and brush my hair. After I use this brush, I use my normal one just to make sure that my hair is knot-free. I will be buying several of these just in case they break or I lose them.</li>
            <li> I bought the green one from Walgreens a few months ago and loved it, so I bought the blue one when I found it at a different store a few weeks later.  The brush works great!  Obviously it&#x27;s not perfect and it&#x27;s not 100% tangle free! but it makes brushing my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s super curly hair tolerable.  Usually she screams and cries the whole time but she doesn&#x27;t with this brush.  I have also used these brushes on my own curly, super thick hair, and they really do reduce the amount of tangles and pain!  And my hair tangles super easily.  To those who say they don&#x27;t work... I don&#x27;t understand... Mine work and have continues working for five months or so now.  I do wish the one for thick hair had slightly longer bristles though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have heard tons of horror stories about ordering from the website, which is why I didn&#x27;t take advantage of their buy one get one free special.  Just buy the brush from a store or a different online merchant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it four stars is that the different color brushes have absolutely no difference.  The bristles are the same pattern and the same length.  There is no difference, that I could find, other than the color.  So I would suggest going with the color your kid likes the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have a two year old, autistic son, who LOVES anything he&#x27;s eyes on TV, so he is obsessed with these brushes.  He carries them around the house with him and throws them in the bath tub (he throws all his favorite things in the bath tub... It&#x27;s one of his things).  One of ours broke after being thrown in the tub a few too many times... It popped in half, which has happened before and we were able to put it back together, however this time the bristle pad came out and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get the bristles back through those tiny holes.  So, for a product meant to be used on and around children, I wish it was a little more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> My granddaughters hated to get their hair brushed. I actually saw this brush in a retail store. I had to buy it. They had a sleep over and after their shower agreed to give the brush a try. AMAZING!!!  The brush went right down their hair from their scalp to the ends. I went back to the store to buy another so they each would have one.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money on this brush, it does not detangle the hair with ease, and is made from a cheap plastic, worthless product!!!</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift to a teenager who loved it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works as advertised!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! I have thick long hair and it glides through and detangles it. It works great for me and I am glad I bought it. I taped it together on the handle because if it falls it will break apart and you can&#x27;t get it back together. I would have given it 5 stars if it did not have this flaw.</li>
            <li> Trash. This doesn&#x27;t work for natural black hair wet or dry. It works only if you detangle first, but if you need help detangling don&#x27;t use this brush. You&#x27;ll just end up frustrated.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful when I got this brush....  I have course,  curly,  Thick hair.  It didn&#x27;t even make it through one swipe through my hair!  Had to pry half of it out of my hair while the handle stayed in my hand.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and it is awesome. My hair hasn&#x27;t detangled this easily is a LONG time. I will gladly buy one every 8-12 months.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for a toddler that has long thick wavy hair , she screamed bloody murder every time we tried to use it that it hurt.&lt;br /&gt;we ended up with 4 brushes even though i called them the minute i realized my mistake when ordering and they said they couldnt stop the order.</li>
            <li> A brush is just a brush in the end. They&#x27;re not really so different. Don&#x27;t pay for a fancy ones and fall for gimmicks. Find a less expensive one. It&#x27;ll do the same job.</li>
            <li> Thought it would work on wet hair but it doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t need a brush for dry hair since I have naturally curly hair so I returned it. Not bad if you wanna brush your hair dry though!</li>
            <li> This brush melts if you use it to dry your hair. I bought this brush because my hair tangles when blow dried, so I thought it would help. All it did was melt inky hair and the bristles melted inside my hair, it stuck to my gir and it took my a long time to get it out</li>
            <li> Its hallow and plastic. Not what i expected.  It doesnt feel nice on the scalp as well</li>
            <li> The brush works at detangling my hair, but makes my hair very frizzy!</li>
            <li> Ordered this brush for fine and for normal hair for my 6 year old granddaughter....she saw it on TV and was sure it would be the answer to her tangled hair each morning.  My daughter tried it first and sent it back to me saying it did nothing worthwhile and added lots of static to the hair.  I was able to try it myself this morning on my granddaughter and was very disappointed....my dogs hair brush does a better job!!!  I am now the owner of two worthless brushes....I do not know where the so called 30-day instructions to return were, as I did not receive such paperwork.  This definitely was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink brush for fine hair and thought this would be great since I ride motorcycles &amp; my hair is always tangled afterwards. It didn&#x27;t work very well and pulled my hair &amp; breakage..so even tried it not being on the bike and it worked a little better but not much....When the brush arrived there was no return label in the box &amp; to top it off customer service keeps calling me and wanting to charge my debit card more for some sort of club I have no interest in and high pressure trying to get me to go along...I finely had to block their number....my advice..save your money and look for one at Sally&#x27;s or Wal-mart1</li>
            <li> I m in my mid 40&#x27;s and not ready to cut off my very long color treated blonde hair. I spent of fortune on so called good shampoos and conditioners and still had to spend a long time to comb my hair. I wash and condition it every day, and braided it at night time to make it easier in the morning to comb through after my shower. I was at my wits end and was about to cut all my hair off. I was at Walgreens waiting to have a prescription filled and I saw this brush in the as seen on tv Isle. I thought what the hell it can&#x27;t hurt to try I can always bring it back. when I took my shower that night and use the brush for the first time I was shocked at how great it works. it feels a little strange at first, but after a couple days you&#x27;ll get used to it. I&#x27;m planning to buy a couple more just in case the company goes out of business for some reason! it seriously saved my hair</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this. I saw some videos on you tube that said it was ok. I ordered it anyway. I am glad I did. It worked great on me and my daughter we are caucasian. My hair is thick, curly &amp; wavy (Just frizzy most of the time unless I flat iron it a lot.) My hair was dry, with hair spray (not that super strong stuff thats like glue but suave in the pump bottle) still in it from night before and I brushed through it without all the pulling my normal brush does. And a lot less hair left in the brush than my old brush. I was shocked how well it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In one of the you tube reviews that showed a girl saying the blue one for thick hair was to stiff. The normal one green is less stiff than the thick &amp; the fine one pink is less stiff than the normal. I don&#x27; t agree with her  thinking that the blue is to stiff, with my type of hair any less stiff and it would just give to much. I don&#x27;t think it would be effective in getting out my knots. They are not even stiff, they are very flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My daughter has thick hair but less wavy and frizzy than mine. Brushing her hair is ten minutes of her crying and trying to run from me. I told her I got a new brush that is not supposed to hurt so much. I was shocked again at how  great it worked. I only got two oww moms from her. It&#x27;s her new favorite brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have not tried it wet yet. I&#x27;ll try to update it after I do. The handle is just plastic no grip on it, also it is hollow inside. Both of which might be a problem for wet use.&lt;br /&gt;But I really like it and think it is well worth the price. My daughter is really benefiting from it and grateful.</li>
            <li> Not good for thick hair</li>
            <li> This may get the tangles out but it will break your hair and the bristles hurt your head.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> The wet brush... Search for it... It is cheaper and it actually works on wet and dry hair!!:) happy shopping!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush from the product website. I purchased it because my 6 year old has very long, thick hair. It is difficult to brush through if it is not kept braided, which she hates. We tried this brush after leaving her hair down for the day and we could not begin to brush through it. I also ordered another brush for my fine hair and there was still no difference between it and a brush from the dollar store. It is made of cheap plastic that I was afraid would break. The handle is difficult to grip well. I would not recommend this brush, but will try it on the horses as previously suggested.</li>
            <li> This brush makes a mess of my thick, curly hair - bought the comb from the same company - it&#x27;s great - use it on both wet and dry hair. Maybe this brush works for some people but I&#x27;m not one of them - it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> bought this for my grandson...he has long hair, teenagers......best brush ever</li>
            <li> so amazon sent me normal insyead so before I returned it I tried it. this brush rocks!  my son needs the thicker styled brusj but the normal works great for me.</li>
            <li> 2/17/15   Nevermind! Don&#x27;t waste your money at all. Seems after I&#x27;ve washed it a few times it has no glide at all. Could there have been a coating on it? I don&#x27;t know, there is no warning to not wash it. How else would I clean it? Ridiculous. Pulled and snags now like any other brush.      2/10/15  After wondering for a year, I finally bought it. I am happy and disappointed at the same time. Happy it works! It really does what it says! I was amazed because nothing has ever worked on my hair.It is also very easy to clean and wash. However that is what you are paying for and that is all. It has a very poor design. The handle part is so small it is very hard to hold and the handle is a poor shape. The brush has no balance at all. It is also very slippery. For the price, it should be a much better handle. I also have a feeling the bristles are going to wear out very quickly as some are bent already in a week. So great concept very poorly designed for the price, I&#x27;ve gotten higher quality at the dollar store. They need to go back to the drawing board!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, so naturally bought thick hair one.  The first week I started using it, I noticed significant amount of hairfall after brushing. Since I paid for it, I gave it another few weeks and my hair falls SO MUCH evry day!  After few weeks of using this, I realized one day when I was making my usual ponytail I have so much less hair than I used to! (still alot though.. I have lots of hair).  I&#x27;ve stopped using it and went back to my bamboo brush.  LADIES, IF YOU LOVE UR HAIR, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have an 8 year old girl who has very long hair that has been a  nightmare trying to brush daily.  Sometimes her mood for the entire day was set by how horrific her hair brushing experience was.  We got these in the mail today and tried with very low hopes of success.  To our absolute surprise her knotty hair was transformed into silky long locks withut my daughter even flinching once.  We will recommend this product to all of our friends who suffer the same problem.  This is a product that will literally change our lives from this day forward. Thanks Michel Mercier!</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my daughter. It was one of those things she saw on tv and asked for it for Christmas. Neither of us care for it and it often causes more tangles than it solves.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for moms thick Greek hair..she hasn&#x27;t said it works or not. :(</li>
            <li> Causes a lot of breakage of the hair.  :(</li>
            <li> Brush worked as advertised.  Am now able to brush my granddaughter&#x27;s hair without tears and screams!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for s***, I can get a brush from the 99 cent store that works better</li>
            <li> Product did not work well.</li>
            <li> I got 2 of these (not from here) the pink and the green. They do not work!&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going back to my store bought one because these did nothing. They feel cheap to me.&lt;br /&gt;I got these for my little girl to help because she is tender headed so I was really hoping for no more OUCH....back to looking for something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old woman who was undeservedly born with shiny, very thick, wavy hair that is currently mid-back length. I&#x27;ve been irrationally afraid of combing my hair since I was a kid, because it tangles VERY quickly and easily to the point where I can barely keep up with it. I&#x27;m not big on beauty products - especially gimmicky ones like this brush - but I picked it up on a whim at a drugstore ($15) after seeing that it was similar to the [[ASIN:B006J2I65Y Spark Innovators Hair Bean Hair Detangling Comb]], which worked well for me but was too small and awkwardly-shaped to use. So, here&#x27;s the rundown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Detangles with much less pain and effort than a regular brush&lt;br /&gt;-Large surface area for quicker brushing&lt;br /&gt;-Feels good on the scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Hollow plastic, flimsy construction&lt;br /&gt;- Bristles lose rigidity over time&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to clean&lt;br /&gt;- High price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I think that the Hair Bean is better for children to use and for shorter hair, but if you have thick, long hair, this brush is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush, worth every penny.  Finally a product that brushing the kid&#x27;s hair painless!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair brush for thick hair. My hair feels softer and it really helps with the knots, I dont rip out so much hair when Im brushing.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived quickly, but unfortunately it is no better than any detangling brush you can buy in a drugstore for half the price.  Still need to use detangling sprays.  I would not recommend this to anyone with long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be amazing because I saw it on TV but I didn&#x27;t like it at all. The material it&#x27;s made of is a cheap plastic and it doesn&#x27;t really detangle that well. I would just stick to my old detangling paddle brush that I already had.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that I absolutely cannot get a brush through wet or dry, although wet is worse.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I had my reservations when I saw the commercial for this brush.&lt;br /&gt;After all, a lot of products that are shown on TV through infomercials tend to get bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;However, I found after researching reviews that there are several happy customers who loved this brush.&lt;br /&gt;At $30, it&#x27;s the most expensive brush I own, maybe ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the shower with wet tangled hair I grabbed this brush and, amazingly, it slide through my hair with hardly any trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Hardly any trouble&amp;#34; is a 95% improvement compared to other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I brushed it underneath, something that would lead to pain and several strands being ripped from my scalp, but it was as if I had tangle free hair to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;No pain, very few strands left on the brush, but not ripped. Rather, they were bound to fall out anyway.&lt;br /&gt;After I dried my hair it was very soft and manageable, and I credit the brush to that because that was the only change I made to my hair regimen. No change in shampoo or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I can have the worst hair day and still be able to get a brush through it.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very happy with my purchase, this brush is a hair saver, and I will not use any other brush.</li>
            <li> I have four daughters with four different hair types and this brush HURTS!!!!!!! I wasted a lot of money, the site was misleading and they over charged and didn&#x27;t help out when I called. DON&#x27;T DO IT!</li>
            <li> Did not work on thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, wavy, long, naturally blond hair. For decades I have had a wonderful brush that reached all through my hair to the scalp, but my luggage was lost on an airline a few months ago, and I have been buying hairbrushes ever since then, trying to find one that would penetrate my difficult hair and give me that wonderful brushing action. I am discovering that most brushes on the market these days are too soft and will not stand up to going through my long thick wavy hair. So I ordered a Michele Mercier Dentangling Brush -- the blue one that is supposed to be for thick hair. Once again this brush is a disappointment. The bristles are too short to reach my scalp. Furthermore, the bristles bent over right away within the first few seconds of brushing. After 5 minutes of attempting to brush, the bristles were mostly flat as a pancake. Total waste of money if you really have thick long hair. So my search for an old fashioned real brush continues.</li>
            <li> Same story as many folks on here-Not only does the brush NOT work, but I ended up with paying $54 for TWO brushes..I clicked on the option to get a sparkle brush on the website thinking it would show me the price, but instead they added third brush to my order and charged my credit card before I could review my order. Also, I selected the brush for fine hair but when the TWO brushed that I paid for (no free one although I paid for the shipping of three brushes).. I got one for fine hair and one for thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the heels of a WubbleBubble Ball fiasco, my 5 year olds are learning that commercials are not true.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has really thick hair and no brush that we have bought has been able to go through her hair ,we seen this on TV and I thought ill try it and to my surprise she lets us brush her hair without any problems or saying its pulling and fighting us with every stroke ,so YES I RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH TO EVEY PERSON THAT HAS A CHILD WITH THICK HAIR ,IT&#x27;S FABULOUS,.I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT TWO OF THESE ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all I heard it was but it was nice. Lot of hair in the brush after use.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and use it every day, as does my mother and sister. We all have different textures of very thick African American Hair (long and curly, longer and wavy, and coarser and extra thick). We all love it. It gives a good scalp message, detangles wet and dry hair and we have all seen hair growth while using it. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wasn;t the one for thick hair.  It was the same as the regular one.</li>
            <li> gave this as a gift and my mother in law was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It really works the way it says.  I have had no problems with it.  My daughter did not cry for the first time in a long time when I brushed her hair.  And mine OH MY did it ever work.  And I have the worst unmanageable EVER! Thank you!</li>
            <li> my daughter is extremely thick curly hair we have tried everything out there and nothing worked. we ordered this and oh my gosh! it has been amazing. she use to cry all the time when we would go to brush her hair now she does it herself.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in green from my local Walgreens. I was excited to see it there, as I&#x27;ve been wanting to try it. I took it home, and I took it out of the box. It&#x27;s a weird looking brush, but the moment I used it on my hair, I fell in love! It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do! My hair gets tangled easily, but this brush brushes through those tangles with ease. Use it gently on your hair, there&#x27;s NO NEED to pull. That&#x27;s the first thing I learned. It&#x27;s customary to want to pull through or apply some kind of pressure when passing the brush through your hair, but trust me...IT IS NOT NECESSARY. Just brush from the top of your scalp all the way down to the hair tip.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This brush is crap, if you want pain free brush I suggest wet brush. We bought for 7year old daughter who always wakes up with a rats nest and it hurts her bad, last week we bought wet brush from salon and she brushes the tangles right out with no pain. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> My daughter BEGGED me to get this brush. It&#x27;s not a good brush. She is really disappointed and so am I for buying it.</li>
            <li> If I could have given this brush 0 stars I would have! I got this hoping that it would be the BE ALL END ALL of pulling a brush through my extremely thick hair and not fighting tangles or finding enough hair in the bristles to make a wig... I was wrong! It does nothing that it advertised and  to top it off cant actually go through my hair even though I got the blue one for thick hair. Very disappointed! Just to be clear the brush will NOT help de-tangle your hair; It will NOT help stop pulling your hair out and it IS WORTHLESS when trying to style!</li>
            <li> This is an awful brush!!!Cannot even brush your hair very well or very quickly. I was so disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Actually works on my horse&#x27;s tail. Can&#x27;t say anything about human hair.  Did a real good job where other brushes just came apart.</li>
            <li> This brush did not work at all, it just caused pain from pulling and does not detangle.  Its also expensive.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
