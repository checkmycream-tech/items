            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>It provides a great nonabrasive exfoliation that all skin needs at some point.</li>
            <li>I am really so happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Great value</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li>Just as described I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>SO glad I found this!</li>
            <li>DCL Glycolic Acid Pads 20% have been an effective addition to my skin care routine.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this product for fine lines and my melasma management!</li>
            <li>more now in my thirties than ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li>I wash with a mixture of organic castor oil and another carrier oil for better glide.  </li>
            <li>I also receive so many compliments on how I don&#x27;t look my age</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price, much cheater than if purchased from the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>My skin now seems to take the moisturizer better (if that makes any sense).</li>
            <li>Absolutely love and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>but this 20% glycolic acid treatment works faster and more evenly (plus</li>
            <li>/&gt;After use my skin feels and looks smoother and more youthful.</li>
            <li>Promises more than it delivers and stings</li>
            <li>but I would say about 80% better.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more of the gel.</li>
            <li>This product works much better than more aggressively advertised/promoted Glycolic products.</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking that 20% wouldn&#x27;t be too strong for me</li>
            <li>My fine lines have lessened.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>That was fine</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and cannot afford a chemical peel, so this is a good option for me.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth as a peach.</li>
            <li>I am ordering another container, its well worth it!</li>
            <li>I do the hot washcloth about four times, making sure to get it all off.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I use the intense moisturizer during the peel and by Monday morning I have an amazing fresh glow to my skin.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it enough to be fair</li>
            <li>I have a 30% glycolic acid at home that is just too strong for my skin, but these 20% pads really do wonders!  </li>
            <li>Saturday and Sunday I have mild peeling, no redness or burning.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, use it daily for the last 9 years!</li>
            <li>Not a miracal worker but worth it.</li>
            <li>Strong for sensetive skin but reconended for normal</li>
            <li>Product works as expected, better complection in 2 weeks, would love to have 40% pads wrapped individually for better results.</li>
            <li>I am always on the lookout for the least amount of ingredients that are the most effective.  </li>
            <li>And it really does the job!  </li>
            <li>I went to have one done somewhere and ended up getting microderm abrasion and some other kind of gentle peel with it.</li>
            <li>I first used these acid pads during high school at the recommendation of my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in my skin from use of this product.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of products out there claiming to have 20% glycolic acid in them, but this stuff really does.  </li>
            <li>These work very well.  </li>
            <li>But not at all as much as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>It changed my skin FAST.</li>
            <li>My face is so much clearer.</li>
            <li>Depending on the pressure you use to wipe your face with these pads, you will peel more or less.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and it really takes away the old and wrinkled skin.</li>
            <li>I am Korean-American with normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin silky soft!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use chemicals on my face or body or home usually, so I tried so many natural treatments for my skin.</li>
            <li>After using my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin in t-zone, pores and occasional breakouts..</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Even this technique did not upset my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely erased the discoloration on my cheeks</li>
            <li>I used to have something happening on my face all the time and twice as much around the last week before my period.</li>
            <li>After cleansing with my oils for a few minutes, focusing on any areas of congestion, I place a hot washcloth on my face until it cools and then gently wipe my cleansing oils away.  </li>
            <li>It stings a bit, but not more than a light slapping sting.</li>
            <li>Also, I still break out a little bit before my period but the pimples go away quickly.</li>
            <li>I have wasted much time and money trying out unproven skin care products that do nothing but leave me with the memory of a clever marketing scam.</li>
            <li>Skin is soft, pores smaller, makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old and have actually been receiving compliments on my complexion since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li>I was a little wary when I went to purchase these again because some of the reviews, but it works great.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive, use less pressure, if your skin is tough, like mine, use more.  </li>

            <li> If you are sensitive, use less pressure, if your skin is tough, like mine, use more.  </li>
            <li> I use retina micro every other night with an intense moisturizer (Avene) and I add this peel about once a month on a Friday morning before any other products.  </li>
            <li> If I buy something I want to get my money&#x27;s worth not a good product.</li>
            <li> I think these pads will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> Now after several weeks of use rest of the pads begin to dry off - reason for 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Too harsh for my sensitive skin, so i threw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I will be using these pads for a LONG time!</li>
            <li> I continue to use Retin-A also &amp; still not overly dry.</li>
            <li> They cause some initial stinging, but afterwards, they leave my face softer, glowing, and less dry than before.</li>
            <li> Super expensive, but this plus [[ASIN:B001A3ML3K Proactiv]] and my face cleared up overnight.</li>
            <li> Was supposed to help get rid of rough skin.  </li>
            <li> Not much help yet.</li>
            <li> I am 39, I still have acne, I have acne scarring, just reddish spots, not really surface bumps or anything, no pock marks and some sun damage spots</li>
            <li> but it was, be careful, use very carefully</li>
            <li> I tried it once or twice a week, sometimes every other week.</li>
            <li> There is some information (on medline) that indicates glycolic acid stimulates cell turnover and production of new skin (a process that slows down as we age).I prefer to use skin care products that have some science behind them.</li>
            <li> These pads tingle a little, not much burning, just a little heat.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to use these every other day &amp; they are not too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> Just keep the lid on tight</li>
            <li> and I think it helped a little bit?</li>
            <li> I have been using DCL Glycolic Acid pads for a few years now under the instruction/advice of my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I avoid the retina for a few days after as well.</li>
            <li> Not a good brand.  </li>
            <li> I use these 1 - 3 times a week, leave on for about 7-8 minutes, then wash off with cold water.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great!! After using my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> Great product and timely delivery!</li>
            <li> I went for my second facial, the doctor that works at the spa recommended this product. I tried it once or twice a week, sometimes every other week. Was recommended to use it on face for 5 minutes and wash off. Skin is soft, pores smaller, makeup goes on smoother. I have very oily skin in t-zone, pores and occasional breakouts..more now in my thirties than ever. I am ordering another container, its well worth it!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s the best Glycolic Acid Pads on the market.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try.</li>
            <li> Using it about twice a week has taken years off my skin and cleared up cystic acne. I wish I had tried this earlier. It stings a bit, but not more than a light slapping sting. My pores look much smaller and my skin is glowing. I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using DCL Glycolic Acid pads for a few years now under the instruction/advice of my Dermatologist. They help control my oily skin &amp; help lighten my acne scars.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in my skin from use of this product.  Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  It was recommended in a beauty magazine that&#x27;s why I purchased.  Trying to improve appearance of elbows and this was suggested.  Was supposed to help get rid of rough skin.  Not much help yet.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough to be fair, you can only it 2x a week.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product again!  I have sensitive skin.  I wash with a mixture of organic castor oil and another carrier oil for better glide.  After cleansing with my oils for a few minutes, focusing on any areas of congestion, I place a hot washcloth on my face until it cools and then gently wipe my cleansing oils away.  I do the hot washcloth about four times, making sure to get it all off.  As you can see, I am committed to my facial regimen.  I am always on the lookout for the least amount of ingredients that are the most effective.  DCL Glycolic Acid Pads 20% have been an effective addition to my skin care routine.  I use them 1-2 times per week.  I have seen improvements with my pore size and milia underneath my eyes.  For a deeper &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; I have used one pad, waited five minutes and applied another pad that I rinsed after an additional five minutes.  Even this technique did not upset my sensitive skin.  I am very happy with the results from this product.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of products out there claiming to have 20% glycolic acid in them, but this stuff really does.  And it really does the job!  I use these 1 - 3 times a week, leave on for about 7-8 minutes, then wash off with cold water.  I have a 30% glycolic acid at home that is just too strong for my skin, but these 20% pads really do wonders!  My acne scars have faded. My fine lines have lessened. My pores have become smaller.  I also receive so many compliments on how I don&#x27;t look my age (I&#x27;m 38).  I will be using these pads for a LONG time!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used to order this product through my Dermatologist&#x27;s office but realized I could get it online. It&#x27;s a great price, much cheater than if purchased from the doctor&#x27;s office. It provides a great nonabrasive exfoliation that all skin needs at some point. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Just as described I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> Would not buy again. Not a good brand.  If I buy something I want to get my money&#x27;s worth not a good product.</li>
            <li> Too harsh for my sensitive skin, so i threw it in the garbage. I should have contacted customer service for a refund.</li>
            <li> I have been using these glycolic acid pads for several years now. I am 56 years old and have actually been receiving compliments on my complexion since I have been using this product. I use one pad 1-3 times a week after cleansing my face. They cause some initial stinging, but afterwards, they leave my face softer, glowing, and less dry than before. There is some information (on medline) that indicates glycolic acid stimulates cell turnover and production of new skin (a process that slows down as we age).I prefer to use skin care products that have some science behind them. I have wasted much time and money trying out unproven skin care products that do nothing but leave me with the memory of a clever marketing scam.This is a product that actually works. It is pricey for everyday use, but one container lasts me almost a year since you really don&#x27;t need to use every day(in my opinion) to get results.I have very sensitive skin and cannot afford a chemical peel, so this is a good option for me.</li>
            <li> Super expensive, but this plus [[ASIN:B001A3ML3K Proactiv]] and my face cleared up overnight. Not sure which product actually did it, or if it was a combination, but I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this is the first time something actually worked.</li>
            <li> I use retina micro every other night with an intense moisturizer (Avene) and I add this peel about once a month on a Friday morning before any other products.  Saturday and Sunday I have mild peeling, no redness or burning. I use the intense moisturizer during the peel and by Monday morning I have an amazing fresh glow to my skin. I avoid the retina for a few days after as well. Love this product for fine lines and my melasma management!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to use these. I am 63 &amp; still have plugged pores. My dermatologist told me to use these every other day &amp; they are not too harsh on my skin. I continue to use Retin-A also &amp; still not overly dry. My skin now seems to take the moisturizer better (if that makes any sense). I have been using these for about a month &amp; I&#x27;m starting to see improvement. My pores look clearer &amp; smaller.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working fine. Not a miracal worker but worth it. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I first used these acid pads during high school at the recommendation of my dermatologist. I was a little wary when I went to purchase these again because some of the reviews, but it works great. I am Korean-American with normal to oily skin. These do not produce any redness, irritation or peeling. I use about twice a week. The next morning, my pimples are visibly diminished and I think they help with acne scarring. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love and will purchase again. It makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these from my dermatologist (who told me only a doctor&#x27;s office could sell them), but when his office stopped carrying this product, I looked for, and found it online. Yay! I use prescription Retinol .1% but this 20% glycolic acid treatment works faster and more evenly (plus it&#x27;s way cheaper than the Retinol).&lt;br /&gt;After use my skin feels and looks smoother and more youthful. It is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Strong for sensetive skin but reconended for normal</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that 20% wouldn&#x27;t be too strong for me but it was, be careful, use very carefully</li>
            <li> These work very well.  Depending on the pressure you use to wipe your face with these pads, you will peel more or less.  If you are sensitive, use less pressure, if your skin is tough, like mine, use more.  I use these in combination with Retin-A.  My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> Promises more than it delivers and stings</li>
            <li> Product works as expected, better complection in 2 weeks, would love to have 40% pads wrapped individually for better results. Now after several weeks of use rest of the pads begin to dry off - reason for 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and great product!</li>
            <li> leaves my skin silky soft! Waiting to see long-term results.</li>
            <li> Hurray!!! SO glad I found this! I don&#x27;t use chemicals on my face or body or home usually, so I tried so many natural treatments for my skin. I am 39, I still have acne, I have acne scarring, just reddish spots, not really surface bumps or anything, no pock marks and some sun damage spots I guess. I thought it was all acne scarring but I think some of it is from the sun. I did some research about different peels and figured Glycolic was the way to go for me. I went to have one done somewhere and ended up getting microderm abrasion and some other kind of gentle peel with it. That was fine and I think it helped a little bit? But not at all as much as I hoped it would. Then I bought this stuff along with the lightening gel, same company. I have been using both for maybe two months? It changed my skin FAST. My face is so much clearer. I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever been so even toned. It has smoothed some lines I had which was not even my goal but I am a fan. It hasn&#x27;t completely erased the discoloration on my cheeks but I would say about 80% better. Also, I still break out a little bit before my period but the pimples go away quickly. I used to have something happening on my face all the time and twice as much around the last week before my period. These pads tingle a little, not much burning, just a little heat. Wash it off after five minutes. No big deal. I use it twice a week. And the lightening gel morning and night.  I just ordered more of the gel. I think these pads will last a really long time. And they are still moist, I haven&#x27;t had any issues of them drying up. Just keep the lid on tight I guess. I am really so happy with the product. It is the only thing that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, use it daily for the last 9 years! and it really takes away the old and wrinkled skin. My face is smooth as a peach.</li>
            <li> This product works much better than more aggressively advertised/promoted Glycolic products. Great value and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
