            <li>I do not know if it is just this organizer that this happened to, but for $180.00 and for the purpose of what the product is designed/made to do, I am not all happy.  </li>

            <li>It really is a nice product!  </li>
            <li>Looks great on my counter, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the fact that it does not have a lid which was a deciding factor for me when making the purchase.</li>
            <li>Looks of good quality and is quite sturdy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fair share of space-</li>
            <li>It arrived within days and it is even more beautiful in person.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge!!</li>
            <li>I was impressed on how fast the order had been fulfilled and shipped!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>did you buy that questions,&amp;#34; and I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>The pulls are a nice detail as well.  </li>
            <li>this is nice as a starter.</li>
            <li>It does look nice and hold a lot, hence the reason for 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>One of the drawers doesnt pull out or close very easily.</li>
            <li>but so far the knob seems sturdy and assembly was easy!!!!!</li>
            <li>Easy construction too!      </li>
            <li>So after weeks of research I decided to purchase this item through Amazon (who has GREAT customer service) from a seller that was willing to take returns if I had a problem with the item after receiving it.</li>
            <li>The knobs can easily be switched out if you buy your own from any store as they are removable and replaceable.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package, I was also pleased to see that it was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend for a stylish, well-made (for the most part) organizer.      </li>
            <li>Just like so many of you makeup fanatics out there..</li>
            <li>Mostly bcse</li>
            <li>I love the organizer and the crack doesn&#x27;t even show up as it&#x27;s against the wall on my counter.  </li>
            <li>it were any more damaged, I would indeed, have returned it.</li>
            <li>It has five drawers and a \\&quot;cubby\\&quot; on the top so to can place things on top without worrying that they will get knocked off.</li>
            <li>All in all I could not ask for anything more.</li>
            <li>I get so many &amp;#34;where</li>
            <li>Would make an excellent present for girlfriend, mom, wife, sister,....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this cube for about a week now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the scraping noise I hear upon opening will eventually disappear by some magic.</li>
            <li>I love the top cubby.  </li>
            <li>I had been searching for this like most gals&#x27; since i seen it on that Kardashian reality show.</li>
            <li>I love make-up and this won&#x27;t fit all my make-up!</li>
            <li>For the cost you&#x27;d think it would be more functional / better design.  </li>
            <li>on top and 2 drawers you can order</li>
            <li>The positives are my wife loved the organizer, its very nice looking, the drawers are large and appears easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this in the mail!</li>
            <li>, it is a great dupe for the kardashian clear cube</li>
            <li>What sold me was the fact that there is no flip top &amp; FREE shipping(very heavy,received in one week)</li>
            <li>The best money i ever spent!</li>
            <li>You just have to screw in the diamond drawer pulls - easy.</li>
            <li>You just have to screw in the diamond drawer pulls - easy.</li>
            <li>I had been going back and forth for weeks about buying this makeup cube...its pricey but its beautiful.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a beautiful way to display your makeup</li>
            <li>And they are really very pretty!</li>
            <li>And they are really very pretty!</li>
            <li>Huge crack in the bottom drawer.</li>
            <li>Such great quality and can fit tons of makeup.</li>
            <li>that wouldn&#x27;t fit w</li>
            <li>I purchased via Amazon Prime, so I received the cube in two days with free shipping.</li>
            <li>i am a makeup \\&quot;whore\\&quot; and have a ton of makeup so all the drawers are filled.</li>
            <li>and once I filled it with my makeup</li>
            <li>short, this was definitely a great buy for me.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about my make up organizer coming in the mail only to unwrap it from the great packaging to find a crack in the acrylic on the bottom.</li>
            <li>This box has a very elegant look to it and overall I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Holds all of my makeup and is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Thank u so much! :)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>When I found this alternative I was so excited.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this piece if you are looking for a dupe of the Kdash clear cube - or just a great place to store makeup!</li>
            <li>It keeps all my makeup clean and dust free, and it&#x27;s very pretty to look at with the diamond pulls.  </li>
            <li>I even debated keeping it because it would be hard to see the crack, but for the price I felt like it should have been perfect</li>
            <li>I love it but really wish i bought the 24 inch one...</li>
            <li>There are many places on the internet selling these acrylic makeup organizers, and I found price points that ranged anywhere from $120 to $300, but surprisingly found little feedback from any of the consumers that have purchased and used these products.</li>
            <li>I use it to hold all of my fragrances and quick reach items.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty though.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this cube to anyone who is willing to make the investment!</li>
            <li>I was excited about receiving this and the first box arrived cracked at the side along where the drawers inserted in.  </li>
            <li>Each drawer, as stated, is 2 1/2 inches deep - you can easily stack say 4 Mac sized 16 pan eye shad pallets on top of one another &amp; have have two stacks of 4 ea. -</li>
            <li>Each drawer, as stated, is 2 1/2 inches deep - you can easily stack say 4 Mac sized 16 pan eye shad pallets on top of one another &amp; have have two stacks of 4 ea. -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy that I decided to order this item and have no regrets that I chose this one over some of the other options in my price range.</li>
            <li>Makeup looks so clean, pretty and organized.</li>
            <li>It look great and takes up little space.</li>
            <li>I would wind up keeping the lid open to fit things on top</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this piece if you are looking for a dupe of the Kdash clear cube - or just a great place to store makeup!ckaged &amp; in 2 days as promised.</li>
            <li>So, check out both if you want elegant clear acrylic makeup or anything storage.</li>
            <li>But, the pricetag was much too rich for my taste.  </li>
            <li>So at $160 bucks - which I am not saying is cheap - but compared to $300 &amp; free 2nd day shipping, I went for it...</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well and shipped rather quickly</li>
            <li>It looks very high end and is very well made!!</li>
            <li>The makeup organizer is very well made and exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>I personally like the knobs, they are a cute touch.</li>
            <li>Thanks!    </li>
            <li>Overall I love the concept and the design.  </li>
            <li>at first I was like....</li>
            <li>I also decided that most likely (as I had noticed in the Kdash clips)</li>
            <li>so really what&#x27;s the point of having this lid?!</li>
            <li>As far as the depth of the drawers you can fit just about anything in them.</li>
            <li>It stores most of my makeup, although I do plan on purchasing another to spread out my collection, and make room for future purchases.</li>
            <li>Having considered purchasing the original Clear Cube I stumbled upon this one.  </li>
            <li>I began looking into makeup organization solutions on the internet when I came across a blog that introduced me to the Clear Cube, and I, like so many other girls, became fixated on the idea of finding myself one at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>For the amount of money we have spent I hope that the new makeup organizer will be better packaged cracked &amp; scratch free.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend buying this, it is high quality and easy to assemble!</li>
            <li>The drawers have to go in certain ways otherwise</li>
            <li>I have some acrylic organizers for my lipsticks and an acrylic file organizer where I house my large palettes; they are matched quite well.</li>
            <li>The top of the cube is open so you can stack bottles and other things on top without having the lid propped open and the drawer pulls are a nice decorative feature, although I did not care for the ones it came with and purchased different ones at Home Depot.  </li>
            <li>am way late to the party &amp; only became aware of Kdash clear cube this year while searching for the perfect makeup holder for my ever expanding collection.</li>
            <li>&quot; Nothing I saw b4 was large enough to fit all that I had accumulated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I was even more excited about was the price, half of what a Clear Cube cost.</li>
            <li>and now I have an amazing makeup organizer big enough to hold my collection.</li>
            <li>Another thanks.    </li>
            <li>I would love to re-order, only if all drawers open and close with ease and success.   </li>
            <li>I really want to purchase another, but scared that I will get another damaged one.</li>
            <li>This item came very well packed</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;gem\\&quot; like knobs on the organizer really jazz it</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take up too much space on my bathroom counter, and it holds all of my makeup with plenty of space to spare.  </li>
            <li>It holds do much and it&#x27;s very durable.</li>
            <li>I chose this one as opposed to some of the other pricier ones because of the decorative knobs and the space on top for storage.</li>
            <li>(I was not interested in the flip top)</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>so I could use the above acrylic drawers for my special occasion makeup and face products.  </li>
            <li>I was able to open the bottom drawer just enough to attach the pull.  </li>
            <li>This organizer is big so make sure you have space on your counter for it as it definitely takes up</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I am not mad at the weight, as it seems to be of high quality and made to last.  </li>
            <li>I have my makup brushes &amp; mirror on top - which btw is like a little cubby - it has a lip all the way around it.</li>
            <li>I have my makup brushes &amp; mirror on top - which btw is like a little cubby - it has a lip all the way around it.</li>
            <li>The cube had the drawers already in place, only the knobs required assembly, which were easy enough to emplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just think for the price the drawers should open and close properly and they shoudl ship it with parts that actually fit.</li>
            <li>If, and only if, new ones come in before a certain date, I can order a new one and still get a refund.</li>
            <li>I had to go out and buy new ones on my own, which wouldnt have been a problem except they are metric sizing so it was very difficult to find screws that fit.</li>
            <li>On the original clear cube the fliptop would have been useless for me since I knew I wanted to store nail polish/bottles on top</li>
            <li>I ordered a nearly identical makeup box from another seller and it arrived broken, luckily it was an easy return.</li>
            <li>Everything is easily accessible, and cuts down my time in front of the vanity.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the clips from the show revealing the clear clube...</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to get a Clear Cube ever since I saw it on an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.</li>
            <li>After searching for a clear cube for weeks I stumbled upon this Gem.</li>
            <li>I get pretty long winded - but felt my research might be helpful to others..</li>
            <li>so I was surprised when I opened it up, to find some cracks on the side of one of the drawers.  </li>
            <li>You must have ordered direct from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The cube was packaged very well, being wrapped in foam and tape and double boxed.</li>
            <li>So like everyone else I was completely enticed by the Kardashian Clear Cube.  </li>
            <li>Although it is expensive it is NOT nearly expensive as the original clear cube and its the almost exact thing.</li>
            <li>Really sturdy &amp; very well made, came extremely well packaged &amp; in 2 days as promised.</li>
            <li>I was surprised upon opening the package that it was in such a small box and wasn&#x27;t better protected.</li>
            <li>&quot; I purchased this makeup organizer for my daughter&#x27;s high school graduation present.</li>
            <li>This particular acrylic organizer is considerably priced a lot less if you search around and notice most acrylic cube organizers are currently for sale at an average of $300-$400 (not including shipping/tax) if you also consider the sizing of the product (12 x 12 x 15 tall,</li>
            <li>I feared ordering one and having it delivered and finding that it was poorly made, with low grade acrylic, that would become cracked or discolored as many of the online sellers had a no return policy!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Since Laurie had written last August 2011 on this forum (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NK94GVO2NPL8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R1NK94GVO2NPL8) to say that she would send out a couple of new drawers to a customer who had a too-tight drawer, and others said that she was responsive, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to order.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an annoying little sound when you pull the drawers out, but I got over that after I saw how cute my makeup fit in it.  </li>
            <li>(same dimensions, clear)</li>
            <li>It is thick and free of any defaults.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the box I noticed that every drawer on the right side was heavily cracked.</li>
            <li>I have a HUGE collection, and I&#x27;m actually considering buying a secondary unit to accomodate it all.  </li>
            <li>After a quick trip to Home Depot and a chat with a helpful employee, I found very similar diamond pulls (slightly larger) in the bathroom section of the store and a small pack of shorter screws.</li>
            <li>Also the bottom drawer had tons of scratches inside, that was not a result of poor packaging since it was on the inside of the drawer,  so this item was either never inspected or manufacturer thought it was fine as is.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this cube for about a week now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the scraping noise I hear upon opening will eventually disappear by some magic.</li>
            <li> I love the top cubby.  </li>
            <li> I had been searching for this like most gals&#x27; since i seen it on that Kardashian reality show.</li>
            <li> I love make-up and this won&#x27;t fit all my make-up!</li>
            <li> For the cost you&#x27;d think it would be more functional / better design.  </li>
            <li> on top and 2 drawers you can order</li>
            <li> The positives are my wife loved the organizer, its very nice looking, the drawers are large and appears easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this in the mail!</li>
            <li> , it is a great dupe for the kardashian clear cube</li>
            <li> What sold me was the fact that there is no flip top &amp; FREE shipping(very heavy,received in one week)</li>
            <li> The best money i ever spent!</li>
            <li> You just have to screw in the diamond drawer pulls - easy.</li>
            <li> You just have to screw in the diamond drawer pulls - easy.</li>
            <li> I had been going back and forth for weeks about buying this makeup cube...its pricey but its beautiful.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a beautiful way to display your makeup</li>
            <li> And they are really very pretty!</li>
            <li> And they are really very pretty!</li>
            <li> Huge crack in the bottom drawer.</li>
            <li> Such great quality and can fit tons of makeup.</li>
            <li> that wouldn&#x27;t fit w</li>
            <li> I purchased via Amazon Prime, so I received the cube in two days with free shipping.</li>
            <li> i am a makeup \\&quot;whore\\&quot; and have a ton of makeup so all the drawers are filled.</li>
            <li> and once I filled it with my makeup</li>
            <li> short, this was definitely a great buy for me.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about my make up organizer coming in the mail only to unwrap it from the great packaging to find a crack in the acrylic on the bottom.</li>
            <li> This box has a very elegant look to it and overall I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Holds all of my makeup and is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Thank u so much! :)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> When I found this alternative I was so excited.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this piece if you are looking for a dupe of the Kdash clear cube - or just a great place to store makeup!</li>
            <li> It keeps all my makeup clean and dust free, and it&#x27;s very pretty to look at with the diamond pulls.  </li>
            <li> I even debated keeping it because it would be hard to see the crack, but for the price I felt like it should have been perfect</li>
            <li> I love it but really wish i bought the 24 inch one...</li>
            <li> There are many places on the internet selling these acrylic makeup organizers, and I found price points that ranged anywhere from $120 to $300, but surprisingly found little feedback from any of the consumers that have purchased and used these products.</li>
            <li> I use it to hold all of my fragrances and quick reach items.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty though.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cube to anyone who is willing to make the investment!</li>
            <li> I was excited about receiving this and the first box arrived cracked at the side along where the drawers inserted in.  </li>
            <li> Each drawer, as stated, is 2 1/2 inches deep - you can easily stack say 4 Mac sized 16 pan eye shad pallets on top of one another &amp; have have two stacks of 4 ea. -</li>
            <li> Each drawer, as stated, is 2 1/2 inches deep - you can easily stack say 4 Mac sized 16 pan eye shad pallets on top of one another &amp; have have two stacks of 4 ea. -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I decided to order this item and have no regrets that I chose this one over some of the other options in my price range.</li>
            <li> Makeup looks so clean, pretty and organized.</li>
            <li> It look great and takes up little space.</li>
            <li> I would wind up keeping the lid open to fit things on top</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this piece if you are looking for a dupe of the Kdash clear cube - or just a great place to store makeup!ckaged &amp; in 2 days as promised.</li>
            <li> So, check out both if you want elegant clear acrylic makeup or anything storage.</li>
            <li> But, the pricetag was much too rich for my taste.  </li>
            <li> So at $160 bucks - which I am not saying is cheap - but compared to $300 &amp; free 2nd day shipping, I went for it...</li>
            <li> It was packaged very well and shipped rather quickly</li>
            <li> It looks very high end and is very well made!!</li>
            <li> The makeup organizer is very well made and exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> I personally like the knobs, they are a cute touch.</li>
            <li> Thanks!    </li>
            <li> Overall I love the concept and the design.  </li>
            <li> at first I was like....</li>
            <li> I also decided that most likely (as I had noticed in the Kdash clips)</li>
            <li> so really what&#x27;s the point of having this lid?!</li>
            <li> As far as the depth of the drawers you can fit just about anything in them.</li>
            <li> It stores most of my makeup, although I do plan on purchasing another to spread out my collection, and make room for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Having considered purchasing the original Clear Cube I stumbled upon this one.  </li>
            <li> I began looking into makeup organization solutions on the internet when I came across a blog that introduced me to the Clear Cube, and I, like so many other girls, became fixated on the idea of finding myself one at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money we have spent I hope that the new makeup organizer will be better packaged cracked &amp; scratch free.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend buying this, it is high quality and easy to assemble!</li>
            <li> The drawers have to go in certain ways otherwise</li>
            <li> I have some acrylic organizers for my lipsticks and an acrylic file organizer where I house my large palettes; they are matched quite well.</li>
            <li> The top of the cube is open so you can stack bottles and other things on top without having the lid propped open and the drawer pulls are a nice decorative feature, although I did not care for the ones it came with and purchased different ones at Home Depot.  </li>
            <li> am way late to the party &amp; only became aware of Kdash clear cube this year while searching for the perfect makeup holder for my ever expanding collection.</li>
            <li> &quot; Nothing I saw b4 was large enough to fit all that I had accumulated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I was even more excited about was the price, half of what a Clear Cube cost.</li>
            <li> and now I have an amazing makeup organizer big enough to hold my collection.</li>
            <li> Another thanks.    </li>
            <li> I would love to re-order, only if all drawers open and close with ease and success.   </li>
            <li> I really want to purchase another, but scared that I will get another damaged one.</li>
            <li> This item came very well packed</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;gem\\&quot; like knobs on the organizer really jazz it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take up too much space on my bathroom counter, and it holds all of my makeup with plenty of space to spare.  </li>
            <li> It holds do much and it&#x27;s very durable.</li>
            <li> I chose this one as opposed to some of the other pricier ones because of the decorative knobs and the space on top for storage.</li>
            <li> (I was not interested in the flip top)</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> so I could use the above acrylic drawers for my special occasion makeup and face products.  </li>
            <li> I was able to open the bottom drawer just enough to attach the pull.  </li>
            <li> This organizer is big so make sure you have space on your counter for it as it definitely takes up</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I am not mad at the weight, as it seems to be of high quality and made to last.  </li>
            <li> I have my makup brushes &amp; mirror on top - which btw is like a little cubby - it has a lip all the way around it.</li>
            <li> I have my makup brushes &amp; mirror on top - which btw is like a little cubby - it has a lip all the way around it.</li>
            <li> The cube had the drawers already in place, only the knobs required assembly, which were easy enough to emplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just think for the price the drawers should open and close properly and they shoudl ship it with parts that actually fit.</li>
            <li> If, and only if, new ones come in before a certain date, I can order a new one and still get a refund.</li>
            <li> I had to go out and buy new ones on my own, which wouldnt have been a problem except they are metric sizing so it was very difficult to find screws that fit.</li>
            <li> On the original clear cube the fliptop would have been useless for me since I knew I wanted to store nail polish/bottles on top</li>
            <li> I ordered a nearly identical makeup box from another seller and it arrived broken, luckily it was an easy return.</li>
            <li> Everything is easily accessible, and cuts down my time in front of the vanity.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the clips from the show revealing the clear clube...</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get a Clear Cube ever since I saw it on an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.</li>
            <li> After searching for a clear cube for weeks I stumbled upon this Gem.</li>
            <li> I get pretty long winded - but felt my research might be helpful to others..</li>
            <li> so I was surprised when I opened it up, to find some cracks on the side of one of the drawers.  </li>
            <li> You must have ordered direct from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The cube was packaged very well, being wrapped in foam and tape and double boxed.</li>
            <li> So like everyone else I was completely enticed by the Kardashian Clear Cube.  </li>
            <li> Although it is expensive it is NOT nearly expensive as the original clear cube and its the almost exact thing.</li>
            <li> Really sturdy &amp; very well made, came extremely well packaged &amp; in 2 days as promised.</li>
            <li> I was surprised upon opening the package that it was in such a small box and wasn&#x27;t better protected.</li>
            <li> &quot; I purchased this makeup organizer for my daughter&#x27;s high school graduation present.</li>
            <li> This particular acrylic organizer is considerably priced a lot less if you search around and notice most acrylic cube organizers are currently for sale at an average of $300-$400 (not including shipping/tax) if you also consider the sizing of the product (12 x 12 x 15 tall,</li>
            <li> I feared ordering one and having it delivered and finding that it was poorly made, with low grade acrylic, that would become cracked or discolored as many of the online sellers had a no return policy!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Since Laurie had written last August 2011 on this forum (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NK94GVO2NPL8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R1NK94GVO2NPL8) to say that she would send out a couple of new drawers to a customer who had a too-tight drawer, and others said that she was responsive, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to order.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an annoying little sound when you pull the drawers out, but I got over that after I saw how cute my makeup fit in it.  </li>
            <li> (same dimensions, clear)</li>
            <li> It is thick and free of any defaults.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box I noticed that every drawer on the right side was heavily cracked.</li>
            <li> I have a HUGE collection, and I&#x27;m actually considering buying a secondary unit to accomodate it all.  </li>
            <li> After a quick trip to Home Depot and a chat with a helpful employee, I found very similar diamond pulls (slightly larger) in the bathroom section of the store and a small pack of shorter screws.</li>
            <li> Also the bottom drawer had tons of scratches inside, that was not a result of poor packaging since it was on the inside of the drawer,  so this item was either never inspected or manufacturer thought it was fine as is.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep this because as mentioned before it is almost half the price of the Clear Cube</li>
            <li> I managed to pull it open only half way, and now it is not going back in.  </li>
            <li> The price of this box is almost half of what the Clear Cube costs (I paid less than $6 shipping and received it the very next day after ordering).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers complain of the same sort of defects.  </li>
            <li> I do wish that the company would make insertable dividers, as all those I&#x27;ve seen are slightly too large or not nice enough to compliment the cube.</li>
            <li> but for a professional, too small with no individual compartments for smaller stuff like scissors, etc.. AND while i pull the levels out they are stiff and i have to wiggle it side to side to pry it out.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time debating the purchase of this item due to the price, and I finally took the plunge and ordered it.</li>
            <li> and it came in one piece, however, none of the screws would fit into the diamond pulls, which was a bit disappointing considering the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> /the lid closed -</li>
            <li> so I ordered several of those for my lipsticks and nail products and my everyday makeup</li>
            <li> What does that mean \\&quot;you must have ordered direct from Amazon.\\</li>
            <li> As for the actual product,  It is heavy!  </li>
            <li> Just like the other folks here who she responded to.</li>
            <li> In the morning (just about 20 minutes ago) when I began transferring my items, I found the bottom drawer extremely hard to open!  </li>
            <li> In fact you have to pull so hard that the handle actually pulled off / fell apart.  </li>
            <li> Also the screws they shipped with the product were the wrong size, not long enough to go through the drawer and connect into the handle.  </li>
            <li> that seriously arrived the very next day!!</li>
            <li> They give a little sparkle to the piece.</li>
            <li> They give a little sparkle to the piece.</li>
            <li> Also, the drawers are a little noisy.</li>
            <li> I was a little taken by the weight of it</li>
            <li> I also looked into the seller and found that their business is making acrylic and plastic products and figured they knew what they were doing as opposed to several of the other sellers who offered it at a lower price but had questionable websites that sell anything from skin care products to belt buckles (no joke).     </li>
            <li> There was a slight imperfection on the face of one of the drawers and a crack in the back of the bottom drawer near the base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see in the photos but the rings behind the pulls are gold so if that does not go with your decor, you may want to purchase different ones as I did.  </li>
            <li> The bottom of the organizer has small rubber feet</li>
            <li> When I began screwing in the drawer pulls, I found that the bottom drawer was quite difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> the lowest level is a bizzz to try and pull out, it is VERY stiff and stuck.</li>
            <li> Plus the Muji drawers were a bit shallow.</li>
            <li> the 4th level to the bottom is also stiff and difficult to pull out.</li>
            <li> Also as other reviewers have stated, while the drawers slide in and out with ease, they do make a squeaking noise and there is also an unpleasant acrylic smell to the box</li>
            <li> Received it broken and cracked and had to return it.</li>
            <li> , that arrived in even WORSE condition and it was not double-boxed.  </li>
            <li> I believe this to be a result of poor packaging.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I din&#x27;t review this when I bought it.</li>
            <li> Also it made weird squeaking noises.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> some will be difficult to pull in and out</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Sadly, I din&#x27;t review this when I bought it. It is absolutely beautiful and the seller was awesome! Perfect order</li>
            <li> This particular acrylic organizer is considerably priced a lot less if you search around and notice most acrylic cube organizers are currently for sale at an average of $300-$400 (not including shipping/tax) if you also consider the sizing of the product (12 x 12 x 15 tall, 2 1/2 deep.) When I received my organizer it was in perfect condition. Looks of good quality and is quite sturdy. Did not have any issues with pulling out the drawers. Looks great on my counter, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the fact that it does not have a lid which was a deciding factor for me when making the purchase. I personally like the knobs, they are a cute touch. The knobs can easily be switched out if you buy your own from any store as they are removable and replaceable. The bottom of the organizer has small rubber feet so there&#x27;s no scratches on the plastic. Overall, I did not see what improvements were needed for the price and the roomy size. If I need another, I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I placed an order for the Acrylic Makeup Organizer on August 1st and received it at my door the next evening.  I was impressed on how fast the order had been fulfilled and shipped!  Thanks!    When I opened the package, I was also pleased to see that it was packaged well.  I was not expecting the size of the box it shipped in and also the smaller box that was inside (housing the actual product).  Very nicely packaged for protection.  Another thanks.    As for the actual product,  It is heavy!  I am not mad at the weight, as it seems to be of high quality and made to last.  The pulls are a nice detail as well.  Overall I love the concept and the design.  Easy construction too!      Now for the downfall.  When I began screwing in the drawer pulls, I found that the bottom drawer was quite difficult to open.  I was able to open the bottom drawer just enough to attach the pull.  In the morning (just about 20 minutes ago) when I began transferring my items, I found the bottom drawer extremely hard to open!  Also it made weird squeaking noises.  I managed to pull it open only half way, and now it is not going back in.  I do not know if it is just this organizer that this happened to, but for $180.00 and for the purpose of what the product is designed/made to do, I am not all happy.  With that said, I contacted Amazon and they sent me a return label and I am sending it back.  I contacted sourceoneorg via e-mail explaining the issue and am waiting to hear back as well.      I would love to re-order, only if all drawers open and close with ease and success.   It really is a nice product!  I do recommend for a stylish, well-made (for the most part) organizer.      Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about my make up organizer coming in the mail only to unwrap it from the great packaging to find a crack in the acrylic on the bottom. I even debated keeping it because it would be hard to see the crack, but for the price I felt like it should have been perfect, so I sent it back. I really want to purchase another, but scared that I will get another damaged one. It is very pretty though. I&#x27;m sad I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> Just like so many of you makeup fanatics out there.. I was on the prowl for the now famous/infamous \\&quot;Kardashian Makeup Cube.\\&quot; Nothing I saw b4 was large enough to fit all that I had accumulated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**WARNING** You can skip this part - I get pretty long winded - but felt my research might be helpful to others..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am way late to the party &amp; only became aware of Kdash clear cube this year while searching for the perfect makeup holder for my ever expanding collection. When I saw the clips from the show revealing the clear clube...I went through the AAAHHHh that is the coolest thing I ever saw for makeup storage!!...had never seen or woulda thought of such a thing. Followed by the \\&quot;you have got to be kidding me!!\\&quot; once I looked it up and saw the price. Never knew acrylic was so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read about Muji - but every time I checked out the Muji site they were sold out. Plus the Muji drawers were a bit shallow. Went to ebay, checked out what they had - some possibilities - they seemed to have lots of choices of the same Kdash cube &amp; offered different configurations of it. But I was unsure of some of the sellers. though I actually did see some of the same sellers here on Amazon - but not a lot of feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I saw this one.... at first I was like....the drawer pulls are different and there is no lid. But I kept coming back to it. Mostly bcse it was the same size as the Kdash one - 12x12x15 - and it was offered by Sourceone but through Amazon - which gave me confidence in the seller - w/free 2nd day delivery through Amazon Prime. I also decided that most likely (as I had noticed in the Kdash clips) I would wind up keeping the lid open to fit things on top that wouldn&#x27;t fit w/the lid closed - so really what&#x27;s the point of having this lid?! So at $160 bucks - which I am not saying is cheap - but compared to $300 &amp; free 2nd day shipping, I went for it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**actual review**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this Makeup organizer!! Really sturdy &amp; very well made, came extremely well packaged &amp; in 2 days as promised. You just have to screw in the diamond drawer pulls - easy. And they are really very pretty! They give a little sparkle to the piece. Each drawer, as stated, is 2 1/2 inches deep - you can easily stack say 4 Mac sized 16 pan eye shad pallets on top of one another &amp; have have two stacks of 4 ea. - so 8 pallets in one drawer. Everything I have fits perfectly - w/some room to spare. I have my makup brushes &amp; mirror on top - which btw is like a little cubby - it has a lip all the way around it. I would definitely recommend this piece if you are looking for a dupe of the Kdash clear cube - or just a great place to store makeup!ckaged &amp; in 2 days as promised.

            <li> I love it! Holds all of my makeup and is well worth the price! It was packaged very well and shipped rather quickly, it is a great dupe for the kardashian clear cube and i couldnt be happier! The best money i ever spent! Thank u so much! :)</li>
            <li> This item came very well packed so I was surprised when I opened it up, to find some cracks on the side of one of the drawers.  Since I couldn&#x27;t feel the crack, it appeared that it didn&#x27;t go all the way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered returning this, but to repack and pay for shipping again, I decided I didn&#x27;t want to be bothered.  I love the organizer and the crack doesn&#x27;t even show up as it&#x27;s against the wall on my counter.  The \\&quot;gem\\&quot; like knobs on the organizer really jazz it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it were any more damaged, I would indeed, have returned it.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time debating the purchase of this item due to the price, and I finally took the plunge and ordered it. I began looking into makeup organization solutions on the internet when I came across a blog that introduced me to the Clear Cube, and I, like so many other girls, became fixated on the idea of finding myself one at a more reasonable price. There are many places on the internet selling these acrylic makeup organizers, and I found price points that ranged anywhere from $120 to $300, but surprisingly found little feedback from any of the consumers that have purchased and used these products. I feared ordering one and having it delivered and finding that it was poorly made, with low grade acrylic, that would become cracked or discolored as many of the online sellers had a no return policy! So after weeks of research I decided to purchase this item through Amazon (who has GREAT customer service) from a seller that was willing to take returns if I had a problem with the item after receiving it. I also looked into the seller and found that their business is making acrylic and plastic products and figured they knew what they were doing as opposed to several of the other sellers who offered it at a lower price but had questionable websites that sell anything from skin care products to belt buckles (no joke).     The makeup organizer is very well made and exactly what I was hoping for! I&#x27;m very happy that I decided to order this item and have no regrets that I chose this one over some of the other options in my price range. This organizer is big so make sure you have space on your counter for it as it definitely takes up it&#x27;s fair share of space- but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews and the responses from Laurie Hamilton, who says she is the \\&quot;manufacturer,\\&quot; I purchased this makeup organizer for my daughter&#x27;s high school graduation present. It would have been perfect, if not for the cracked drawer. Huge crack in the bottom drawer. Since Laurie had written last August 2011 on this forum (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NK94GVO2NPL8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R1NK94GVO2NPL8) to say that she would send out a couple of new drawers to a customer who had a too-tight drawer, and others said that she was responsive, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to order. However, when I wrote to her, this was her response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been out of those boxes for months.  You must have ordered direct from Amazon.  Please contact them &amp; let them know about the drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurie&lt;br /&gt;SourceOne\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huh? What does that mean \\&quot;you must have ordered direct from Amazon.\\&quot; Of course I did. Just like the other folks here who she responded to. Anyhow, I did contact Amazon and they said there&#x27;s nothing I can do except return the entire box for a refund. If, and only if, new ones come in before a certain date, I can order a new one and still get a refund. Sigh.</li>
            <li> Received it broken and cracked and had to return it. The amount of damage to it made me nervous about repurchasing so I went with a different product I could find at a local store.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get a Clear Cube ever since I saw it on an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. When I found this alternative I was so excited. What I was even more excited about was the price, half of what a Clear Cube cost. I am no expert on acrylic but it is great quality. It is thick and free of any defaults. It has five drawers and a \\&quot;cubby\\&quot; on the top so to can place things on top without worrying that they will get knocked off. As far as the depth of the drawers you can fit just about anything in them. All in all I could not ask for anything more. It is perfect.</li>
            <li> I get so many &amp;#34;where did you buy that questions,&amp;#34; and I love it! It is the best organizer and every girl should own one or two!!!</li>
            <li> After searching for a clear cube for weeks I stumbled upon this Gem. What sold me was the fact that there is no flip top &amp; FREE shipping(very heavy,received in one week) Although it is expensive it is NOT nearly expensive as the original clear cube and its the almost exact thing. (same dimensions, clear) On the original clear cube the fliptop would have been useless for me since I knew I wanted to store nail polish/bottles on top so this acrylic organizer was perfect. The box is absolutly beautiful! Comes put together except for the knobs. Its airtight (makes wind noise when I open and close drawers) but Im thinking over time it will subside. The drawers have to go in certain ways otherwise some will be difficult to pull in and out but once you have it in correctly it opens with ease. I should mention though that one of the drawer pulls broke on me but I contacted the Seller and they sent out a replacement (actually a couple of them) that seriously arrived the very next day!! This makeup box holds an enormous amount of products. Makeup looks so clean, pretty and organized. I will try to put a picture up. So happy  with purchase and great customer service. Would make an excellent present for girlfriend, mom, wife, sister,....you get the picture.</li>
            <li> I purchased this organizer after searching for one on the internet for about a month. I chose this one as opposed to some of the other pricier ones because of the decorative knobs and the space on top for storage. (I was not interested in the flip top) I purchased via Amazon Prime, so I received the cube in two days with free shipping. The cube was packaged very well, being wrapped in foam and tape and double boxed. After taking some time to carefully open the package, I discovered the cube arrived in tact, without cracks or chips. The cube had the drawers already in place, only the knobs required assembly, which were easy enough to emplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this cube for about a week now, and I love it. It stores most of my makeup, although I do plan on purchasing another to spread out my collection, and make room for future purchases. I do wish that the company would make insertable dividers, as all those I&#x27;ve seen are slightly too large or not nice enough to compliment the cube. Also, the drawers are a little noisy. I&#x27;m hoping the scraping noise I hear upon opening will eventually disappear by some magic. Other than that I&#x27;m pleased. I have some acrylic organizers for my lipsticks and an acrylic file organizer where I house my large palettes; they are matched quite well. I would recommend this cube to anyone who is willing to make the investment!</li>
            <li> This makeup organizer is perfect.  It didn&#x27;t take up too much space on my bathroom counter, and it holds all of my makeup with plenty of space to spare.  I love the top cubby.  I use it to hold all of my fragrances and quick reach items.</li>
            <li> I ordered a nearly identical makeup box from another seller and it arrived broken, luckily it was an easy return. I decided to order this organizer instead and it came in one piece, however, none of the screws would fit into the diamond pulls, which was a bit disappointing considering the cost of the product. After a quick trip to Home Depot and a chat with a helpful employee, I found very similar diamond pulls (slightly larger) in the bathroom section of the store and a small pack of shorter screws. The replacement pulls and screws worked perfect and now I have an amazing makeup organizer big enough to hold my collection.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this in the mail! I had been searching for this like most gals&#x27; since i seen it on that Kardashian reality show. I love make-up and this won&#x27;t fit all my make-up! I love it but really wish i bought the 24 inch one... so if you have A LOT of make-up like me! this is nice as a starter. but for a professional, too small with no individual compartments for smaller stuff like scissors, etc.. AND while i pull the levels out they are stiff and i have to wiggle it side to side to pry it out. but so far the knob seems sturdy and assembly was easy!!!!! no tools required!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2/5/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE knob broke off one one of the levels. the lowest level is a bizzz to try and pull out, it is VERY stiff and stuck. the 4th level to the bottom is also stiff and difficult to pull out.</li>
            <li> I had been going back and forth for weeks about buying this makeup cube...its pricey but its beautiful. It arrived within days and it is even more beautiful in person. I LOVE IT! i am a makeup \\&quot;whore\\&quot; and have a ton of makeup so all the drawers are filled. I would definitely recommend buying this, it is high quality and easy to assemble!</li>
            <li> I hope this review may assist someone is making a decision on purchasing this product.  Having considered purchasing the original Clear Cube I stumbled upon this one.  The price of this box is almost half of what the Clear Cube costs (I paid less than $6 shipping and received it the very next day after ordering).  The top of the cube is open so you can stack bottles and other things on top without having the lid propped open and the drawer pulls are a nice decorative feature, although I did not care for the ones it came with and purchased different ones at Home Depot.  It&#x27;s hard to see in the photos but the rings behind the pulls are gold so if that does not go with your decor, you may want to purchase different ones as I did.  This box has a very elegant look to it and overall I am pleased with it.  Here are the reasons I only gave it 4 stars:  There was a slight imperfection on the face of one of the drawers and a crack in the back of the bottom drawer near the base. I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers complain of the same sort of defects.  I decided to keep this because as mentioned before it is almost half the price of the Clear Cube and once I filled it with my makeup the crack is not visible.  Also as other reviewers have stated, while the drawers slide in and out with ease, they do make a squeaking noise and there is also an unpleasant acrylic smell to the box but I think that will dissipate with time.  Overall, this is a beautiful way to display your makeup and I&#x27;m happy that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> For the cost you&#x27;d think it would be more functional / better design.  One of the drawers doesnt pull out or close very easily. In fact you have to pull so hard that the handle actually pulled off / fell apart.  I have to leave the drawer slightly open at all times so I can get it open.  Also the screws they shipped with the product were the wrong size, not long enough to go through the drawer and connect into the handle.  I had to go out and buy new ones on my own, which wouldnt have been a problem except they are metric sizing so it was very difficult to find screws that fit. It does look nice and hold a lot, hence the reason for 3 stars.  I just think for the price the drawers should open and close properly and they shoudl ship it with parts that actually fit. I would NOT recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li> This makeup organizer is AMAZING!!!! It&#x27;s huge!! Such great quality and can fit tons of makeup. I am very pleased. It looks very high end and is very well made!!</li>
            <li> I was excited about receiving this and the first box arrived cracked at the side along where the drawers inserted in.  It was double boxed.  I returned to Amazon, waited again for a replacement box (technically I have to return and repurchase), that arrived in even WORSE condition and it was not double-boxed.  This time the sides were cracked as was the bottom.  Both appeared to beg units that were returned by another party and then resent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m reluctant to spend the extra money on a Sherrieblossom Icebox, but am going to do it.  If this can&#x27;t be shipped without cracking, it won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> So like everyone else I was completely enticed by the Kardashian Clear Cube.  But, the pricetag was much too rich for my taste.  I couldn&#x27;t justify spending 300 bucks on something to organize my makeup *I could buy makeup with that!  So I researched this product (and countless others).  It was absolutely perfect.  It comes to about 200, and with Amazon Prime shipping, I received it the NEXT day.  The product comes just as described.  I was a little taken by the weight of it, it&#x27;s a lot heavier than it looks.  The acrylic is not as thick as the Clear Cube, but it does it&#x27;s job very well.  There&#x27;s an annoying little sound when you pull the drawers out, but I got over that after I saw how cute my makeup fit in it.  There&#x27;s also a plastic smell that comes with it, which faded in about a week.  I have a HUGE collection, and I&#x27;m actually considering buying a secondary unit to accomodate it all.  Everything is easily accessible, and cuts down my time in front of the vanity.  I store it all on a desk in my bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this was definitely a great buy for me.  I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Loved it ! Exactly what I expected. Would buy again. Everything was as said in description. Measurements and all .</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product! It holds do much and it&#x27;s very durable. It look great and takes up little space.</li>
            <li> I purchased this makeup organizer as a birthday gift for my wife. Upon opening the box I noticed that every drawer on the right side was heavily cracked. I believe this to be a result of poor packaging. I was surprised upon opening the package that it was in such a small box and wasn&#x27;t better protected. Also the bottom drawer had tons of scratches inside, that was not a result of poor packaging since it was on the inside of the drawer,  so this item was either never inspected or manufacturer thought it was fine as is. The positives are my wife loved the organizer, its very nice looking, the drawers are large and appears easy to clean. We just returned it and ordered a second and final . For the amount of money we have spent I hope that the new makeup organizer will be better packaged cracked &amp; scratch free.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and the larger set after watching the Kardashians&#x27; on tv and seeing their acrylic makeup stored in something very similar.  I love it!  It keeps all my makeup clean and dust free, and it&#x27;s very pretty to look at with the diamond pulls.  I would highly recommend this product.  I want to order another one in fact.  Also, check out Frontgate because I also ordered several of their acrylic makeup storage holder - it has dividers for lipsticks and brushes, etc. on top and 2 drawers you can order so I ordered several of those for my lipsticks and nail products and my everyday makeup so I could use the above acrylic drawers for my special occasion makeup and face products.  I have a lot of makeup!  LOL.  So, check out both if you want elegant clear acrylic makeup or anything storage.</li>
