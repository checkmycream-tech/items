            <li> Used this product just once on my armpits. This was a week after getting them waxed and it still made my armpits break out in a horrible and painful rash. Would rate lower if I could.</li>
            <li> Great product I love it.</li>
            <li> Not working ass i expectedðŸ˜”ðŸ‘Ž</li>
            <li> I did not experience and discomfort using this product, however after using it for the time suggested on the packaging I noticed nothing different in the area I used it on.</li>
            <li> Done with bottle and I see no difference , really disappointed :( . I put on twice a day and it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month now. I&#x27;ve see a 1-2 shades lighter difference in my inner thighs. But in other parts of the body, for example elbows and butt , was no difference. Overall its a good product and will keep buying it if only for my inner thighs.</li>
            <li> I received the cream on October 6th and have been using it faithfully ever since - at least twice a day every day [sometimes more than twice when I was just home relaxing]. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen the slightest change in the sensitive region and inner thigh. I&#x27;m a light skinned hispanic &amp; the tone down there has just become a few shades darker than I&#x27;m comfortable with. It&#x27;s a shame that so far it isn&#x27;t working, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I&#x27;m going to finish this cream but I won&#x27;t be purchasing another.</li>
            <li> Is not good and I bought two used until the end of did not bleaching did not remove the blackness of the labia do not I advise use never these</li>
            <li> I received and I happy with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the gel, which I like more than the cream, (on my &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; area) for about a week and see its working!  Im about two shades lighter.  It&#x27;s important to massage the gel or cream into the skin for a minute or two. Don&#x27;t just rub on and do nothing else. Do this in the morning and before bed. Give it a minute to dry Bedford putting on clothes.</li>

            <li> I have been using it more than one month on my bikini area, but I have seen no results... I will keep using it until all gone, but I am not happy with this product. I should be seeing something by now.</li>
            <li> It sucks . I see no differnce</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work quiet as I thought it would</li>
