            <li>Got this as a gift and it came very nicely packaged and was</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Awesome packaging came with more things than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t imagine that a shampoo that didn&#x27;t make suds could clean your hair, but it does!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a night and day difference, but good to knowthe anti-frizz creme works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received compliments about how good my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>It works, and it is a good product.</li>
            <li>but my boyfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it took a good 4-5 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li>every day is a good hair day.</li>
            <li>The product is good, however I found it built up over a 2 week time period, and I needed to use my shampoo to get the heaviness out.</li>
            <li>We both tried it out during my stay and agreed it wasn&#x27;t a good product.</li>
            <li>but once I did, I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Loved the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Good purchase / good quality item /</li>
            <li>so I am a good candidate to try this product for it&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>It did not change the behavior or look of my hair but its all and all a good product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that the Fig works the best for me, but the sweet almond mint is a good backup if I&#x27;m out the the fig.</li>
            <li>a great gift - recipient said it has remarkably improved their hair and that they love it</li>
            <li>I love love love it!!!</li>
            <li>This system is great for your hair and the special gifts you receive is a great way to try before you buy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the Texture Balm yet, but I&#x27;m sure it works as great as the rest of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it makes my hair very healthy</li>
            <li>I love the wen products!</li>

            <li>Loving what it is doing to my hair.</li>

            <li>seen the advertising on TV,watcht it and ordered for my wife so she could try it out,She tried it and liked it.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>The anti-frizz gloss also makes your hair feel kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>Your scalp produces its own oil.  </li>
            <li>Would rather use cheap shampoo gave me better results!!</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because I have used every imaginable hair product on the market, and WEN Hair Care System is amazingly and by far the BEST.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product, never would have used it other wise!  </li>
            <li>NICE GIFT SET, MY GIRLS WILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Wen has a great product but didn&#x27;t get shipped the right items  ...</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this product makes it look fuller.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much for a great purchasing experience.</li>
            <li>This is okay but for the price I don&#x27;t think it lives up to all the hype.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get one item I wanted but more of others....</li>
            <li>My hair does not have more body or moisture.</li>
            <li>Definitely more body and shine.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE IT &amp; LOOKING FORWARD</li>
            <li>The time after that, even better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Wen.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>never thought I would be one of those people who paid more than $15 for hair products.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthier, shinier and more manageable than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It made  my  natraual hair feel like straw.... find that cheaper products works better...</li>
            <li>more shine, more volume and body, etc.</li>
            <li>I love the soothing gel they give you.</li>
            <li>The products are just ok.  </li>
            <li>Overpriced for what you get which is mostly the cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I find I have to wash my hair more often, which I do not want to do.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was going to make my hair in better condition</li>
            <li>Idk maybe this product will work better for somebody else but as for me</li>
            <li>I love how healthy it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li>and I love that I could get this as a 1 time deal.</li>
            <li>I love wen</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair feels and performs.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so healthy before.</li>
            <li>but I have gotten so many compliments</li>
            <li>Love this product, makes my hair silky and shiny and my scalp hasn&#x27;t felt better in years.</li>
            <li>And love the way they made my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li>and when I used to be able to run my fingers through my hair without snags I can no longer do this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel like I need to wash it more.</li>
            <li>/wavy the hair that is course and does not need to be washed as often, but I feel like I need to wash it more with this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to run my fingers through it without any snags all while it holds my curls.</li>
            <li>The product would be better but for my hair it is not.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Bleaching or dying your hair, try to keep more of the substance in your hair after taking a shower.</li>
            <li>I would pay the price if it worked better then</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love what this product did to my hair...</li>
            <li>I want to express that I love my hair, not my scalp.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Received many compliments.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes your scalp feel when cleansing your hair.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying WEN products that my co-worker recommended.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of my hair after I cleanse it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure that you use it as directed on the bottle.</li>
            <li>A dollar bottle of Pert will work better than this stuff.</li>
            <li>Quick Look: Great quality product, worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a good product and my results were also consistent with what has been advertised ...</li>
            <li>Its a good product,  Wish it explained what each product is exactly for and the benefits.  </li>
            <li>I have curly dry hair, this is the best system for my hair!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product, but it really is no better then a good shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love the product for a light weight conditioner and shampoo in one.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great and it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>also it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking any better than normal shampoos and conditioners.it smells ok and feels nice during washing</li>
            <li>not a bad deal but wanted my styling creme!</li>
            <li>Holy cow my hair looks and  feels awesome.  </li>
            <li>I DO like the almond mint scent and don&#x27;t find it strong or lingering.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but frizzy</li>
            <li>Read the fine print.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take more time to clean your hair, since there&#x27;s no bubbles to help distribute, you will dedicate up to 5 minutes (Depending on length) to work the product in your hair, and to clean your scalp.</li>
            <li>It works great on my fine, short hair.  </li>
            <li>Huge deceptive product.</li>
            <li>Your hair feels silky and smooth   after just 1 use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to trial it for three months and then decide if I&#x27;m truly a convert to sulfate free.</li>
            <li>If you have questions, please feel free to ask me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m convinced my hair definitely feels good and looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Really?!?!?!</li>
            <li>Still waiting for my purchase very upset!!!</li>
            <li>The Sweet Almond Mint Volumizing Root Lift is fantastic.</li>
            <li>so there was a significant amount of dryness.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I did order it</li>
            <li>It was always dry and fly away, and the ends looked frizzy</li>
            <li>Despite promises that the infomercial makes, it does not leave my hair feeling or looking clean.  </li>
            <li>Scalp always feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>As a stylist I was naturally weary, but after using it for myself I am in love!</li>
            <li>Love it so much I am giving them as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Products Used: Sweet Almond Mint-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true what the infomercial states, you&#x27;ll feel the difference once you massage it into your hair.</li>
            <li>, I decided to order the Wen Sweet Almond Mint hair care kit.</li>
            <li>After recovery, I thought it would be a good time to try some different products.</li>
            <li>so I can give detailed information that might help you decide if it&#x27;s worth the expense to try.</li>
            <li>After using when it is so much smoother &amp; more manageable.</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m happy with the products I received.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get all the additional products because I love new hair products.</li>
            <li>Just 2 tiny squirts of the Pomegranate Straightening Smoothing Gloss provides a healthy shine for my overwhelming amount of hair, but doesn&#x27;t look or feel oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>At least they were honest, there is NO SOLUTION to getting good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made hair more manageable even in VA, normally its frizzy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read different reviews that say WEN&#x27;s great at first, then after a month or so, not so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>It tangles easily, but the more I brushed the tangles out,</li>
            <li>am Korean, with straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>For the price I just don&#x27;t see how its worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair has not ever been so soft, silky and managable, and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my hair is when I use it.</li>
            <li>I love how soft this cleansing conditioner makes my hair.</li>
            <li>But none of them seem worth the money.</li>
            <li>At the point of receiving the package, cancel future orders on the phone and be courteous.</li>
            <li>Present for my mom she liked it</li>
            <li>and I do love the smell though it seems my hair doesn&#x27;t stay as clean as with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>It took some time to get the right amount to use on my hair length</li>
            <li>It was sent right away</li>
            <li>Has alcohol and a lot of ingredients that may not be right for you.</li>
            <li>Sweet Almond Mint styling cream provides great hold and manageability without being sticky or stiff, and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel great, and it has a pleasing but not overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>- the results were adequate but I also tried RenPure brand and was much happier with it.</li>
            <li>When I brushed my hair more hair was coming out than ;normal and I had more breakage than normal.</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and have fine hair and Wen makes my hair look fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shine was the same, my hair is fairly  healthy to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will know better next time and not make those types of product purchases from amazon .</li>
            <li>Like it better than regular shampoo</li>
            <li>Several coworkers use it and love it.</li>
            <li>The texture of my hair changed from soft and smooth to a wooly, brittle, frizzy, and wiry texture.  </li>
            <li>So the first time I used it, I followed ALL the directions and recommendations that come with each product.</li>
            <li>Since the first time use, I&#x27;ve modified the amount to 12 pumps the first shampoo</li>
            <li>I thought it would make my hair more manageable and my curly, coarse hair remained unchanged.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t care for this product at all.</li>
            <li>(at first I just thought it was a holiday delay on billing me), but had no idea that it was because I was signed up for a monthly shampoo shipment.</li>
            <li>but I had never received beyond the initial order I gifted to my Mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service</li>
            <li>I used to get really frizzy, but the Wen took away the frizzies!</li>
            <li>Its been over a month, and I still have more product left.</li>
            <li>I really like the products!</li>
            <li>would like to than Ginger Lily Boutique for their timely response with my order and for contacting me in response to all my questions I will be ordering more Wen products from Ginger Lily in the future.</li>
            <li>I love the anti frizz gel also as part of my daily hair care.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is short I do not use so much and can make my supply last and happy with the price.</li>
            <li>After first use of the product people immediately noticed a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Check ingredients first to see if this is the wen you want.</li>
            <li>; I told her that I had ordered Wen because I watched the TV commercials, and it implied that Wen was much more gentle than regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>(more if you have long hair - which I do).  </li>
            <li>but the little used proved successful so far</li>
            <li>The kit contained all the products pictured here: Sweet Almond Mint Conditioner (12 oz.), Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment (2 oz.), Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cream (2 oz.), Sweet Mint Texture Balm (.35 oz.), and a black wide-tooth</li>
            <li>send the product back for a full refund since I was still within my 60 days!</li>
            <li>I enjoy having it long because I love a good up-do, but wearing it down has really never been an option.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I might straighten my hair for special occasions, but with the product smoothing my hair, I most likely will discontinue straightening.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a single mom living on one income, so every penny is precious.</li>
            <li>I certainly would never recommend it.</li>
            <li>Purchased from the Wen site with a pretty decent promo&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>she told me the shampoo does not really produce foam when you wash your hair and the product itself is really not all that great</li>
            <li>I color my hair and wanted to see if this shampoo really keeps the color from fading so fast and it really does work.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Im very upset that it can not be returned as the product paper work claims a 60 day guarantee.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>i really like wen</li>
            <li>I really dont like the pomegranate smell .</li>
            <li>So I finally got around to trying a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>Hair is much softer and doesn&#x27;t seem as frayed when flare ironing</li>
            <li>be very grateful if i could return the rest and get refil</li>
            <li>I really like wen</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m using wen from now thsnk you so much</li>
            <li>I figured I would splurge and buy the real thing in hopes that it would repair my hair and restore the shininess.</li>
            <li>The straightening smoothing gloss is very oily.  </li>
            <li>My color stays much longer</li>
            <li>Leaves hair without much volume</li>
            <li>What I appreciated was when I inquired about the reason for the tardiness the bender responded immediately.</li>
            <li>The condition smells good at least.</li>
            <li>I went to my stylist to see what we could do to change my hair texture and color back to its original glamorous condition.  </li>
            <li>The mask is ok tough and my hair is tangle free with it.</li>
            <li>Live Wen came very quicklu</li>
            <li>I made sure to rinse because of previous reviews.</li>
            <li>It helps hair grow, keeps it silky soft and tangle free, and while I do not personally use the gels or styling cremes, I do in the spring</li>
            <li>, Anti-Frizz Creme, Cleansing Conditioner (main product), and the Ultra Nourishing Cleansing Add-In.&lt;br /&gt;Former Shampoo/Conditioner: Joico&lt;br /&gt;Originally</li>
            <li>/&gt;First Use&lt;br /&gt;-Cleansing Conditioner (main product), Ultra Nourishing Add-in, and Anti-Frizz</li>
            <li>It smells great, and it makes my dried out hair extremely soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stopped relaxing and going back natural and this product has not disappointed</li>
            <li>this product adds volume it makes your hair soft manageable just alone without the other products it preforms well love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is maybe a little more shiny</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and sinuses, so anything with too much perfume</li>
            <li>Great concept with the kits, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not forced into autoship when you do.</li>
            <li>Two to four times as much as normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>but I think my hair looks greasier than normal</li>
            <li>The only downside I found at first was that if you have oily hair, using too much product can lead to greasy looking hair.</li>
            <li>This was not disclosed or I was not aware of the fine print.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to adjust to the fact that the shampoo would not latter up like regular shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that your hair actually feels softer and silkier while you are in the shower, but after I dry my hair it does not feel any softer or silkier or better conditioned.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was gentle on my multi-racial fine and soft hair (African American/European American).  </li>
            <li>glad I&#x27;m getting out of this mess!</li>
            <li>and there to add onto their primary, just like every other hair care type.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Where I live</li>
            <li>This took a while to get here as I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>My highlights are still a lustrous red, hair is soft and silky, less frizz, and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>had tried everything from cheap store brands to expensive salon brands, and nothing ever worked to get my hair healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li>So if you were to use this regularly, you would go through it very very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, it does make my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Your hair feel very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>The first several days using this product, I believed it would live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>Going on using them for 5 years with my natural &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; hair!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I use this every season to have strong healthy hair through the cold months.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to finally break down and purchase this product.</li>
            <li>Also, buying it online at Amazon.com is smart as you only have to order as needed and not have automatic shipping.  </li>
            <li>Unexpected benefit!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works for my hair thus far.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried Wen from Chaz Dean on the tv commercial, that is the real Wen.</li>
            <li>It is shinier and soft.</li>
            <li>EVERYTHING SHOULD BE FIXED SOON</li>
            <li>I color my hair and it doesn&#x27;t wash out the color as fast like regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair is extremely soft and after using it for 4 months my hair is&lt;br /&gt;actually growing.</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair about 3 times a week since there is so much of it</li>
            <li>My hair did indeed feel soft.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>So with WEN AND your natural oil, it makes your hair greasy.  </li>
            <li>The product is good but too expensive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s pricey, but for me, it probably equals out to what I&#x27;m used to spending for shampoo, conditioner, volumizer, the occasional serum or dry oil, etc.</li>
            <li>Anyways after the first use my hair felt really dry.</li>
            <li>Using the Wen Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner is a bit different than a traditional shampoo/condition regiment, but it&#x27;s actually easier.</li>
            <li>My hair was very dry and very very tangley.</li>
            <li>The only thing good I can say is that my hair has less frizz with this product, but that is probably only because the result is greasy, so that&#x27;s not really a plus.  </li>
            <li>The generic brands that I&#x27;ve tried in the past from Sally&#x27;s and L&#x27;Oreal do a much better job my hair feels cleaner for longer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used high end shampoos, so I&#x27;ve never had an issue with them damaging, taking away color, or otherwise taking away luster.</li>
            <li>Better than the generic forms and the sent since the last little bit longer.</li>
            <li>Long story short, the first time use left my hair softer and smoother than I&#x27;m normally used to.</li>
            <li>Mrs We Care uses this product all the time, and definitely her hair is more shining and less dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>After the first use it was ok but after the 3rd and 4th it was awful, made my hair oily, and most important not clean feeling.</li>
            <li>My hairs condition before Wen was long very thick very curly and extremely healthy since I do not any heat products on my hair.</li>
            <li>so many others I fell for that late night infomercial bologna!</li>
            <li>It has changed my hair from dull and dry to healthy looking, manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>My go-to do for work has been to either French braid it or put it in a bun because I stay so busy I don&#x27;t have time to restyle it over and over again all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WEN can only do so much when you Blow dry, bleach, dye and/or Iron your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most days now, I don&#x27;t mind getting up a little earlier to style it to wear down, because it stays styled.</li>
            <li>My ends are not all frizzy anymore, my scalp is not dry either.  </li>
            <li>Due to health complications, I wasn&#x27;t able to follow my usual hair routines for several months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a good fit for my hair.  </li>
            <li>product takes weeks to arrive, like other folks have reported, it is priority shipped to some post office where I believe it is left in the corner until they absolutely have to deal with it.</li>
            <li>I bought my first round of Wen products with a gift card I got for Christmas figuring that if it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>my other high end shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything with this product, following directions exactly, using more, using less, using it every other day, leaving it in, rinsing it out, combing it through, using hot water, using cold water . . .</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair that is, at the same time, very fine and difficult to control.</li>
            <li>It is going to take 4-6 weeks for a refund, minus shipping (which I&#x27;m sure they will charge me at least half of what I paid), but they sure quick on the draw to keep me from posting a bad review on their site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Awesome packaging came with more things than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t imagine that a shampoo that didn&#x27;t make suds could clean your hair, but it does!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a night and day difference, but good to knowthe anti-frizz creme works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received compliments about how good my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> It works, and it is a good product.</li>
            <li> but my boyfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it took a good 4-5 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> every day is a good hair day.</li>
            <li> The product is good, however I found it built up over a 2 week time period, and I needed to use my shampoo to get the heaviness out.</li>
            <li> We both tried it out during my stay and agreed it wasn&#x27;t a good product.</li>
            <li> but once I did, I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Loved the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Good purchase / good quality item /</li>
            <li> so I am a good candidate to try this product for it&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> It did not change the behavior or look of my hair but its all and all a good product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that the Fig works the best for me, but the sweet almond mint is a good backup if I&#x27;m out the the fig.</li>
            <li> a great gift - recipient said it has remarkably improved their hair and that they love it</li>
            <li> I love love love it!!!</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Texture Balm yet, but I&#x27;m sure it works as great as the rest of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> It makes your hair feel kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> The anti-frizz gloss also makes your hair feel kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> Your scalp produces its own oil.  </li>
            <li> Would rather use cheap shampoo gave me better results!!</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I have used every imaginable hair product on the market, and WEN Hair Care System is amazingly and by far the BEST.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, never would have used it other wise!  </li>
            <li> NICE GIFT SET, MY GIRLS WILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Wen has a great product but didn&#x27;t get shipped the right items  ...</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product makes it look fuller.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much for a great purchasing experience.</li>
            <li> This is okay but for the price I don&#x27;t think it lives up to all the hype.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get one item I wanted but more of others....</li>
            <li> My hair does not have more body or moisture.</li>
            <li> Definitely more body and shine.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE IT &amp; LOOKING FORWARD</li>
            <li> The time after that, even better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Wen.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> never thought I would be one of those people who paid more than $15 for hair products.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthier, shinier and more manageable than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It made  my  natraual hair feel like straw.... find that cheaper products works better...</li>
            <li> more shine, more volume and body, etc.</li>
            <li> I love the soothing gel they give you.</li>
            <li> The products are just ok.  </li>
            <li> Overpriced for what you get which is mostly the cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I find I have to wash my hair more often, which I do not want to do.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was going to make my hair in better condition</li>
            <li> Idk maybe this product will work better for somebody else but as for me</li>
            <li> I love how healthy it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> and I love that I could get this as a 1 time deal.</li>
            <li> I love wen</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels and performs.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so healthy before.</li>
            <li> but I have gotten so many compliments</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair silky and shiny and my scalp hasn&#x27;t felt better in years.</li>
            <li> And love the way they made my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> and when I used to be able to run my fingers through my hair without snags I can no longer do this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel like I need to wash it more.</li>
            <li> /wavy the hair that is course and does not need to be washed as often, but I feel like I need to wash it more with this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to run my fingers through it without any snags all while it holds my curls.</li>
            <li> The product would be better but for my hair it is not.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Bleaching or dying your hair, try to keep more of the substance in your hair after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> I would pay the price if it worked better then</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love what this product did to my hair...</li>
            <li> I want to express that I love my hair, not my scalp.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Received many compliments.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes your scalp feel when cleansing your hair.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying WEN products that my co-worker recommended.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of my hair after I cleanse it.  </li>
            <li> Make sure that you use it as directed on the bottle.</li>
            <li> A dollar bottle of Pert will work better than this stuff.</li>
            <li> Quick Look: Great quality product, worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a good product and my results were also consistent with what has been advertised ...</li>
            <li> Its a good product,  Wish it explained what each product is exactly for and the benefits.  </li>
            <li> I have curly dry hair, this is the best system for my hair!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, but it really is no better then a good shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love the product for a light weight conditioner and shampoo in one.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great and it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> also it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking any better than normal shampoos and conditioners.it smells ok and feels nice during washing</li>
            <li> not a bad deal but wanted my styling creme!</li>
            <li> Holy cow my hair looks and  feels awesome.  </li>
            <li> I DO like the almond mint scent and don&#x27;t find it strong or lingering.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but frizzy</li>
            <li> Read the fine print.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take more time to clean your hair, since there&#x27;s no bubbles to help distribute, you will dedicate up to 5 minutes (Depending on length) to work the product in your hair, and to clean your scalp.</li>
            <li> It works great on my fine, short hair.  </li>
            <li> Huge deceptive product.</li>
            <li> Your hair feels silky and smooth   after just 1 use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to trial it for three months and then decide if I&#x27;m truly a convert to sulfate free.</li>
            <li> If you have questions, please feel free to ask me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m convinced my hair definitely feels good and looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Really?!?!?!</li>
            <li> Still waiting for my purchase very upset!!!</li>
            <li> The Sweet Almond Mint Volumizing Root Lift is fantastic.</li>
            <li> so there was a significant amount of dryness.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I did order it</li>
            <li> It was always dry and fly away, and the ends looked frizzy</li>
            <li> Despite promises that the infomercial makes, it does not leave my hair feeling or looking clean.  </li>
            <li> Scalp always feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> As a stylist I was naturally weary, but after using it for myself I am in love!</li>
            <li> Love it so much I am giving them as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Products Used: Sweet Almond Mint-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true what the infomercial states, you&#x27;ll feel the difference once you massage it into your hair.</li>
            <li> , I decided to order the Wen Sweet Almond Mint hair care kit.</li>
            <li> After recovery, I thought it would be a good time to try some different products.</li>
            <li> so I can give detailed information that might help you decide if it&#x27;s worth the expense to try.</li>
            <li> After using when it is so much smoother &amp; more manageable.</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m happy with the products I received.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get all the additional products because I love new hair products.</li>
            <li> Just 2 tiny squirts of the Pomegranate Straightening Smoothing Gloss provides a healthy shine for my overwhelming amount of hair, but doesn&#x27;t look or feel oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> At least they were honest, there is NO SOLUTION to getting good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made hair more manageable even in VA, normally its frizzy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read different reviews that say WEN&#x27;s great at first, then after a month or so, not so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> It tangles easily, but the more I brushed the tangles out,</li>
            <li> am Korean, with straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> For the price I just don&#x27;t see how its worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair has not ever been so soft, silky and managable, and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my hair is when I use it.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this cleansing conditioner makes my hair.</li>
            <li> But none of them seem worth the money.</li>
            <li> At the point of receiving the package, cancel future orders on the phone and be courteous.</li>
            <li> Present for my mom she liked it</li>
            <li> and I do love the smell though it seems my hair doesn&#x27;t stay as clean as with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> It took some time to get the right amount to use on my hair length</li>
            <li> It was sent right away</li>
            <li> Has alcohol and a lot of ingredients that may not be right for you.</li>
            <li> Sweet Almond Mint styling cream provides great hold and manageability without being sticky or stiff, and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel great, and it has a pleasing but not overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> - the results were adequate but I also tried RenPure brand and was much happier with it.</li>
            <li> When I brushed my hair more hair was coming out than ;normal and I had more breakage than normal.</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and have fine hair and Wen makes my hair look fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shine was the same, my hair is fairly  healthy to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will know better next time and not make those types of product purchases from amazon .</li>
            <li> Like it better than regular shampoo</li>
            <li> Several coworkers use it and love it.</li>
            <li> The texture of my hair changed from soft and smooth to a wooly, brittle, frizzy, and wiry texture.  </li>
            <li> So the first time I used it, I followed ALL the directions and recommendations that come with each product.</li>
            <li> Since the first time use, I&#x27;ve modified the amount to 12 pumps the first shampoo</li>
            <li> I thought it would make my hair more manageable and my curly, coarse hair remained unchanged.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t care for this product at all.</li>
            <li> (at first I just thought it was a holiday delay on billing me), but had no idea that it was because I was signed up for a monthly shampoo shipment.</li>
            <li> but I had never received beyond the initial order I gifted to my Mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service</li>
            <li> I used to get really frizzy, but the Wen took away the frizzies!</li>
            <li> Its been over a month, and I still have more product left.</li>
            <li> I really like the products!</li>
            <li> would like to than Ginger Lily Boutique for their timely response with my order and for contacting me in response to all my questions I will be ordering more Wen products from Ginger Lily in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the anti frizz gel also as part of my daily hair care.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is short I do not use so much and can make my supply last and happy with the price.</li>
            <li> After first use of the product people immediately noticed a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Check ingredients first to see if this is the wen you want.</li>
            <li> ; I told her that I had ordered Wen because I watched the TV commercials, and it implied that Wen was much more gentle than regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> (more if you have long hair - which I do).  </li>
            <li> but the little used proved successful so far</li>
            <li> The kit contained all the products pictured here: Sweet Almond Mint Conditioner (12 oz.), Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment (2 oz.), Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cream (2 oz.), Sweet Mint Texture Balm (.35 oz.), and a black wide-tooth</li>
            <li> send the product back for a full refund since I was still within my 60 days!</li>
            <li> I enjoy having it long because I love a good up-do, but wearing it down has really never been an option.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I might straighten my hair for special occasions, but with the product smoothing my hair, I most likely will discontinue straightening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a single mom living on one income, so every penny is precious.</li>
            <li> I certainly would never recommend it.</li>
            <li> Purchased from the Wen site with a pretty decent promo&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> she told me the shampoo does not really produce foam when you wash your hair and the product itself is really not all that great</li>
            <li> I color my hair and wanted to see if this shampoo really keeps the color from fading so fast and it really does work.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Im very upset that it can not be returned as the product paper work claims a 60 day guarantee.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> i really like wen</li>
            <li> I really dont like the pomegranate smell .</li>
            <li> So I finally got around to trying a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> Hair is much softer and doesn&#x27;t seem as frayed when flare ironing</li>
            <li> be very grateful if i could return the rest and get refil</li>
            <li> I really like wen</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m using wen from now thsnk you so much</li>
            <li> I figured I would splurge and buy the real thing in hopes that it would repair my hair and restore the shininess.</li>
            <li> The straightening smoothing gloss is very oily.  </li>
            <li> My color stays much longer</li>
            <li> Leaves hair without much volume</li>
            <li> What I appreciated was when I inquired about the reason for the tardiness the bender responded immediately.</li>
            <li> The condition smells good at least.</li>
            <li> I went to my stylist to see what we could do to change my hair texture and color back to its original glamorous condition.  </li>
            <li> The mask is ok tough and my hair is tangle free with it.</li>
            <li> Live Wen came very quicklu</li>
            <li> I made sure to rinse because of previous reviews.</li>
            <li> It helps hair grow, keeps it silky soft and tangle free, and while I do not personally use the gels or styling cremes, I do in the spring</li>
            <li> , Anti-Frizz Creme, Cleansing Conditioner (main product), and the Ultra Nourishing Cleansing Add-In.&lt;br /&gt;Former Shampoo/Conditioner: Joico&lt;br /&gt;Originally</li>
            <li> /&gt;First Use&lt;br /&gt;-Cleansing Conditioner (main product), Ultra Nourishing Add-in, and Anti-Frizz</li>
            <li> It smells great, and it makes my dried out hair extremely soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stopped relaxing and going back natural and this product has not disappointed</li>
            <li> this product adds volume it makes your hair soft manageable just alone without the other products it preforms well love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is maybe a little more shiny</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and sinuses, so anything with too much perfume</li>
            <li> Great concept with the kits, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not forced into autoship when you do.</li>
            <li> Two to four times as much as normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I think my hair looks greasier than normal</li>
            <li> The only downside I found at first was that if you have oily hair, using too much product can lead to greasy looking hair.</li>
            <li> This was not disclosed or I was not aware of the fine print.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to adjust to the fact that the shampoo would not latter up like regular shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that your hair actually feels softer and silkier while you are in the shower, but after I dry my hair it does not feel any softer or silkier or better conditioned.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was gentle on my multi-racial fine and soft hair (African American/European American).  </li>
            <li> glad I&#x27;m getting out of this mess!</li>
            <li> and there to add onto their primary, just like every other hair care type.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Where I live</li>
            <li> This took a while to get here as I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> My highlights are still a lustrous red, hair is soft and silky, less frizz, and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> had tried everything from cheap store brands to expensive salon brands, and nothing ever worked to get my hair healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li> So if you were to use this regularly, you would go through it very very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, it does make my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Your hair feel very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> The first several days using this product, I believed it would live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Going on using them for 5 years with my natural &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; hair!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I use this every season to have strong healthy hair through the cold months.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to finally break down and purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Also, buying it online at Amazon.com is smart as you only have to order as needed and not have automatic shipping.  </li>
            <li> Unexpected benefit!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works for my hair thus far.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried Wen from Chaz Dean on the tv commercial, that is the real Wen.</li>
            <li> It is shinier and soft.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING SHOULD BE FIXED SOON</li>
            <li> I color my hair and it doesn&#x27;t wash out the color as fast like regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely soft and after using it for 4 months my hair is&lt;br /&gt;actually growing.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair about 3 times a week since there is so much of it</li>
            <li> My hair did indeed feel soft.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> So with WEN AND your natural oil, it makes your hair greasy.  </li>
            <li> The product is good but too expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s pricey, but for me, it probably equals out to what I&#x27;m used to spending for shampoo, conditioner, volumizer, the occasional serum or dry oil, etc.</li>
            <li> Anyways after the first use my hair felt really dry.</li>
            <li> Using the Wen Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner is a bit different than a traditional shampoo/condition regiment, but it&#x27;s actually easier.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and very very tangley.</li>
            <li> The only thing good I can say is that my hair has less frizz with this product, but that is probably only because the result is greasy, so that&#x27;s not really a plus.  </li>
            <li> The generic brands that I&#x27;ve tried in the past from Sally&#x27;s and L&#x27;Oreal do a much better job my hair feels cleaner for longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used high end shampoos, so I&#x27;ve never had an issue with them damaging, taking away color, or otherwise taking away luster.</li>
            <li> Better than the generic forms and the sent since the last little bit longer.</li>
            <li> Long story short, the first time use left my hair softer and smoother than I&#x27;m normally used to.</li>
            <li> Mrs We Care uses this product all the time, and definitely her hair is more shining and less dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> After the first use it was ok but after the 3rd and 4th it was awful, made my hair oily, and most important not clean feeling.</li>
            <li> My hairs condition before Wen was long very thick very curly and extremely healthy since I do not any heat products on my hair.</li>
            <li> so many others I fell for that late night infomercial bologna!</li>
            <li> It has changed my hair from dull and dry to healthy looking, manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> My go-to do for work has been to either French braid it or put it in a bun because I stay so busy I don&#x27;t have time to restyle it over and over again all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WEN can only do so much when you Blow dry, bleach, dye and/or Iron your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most days now, I don&#x27;t mind getting up a little earlier to style it to wear down, because it stays styled.</li>
            <li> My ends are not all frizzy anymore, my scalp is not dry either.  </li>
            <li> Due to health complications, I wasn&#x27;t able to follow my usual hair routines for several months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good fit for my hair.  </li>
            <li> product takes weeks to arrive, like other folks have reported, it is priority shipped to some post office where I believe it is left in the corner until they absolutely have to deal with it.</li>
            <li> I bought my first round of Wen products with a gift card I got for Christmas figuring that if it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> my other high end shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything with this product, following directions exactly, using more, using less, using it every other day, leaving it in, rinsing it out, combing it through, using hot water, using cold water . . .</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair that is, at the same time, very fine and difficult to control.</li>
            <li> It is going to take 4-6 weeks for a refund, minus shipping (which I&#x27;m sure they will charge me at least half of what I paid), but they sure quick on the draw to keep me from posting a bad review on their site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My down my back medium length hair is so soft that it will not hold a curl, and nor will it hold an up do without tons of hair spray and lots of hair pins--see photo.  </li>
            <li> used the product for two months and my hair color changed from a soft dark brown to a brassy auburn, so I thought.  </li>
            <li> The WEN helps the color last twice as long.</li>
            <li> BUT, I&#x27;m also accustomed to using leave-in conditioner and a volumizer foam as well as a thermal spray when I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> So just how long is THAT bottle going to last .</li>
            <li> Instead, after using the product, my wavy shoulder-length hair looks greasy, lank and flat</li>
            <li> Honestly not my fav hair product, I was a bit disappointed when I bought it because everyone put it out there to be greatest stuff, and I have really dry hair</li>
            <li> No major change in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It actually helped with dry over processed hair and works with shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> Especially the ends which can get brittle and dry during the summers here.</li>
            <li> If you follow the regime, and buy even one extra, it will cost you about the same as any other hair care--hence the 4 review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product says to use 24-32 pumps for long hair, at that rate, the bottle would have a lifespan of almost two weeks.</li>
            <li> However, the product says it require long use for optimal results.</li>
            <li> Who knows how long it will take to recover.</li>
            <li> I purchased ins did my daughter and myself and they arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Long (mid back), thick, straight, black, and with Highlights (red)&lt;br /&gt;Ethnicity Hair Type:</li>
            <li> Hooked and cannot say enough about this product or all of the other products under the name WEN.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been a &amp;#34;shampoo snob&amp;#34</li>
            <li> you order Wen, there are two boxes you can check to opt out of receiving additional mailings of the product, and the other allows them to release your info to third parties.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps for some other people with different types of hair</li>
            <li> My hair was quite dry and flyaway.</li>
            <li> dry it out.</li>
            <li> and it takes about 4 hours to dry.</li>
            <li> However, I have dry hair.</li>
            <li> But my hair feels course and dry and the shine is no longer there.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for all hair types-especially mine which is dry and curly.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps with your dry hair and saving you money.</li>
            <li> I have course, dry hair</li>
            <li> For those who can use additional details: heavy, waist length Asian hair which I color three times a year, worn down or braided or in bun or ponytail, blow dryer for only about 5-7 minutes to dry roots and bangs, flat iron</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo is your friend!</li>
            <li> DRY SHAMPOO IS YOUR FRIEND!</li>
            <li> The proof is in the post pictures, that I am not bold enough to share online, and</li>
            <li> I tried following the directions, tried combing it through, tried using less, etc.  </li>
            <li> While I was hoping the product would give my hair more volume and bounce, I have found that it actually has less volume than with previous products I have used, which also happen to be much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I recently changed my color from black to read</li>
            <li> : Use a small amount in mid section of your hair to the ends on a daily bases.</li>
            <li> Wen actually does not clean my hair but leaves it greasy.</li>
            <li> After the second use it felt a little bit softer.</li>
            <li> On top of all that I now have extremely bad dandruff.</li>
            <li> wen might be a great item but the company will get you in nasty replenished cycle meaning</li>
            <li> The Re Moist product is unknown, I used it, but I can tell no discernible difference in the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> EMPTY BOTTLES</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks, my hair is always greasy and the ends are rough to the touch.</li>
            <li> maybe 3-4 times a month, wet pin curls overnight if I want wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left both of our hair greasy and limp.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry &amp; coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> u are supposed to use literally half the bottle in one washing for long hair!!</li>
            <li> Now my hair and scalp are so used to the wen that if I try and use other products my head will just itch all day..</li>
            <li> and then they get a bill from company for other one they don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive for the results.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo your scalp when needed with other shampoo products of your choice.</li>
            <li> I saw several other negative reviews for this product written by other Asians and multi ethnic users.</li>
            <li> not worth the price</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really feel guilty about spending the money since it didn&#x27;t come out of my household</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I managed to move it down to 6 pumps and focus on the scalp to cleanse, and use a brush to help move the product down to the ends and pinned it up for the duration of the shower.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel waxy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> My hair was down to my butt</li>
            <li> I think if you have oily or tendency to be oily, it might weigh your hair down...</li>
            <li> I will not use any other product now that I have tried this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Half &amp; Half, Asian-American hair</li>
            <li> TO FIND HALF</li>
            <li> and I used about half of the recommended amount of everything except for the cleansing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;About</li>
            <li> Easier to manage, I use less.</li>
            <li> I have very short hair and was afraid it would make it too soft or limp for my short&lt;br /&gt;spikey</li>
            <li> To add to that, once it grew past a certain point (just above my shoulders), it seemed impossible to keep it conditioned.</li>
            <li> Also, the customer service email address on their site doesn&#x27;t work, and the hotline is filled with bumbling idiots who seem confused as to why you don&#x27;t want $40 worth of greasy, poor quality shampoo that may or may not arrive billed to you</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and heavy that it never held a style for long.</li>
            <li> As it says, it does not lather at all, so it takes a little to get used to.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE PRICE!</li>
            <li> it is very dry and the water is hard salty</li>
            <li> I have very thick and coarse hair</li>
            <li> Used this product and actually seen no improvement in my hair situation!!..huge waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> None, I brush it and shove it in pony tails and messy buns.</li>
            <li> However, I had to pay the $10.40/per box shipping charges and waste my gas to travel to and from the post office to return the mailings I didn&#x27;t order.  </li>
            <li> , messy do.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to others, unless they have money to waste.</li>
            <li> you have to build up to going without for a few days.</li>
            <li> It is heavy</li>
            <li> Product arrived within a few days.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel heavy &amp; it looked greasy.</li>
            <li> If I blow-dry it with a styling brush and use a straightener, it straightens somewhat, but once I&#x27;ve let it hang a little it starts to retract and get small waves in it again.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it&#x27;s made of</li>
            <li> I did my usual research and decided to give the WEN product line a try.</li>
            <li> read the small print</li>
            <li> No more conditioners for me.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Extremely small bottles for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive in my opinion and there are other shampoo/conditioner products that work just as well for less money.</li>
            <li> halfway through my second bottle of Wen I noticed my hair was much thinner than it had ever been before and looked terrible.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - it does not help manage or help control course curly hair in the least!  </li>
            <li> it is hard to get all the product out, and it tends to want to build up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to address all the negative results I&#x27;ve read or heard about</li>
            <li> Icky.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with the results of this product,  my hair was heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased less expensive conditioning cleansing creams.</li>
            <li> Not happy, you definitively loose a lot of hair with this product, it is very expensive, and I had very high expectations and the results are awful.</li>
            <li> I should have done my research because this was very expensive compared to other places.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick curly</li>
            <li> Very thick, tingles.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bottle only lasts me about a month and is too expensive for me to use regularly. :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just not meant for my thin hair type.</li>
            <li> Not happy with what it did to my scalp.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s weird.</li>
            <li> She was not impressed</li>
            <li> I WAS JUST SO SAD</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about all the hype around this product.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive.</li>
            <li> In addition, I also found it difficult to cancel the automatic delivery.  </li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, though.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work and is expensive.</li>
            <li> I found that for the price, it is way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> hair is always damaged because of the dry weather and the awful water.&lt;br /&gt;Since this damages my hair</li>
            <li> Left my hair horribly greasy and feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to give it a 1 star, that&#x27;s how bad this product &amp; customer service</li>
            <li> and it still feels dirty!  </li>
            <li> and now I am just disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed that this product stripped my color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Which leads me to the scam part of this crap.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> This crap does not work!</li>
            <li> Horrible product, horrible company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was really awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hooked and cannot say enough about this product or all of the other products under the name WEN.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been a &amp;#34;shampoo snob&amp;#34; lol. Always bought suave......&lt;br /&gt;A friend of my gave me a travel size of wen one day and I was hooked! Now my hair and scalp are so used to the wen that if I try and use other products my head will just itch all day..it&#x27;s weird. So I&#x27;m hooked and would recommend it for all hair lengths and types! Also, I have to dye my hair. The WEN helps the color last twice as long. Unexpected benefit!!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about this product except I will never go back to store brands. Best line of hair products ever!!</li>
            <li> Definitely see and feel the difference in the shine, feel and look of my hair.</li>
            <li> They said they loved it!</li>
            <li> I have to admit it works great.  My hair is all gray but I do dye it ,so it is very coarse.  Wen help my hair feel silky.  It really works.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for Fall/Winter hair care. It helps hair grow, keeps it silky soft and tangle free, and while I do not personally use the gels or styling cremes, I do in the spring and they work great too. I use this every season to have strong healthy hair through the cold months.</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair feels when I use the WEN system but it takes a lot of the product each time you use it (more if you have long hair - which I do).  It&#x27;s expensive in my opinion and there are other shampoo/conditioner products that work just as well for less money.</li>
            <li> Love it so much I am giving them as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> This system is great for your hair and the special gifts you receive is a great way to try before you buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this hair product did anything for my hair. I would not recommend spending a lot of money on this set.</li>
            <li> Live Wen came very quicklu</li>
            <li> This is okay but for the price I don&#x27;t think it lives up to all the hype.  My hair is maybe a little more shiny but that&#x27;s about it.  For the price I just don&#x27;t see how its worth it.</li>
            <li> Hair Type: Long (mid back), thick, straight, black, and with Highlights (red)&lt;br /&gt;Ethnicity Hair Type: I&#x27;m Half &amp; Half, Asian-American hair&lt;br /&gt;Product Use: One week&lt;br /&gt;Products Used: Sweet Almond Mint-Re Moist, Anti-Frizz Creme, Cleansing Conditioner (main product), and the Ultra Nourishing Cleansing Add-In.&lt;br /&gt;Former Shampoo/Conditioner: Joico&lt;br /&gt;Originally Purchased from the Wen site with a pretty decent promo&lt;br /&gt;Hair Style Dedication: None, I brush it and shove it in pony tails and messy buns. I&#x27;m pretty lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Summary followed by breakdown&lt;br /&gt;It works for my hair thus far. My highlights are still a lustrous red, hair is soft and silky, less frizz, and feels amazing. Product takes time in the shower to use, about 5 minutes for my hair length to work it in. But there is a noticeable difference for me. I&#x27;ve only used high end shampoos, so I&#x27;ve never had an issue with them damaging, taking away color, or otherwise taking away luster. Occasionally I might straighten my hair for special occasions, but with the product smoothing my hair, I most likely will discontinue straightening. After the product is depleted, I&#x27;ll give a final summary review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Use&lt;br /&gt;-Cleansing Conditioner (main product), Ultra Nourishing Add-in, and Anti-Frizz afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product says to use 24-32 pumps for long hair, at that rate, the bottle would have a lifespan of almost two weeks. I managed to move it down to 6 pumps and focus on the scalp to cleanse, and use a brush to help move the product down to the ends and pinned it up for the duration of the shower. As it says, it does not lather at all, so it takes a little to get used to. The after results felt amazing. My hair was less frizzy, super silky, less tangled. The shine was the same, my hair is fairly  healthy to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following Uses&lt;br /&gt;With out the anti-frizz creme, I can tell a difference in the frizz level. It&#x27;s not a night and day difference, but good to knowthe anti-frizz creme works. The Re Moist product is unknown, I used it, but I can tell no discernible difference in the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts&lt;br /&gt;They claim to eliminate the need of external products, that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;one product solves it all&amp;#34; type, but they still have extra things here and there to add onto their primary, just like every other hair care type. If you follow the regime, and buy even one extra, it will cost you about the same as any other hair care--hence the 4 review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take more time to clean your hair, since there&#x27;s no bubbles to help distribute, you will dedicate up to 5 minutes (Depending on length) to work the product in your hair, and to clean your scalp. So if you&#x27;re trying to save water, you may want to turn it off during cleansing.</li>
            <li> Wen has a great product but didn&#x27;t get shipped the right items  ...didn&#x27;t get one item I wanted but more of others....not a bad deal but wanted my styling creme!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried Wen from Chaz Dean on the tv commercial, that is the real Wen. This one seems like a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;. Not sure what it&#x27;s made of but it feels like it&#x27;s been tampered with to make money. It makes my hair greasy. Don&#x27;t like at all</li>
            <li> NICE GIFT SET, MY GIRLS WILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Great product...try it and you will like it. It actually helped with dry over processed hair and works with shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to finally break down and purchase this product. It is pricey! However, the product says it require long use for optimal results. I have used this product for 1 month. My hair does not have more body or moisture. It is shinier and soft. That is the only advantage. I would compare it to a simpler product though would not pay the same price. Please note, this product must use 5-6 pumps for an initial rinse. Then an additional 5-6 pumps to rest on hair during the remainder of your bathing regime. So you use it just like a shampoo and conditioning treatment only it comes out of the same bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true what the infomercial states, you&#x27;ll feel the difference once you massage it into your hair. I have very thick and coarse hair and after I use wen I feel like I thinned out my hair. Your hair feels silky and smooth   after just 1 use. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Was not happy with the results of this product,  my hair was heavy and greasy.  Im very upset that it can not be returned as the product paper work claims a 60 day guarantee.  I will know better next time and not make those types of product purchases from amazon . EVER.</li>
            <li> Like it better than regular shampoo</li>
            <li> Definitely more body and shine. My hair was quite dry and flyaway. WEN has helped to restore moisture. It feels nice to the touch.</li>
            <li> This crap does not work! Every product was total junk.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t imagine that a shampoo that didn&#x27;t make suds could clean your hair, but it does!!!  I&#x27;ve received compliments about how good my hair looks.  People ask what I&#x27;m doing differently.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. Several coworkers use it and love it. I tried but it just does not do what it says. My hair is fine but frizzy and I colour every 6-8 weeks. So that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> It works, and it is a good product. I have very long and thick hair it is hard to get all the product out, and it tends to want to build up. I may not be using it correctly; which would be my mistake, but while it is not built up, it is wonderful and does as it claims.</li>
            <li> Awesome packaging came with more things than I thought it would. Made my mother-in law extremely happy on Christmas. Smelled amazing.</li>
            <li> i really like wen i wanted to try it but didnt want the auto ship so i bought it here&lt;br /&gt;The product is great it cleans my hair and disnt dry it out.</li>
            <li> Motivation for Ordering:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After viewing the infomercial for some years, I decided to order the Wen Sweet Almond Mint hair care kit. I wanted a product that was gentle on my multi-racial fine and soft hair (African American/European American).  My down my back medium length hair is so soft that it will not hold a curl, and nor will it hold an up do without tons of hair spray and lots of hair pins--see photo.  The kit contained all the products pictured here: Sweet Almond Mint Conditioner (12 oz.), Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment (2 oz.), Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cream (2 oz.), Sweet Mint Texture Balm (.35 oz.), and a black wide-tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product for two months and my hair color changed from a soft dark brown to a brassy auburn, so I thought.  The texture of my hair changed from soft and smooth to a wooly, brittle, frizzy, and wiry texture.  I went to my stylist to see what we could do to change my hair texture and color back to its original glamorous condition.  She stated, &amp;#34;Your hair is fried, we will have to cut it all off, what have you been using!&amp;#34; I told her that I had ordered Wen because I watched the TV commercials, and it implied that Wen was much more gentle than regular shampoo.  The lovely head of gorgeous hair in the photo is all gone.  My stylist had to cut my hair to within an inch of my scalp.  It is gradually growing back with the aid of vitamins and my regular hair care products. Friends, family members, and persons at my house of faith were astonished at the transformation.  I told them of my experience with Wen.  The proof is in the post pictures, that I am not bold enough to share online, and the astonished looks on their faces. I&#x27;ve heard whispers, &amp;#34;What happened to her hair!&amp;#34;  No, I&#x27;m not taking chemo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Mailings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you order Wen, there are two boxes you can check to opt out of receiving additional mailings of the product, and the other allows them to release your info to third parties.  I selected no for both boxes.  Wen put me on the list anyway even though I had opted out of receiving additional products.  When I called, I spoke to someone in Asia (India) they said that they didn&#x27;t want me to run out. &amp;#34;I told them I checked the no box.  They then proceeded to ask why I wanted to cancel, and I told them that the color and texture of my hair changed and my stylist had to cut away the damaged hair.  They said, &amp;#34;We have a product especially for ethnic hair.&amp;#34;  I declined.  However, I had to pay the $10.40/per box shipping charges and waste my gas to travel to and from the post office to return the mailings I didn&#x27;t order.  The post office does not accept &#x27;return to sender&#x27; for the Wen products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t do enough research before ordering this product.  I should have read all the reviews prior to ordering this product.  My hair was my thing and now it&#x27;s all gone.  Who knows how long it will take to recover.</li>
            <li> Cost a lot but my boyfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> She was not impressed</li>
            <li> The product is good but too expensive</li>
            <li> Loving what it is doing to my hair. Stopped relaxing and going back natural and this product has not disappointed</li>
            <li> I love the wen products! Going on using them for 5 years with my natural &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; hair!</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I have used every imaginable hair product on the market, and WEN Hair Care System is amazingly and by far the BEST.  I have very short hair and was afraid it would make it too soft or limp for my short&lt;br /&gt;spikey, messy do.  It works great on my fine, short hair.  I am sold......Also, buying it online at Amazon.com is smart as you only have to order as needed and not have automatic shipping.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT MY HAIR FEELS AMAZING I WAS JUST SO SAD TO FIND HALF MY KIT WAS SHIPPED W EMPTY BOTTLES I CALLED &amp; EVERYTHING SHOULD BE FIXED SOON BUT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW IT&#x27;S GONNA FEEL WHEN I GET TO USE IT ALL LOVE IT &amp; LOOKING FORWARD TO RECEIVING THE REST OF MY SHIPMENT</li>
            <li> As a stylist I was naturally weary, but after using it for myself I am in love! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks, my hair is always greasy and the ends are rough to the touch. I really dont like the pomegranate smell . The mask is ok tough and my hair is tangle free with it.</li>
            <li> It works just as advertised! My hair has not ever been so soft, silky and managable, and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> So I finally got around to trying a sulfate free shampoo. Due to health complications, I wasn&#x27;t able to follow my usual hair routines for several months. After recovery, I thought it would be a good time to try some different products. I did my usual research and decided to give the WEN product line a try. I was skeptical about all the hype around this product. So the first time I used it, I followed ALL the directions and recommendations that come with each product. 20 pumps for my waist length hair. That&#x27;s A LOT of product. No matter. I wanted to see if I could duplicate the advertisement results. Since the first time use, I&#x27;ve modified the amount to 12 pumps the first shampoo and then another 12 pumps for the second wash. I also leave the cleansing conditioner in while I take my shower and then apply the SIXTHIRTEEN while I rinse off. And then I RINSE RINSE RINSE my hair. I DO like the almond mint scent and don&#x27;t find it strong or lingering. I&#x27;m reviewing the Fig Styling Creme in a seperate review. Long story short, the first time use left my hair softer and smoother than I&#x27;m normally used to. BUT, I&#x27;m also accustomed to using leave-in conditioner and a volumizer foam as well as a thermal spray when I use a flat iron. I didn&#x27;t use ANY of those things during my &amp;#34;experimental trial&amp;#34;. The next time I used it, my hair behaved in a similar manner. The time after that, even better. The time after that, the time after that....well, you get the picture. I shampoo my hair about every 3rd or 4th day and in between, I didn&#x27;t experience any oiliness or product heaviness that accumulates with leave-ins. Also, I deep condition my hair a couple of times a week with coconut oil before shampooing. I&#x27;ve done the coconut oil thing for a number of years and I don&#x27;t ever plan to stop. But back on point. I read some reviews that talk about accelerated hair loss using WEN (that was a BIG concern for me!). I didn&#x27;t have a hair loss experience. I&#x27;ve used every product in this trial package (plus the Fig styling creme) and I&#x27;m convinced my hair definitely feels good and looks shiny and healthy. Especially the ends which can get brittle and dry during the summers here. I&#x27;ve read different reviews that say WEN&#x27;s great at first, then after a month or so, not so much. I&#x27;m going to trial it for three months and then decide if I&#x27;m truly a convert to sulfate free. For those who can use additional details: heavy, waist length Asian hair which I color three times a year, worn down or braided or in bun or ponytail, blow dryer for only about 5-7 minutes to dry roots and bangs, flat iron maybe 3-4 times a month, wet pin curls overnight if I want wavy hair. If you have questions, please feel free to ask me. For now, WEN gets 5 stars for performance and results. It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s pricey, but for me, it probably equals out to what I&#x27;m used to spending for shampoo, conditioner, volumizer, the occasional serum or dry oil, etc. BTW, I haven&#x27;t pin curled my hair since switching to WEN. I&#x27;ll update this review when I try curling my hair. I&#x27;ve tried to address all the negative results I&#x27;ve read or heard about so I can give detailed information that might help you decide if it&#x27;s worth the expense to try. I&#x27;m very pleased and enthusiastic. Give it a try and see what you think.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Wen. My hair has never been any softer or shiny! Unfortunately, the bottle only lasts me about a month and is too expensive for me to use regularly. :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> I tried following the directions, tried combing it through, tried using less, etc.  No matter what my hair felt greasy.  I think it would work great as a condtioner which is what I have just started doing.</li>
            <li> It does not work as well as promised.  I could not tell a difference in my hair.  I thought it would make my hair more manageable and my curly, coarse hair remained unchanged.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  My hair looks and feels wonderful.  I color my hair and it doesn&#x27;t wash out the color as fast like regular shampoo.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> this product is a scam!!!! u are supposed to use literally half the bottle in one washing for long hair!! also it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking any better than normal shampoos and conditioners.it smells ok and feels nice during washing but that&#x27;s about it. NOT WORTH THE PRICE!</li>
            <li> not worth the price - the results were adequate but I also tried RenPure brand and was much happier with it. I would not recommend this product to others, unless they have money to waste.</li>
            <li> Quick Look: Great quality product, worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would be one of those people who paid more than $15 for hair products. I&#x27;m a single mom living on one income, so every penny is precious. I have super thick hair that is, at the same time, very fine and difficult to control. It has a lot of body, but it&#x27;s not all-out curly. I enjoy having it long because I love a good up-do, but wearing it down has really never been an option. My hair is so thick and heavy that it never held a style for long. To add to that, once it grew past a certain point (just above my shoulders), it seemed impossible to keep it conditioned. It was always dry and fly away, and the ends looked frizzy no matter how often I kept it trimmed or what styling product I used. If I blow-dry it with a styling brush and use a straightener, it straightens somewhat, but once I&#x27;ve let it hang a little it starts to retract and get small waves in it again. It tangles easily, but the more I brushed the tangles out, the puffier and fuzzier it became.  My go-to do for work has been to either French braid it or put it in a bun because I stay so busy I don&#x27;t have time to restyle it over and over again all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried everything from cheap store brands to expensive salon brands, and nothing ever worked to get my hair healthy and manageable. I bought my first round of Wen products with a gift card I got for Christmas figuring that if it didn&#x27;t work I wouldn&#x27;t really feel guilty about spending the money since it didn&#x27;t come out of my household budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say that I am amazed by the results is an understatement. My hair is healthier, shinier and more manageable than it has ever been. Most days now, I don&#x27;t mind getting up a little earlier to style it to wear down, because it stays styled. Using the Wen Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner is a bit different than a traditional shampoo/condition regiment, but it&#x27;s actually easier. It makes your hair feel great, and it has a pleasing but not overwhelming scent. I have really sensitive skin and sinuses, so anything with too much perfume makes me itch and makes my sinuses act up, but that isn&#x27;t the case with this product. The recommended amount seems like a lot to use at once, but it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sweet Almond Mint styling cream provides great hold and manageability without being sticky or stiff, and it doesn&#x27;t take much. Just 2 tiny squirts of the Pomegranate Straightening Smoothing Gloss provides a healthy shine for my overwhelming amount of hair, but doesn&#x27;t look or feel oily or greasy. The Sweet Almond Mint Volumizing Root Lift is fantastic. It looks like a super-fine powder that practically disappears in your hand, but somehow it works! I haven&#x27;t used the Texture Balm yet, but I&#x27;m sure it works as great as the rest of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I encourage you to try the Wen products. I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the result. I am making room in my household budget now for Wen. It works fantastically and makes me feel beautiful!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to give it a 1 star, that&#x27;s how bad this product &amp; customer service is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like so many others I fell for that late night infomercial bologna! I have tried everything with this product, following directions exactly, using more, using less, using it every other day, leaving it in, rinsing it out, combing it through, using hot water, using cold water . . . I can&#x27;t think of anything else to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product takes weeks to arrive, like other folks have reported, it is priority shipped to some post office where I believe it is left in the corner until they absolutely have to deal with it. I&#x27;d say it took a good 4-5 weeks to arrive. The instructions say to use like 20 pumps. Really?!?!?! So just how long is THAT bottle going to last . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after I received the product, I started getting emails stating if I was not getting the results I wanted to call Wen by Chaz. I called today, told them the issues I was having. Their solution to me getting the results I was expecting . . . send the product back for a full refund since I was still within my 60 days! At least they were honest, there is NO SOLUTION to getting good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I signed into my account to write a review and guess what? When I go to &#x27;write a review&#x27; it says &#x27;Submission Currently Unavailable.&#x27; Wow! It is going to take 4-6 weeks for a refund, minus shipping (which I&#x27;m sure they will charge me at least half of what I paid), but they sure quick on the draw to keep me from posting a bad review on their site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo glad I&#x27;m getting out of this mess!</li>
            <li> Thank you to Amazon for caring the products of WEN.  It&#x27;s a very good product, never would have used it other wise!  It&#x27;s made hair more manageable even in VA, normally its frizzy but now it can be straightened with no issues!  Definitely like this product...</li>
            <li> Love this product. every day is a good hair day. my hair is bouncy shiny and feels like I went to the salon every day now. I am definitely a Wen girl.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and very very tangley. After using when it is so much smoother &amp; more manageable.</li>
            <li> Honestly not my fav hair product, I was a bit disappointed when I bought it because everyone put it out there to be greatest stuff, and I have really dry hair and it did not work for me at all. After the first use it was ok but after the 3rd and 4th it was awful, made my hair oily, and most important not clean feeling. Dislike this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this because a friend raved about it for months to me. At first, I didn&#x27;t care for this product at all. I didn&#x27;t think it did much for my hair, but I figured I would give it a few weeks and i love it! I wash it twice as the bottle states, but i do not use it as a leave in treatment. To me, if I do that, my hair just seems oily and I can&#x27;t stand it. I have very curly hair and I&#x27;ve found that the Fig works the best for me, but the sweet almond mint is a good backup if I&#x27;m out the the fig.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my hair is when I use it.</li>
            <li> Well I bought this product for my sys .. she told me the shampoo does not really produce foam when you wash your hair and the product itself is really not all that great</li>
            <li> It smells great, and it makes my dried out hair extremely soft.&lt;br /&gt;Where I live it is very dry and the water is hard salty water.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is always damaged because of the dry weather and the awful water.&lt;br /&gt;Since this damages my hair it never seems to grow. Since I have been using WEN my hair is totally different.&lt;br /&gt;I can actually comb through it after washing it. My hair is extremely soft and after using it for 4 months my hair is&lt;br /&gt;actually growing. This is definitely my hair care product the I will never stray away from.</li>
            <li> It expensive only purchased it because of a few good  reviews I read on this site. It made  my  natraual hair feel like straw.... find that cheaper products works better... Will never spend money on product again!!! I lived&amp;learned!!!</li>
            <li> try this stuff I have short hair this product adds volume it makes your hair soft manageable just alone without the other products it preforms well love it.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and it came very nicely packaged and was a great gift - recipient said it has remarkably improved their hair and that they love it</li>
            <li> It is a good product and my results were also consistent with what has been advertised ... more shine, more volume and body, etc. It was easy to adjust to the fact that the shampoo would not latter up like regular shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t realize or was trying to avoid was the continuing shipments of the product unless you call to cancel them. I wanted to try the product and see how it worked without signing up for on-going shipments of the product. This was not disclosed or I was not aware of the fine print.  Other than that I&#x27;m happy with the products I received.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again. Works great.</li>
            <li> The product is good, however I found it built up over a 2 week time period, and I needed to use my shampoo to get the heaviness out.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, horrible company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a starter kit for my Mom for Christmas. We both tried it out during my stay and agreed it wasn&#x27;t a good product. The shampoo left both of our hair greasy and limp. Also, the instructions request that you use A LOT of product with each use. Like, think 8-12 pumps. Two to four times as much as normal shampoo. So if you were to use this regularly, you would go through it very very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which leads me to the scam part of this crap. So, when you buy from the WEN website, it signs you up to receive monthly $40+ shipments automatically. Whether you click &amp;#34;no thanks&amp;#34; or not. It&#x27;s their policy. Also, you might not receive these packages. But boy, will they bill you. I discovered 4 fees of $40 on my credit-card bill (at first I just thought it was a holiday delay on billing me), but had no idea that it was because I was signed up for a monthly shampoo shipment. Not only that, but I had never received beyond the initial order I gifted to my Mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service there is a joke. To get a refund for a monthly shipment I never signed up for, I had to sign a freakin&#x27; affadavit. Also, the customer service email address on their site doesn&#x27;t work, and the hotline is filled with bumbling idiots who seem confused as to why you don&#x27;t want $40 worth of greasy, poor quality shampoo that may or may not arrive billed to you monthly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr: DO NOT BY THIS PRODUCT. IT&#x27;S A SCAM.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this cleansing conditioner makes my hair. I used to get really frizzy, but the Wen took away the frizzies!</li>
            <li> Ok. I *LIKE* this product. I really do. Its been over a month, and I still have more product left. It does take time. It does take a lot of product. It does smell minty. But, it does make my hair very soft and manageable. I am not at a point yet where I can go without doing anything to my hair... I do hope to attain this someday, but I think my hair was to damaged at the start. I love the soothing gel they give you. It seems to work wonders on my hair. I wash my hair about every 3/6 days depending on what is going on in my life at that time. Dry shampoo is your friend! YOur hair will be greasy between washes... you have to build up to going without for a few days. DRY SHAMPOO IS YOUR FRIEND! But all and all, i like the product. Im undecided if I&#x27;ll continue on with this process or not.</li>
            <li> The products are just ok.  No major change in my hair.  I should have done my research because this was very expensive compared to other places.  Way too expensive.</li>
            <li> wen might be a great item but the company will get you in nasty replenished cycle meaning is they will keep sending this item over and over. read the small print this item is not one time buy. amazon do your research on these company and item put a warning  this item is not one time buy so people don&#x27;t get charge for something they bought one time and then they get a bill from company for other one they don&#x27;t buy. its only for people who needs this and have alot of money to spend. some of us are on a budget</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have very fine hair and this product makes it look fuller.  I will not use any other product now that I have tried this!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel waxy and weighed down. Overpriced for what you get which is mostly the cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations. I saw no change in the condition of my hair. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> After using this product I syarted losing a lot of hair. After not using about two weeks hair stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift my daughter in law loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I find I have to wash my hair more often, which I do not want to do.  Perhaps it&#x27;s just not meant for my thin hair type.</li>
            <li> You will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> This product is not for me. I thought it was going to make my hair in better condition that what it already was, no it did not. My hairs condition before Wen was long very thick very curly and extremely healthy since I do not any heat products on my hair. I only wash my hair about 3 times a week since there is so much of it and it takes about 4 hours to dry. Anyways after the first use my hair felt really dry. After the second use it felt a little bit softer. And about the 5th time I used this product my hair had felt like I had a bunch of wax in it. When I brushed my hair more hair was coming out than ;normal and I had more breakage than normal. On top of all that I now have extremely bad dandruff. I cannot scratch my head without my nails getting caked with it. Idk maybe this product will work better for somebody else but as for me no I do not like it.</li>
            <li> I quite dislike this product.  Despite promises that the infomercial makes, it does not leave my hair feeling or looking clean.  Instead, after using the product, my wavy shoulder-length hair looks greasy, lank and flat and it still feels dirty!  While I was hoping the product would give my hair more volume and bounce, I have found that it actually has less volume than with previous products I have used, which also happen to be much less expensive.  The only thing good I can say is that my hair has less frizz with this product, but that is probably only because the result is greasy, so that&#x27;s not really a plus.  In addition, I also found it difficult to cancel the automatic delivery.  Despite calling to cancel, I continued to receive the automatic delivery and it took several calls to accomplish this.</li>
            <li> Hair is much softer and doesn&#x27;t seem as frayed when flare ironing but I think my hair looks greasier than normal</li>
            <li> Excellent hair product.  It does not weigh my hair down.  I love how healthy it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> The first several days using this product, I believed it would live up to my expectations. My hair did indeed feel soft. The only downside I found at first was that if you have oily hair, using too much product can lead to greasy looking hair. My hair was down to my butt and I used about half of the recommended amount of everything except for the cleansing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;About halfway through my second bottle of Wen I noticed my hair was much thinner than it had ever been before and looked terrible. I take a daily multi vitamin, never heat treat or dye my hair, so I asked a doctor who told me it was probably something that I was doing to my hair since I am nutritionally up to par. I stopped using Wen, and noticed a decrease in the hair I was losing.&lt;br /&gt;I am Korean, with straight, fine hair. I saw several other negative reviews for this product written by other Asians and multi ethnic users. Perhaps Wen is a No No for us. I certainly would never recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really liked how this worked.  It took some time to get the right amount to use on my hair length but once I did, I loved it.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, though.  Won&#x27;t be ordering it again for that reason.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It was sent right away and I love that I could get this as a 1 time deal. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair with a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I wanted just cleansing shampoo. the rest was waist  of my money .I be very grateful if i could return the rest and get refil shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;  thank you fara</li>
            <li> Very good product and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like the products!</li>
            <li> I really like wen it makes my hair very healthy I love wen and I&#x27;m using wen from now thsnk you so much</li>
            <li> Left my hair horribly greasy and feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> great improvement in hair loss and breakage...something i was not expecting.  Love the way my hair feels and performs.  Scalp always feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive for the results.  It&#x27;s not a good fit for my hair.  Plus, I don&#x27;t like anything you have to have on auto ship to get the&lt;br /&gt;best price!</li>
            <li> seen the advertising on TV,watcht it and ordered for my wife so she could try it out,She tried it and liked it.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever! My hair has never looked so healthy before. People ask me all the time what I use on my hair. No split ends.</li>
            <li> I have curly dry hair, this is the best system for my hair!</li>
            <li> Not happy, you definitively loose a lot of hair with this product, it is very expensive, and I had very high expectations and the results are awful. I will never recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> Loved the way it made my hair feel. No more conditioners for me.</li>
            <li> Leaves bulid up in my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - it does not help manage or help control course curly hair in the least!  The condition smells good at least.</li>
            <li> Holy cow my hair looks and  feels awesome.  I was a bit hesitant that it didn&#x27;t lather but I have gotten so many compliments I will never use another product.. Oh and my skin cleared up on my face....</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair silky and shiny and my scalp hasn&#x27;t felt better in years.</li>
            <li> I love the product for a light weight conditioner and shampoo in one.  Your hair feel very soft and silky.  It controls frizz well.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it!</li>
            <li> I love love love it!!! However, I have dry hair. I think if you have oily or tendency to be oily, it might weigh your hair down...</li>
            <li> I have purchased less expensive conditioning cleansing creams. And love the way they made my hair look and feel. I recently changed my color from black to read so there was a significant amount of dryness. I figured I would splurge and buy the real thing in hopes that it would repair my hair and restore the shininess. I have to admit I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. My hair is not shiny at all and when I used to be able to run my fingers through my hair without snags I can no longer do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells wonderful. Better than the generic forms and the sent since the last little bit longer. But my hair feels course and dry and the shine is no longer there. I was so excited to get all the additional products because I love new hair products. But none of them seem worth the money. The straightening smoothing gloss is very oily.  It makes your hair feel kind of sticky. The anti-frizz gloss also makes your hair feel kind of sticky. It is supposed to be illuminating the need to wash your hair is often and I feel like I need to wash it more. I have very thick curly/wavy the hair that is course and does not need to be washed as often, but I feel like I need to wash it more with this product. The generic brands that I&#x27;ve tried in the past from Sally&#x27;s and L&#x27;Oreal do a much better job my hair feels cleaner for longer and I&#x27;m able to run my fingers through it without any snags all while it holds my curls. I&#x27;ve seen these commercials for years and always wanted to try it I was so excited when I did order it and now I am just disappointed. Perhaps for some other people with different types of hair The product would be better but for my hair it is not.</li>
            <li> Read the fine print. When u got my box I was registered for future mailings. I called WEN customer service and they were going to bill me for future shipments. I immediately told them to cancel. Plus the product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Great purchase! I absolutely love it. My hair has never felt so soft. I would recommend everyone to try it. I purchased ins did my daughter and myself and they arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I have read a ton of reviews that your hair falls out with Wen.</li>
            <li> In one day my hair went from frustrating to FABULOUS...NO JOKE. I&#x27;ve converted to WEN-ism. Thank you Amazon &amp; Wen.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work and is expensive. Use Moroccan oil. It&#x27;s fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> Good purchase / good quality item / Mrs We Care uses this product all the time, and definitely her hair is more shining and less dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hair has never looked or felt better! I recommend this product for all hair types-especially mine which is dry and curly. would like to than Ginger Lily Boutique for their timely response with my order and for contacting me in response to all my questions I will be ordering more Wen products from Ginger Lily in the future.</li>
            <li> It does what it says!  I color my hair and wanted to see if this shampoo really keeps the color from fading so fast and it really does work. I love the anti frizz gel also as part of my daily hair care. I shampoo and style my hair every day. Since my hair is short I do not use so much and can make my supply last and happy with the price.</li>
            <li> Extremely small bottles for the price.</li>
            <li> terrific product thank you</li>
            <li> It was really awful.  Left my hair feeling and looking oily and stringy.  No feeling of cleansed while washing.  Icky.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t use all the products yet but the little used proved successful so far</li>
            <li> BUYING: Go to the WEN site and buy it. Its cheaper then anyway else. At the point of receiving the package, cancel future orders on the phone and be courteous. These people are just like you and me, just doing their job. (Don&#x27;t wait the next day, just do it that day so you won&#x27;t forget.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USING: Use a small amount in mid section of your hair to the ends on a daily bases. Shampoo your scalp when needed with other shampoo products of your choice. Your scalp produces its own oil.  So with WEN AND your natural oil, it makes your hair greasy.  Which has plenty of people complaining. For one set package, it last me 6-9 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Bleaching or dying your hair, try to keep more of the substance in your hair after taking a shower. WEN can only do so much when you Blow dry, bleach, dye and/or Iron your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REPEAT: Consider the different variations they have when you order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading. Hope this helps with your dry hair and saving you money.</li>
            <li> Used this product and actually seen no improvement in my hair situation!!..huge waste of money!!! Would rather use cheap shampoo gave me better results!!</li>
            <li> My color stays much longer and I do love the smell though it seems my hair doesn&#x27;t stay as clean as with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, but it really is no better then a good shampoo and conditioner.  I have course, dry hair so I am a good candidate to try this product for it&#x27;s effectiveness.  I found that for the price, it is way too expensive.  I would pay the price if it worked better then my other high end shampoo.  I found that your hair actually feels softer and silkier while you are in the shower, but after I dry my hair it does not feel any softer or silkier or better conditioned.  Great concept with the kits, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> This product is not for all hair types.  I have thick, dry &amp; coarse hair.  It has changed my hair from dull and dry to healthy looking, manageable and soft.  Each time I use it, my hair looks healthier!  My ends are not all frizzy anymore, my scalp is not dry either.  I would recommend this product for my hair type and for people with thicker hair.  It is heavy but my hair can handle that.  I love all of it!</li>
            <li> I love it. Easier to manage, I use less.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed that this product stripped my color. Do not recommend for color treated hair. I should have done my research before hand.</li>
            <li> Its a good product,  Wish it explained what each product is exactly for and the benefits.  But smells nice and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dirty.  It did not change the behavior or look of my hair but its all and all a good product.</li>
            <li> I love what this product did to my hair... Not happy with what it did to my scalp. Is this a glorified conditioner? That&#x27;s what my scalp felt like... Shampoo then conditioner, but I didn&#x27;t quite rinse. I made sure to rinse because of previous reviews. I want to express that I love my hair, not my scalp.</li>
            <li> Wen actually does not clean my hair but leaves it greasy. It&#x27;s too pricy and does not do its job. I&#x27;m very disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair without much volume</li>
            <li> This took a while to get here as I live in Hawaii. What I appreciated was when I inquired about the reason for the tardiness the bender responded immediately. Love the product. It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> Product arrived within a few days. After first use of the product people immediately noticed a difference in my hair. Received many compliments. Love the way it makes your scalp feel when cleansing your hair. Already a BIG fan. I will order again from this seller in the future. You&#x27;re not forced into autoship when you do. Thank you very much for a great purchasing experience.</li>
            <li> Seen on the news it makes your hair fall out!</li>
            <li> Still waiting for my purchase very upset!!!</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel heavy &amp; it looked greasy. Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying WEN products that my co-worker recommended.  I love the feel of my hair after I cleanse it.  The smell is great and it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> The best hair products that I have ever used!! Make sure that you use it as directed on the bottle. I am 54 years old and have fine hair and Wen makes my hair look fuller and thicker. I ordered a bottle for my daughters.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Huge deceptive product. Messages to customer service not returned. Smells great. Very thick, tingles. Dries out hair though. Check ingredients first to see if this is the wen you want. Has alcohol and a lot of ingredients that may not be right for you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my Wife from her wishlist. This product simply does not work, it makes her hair greasy. Contacted seller about issue with product and they &amp;#34;cannot help me.&amp;#34; Will escalate my issue to Amazon if there is no resolution.</li>
            <li> Present for my mom she liked it</li>
            <li> A dollar bottle of Pert will work better than this stuff. However if you would like to be sent a continual supply billed every couple of months for about a hundred and fifty purchase this trial pack.</li>
