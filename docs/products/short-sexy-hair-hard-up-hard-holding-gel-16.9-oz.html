            <li>A little goes a long way and the hold is superior to other gels and glue.  </li>

            <li> It costs nearly as much for a little tube at the store.  </li>
            <li> but it leaves your hair dry</li>
            <li> We use to pay the same price for a bottle less than 1/2 this size.</li>
            <li> If your hair is wet</li>
            <li> you get the wet look.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER pay attention to the fact that if you do not wipe ALL the gel away from the applicator when you press the pump down, it WILL dry out, and you will have to pick the dried gel off the applicator before you can pump it to use it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Just a little shampoo</li>
            <li> At retail price a small 9 oz bottle is $20 you might find it at tj maxx or Nordstrom rack for 1/2 that price</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick &amp; heavy.  </li>
            <li> Stays in shape and not too stiff!!</li>
            <li> Hands down!!!!!</li>
            <li> and the day is worst which it will leave your hair with a lot of flakes.</li>

            <li> this book has soooooo many tips you can learn form, but you must read it and study it...  you also have to apply the principles</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product for his hair he has used it for several years was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>

            <li> This hair gel just holds and holds! I&#x27;ve slept with it one in more than one occasion, and every time I wake up, my hair still holds its shape. Been using it for years and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love the pump and great price for the amount you get. Will definitely order again</li>
            <li> great product ... but heard it was discontinued....</li>
            <li> Perfect for short hair</li>
            <li> Best hair gel for those with short / thick hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair gel on the planet, hands down! I&#x27;ve tried em all....and none of them have the length or strength of hold.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick &amp; heavy.  This is the one &amp; only product that holds my hair in place!  Most gel products flake when it dries.  Not this awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the hold is superior to other gels and glue.  Like buying this larger size as it is easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> When I first started styling my hair i used glued which is ok but it leaves your hair dry and the day is worst which it will leave your hair with a lot of flakes. Shortsexyhair is the best by far. Great hold great shine sometimes it even looks better the after. One tube at walmart is 17 dollars and I got two 16oz bottles for 30 dollars. I am greatly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It&#x27;s nice to be able to get it at a lower price and the pump dispenser makes applying my hair gel very convenient.</li>
            <li> At retail price a small 9 oz bottle is $20 you might find it at tj maxx or Nordstrom rack for 1/2 that price but again only 9oz. Great price. Great gel.  I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product, had been using it for 3 years now. Best gel i have used so far.</li>
            <li> great price for this product</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product.  I am even happier with the deal.  It costs nearly as much for a little tube at the store.  I would recommend this everybody, especially those that already use this product.  I will never buy it at the store again, only from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;It is everything they say it is. If your hair is wet you get the wet look. I rub it through my hands then rub it through my hair, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it !!</li>
            <li> Best hair gel I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried several hairsprays and gels but nothing compares to the hold this product gives, and since I don&#x27;t need to use a lot at one time this product lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short and this stuff is fantastic!  It dries quickly and stays neat all day. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> good quality, last for a long time, i order it everytime i can, it saves a lot of many specially cuz i do my hair everyday :)</li>
            <li> Great product! Stays in shape and not too stiff!!</li>
            <li> Love the product...HATE the pump. I usually buy this in a squeeze bottle, but this was a great buy.  HOWEVER pay attention to the fact that if you do not wipe ALL the gel away from the applicator when you press the pump down, it WILL dry out, and you will have to pick the dried gel off the applicator before you can pump it to use it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> This stuff holds your hair awesomely! I own a convertible and wear a hard hat at work... no problems!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair glue ever!  This product is great and I love it! Will buy more and more.</li>
            <li> Came quick. Correct product price good</li>
            <li> This gel works really well for short hair! My style is short, but I use gel to add shine, hold, and some texture. This is probably the best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever purchased! It can hold your hair in place all day, and it very, very resistant to heat and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has medium to high shine, a nice scent, and an amazing hold that lasts all day and night. It washes out easy too! Just a little shampoo and it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
