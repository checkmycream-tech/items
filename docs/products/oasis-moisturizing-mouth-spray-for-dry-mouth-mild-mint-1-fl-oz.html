            <li> I got absolutely no relief with this spray.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than other brands and freshens breath too.</li>
            <li> OTHER THAN THAT, IT WORKS</li>
            <li> The sprayer dispenses a sharp stream not a mist.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Oasis since I had adverse reactions to other mouth washes.  </li>
            <li> Tried the other mouth sprays on the market.</li>
            <li> It is hard to locate locally</li>
            <li> I have terrible dry mouth pretty much 24/7</li>
            <li> A little cheaper than other brand.</li>
            <li> No moisture left behind.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night and have been using it for a few years.  </li>
            <li> So much so I&#x27;d wake up very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Not very effective.</li>
            <li> the past did not help.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its small size allows me to carry it in my car and in my handbag so that its on hand</li>
            <li> Not really sure it works; maybe</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some years and have been unable to get it locally</li>
            <li> This brand is hard to find in drugstores.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in stores like CVS, Walgreens, Target, etc.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell ya if it works or not - I couldn&#x27;t get past the flavor!</li>
            <li> A lot of money for not a good product.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth is very uncomfortable, and a couple sprays of Oasis solves the problem.  </li>
            <li> Biotene breath spray was taken off the market due to a labeling glitch and I was desperate to find another</li>
            <li> This product is useless.</li>
            <li> I helps keep my mouth moist when I am unable to use gum or liquids.  </li>
            <li> It also had a weird metallic taste to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not crazy about the flavor</li>
            <li> It may work well with someone,that is not as bad as I am.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad</li>

            <li> Well it made my breath smell fresh and numbed my tongue a little but didn&#x27;t really make my mouth anymore moist than it is.</li>
            <li> The spray was not quite what I expected. It didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped. It also left an after taste much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me, I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> First product I&#x27;ve ever wound that works and has a pleasant taste</li>
            <li> Nice minty taste, helps with an unpleasant problem.</li>
            <li> it was delivered on time anyways it&#x27;s really good I I&#x27;m amazed at it to keep my  now from being dry which prevent my mail from getting cavities.</li>
            <li> Two sprays is not enough to moisten my mouth.  Warning on package not to use more than 60 sprays a day.  Biotene mouthwash works much better.  I can&#x27;t see any use for this unless you sprayed repeatedly constantly.  I have dry mouth.  This product is useless.</li>
            <li> This is the first mouth moisturizer that I have found that really is helpful.  I squirt about 3 squirts in my mouth and that mostly lasts the whole night.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth.  I use it every day. I like the taste.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy this product again. Is sticky and then rinses out of mouth. No moisture left behind.</li>
            <li> My mouth was always dry from using a CPAP at night.  So much so I&#x27;d wake up very uncomfortable.  Four shots of this and my mouth is great.  I do wear a chin strap at night.  One thing, I never knew this but it comes in flavors.  The last two I purchased were &amp;#34;Mint&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s an acquired taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had ever worsening &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; for more than a dozen years. During most that time, I&#x27;ve used Biotene - until they changed their formulation. More recently, I&#x27;ve been &#x27;experimenting&#x27; with different sprays and gels and rinses. Probably seven or eight so far.&lt;br /&gt;Didja ever taste Kaopectate? It&#x27;s for diarrhea. I remember it from as far back as when I was a kid, in the 1950&#x27;s. If you&#x27;ve never tried it, and yer curious (lord knows why that would be!), buy some Oasis Dry Mouth Moisturizing Spray. You&#x27;ll get the idea..... That is NOT a compliment! I think this stuff tastes awful! I couldn&#x27;t tell ya if it works or not - I couldn&#x27;t get past the flavor!</li>
            <li> I prefer the Rain spray - but this one does what it is supposed to do just not as appealing</li>
            <li> Oasis Mousturizing Mouth Sray has been very effective! The sprays I have used&lt;br /&gt;in the past did not help.&lt;br /&gt;I have  Sjogrens.&lt;br /&gt;MDB</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would wake up with an extremely dry throat.  But when I spray before going to sleep, that doesn&#x27;t happen.  I love it.  Very mild tolerable taste.</li>
            <li> This product works much better than the other dry mouth moisturizers on the market. It has a nice fresh taste and isn&#x27;t thick like the others. Just wish I didn&#x27;t have to buy it online since I can&#x27;t find it in stores any longer.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor tastes good but it doesn&#x27;t help keep my mouth moist. I sure wish there was something out there that worked good. I guess I will keep searching.</li>
            <li> I have very severe dry mouth due to medication.  I tried this product, it help for a moment,&lt;br /&gt;I had to go on prescription to try and solve this problem.  It may work well with someone,that is not as bad as I am.</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver for people who have constant dry mouth.It lasts longer than other brands and freshens breath too.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Mouth Spray on the market.  It is the only one that truly works!</li>
            <li> It keeps my mouth moisturize and smelling great, if you have dry mouth or throat at you gotta try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked in the dental field for over 8 years and this is the only mouth spray I use and recommend. The mint is very mild like it says and the product last longer then other brands in keeping my mouth moist.  Convenient to carry in my purse and use whenever needed.</li>
            <li> For persistent dry mouth, this is a valued moment of relief.&lt;br /&gt;both the mouthwash and the mist are incredibly useful</li>
            <li> SOMEONE POSTED THAT THE TASTE HAD CHANGED. WELL, I CAN TELL BECAUSE IT&#x27;S NOT SO GOOD. WISH THEY WOULD LEAVE THINGS ALONE. OTHER THAN THAT, IT WORKS WELL TO PROVIDE MOISTURE IN YOUR MOUTH.</li>
            <li> It is much better tasting than the other one on the market that gets all the publicity!  Dry mouth is very uncomfortable, and a couple sprays of Oasis solves the problem.  Works quite well at bedtime, so you can fall asleep easier.</li>
            <li> This is the best tasting and working product for dry mouth as a result of meds. This brand is hard to find in drugstores.</li>
            <li> I have tried various brands of mouthwash and mouth gel for dry mouth and so far this is the most effective one I find. Its small size allows me to carry it in my car and in my handbag so that its on hand whenever I need it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spray so much as squirt into your mouth.  I have a CPAP machine and was looking for a product to keep me from waking up with &amp;#34;dry mouth.&amp;#34;  It takes 4 squirts to coat the mouth (and there&#x27;s only 140 squirts in the bottle) and it doesn&#x27;t last all night.  Biotine works just as well and is much cheaper.  Both have glycerine water as the major ingredient.  It works fine, but as I said Biotine is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works better than others I&#x27;ve tried. Carry one with me, keep one on my bedside table.</li>
            <li> it s ok, but can be shipper</li>
            <li> Not really sure it works; maybe</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in any store and this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it worked better than the Biotene spray I was using.  I doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that helps with having a dry mouth!</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth due to some of my meds.  I use Oasis spray at night - keep it by my bed.  I helps keep my mouth moist when I am unable to use gum or liquids.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> would have been okay but too sweet and sticky and dribbled instead of spraying. Here are six more wods:  it is not satisfactory. for my use.</li>
            <li> Good price and quality! It is hard to locate locally</li>
            <li> The best spray that I have found. I will order again and again. I have terrible dry mouth pretty much 24/7 and this is one dry mouth spray that really works. In my opinion it is better than biotene mouth watering spray.</li>
            <li> Mom has used Biotene for years and I thought that I would buy this for her to try because of the great reviews. She is 89. It works as well as Biotene but she likes the ease and size of the Biotene bottle better. I tried it and it seems to work just as well</li>
            <li> I have Sjogrens Syndrome (dry mouth)  I have been using this product for quite some years and have been unable to get it locally It is my best go to  temporary treatment.</li>
            <li> Great product, works as advertised and priced right. Have dry mouth? Get this and it should take care of your problem. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The sprayer dispenses a sharp stream not a mist. Not very effective. Won&#x27;t buy again. A lot of money for not a good product.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with dry mouth due to medications that I take.  Exercebating the problem is that I now sleep with a CPAP machine which makes my mouth even dryer.  Oasis Moisturizing Mouth Spray helps immensely with the problem.  I put in several squirts as I retire for the night and it helps.</li>
            <li> Out of the 4 mouth Sprays this one did the best it last about a hour and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad I would recomend it as a quick relief on the go I keep it in my truck and next to my bed at night I would buy this again. If you need longer relief the mouth tablets are the best</li>
            <li> It helps my dry mouth but the taste isn&#x27;t very likeable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not crazy about the flavor but it does seem to do the job</li>
            <li> I use a cpap machine and it complicates my dry mouth caused by medications.  I like this much better than other brands and it  has good lasting power while sleeping.</li>
            <li> This product is simular to biotene which I have used for a couple years. I was very pleased as I have extreme dry mouth and this helps me very much.Biotene breath spray was taken off the market due to a labeling glitch and I was desperate to find another product.&lt;br /&gt;The sellar was very fast to supply my order.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, CZiegler</li>
            <li> These types of sprays help if you&#x27;re on a medicine that&#x27;s causing dry mouth or if you&#x27;ve eaten a salty meal and get thirsty but don&#x27;t want to drink too much water before bed. At first we weren&#x27;t sure this brand would be as good as Biotene, but it is. In fact, because the other seemingly changed its formula, we might like this one more. The bottles for this brand have consistently sprayed evenly, it works well at doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do, tastes good and even comes in small, cylindrical travel vials.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Oasis since I had adverse reactions to other mouth washes.  The spray is helpful when the regular mouthwash is not convenient and the mild mint flavor is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Tried the other mouth sprays on the market. This far surpassed the others. Better taste too. It works on contact great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oasis Moisturizing Mouth Spray for a couple of years for dry mouth.  It has worked for me.  I only use it during the night, when I wake up with a dry mouth.  I have tried another brand and Oasis is so much better.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night and have been using it for a few years.  I don&#x27;t care for the taste of the other products out there, just too strong for me.  I am on oxygen 24-7 and take medication that dries out one&#x27;s nose and mouth.  It&#x27;s really a pain at night when you are trying to sleep and wake up thinking you have cotton in one&#x27;s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue ordering this online since they don&#x27;t sell it anymore in the stores that I can find.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Perfect for moisturizing mouth at home, during the night, and on the go. I have dry mouth from medications and also from Sjogrens syndrome. This tastes so much better than other mouth moisturizers I have tried, and smells fresh too. Always make sure the top is on tightly after using so none leaks out. I keep one in my purse and one on my night table. A must for comfort for dry mouth sufferers.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry-mouth this is the solution.  Tastes great &amp; lubricates the mouth for a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> The best tasting dry mouth spray!</li>
            <li> works good for dry mouth delivered on time</li>
            <li> Have been very pleased with the fast service of receiving this product. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great &amp; available. A little cheaper than other brand. Carry in my purse &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leak. I have dry mouth from meds I take</li>
            <li> My father has thrush and they used a moisturizing product at the hospital that was so vile that my father refused to have anymore of it.  However, he had no issues with this Oasis product because the taste was so much more pleasant.  It is a very easy to use product as well - just a couple pumps of the spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Major allergic reaction from this product.</li>
            <li> Felt very sticky at night.</li>
            <li> Best mouth spray I&#x27;ve tried. This product is hard to find in stores like CVS, Walgreens, Target, etc.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this would replace my current regiment of dry mouth toothpaste and rinse. I suffer with very dry mouth at night and was hoping this might help. I got absolutely no relief with this spray. It also had a weird metallic taste to it.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!.  The product works and helps her through the day.  The only product that really helps my wife since she had cancer.</li>
