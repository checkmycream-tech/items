            <li>This is great for thorough cleaning</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is a great value.</li>

            <li>Great toothbrush saves a lot of time and energy because it does all the work.</li>
            <li>The one great aspect of this tooth brush is the heads it uses.  </li>
            <li>Great product and great service.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li>so not so happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>For the price this is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a great job.  </li>
            <li>These are a great deal.</li>
            <li>It is very nice for the price.</li>
            <li>As for cleaning teeth it&#x27;s OK and excellent for gum massage.</li>
            <li>and it does not get my teeth as clean as this one does!!!</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift and they loved it</li>
            <li>For the money, this is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>These work the best and get your teeth really clean without all the pressure.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>and it has just the right amount of pressure and cleans and treats the gums great!!!!</li>
            <li>and now he has his own to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PRO&#x27;s: softer rotation &amp; gentle- perfect if you have braces, like me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using electric toothbrushes my whole life, and for the money, this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>Effective and durable.</li>
            <li>not the built up kind anyway....</li>
            <li>I use to own a Sonic Care.  </li>
            <li>The wiring is attached to the battery using some kind of adhesive connector.  </li>
            <li>my spinbrush from the drugstore does a better job</li>
            <li>Buy a better one.</li>
            <li>This is of course better than a manual toothbrush, and for the price and rechargability, I give it three stars.</li>
            <li>You reach more spots with this tooth brush and it decreases cavities.</li>
            <li>He does much better though.  </li>
            <li>I would love this brush head with the Oral-B&#x27;s power.  </li>
            <li>I love the this product.</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with the efficency of it.</li>
            <li>however I still love it.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel nice and clean after use.</li>
            <li>This cordless electric toothbrush seems to get my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>I think this is a pretty good electric toothbrush for the price.  </li>
            <li>Other that these items, it is an ok brush that does what it is supposed to-just doesn&#x27;t do it as best as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She seems to like it and it keeps her teeth clean :-)</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and reach in the mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and has a strong vibration but doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums.</li>
            <li>is to strong for my kids  </li>
            <li>Wife says not as strong as  her</li>
            <li>When I got it I used it that night and it worked fine, needed charging of course</li>
            <li>if it just ran faster, it would be just fine.</li>
            <li>so I am glad I found an economical toothbrush that has heads available.</li>
            <li>removes the film from your teeth in the AM...but does not do such a great job on plaque.  </li>
            <li>It is the most powerful one that I have owned [over the course of 25 years].</li>
            <li>Bought it because it was cheap</li>
            <li>Oral-B customers that moved away thinking this top brand would be good will return to Oral-B the next purchase.  </li>
            <li>Definitely makes your teeth feel very clean and bright.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and smooth after every use, and it has helped my gums become stronger as well.</li>
            <li>I think what got me originally besides the price was the description of the number of times a minute the brushhead spins.</li>
            <li>Then I ordered the original which they have stopped making.</li>
            <li>And in case you wonder if this one was a fluke I returned the original believing it was defective.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after brushing with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>doesnt do anything special...</li>
            <li>after i started to use this special electric  toothbrush its looks</li>
            <li>You can get cheaper battery powered toothbrushes that spin better and don&#x27;t wear out as fast.</li>
            <li>For $14 - good enough</li>
            <li>This seemed underpowered and wore out quickly.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find an adequate battery holder and I&#x27;ve never seen a connector like that before (and can&#x27;t find anybody that has)</li>
            <li>This little cordless toothbrush is very effective to clean and polish your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush really does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that this toothbrush rotates, rather than just vibrate, and it isn&#x27;t so powerful that it knocks out your fillings.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for about 3 months, after which the plastic part on the main part that connects to brush broke.  </li>
            <li>I will be stocking up on these as Conair changes things so fast but have used thier products for the last 4 years and very pleased with the Plaque Removers.  </li>
            <li>It makes cleaning inner side of teeth row, and molar ends in the back easier and more effective than a manual tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Again, not sure why they made it this way as the faster spin is a great massage on the gum while brushing.  </li>
            <li>This one rates as OK for one reason only.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought I just had a defective one</li>
            <li>The first OptiClean Cordless tooth brush lasted for five years.</li>
            <li>I knew that my Oral B did not cost a lot and did not want to spend a lot to replace it, nor did I want a &amp;#34;super sonic&amp;#34; brush that vibrated my whole head like some of the electric toothbrushes do!  </li>
            <li>The first one has a battery that is not replaceable.  </li>
            <li>This brush gives a deep clean and leave my teeth feeling squeaky clean for the majority of the day even after eating.</li>
            <li>I stopped using Colgate Total for possible health reasons and surprisingly noticed an increase.</li>
            <li>Affordable and as good as the more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li>I only use it three to four times a week since I have a good regular electric tooth brush also.</li>
            <li>I have used this model over a number of years and it is as good in my opinion as more expensive types.</li>
            <li>You will spend 150-200 dollars on a toothbrush that does the same job this one does for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This does seem to be a long lasting good alternative.  </li>
            <li>They work well, but I find that the brushes aren&#x27;t strong enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I was glad I ordered it; however, I feel I perhaps expected too much from the product.  </li>
            <li>It works and it spins, almost too fast.</li>
            <li>The OptiClean Plaque Remover was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>He really likes it alot.</li>
            <li>I have to say so far this is a powerful device.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CON&#x27;s: softer rotation &amp; gentle-</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get tartar &amp; plaque very well.</li>
            <li>that just seems very wasteful.</li>
            <li>The fact that they are rechargeable is a real plus.</li>
            <li>It was cheap and simple.  </li>
            <li>Was very upset with it.</li>
            <li>Does not spin as fast as I hoped for</li>
            <li>but I really ike this item.</li>
            <li>You really have to play around with the ON button to make to turn it on.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush  also spins extremely fast as a matter of fact it spins so fast that it almost doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s even spinning at all</li>
            <li>but you can tell that it&#x27;s spinning because once the battery weekend you can see the whole rotation of the brush and when you put it up against your teeth and gums  think You can feel it.</li>
            <li>This device is now under my sink for next time that I need to clean grout.... will not reorder.</li>
            <li>It operates with much more power than my previous electric toothbrush (the Oral-B Vitality Sonic).</li>
            <li>So, I can no longer attach the brush to main part.  </li>
            <li>It was ok, go for a more expensive one though...</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong after 6 months, uses up less batteries than the Opti-Clean and IMO, has sufficient speed and power that is at least as good as the Opti-Clean.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this-</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>have for many years had a little gum recession on one or two teeth.</li>
            <li>Great head, mediocre performance.</li>
            <li>It performs as good as other High Priced Brands and the cost of the replacement brushes are much less costly.  </li>
            <li>The new one arrived in no time.  </li>
            <li>Compared with most other models, this one is very low speed.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The replacement was the exact same.</li>
            <li>This is  replacement item for the exact same model I had.</li>
            <li>When it is time to buy new head I actually buy a whole new brush.  </li>
            <li>For a \\&quot;use at home\\&quot; plaque cleaner, it&#x27;s certainly recommended versus ignoring your teeth and do not attend your Dentist&#x27;s office regular cleaning.  </li>
            <li>and I like it even better as it gets into hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>Early to tell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;CON&#x27;s: because the bristles are so soft-</li>
            <li>It virtually stops if you put too much pressure on it (against your teeth) and the battery life is next to nothing--about 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the old Oral-B&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one, the buttons wear out fast</li>
            <li>I use this every day and my teeth feel so much cleaner compared to using a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>The charging base is a wonderful convenience.</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptic about trying this model because it was round just like every other model out there</li>
            <li>The same is true on the other end of the battery.</li>
            <li>The size of brush allows for optimal cleaning in hard and easy to reach places.  </li>
            <li>I used to love the square shaped model but after a year of hard use it finally died on me and Conair stop making that model.</li>
            <li>like power - style of handle -ease in using-do not like when put on charger over night to recharge red light stays on does not go to green that would indicate charged</li>
            <li>the only draw back is that replacement heads cost as much s</li>
            <li>This is the second Conair plaque remover I have tried (first one and same additionals with flat toothbrush head).  </li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t press hard on your teeth and gum lines with this brush, I think you will be satisfied with this electric brush.</li>
            <li>I choose for the price, I am very pleased so far, the small  head gets to the hard to reach places, and the bristles are sturdy but flexable.</li>
            <li>Even with less expensive battery powered spin brushes, I get a better clean than I do with this thing.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done, barely.</li>
            <li>Head rotation is much faster than hand manual brushing, but slower than other electric toothbrush equivalent makes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that no other reviewers have had the same problem I&#x27;ve encountered.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are too soft and too long.</li>
            <li>This is my first round head brush</li>
            <li>Something more than up and down back and forth business as usual brushing was needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this would really help a person with breath because a lot of time bad breath comes from a. Lack of flossing because most people don&#x27;t floss</li>

            <li> It worked fine for about 3 months, after which the plastic part on the main part that connects to brush broke.  </li>
            <li> I will be stocking up on these as Conair changes things so fast but have used thier products for the last 4 years and very pleased with the Plaque Removers.  </li>
            <li> It makes cleaning inner side of teeth row, and molar ends in the back easier and more effective than a manual tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> Again, not sure why they made it this way as the faster spin is a great massage on the gum while brushing.  </li>
            <li> This one rates as OK for one reason only.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought I just had a defective one</li>
            <li> The first OptiClean Cordless tooth brush lasted for five years.</li>
            <li> I knew that my Oral B did not cost a lot and did not want to spend a lot to replace it, nor did I want a &amp;#34;super sonic&amp;#34; brush that vibrated my whole head like some of the electric toothbrushes do!  </li>
            <li> The first one has a battery that is not replaceable.  </li>
            <li> This brush gives a deep clean and leave my teeth feeling squeaky clean for the majority of the day even after eating.</li>
            <li> I stopped using Colgate Total for possible health reasons and surprisingly noticed an increase.</li>
            <li> Affordable and as good as the more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li> I only use it three to four times a week since I have a good regular electric tooth brush also.</li>
            <li> I have used this model over a number of years and it is as good in my opinion as more expensive types.</li>
            <li> You will spend 150-200 dollars on a toothbrush that does the same job this one does for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This does seem to be a long lasting good alternative.  </li>
            <li> They work well, but I find that the brushes aren&#x27;t strong enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I was glad I ordered it; however, I feel I perhaps expected too much from the product.  </li>
            <li> It works and it spins, almost too fast.</li>
            <li> The OptiClean Plaque Remover was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> He really likes it alot.</li>
            <li> I have to say so far this is a powerful device.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CON&#x27;s: softer rotation &amp; gentle-</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get tartar &amp; plaque very well.</li>
            <li> that just seems very wasteful.</li>
            <li> The fact that they are rechargeable is a real plus.</li>
            <li> It was cheap and simple.  </li>
            <li> Was very upset with it.</li>
            <li> Does not spin as fast as I hoped for</li>
            <li> but I really ike this item.</li>
            <li> You really have to play around with the ON button to make to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush  also spins extremely fast as a matter of fact it spins so fast that it almost doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s even spinning at all</li>
            <li> but you can tell that it&#x27;s spinning because once the battery weekend you can see the whole rotation of the brush and when you put it up against your teeth and gums  think You can feel it.</li>
            <li> This device is now under my sink for next time that I need to clean grout.... will not reorder.</li>
            <li> It operates with much more power than my previous electric toothbrush (the Oral-B Vitality Sonic).</li>
            <li> So, I can no longer attach the brush to main part.  </li>
            <li> It was ok, go for a more expensive one though...</li>
            <li> and it is still going strong after 6 months, uses up less batteries than the Opti-Clean and IMO, has sufficient speed and power that is at least as good as the Opti-Clean.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this-</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> have for many years had a little gum recession on one or two teeth.</li>
            <li> Great head, mediocre performance.</li>
            <li> It performs as good as other High Priced Brands and the cost of the replacement brushes are much less costly.  </li>
            <li> The new one arrived in no time.  </li>
            <li> Compared with most other models, this one is very low speed.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The replacement was the exact same.</li>
            <li> This is  replacement item for the exact same model I had.</li>
            <li> When it is time to buy new head I actually buy a whole new brush.  </li>
            <li> For a \\&quot;use at home\\&quot; plaque cleaner, it&#x27;s certainly recommended versus ignoring your teeth and do not attend your Dentist&#x27;s office regular cleaning.  </li>
            <li> and I like it even better as it gets into hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> Early to tell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;CON&#x27;s: because the bristles are so soft-</li>
            <li> It virtually stops if you put too much pressure on it (against your teeth) and the battery life is next to nothing--about 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the old Oral-B&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one, the buttons wear out fast</li>
            <li> I use this every day and my teeth feel so much cleaner compared to using a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The charging base is a wonderful convenience.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptic about trying this model because it was round just like every other model out there</li>
            <li> The same is true on the other end of the battery.</li>
            <li> The size of brush allows for optimal cleaning in hard and easy to reach places.  </li>
            <li> I used to love the square shaped model but after a year of hard use it finally died on me and Conair stop making that model.</li>
            <li> like power - style of handle -ease in using-do not like when put on charger over night to recharge red light stays on does not go to green that would indicate charged</li>
            <li> the only draw back is that replacement heads cost as much s</li>
            <li> This is the second Conair plaque remover I have tried (first one and same additionals with flat toothbrush head).  </li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t press hard on your teeth and gum lines with this brush, I think you will be satisfied with this electric brush.</li>
            <li> I choose for the price, I am very pleased so far, the small  head gets to the hard to reach places, and the bristles are sturdy but flexable.</li>
            <li> Even with less expensive battery powered spin brushes, I get a better clean than I do with this thing.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done, barely.</li>
            <li> Head rotation is much faster than hand manual brushing, but slower than other electric toothbrush equivalent makes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that no other reviewers have had the same problem I&#x27;ve encountered.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft and too long.</li>
            <li> This is my first round head brush</li>
            <li> Something more than up and down back and forth business as usual brushing was needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this would really help a person with breath because a lot of time bad breath comes from a. Lack of flossing because most people don&#x27;t floss</li>
            <li> However, I was used to a more expensive sonic toothbrush, which really cleaned much better; I tried this one because I got frustrated that two in a row of the others broke, and I was tired of shelling out so much money of a product with clearly planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so long that it literally has no advantage in removing plaque.</li>
            <li> My husband did not like it at all because he says that it takes too long.</li>
            <li> But for as inexpensive as this is and long that it lasts...</li>
            <li> its the same as any other powered toothbrush with a spinning head.  </li>
            <li> I have tried different brands (Sonicare was the worst with the high pitch sound) and found them to aggressive for sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I had an interplak once before, but the batery life was limited and after a bit would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> After about 30 years of using the original, this one was uncomfortable and too wide.</li>
            <li> an addendum, this past June I purchased an Oral B \\&quot;Complete</li>
            <li> is not powerful enough to remove plaque...</li>
            <li> so i just switched over to a regular electric toothbrush for half the price.</li>
            <li> My second brush arrived with a small crack in the housing before it even left the clam shell packaging.</li>
            <li> but because it was so inexpensive, I was afraid it would be cheap.</li>
            <li> save the $$$$, you need the more expensive model I believe for serious plaque removal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a good as the old bristle-twisting Interplax toohtbrushes were.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other powered tooth brushes and this never happened.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive brush but other inexpensive toothbrushes don&#x27;t break like this.  </li>
            <li> I believe the old one failed because I left the charger on 24-7.</li>
            <li> but this does job because I often floss after I brush to see if I left anything behind but after brushing with this toothbrush there was nothing left and that does not aways happen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rough to use</li>
            <li> brush does not seem very powerful, which isn&#x27;t necessarily bad for everyone, but since using it, I have had &amp;#34;crud&amp;#34; stuck on my front teeth that I can&#x27; t seem to polish off with this brush.  </li>
            <li> I wear them down within a week or 2.  </li>
            <li> sometimes machine is jumpy (turns on/off or slows down while brushing)</li>
            <li> &quot; electric toothbrush for a couple of bucks less than the Opti-Clean.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads are so expensive that instead of buying them he just gets a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I would like to see it come with four brushes, because I have 2 people using it and the 2 brushes do not last that long,and because the brushes are expensive to reorder it is cheaper to buy a new complete set, which gets to be very expensive.</li>
            <li> Lots of money for little cleaning.</li>
            <li> Well, as my Momma use to say, sometimes you just gotta pay a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have owned other electric toothbrushes in the past and buck for buck</li>
            <li> have used this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Round toothbrushes rule..</li>
            <li> Round is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have now ordered this toothbrush 4 times and EACH time the handle cracks within a few days of use--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Bought 2 at the same time, one charging unit failed to function within 2-3 weeks - other one is now servicing all the tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I really do like how it cleans</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the heads are specific to this brush.  </li>
            <li> I have paid 5x this amount for toothbrushes in the past because I just have to have an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> The motor runs the brush head rather slow compared to the competition.  </li>
            <li> The other failed within 1 month after switch no longer powered the unit on.  </li>
            <li> I decided to order this since it was less expensive than ordering replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> Bad customer support -- they try to find any excuse not to give you a service number for warranty replacement.</li>
            <li> it works, but not great.</li>
            <li> I have duct taped the bottom to hold the broken pieces in place</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it comes in hard plastic that requires cutting to get it out of the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are just shy of a king&#x27;s ransom, but we&#x27;re stuck.</li>
            <li> 2 of 2 units have failed.  </li>
            <li> One failed to rotate the brush after 1 year.  </li>
            <li> I beat up the heads so bad, that I can throw it out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and once a day isn&#x27;t a bad schedual to keep.</li>
            <li> Comes with two brush heads, and a charging base.</li>
            <li> Conair&#x27;s customer service is the worst</li>
            <li> Horrible!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought 2 at the same time, one charging unit failed to function within 2-3 weeks - other one is now servicing all the tooth brushes. Not good...can&#x27;t figure out why this product has a two year guarantee, but is not returnable or exchangeable after one month...?</li>
            <li> people review these things online way too soon.    its the same as any other powered toothbrush with a spinning head.  doesnt do anything special...the head doesnt even spin it just turns back and forth about 10 degrees.    the heads were used up within about 2-2 1/2 mothns so i just switched over to a regular electric toothbrush for half the price.</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good electric toothbrush for the price.  It makes cleaning inner side of teeth row, and molar ends in the back easier and more effective than a manual tooth brush.  As long as you don&#x27;t press hard on your teeth and gum lines with this brush, I think you will be satisfied with this electric brush.</li>
            <li> Very good value. Works well.</li>
            <li> I think what got me originally besides the price was the description of the number of times a minute the brushhead spins. It sounded like a lot. It was and it is. It works and it spins, almost too fast. Do not turn it on and then put toothpaste on it. Do not even put toothpaste on it and THEN turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;Put toothpaste on it put it IN your mouth, against your teeth, and then turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have for many years had a little gum recession on one or two teeth. I stopped using Colgate Total for possible health reasons and surprisingly noticed an increase. Something more than up and down back and forth business as usual brushing was needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this electric dental appliance. It may be a teensiest tad underpowered but does seem to do what it is supposed to do quite well. As to whether it will help solve my gum problem time will tell.</li>
            <li> This is the second Conair plaque remover I have tried (first one and same additionals with flat toothbrush head).  This is my first round head brush and I like it even better as it gets into hard to reach places.  I have tried different brands (Sonicare was the worst with the high pitch sound) and found them to aggressive for sensitive teeth and gums.  These work the best and get your teeth really clean without all the pressure.  I will be stocking up on these as Conair changes things so fast but have used thier products for the last 4 years and very pleased with the Plaque Removers.  I did NOT like the waterjet machine they put out as it has no power but am using Panasonic portable water jet and it has just the right amount of pressure and cleans and treats the gums great!!!!</li>
            <li> This seemed underpowered and wore out quickly.  You can get cheaper battery powered toothbrushes that spin better and don&#x27;t wear out as fast. This device is now under my sink for next time that I need to clean grout.... will not reorder.</li>
            <li> The OptiClean Plaque Remover was very inexpensive. I paid $19.00 total for this toothbrush. It came with two heads and the fact that it is rechargeable is convenient. It operates with much more power than my previous electric toothbrush (the Oral-B Vitality Sonic). The Vitality Sonic toothbrush heads are not made anymore so I am glad I found an economical toothbrush that has heads available.</li>
            <li> I have one and he users it. mine and now he has his own to use. He really likes it alot.</li>
            <li> I had an interplak once before, but the batery life was limited and after a bit would not hold a charge. I switched to a sonic care. Sonic care is a rip off. Lots of money for little cleaning. Now I have an interplak again and my mouth is refreshed after using. I should have bought 2.</li>
            <li> This is great for thorough cleaning</li>
            <li> When I got it I used it that night and it worked fine, needed charging of course and it did but then I woke up next morning to find My gums were swollen 3 places. I can not use this. I&#x27;ve used other powered tooth brushes and this never happened. I will stick to Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am allergic?</li>
            <li> Affordable and as good as the more expensive versions.  You don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money to get quality.</li>
            <li> I was glad I ordered it; however, I feel I perhaps expected too much from the product.  It&#x27;s a little rough to use and I recommend it for once a week use.  For a \\&quot;use at home\\&quot; plaque cleaner, it&#x27;s certainly recommended versus ignoring your teeth and do not attend your Dentist&#x27;s office regular cleaning.  This does seem to be a long lasting good alternative.  Yes, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Early to tell.  It works well and should.  Replacement brushes are just shy of a king&#x27;s ransom, but we&#x27;re stuck.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was ordered to replace one that my kids broke. The toothbrush is a great value. The charging base is a wonderful convenience. I happy to that I don&#x27;t have to change any batteries with it.</li>
            <li> I have to say so far this is a powerful device. I only use it three to four times a week since I have a good regular electric tooth brush also. However after several uses, I can feel and see the difference. I feel that it will make a difference the next time I go to the dentist for my regular check up and cleaning.</li>
            <li> This seems to have very low power, so low revolutions.  if it just ran faster, it would be just fine.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this- it works, but not great. It gets the job done, barely. Wish I would&#x27;ve just bought the Oral-B/Sonic..&lt;br /&gt;Long bristles-&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s: softer rotation &amp; gentle- perfect if you have braces, like me.&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s: softer rotation &amp; gentle- it doesn&#x27;t get tartar &amp; plaque very well. I had to go back over my teeth/braces w/a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable-&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s: the red-light indicator show&#x27;s it&#x27;s being charged&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s: the red-light always stays on- you never know if it&#x27;s fully charged, or still charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Speed-&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s: 1 speed makes it &#x27;idiot-proof&#x27;- you just turn it on&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s: because the bristles are so soft- you&#x27;d need a faster speed to help dislodge the tartar/plaque.</li>
            <li> Best buy in an electric toothbrush.  I have used this model over a number of years and it is as good in my opinion as more expensive types.</li>
            <li> is to strong for my kids  but it works,</li>
            <li> my spinbrush from the drugstore does a better job</li>
            <li> Why would anyone use anything else? My dental visits have drop and my teeth improved (both dentist could not believe the improvement).</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter when she got braces. She seems to like it and it keeps her teeth clean :-)</li>
            <li> After about 30 years of using the original, this one was uncomfortable and too wide. Then I ordered the original which they have stopped making. See next review.</li>
            <li> I may be charging it incorrectly - but it does not stay charged.  Do not like it.  Buy a better one.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-B Sonicare system for years.  I decided to order this since it was less expensive than ordering replacement heads.  Well, as my Momma use to say, sometimes you just gotta pay a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for a few weeks now and I am just waiting for one of two things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The it dies and I can throw it out&lt;br /&gt;2.  I beat up the heads so bad, that I can throw it out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you can&#x27;t tell, I want to toss it out.....It virtually stops if you put too much pressure on it (against your teeth) and the battery life is next to nothing--about 2 days.  Even with less expensive battery powered spin brushes, I get a better clean than I do with this thing.  My suggestion for you is save your money.</li>
            <li> like power - style of handle -ease in using-do not like when put on charger over night to recharge red light stays on does not go to green that would indicate charged</li>
            <li> Compared with most other models, this one is very low speed.  In fact I keep thinking the power is running out, even though the unit if fully charged.</li>
            <li> This is of course better than a manual toothbrush, and for the price and rechargability, I give it three stars. However, I was used to a more expensive sonic toothbrush, which really cleaned much better; I tried this one because I got frustrated that two in a row of the others broke, and I was tired of shelling out so much money of a product with clearly planned obsolescence. However, you get what you pay for...with periodontal disease, I have to go back to the more expensive products, which halted the periodontal disease four years ago when I started using them.</li>
            <li> the only draw back is that replacement heads cost as much s the tooth brush does.  When it is time to buy new head I actually buy a whole new brush.  that just seems very wasteful.</li>
            <li> Battery did not hold a charge, would not work. Returned for a refund</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for approx 8 months.  Easy to hold and reach in the mouth. For $14 - good enough</li>
            <li> this tooth brush works well</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush but the battery life isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft and too long. Got it to stimulate my gums and it stopped working two weeks into use. The bristles are so long that it literally has no advantage in removing plaque.</li>
            <li> This is not  rotary tooth brush, but it is as close as it can be!!&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a rotary brush from Bausch and Lomb, but they stopped making them years ago!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought a vibrating tooth brush and it does not get my teeth as clean as this one does!!!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush saves a lot of time and energy because it does all the work. You reach more spots with this tooth brush and it decreases cavities.</li>
            <li> My husband has purchased 3 or 4 of these.  They work well, but I find that the brushes aren&#x27;t strong enough for me.  I wear them down within a week or 2.  He does much better though.  The brush heads are so expensive that instead of buying them he just gets a new toothbrush.  I only use mine for travel, but he uses his all the time.  The fact that they are rechargeable is a real plus.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and they loved it 👍👍👍👍</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush based on the reviews.  It was cheap and simple.  It worked fine for about 3 months, after which the plastic part on the main part that connects to brush broke.  So, I can no longer attach the brush to main part.  I guess you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an addendum, this past June I purchased an Oral B \\&quot;Complete Action\\&quot; electric toothbrush for a couple of bucks less than the Opti-Clean.  It is now the end of December and it is still going strong after 6 months, uses up less batteries than the Opti-Clean and IMO, has sufficient speed and power that is at least as good as the Opti-Clean.</li>
            <li> I received this item within two days.  Unfortunately, it comes in hard plastic that requires cutting to get it out of the packaging.  I cannot return the item because it has been used.  It only worked once.  As soon as I tried to apply the brush to my teeth the second time, it died.  So, I put it back on the charger for a second day.  It died again when I tried to brush my teeth.  I changed the head, just in case.  It died again.  It is now in the trash.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I was hesitant to but because it was so inexpensive, I was afraid it would be cheap. Was so  glad to be wrong. This brush is great!! My teeth feel so clean. It&#x27;s easy to use and has a strong vibration but doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums. Would give it 10 stars if I could</li>
            <li> Been using electric toothbrushes my whole life, and for the money, this one is the best.  Effective and durable.</li>
            <li> Round toothbrushes rule.. I have always used the regular shaped electronic toothbrushes and they always left plaque on the edges surrounding my teeth by my gums. This brush gives a deep clean and leave my teeth feeling squeaky clean for the majority of the day even after eating. Round is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Does what I need it to</li>
            <li> We have used the cordless toothbrushes for decades.  This one rates as OK for one reason only.  The motor runs the brush head rather slow compared to the competition.  They must do this for a reason/purpose but after using the Oral-B&#x27;s I prefer the old Oral-B&#x27;s.  The one great aspect of this tooth brush is the heads it uses.  They are fat, varied texture to hit the spots and crevasses and goes deeper than the Oral-B&#x27;s do.  Unfortunately the heads are specific to this brush.  I would love this brush head with the Oral-B&#x27;s power.  Again, not sure why they made it this way as the faster spin is a great massage on the gum while brushing.  whoever decides that a weaker/slower motor was where to save money made a mistake.  Oral-B customers that moved away thinking this top brand would be good will return to Oral-B the next purchase.  And in case you wonder if this one was a fluke I returned the original believing it was defective.  The replacement was the exact same. Great head, mediocre performance.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that this toothbrush rotates, rather than just vibrate, and it isn&#x27;t so powerful that it knocks out your fillings.  I can&#x27;t believe that no other reviewers have had the same problem I&#x27;ve encountered.  I have now ordered this toothbrush 4 times and EACH time the handle cracks within a few days of use--no joke.  At first I thought I just had a defective one so I kept trying the product again because I do like the way it cleans. The handle cracks in the same place at the bottom where the handle curves in. My second brush arrived with a small crack in the housing before it even left the clam shell packaging. So, I&#x27;m on my 4th one and this one cracked within 4 days.  Conair&#x27;s customer service is the worst so I&#x27;m not even going to contact them again.  I have duct taped the bottom to hold the broken pieces in place and I hope this will prevent any further breakage.  It&#x27;s an inexpensive brush but other inexpensive toothbrushes don&#x27;t break like this.  It&#x27;s too bad because I really do like how it cleans and it&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve used since the Braun Interplak was discontinued years ago.</li>
            <li> This is our second purchase.  The first OptiClean Cordless tooth brush lasted for five years. Great product and great service.</li>
            <li> For the money, this is a good buy.  It&#x27;s just not a good as the old bristle-twisting Interplax toohtbrushes were.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the price. My teeth feel really clean after brushing with this toothbrush. You can&#x27;t beat the price for this product.</li>
            <li> removes the film from your teeth in the AM...but does not do such a great job on plaque.  I develop a lot of plaque on my bridge in lower mouth. thought this would do the trick to avoid me seeing my dentist every 3 months.  but nope.  is not powerful enough to remove plaque...not the built up kind anyway....so not so happy with this purchase.  would return it if I could, but its now used.  save the $$$$, you need the more expensive model I believe for serious plaque removal.</li>
            <li> 2 of 2 units have failed.  One failed to rotate the brush after 1 year.  The other failed within 1 month after switch no longer powered the unit on.  Charge lasts for only about two brushings.  Charger continually draws power.  The size of brush allows for optimal cleaning in hard and easy to reach places.  Head rotation is much faster than hand manual brushing, but slower than other electric toothbrush equivalent makes.  Cleans well.  2 year warranty.  Replacement cost under warranty is $3 per unit plus shipping costs to mail defective units to them.  1/2 hour phone wait to get replacement address and service number for warranty replacement.  Bad customer support -- they try to find any excuse not to give you a service number for warranty replacement.</li>
            <li> Was very upset with it. It was slower then the one I already have and it was 1/2 the price. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does not spin as fast as I hoped for</li>
            <li> I choose for the price, I am very pleased so far, the small  head gets to the hard to reach places, and the bristles are sturdy but flexable.</li>
            <li> So I was hesitant in getting an electrical spin brush but I wanted to give it a try. I received and It&#x27;s not so shabby. My husband did not like it at all because he says that it takes too long. I don&#x27;t mind getting all the nooks and crannies in my teeth. You do have to charge it after you used it about four times. Great product!</li>
            <li> For the price this is a great toothbrush.  It has exceeded my expectations and I believe my teeth are whiter now since using it.</li>
            <li> I love the this product. I have only one thing that I would like to see changed. The Power Plague Remover only comes with 2 brushes. I would like to see it come with four brushes, because I have 2 people using it and the 2 brushes do not last that long,and because the brushes are expensive to reorder it is cheaper to buy a new complete set, which gets to be very expensive.</li>
            <li> It was ok, go for a more expensive one though...</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a great job.  Your teeth feel nice and clean after use. It is very nice for the price.</li>
            <li> This cordless electric toothbrush seems to get my teeth very clean. I am quite satisfied with the efficency of it.</li>
            <li> Wife says not as strong as  her last one but it&#x27;s been working twice a day  since  Christmas.</li>
            <li> This little cordless toothbrush is very effective to clean and polish your teeth.  Definitely makes your teeth feel very clean and bright.  Gave it only four stars instead of five because it is a bit noisy/clunky sounding.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go along with the Pearl Drops Tooth Paste, in combination they work well and once a day isn&#x27;t a bad schedual to keep.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace an Opti-Clean that was burned out from being plugged into 220 outlet while on trip.  The new one arrived in no time.  It is the most powerful one that I have owned [over the course of 25 years].</li>
            <li> This is a replacement unit for one that burned out after 2 years. Bought it because it was cheap and I already had a supply of replacement heads. I believe the old one failed because I left the charger on 24-7. I will unplug this one when away for from home and only charge as needed. As for cleaning teeth it&#x27;s OK and excellent for gum massage. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is my second one, the buttons wear out fast however I still love it.</li>
            <li> after i started to use this special electric  toothbrush its looks like i been to the dentist for a cleaning...its perfect...</li>
            <li> This is our second OptiClean cordless tooth brush.  It performs as good as other High Priced Brands and the cost of the replacement brushes are much less costly.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> sometimes machine is jumpy (turns on/off or slows down while brushing) but I really ike this item. This is  replacement item for the exact same model I had.I will never go back to manual toothbrushes again!</li>
            <li> I had a simple Oral B by Braun that lasted FOREVER that finally died.  I knew that my Oral B did not cost a lot and did not want to spend a lot to replace it, nor did I want a &amp;#34;super sonic&amp;#34; brush that vibrated my whole head like some of the electric toothbrushes do!  I figured for $13 I&#x27;d give this brush a try......well, like they say, you get what you pay for......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush does not seem very powerful, which isn&#x27;t necessarily bad for everyone, but since using it, I have had &amp;#34;crud&amp;#34; stuck on my front teeth that I can&#x27; t seem to polish off with this brush.  Also, the on/off switch does not work well at all.  You really have to play around with the ON button to make to turn it on.  Other that these items, it is an ok brush that does what it is supposed to-just doesn&#x27;t do it as best as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase again and am purchasing another Oral B.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Has been charging for 24 hours now and still won&#x27;t work, I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!  Gave it away</li>
            <li> I used to love the square shaped model but after a year of hard use it finally died on me and Conair stop making that model. I was kind of skeptic about trying this model because it was round just like every other model out there but don&#x27;t be fooled because of the low price. I have paid 5x this amount for toothbrushes in the past because I just have to have an electric toothbrush but I do believe that Conair makes the best. This toothbrush gets all the particles from between your teeth and gums and it almost feels as if you are flossing, my mouth and has never felt cleaner. This toothbrush  also spins extremely fast as a matter of fact it spins so fast that it almost doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s even spinning at all but you can tell that it&#x27;s spinning because once the battery weekend you can see the whole rotation of the brush and when you put it up against your teeth and gums  think You can feel it. I think this would really help a person with breath because a lot of time bad breath comes from a. Lack of flossing because most people don&#x27;t floss but this does job because I often floss after I brush to see if I left anything behind but after brushing with this toothbrush there was nothing left and that does not aways happen.</li>
            <li> Pair this up with a polish and you have a great pair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a few years.  I use to own a Sonic Care.  These are way cheaper and basically the same thing.  These are a great deal.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really does a fantastic job. I have owned other electric toothbrushes in the past and buck for buck this is the best value! You will spend 150-200 dollars on a toothbrush that does the same job this one does for a more reasonable price. My teeth feel so clean and smooth after every use, and it has helped my gums become stronger as well. It&#x27;s like I just came from a dentist cleaning after every use. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my results! Buy it!!</li>
            <li> The first one has a battery that is not replaceable.  Well, it might be, but it&#x27;s not obvious how to.  The wiring is attached to the battery using some kind of adhesive connector.  That is, a connector is soldered to the wiring that then adheres to one pole of the battery.  The same is true on the other end of the battery. Couldn&#x27;t find an adequate battery holder and I&#x27;ve never seen a connector like that before (and can&#x27;t find anybody that has) or else I&#x27;d just have replaced the worn-out battery.  But for as inexpensive as this is and long that it lasts...what the heck! O...and it works well, too! Look mom! No cavities!</li>
            <li> Comes with two brush heads, and a charging base. I use this every day and my teeth feel so much cleaner compared to using a regular tooth brush. My teeth are also a lot whiter. The quality is wonderful and I will order again if needed!</li>
