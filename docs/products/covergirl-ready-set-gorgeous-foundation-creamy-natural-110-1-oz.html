    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am well impressed with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest using with a beauty blender rather than fingers for the best results.</li>
            <li>but I was quite impressed with this.</li>
            <li>AMAZING PRODUCT, IT COVERS PERFECTLY AND DONT NEED TO BE APPLIED DURING THE DAY.</li>
            <li>The coverage is great, and it doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
            <li>but I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>, this is great in a pinch or to put in a makeup bag for on the go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the color will be perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this brand and shade to anyone with very light skin, looking for that foundation they&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I did!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light coverage and not so great blending.</li>
            <li>Great foundation goes on smooth and blends well.</li>
            <li>I really liked this foundation, it blended well and evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>This foundation provides nice and even coverage.</li>
            <li>This is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been having a hard time finding a good color for me and this foundation is actually pretty perfect when I received it i kind of  favored it over the one I bought for myself.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation although it doesn&#x27;t stay all day.</li>
            <li>The coverage isn&#x27;t great and the consistency was not build-able or very blend-able.</li>
            <li>This one went on so smoothly, looked natural, and made my skin look so beautifully flawless.</li>
            <li>It feels more like a tinted moisturizer, but gives the coverage of a more intensive foundation.</li>
            <li>The ready set gorgeous is not one of my favorite liquid foundations I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very moisturizing which makes the blend a good combination of foundation and sunscreen/moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I especially love recommending it to other people that I know.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this because of that, but for those who don&#x27;t have an oily complexion, this should work just fine.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free from infuenster to test.</li>
            <li>(Influenster sent me this Foundation free of charge for the purpose of reviewing)  </li>
            <li>I received this in a VOXBOX from Influenster.com free of charge, and I agreed to share my opinion of it.</li>
            <li>Overall this foundation works very well and is perfect for the combination skin.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that it is my favorite foundation to purchase</li>
            <li>For anyone familiar with CoverGirl&#x27;s Outlast Stay Fabulous 3-in-1 foundation, this is a close cousin to it with one important difference: not as drying.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product after reading about it online and viewing some videos.</li>
            <li>It keeps your look clean and matte</li>
            <li>The color was surprisingly close to my skintone, although maybe a bit darker since it&#x27;s winter now, but once the sun comes back</li>
            <li>Thanks influenster for my free sample!</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t hold up very good, as my face got oilier than it usually would by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>This foundation is very light and more of a liquid than most foundations I&#x27;ve tried before which are usually have just a tad thicker of a formula.</li>
            <li>I received this in a VoxBox complimentary from Influenster to test out.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li>The color blends incredibly nicely so it doesn&#x27;t look like a different tone from my skin, AT ALL.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the coverage it provides me, and it feels so light while giving me coverage.</li>
            <li>I would say this a good foundation for makeup beginners due to the fact the product is just eh.</li>
            <li>Even being too dark though, I was able to blend it well enough that it still looked good.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to not work with drugstore products, resulting in me buying high end products from places like Sephora, but this product actually worked nicely.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more color range because this shade is a little too light for me, however I did get this complimentary of Influenster to try out.</li>
            <li>really like the coverage and texture of this foundation!</li>
            <li>It has a good amount of coverage without feeling too cakey or making my face look dried out</li>
            <li>but once in a while I will get a few here and there or some blemishes, so need a good foundation.</li>
            <li>First off, I have acne and really oily skin.</li>
            <li>This foundation is one of the only one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used (thanks to influenster) that really blends with my natural skin color and makes it look fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>I found that I can get the right shade and texture (since this product is on the heavy side and dries on the face) by mixing it with CoverGirl&#x27;s Smoothers BB cream which has very very light coverage</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very oily</li>
            <li>It also seems to go on a bit smoother, and I really like that it comes in a tube instead of a pump bottle</li>
            <li>But this did oxidize on me and turned me very orange...</li>
            <li>This was gentle and didn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>It also blended really well.</li>
            <li>&amp;the fact is that it is really affordable is</li>
            <li>really like the formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not quite sure whether it cause my skin to breakout since I tested the other products I use</li>
            <li>This is normal for my skin considering its acne prone and oily.</li>
            <li>The squeezy tube makes it easy to squeeze out too much product which is a waste.</li>
            <li>I received this in my Influenster VoxBox last month, and I really enjoy the matte finish this foundation gives, and it&#x27;s definitely build-able to a medium coverage.</li>
            <li>It does the job pretty well; evening out skin tone, making pore appear smaller, etc.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, not too light.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product if your looking to save a bit of money and don&#x27;t want to buy a high end foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard for me to find great foundations, since I have such pale skin.</li>
            <li>It does not look cakey and looks fairly natural, even by the end of the day my skin might not appear matte, but it definitely looks more like a subtle dewy and moisturized look instead of looking like I just stepped out of a sauna.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, just a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>My only complaint was that this was a bit too dark for my fair complexion</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>

            <li> I also like that it can be found in a wide variety of stores instead of just mall stores.</li>
            <li> However, the shade was darker than I expected, and I felt like it got darker with time after application.</li>

            <li> I have had trouble in the past finding one that will go on and not look a bit dry or unnatural.</li>
            <li> The coverage is alright, it evened out the appearance of my skintone, but it did little in covering my acne.</li>
            <li> They usually end up looking too dark, or too cake-y on my face.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I mostly never have acne</li>
            <li> However, being that it is a pharmacy foundation and not too expensive, I suppose the quality isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>

            <li> I love this foundation although it doesn&#x27;t stay all day. It&#x27;s easy to apply, just a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I would say this a good foundation for makeup beginners due to the fact the product is just eh. The ready set gorgeous is not one of my favorite liquid foundations I&#x27;ve tried and I have tried a lot. The coverage isn&#x27;t great and the consistency was not build-able or very blend-able. However, being that it is a pharmacy foundation and not too expensive, I suppose the quality isn&#x27;t too bad. I would compare this to a BB cream for it&#x27;s light coverage and not so great blending. Expect not the skin benefits of a BB cream.</li>
            <li> I received this product in my Dean&#x27;s List Voxbox from Influenster and I have to say, I am well impressed with it. My skin tends to not work with drugstore products, resulting in me buying high end products from places like Sephora, but this product actually worked nicely. It has a good amount of coverage without feeling too cakey or making my face look dried out and it is inexpensive. I also like that it can be found in a wide variety of stores instead of just mall stores. Adding this into my makeup routine pronto!</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT, IT COVERS PERFECTLY AND DONT NEED TO BE APPLIED DURING THE DAY.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product after reading about it online and viewing some videos. However, the shade was darker than I expected, and I felt like it got darker with time after application. I&#x27;m also not quite sure whether it cause my skin to breakout since I tested the other products I use and it&#x27;s certainly not them but need to test this one. I found that I can get the right shade and texture (since this product is on the heavy side and dries on the face) by mixing it with CoverGirl&#x27;s Smoothers BB cream which has very very light coverage but it&#x27;s very moisturizing which makes the blend a good combination of foundation and sunscreen/moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For anyone familiar with CoverGirl&#x27;s Outlast Stay Fabulous 3-in-1 foundation, this is a close cousin to it with one important difference: not as drying. I&#x27;m very oily and I could wear either of them, but if you have dry skin, this is the foundation for you. The benefits of the 3-in-1 without over drying your face. It also seems to go on a bit smoother, and I really like that it comes in a tube instead of a pump bottle (there&#x27;s always so much left in the bottle of the 3-in-1 when the pump stops!).</li>
            <li> The coverage is great, and it doesn&#x27;t look cakey. But this did oxidize on me and turned me very orange...</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from infuenster to test. I really liked this foundation, it blended well and evened out my skin tone. The foundation lasted all day and was lightweight, so I did not feel it. I would recommend this foundation from Covergirl</li>
            <li> This foundation is very light and more of a liquid than most foundations I&#x27;ve tried before which are usually have just a tad thicker of a formula. The coverage is alright, it evened out the appearance of my skintone, but it did little in covering my acne. It does not look cakey and looks fairly natural, even by the end of the day my skin might not appear matte, but it definitely looks more like a subtle dewy and moisturized look instead of looking like I just stepped out of a sauna. The color was surprisingly close to my skintone, although maybe a bit darker since it&#x27;s winter now, but once the sun comes back I&#x27;m sure the color will be perfect. Overall this foundation works very well and is perfect for the combination skin. The only downside would be not covering my acne, but this is not something crucial to have in a foundation for me since I can simply just apply a concealer. Would definitely recommend this too others, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I received this in a VoxBox complimentary from Influenster to test out. I mostly never have acne but once in a while I will get a few here and there or some blemishes, so need a good foundation. I have had trouble in the past finding one that will go on and not look a bit dry or unnatural. This one went on so smoothly, looked natural, and made my skin look so beautifully flawless. I love it so much that it is my favorite foundation to purchase and I especially love recommending it to other people that I know. Try it out and I&#x27;m sure you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This foundation provides nice and even coverage. I do not use a lot, just enough to even my skintone but I am really happy with the results. Thanks influenster for my free sample!</li>
            <li> I received this in my Influenster VoxBox last month, and I really enjoy the matte finish this foundation gives, and it&#x27;s definitely build-able to a medium coverage. I find that it holds up quite well to the humidity as opposed to other drugstore foundations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to find great foundations, since I have such pale skin. They usually end up looking too dark, or too cake-y on my face. This foundation is one of the only one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used (thanks to influenster) that really blends with my natural skin color and makes it look fresh and clean! I&#x27;d suggest using with a beauty blender rather than fingers for the best results. I&#x27;d recommend this brand and shade to anyone with very light skin, looking for that foundation they&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I&#x27;m really glad I did! Although I&#x27;ll probably never go without my Make Up Forever foundation, this is great in a pinch or to put in a makeup bag for on the go. It does the job pretty well; evening out skin tone, making pore appear smaller, etc. It seems to last all day and you can&#x27;t even feel it after it&#x27;s applied. I would definitely recommend this product if your looking to save a bit of money and don&#x27;t want to buy a high end foundation.</li>
            <li> (This product was sent to me for reviewing purposes by Influenster)&lt;br /&gt;Buying foundations has always been a challenge for me but I was quite impressed with this. I have dry, sensitive, acne-prone skin. This was gentle and didn&#x27;t cause me to break out. It also had a matte finish when used alone. It also blended really well. My only complaint was that this was a bit too dark for my fair complexion but I see that they make a shade lighter so I will try that. Even being too dark though, I was able to blend it well enough that it still looked good. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> (Influenster sent me this Foundation free of charge for the purpose of reviewing)  I have been having a hard time finding a good color for me and this foundation is actually pretty perfect when I received it i kind of  favored it over the one I bought for myself. It keeps your look clean and matte</li>
            <li> Great foundation goes on smooth and blends well.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a little over 2 weeks now, and I actually quite like it. It does have a matte application. However, it doesn&#x27;t hold up very good, as my face got oilier than it usually would by the end of the day. I attribute the oiliness to this foundation, because it was the only beauty product that I&#x27;d changed for the days I tried on this. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this because of that, but for those who don&#x27;t have an oily complexion, this should work just fine. &amp;the fact is that it is really affordable is a plus point!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this courtesy of Influenster in my Dean List&#x27;s Voxbox for review purposes.</li>
            <li> First off, I have acne and really oily skin. So after a couple hours, my skin does start to get oily and you can tell that I&#x27;m wearing makeup. This is normal for my skin considering its acne prone and oily. I can&#x27;t do anything about it unless I blot my face every 1-2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the formula. Not too heavy, not too light. It has medium coverage but can be buildable. I wish there were more color range because this shade is a little too light for me, however I did get this complimentary of Influenster to try out. This is my honest opinion. I also this it was packaged with a pump. The squeezy tube makes it easy to squeeze out too much product which is a waste.</li>
            <li> I received this in a VOXBOX from Influenster.com free of charge, and I agreed to share my opinion of it. This is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the coverage and texture of this foundation! It feels more like a tinted moisturizer, but gives the coverage of a more intensive foundation. The color blends incredibly nicely so it doesn&#x27;t look like a different tone from my skin, AT ALL. My only issue with the foundation, and I believe it is just my skin, is that is makes my skin look sort of flaky, but again, I believe that&#x27;s just my skin. Overall, I love the coverage it provides me, and it feels so light while giving me coverage.</li>
