            <li>mature/old people like/ strong for me.</li>
            <li>Got here quick, too!</li>
            <li>Huge bottle of Halston.  </li>
            <li>the 8 ounce bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>I bought the 8 Ounce spray, even though I don&#x27;t like it, I might as well wear it since I bought the huge bottle.</li>
            <li>Or to put a dash on you before bed for your lover to enjoy.</li>
            <li>Great Product and Price...close to what I remember in the 70&#x27;s and brought back memories...fast shipping and product not damaged.</li>
            <li>This is a warm intimate light scent which does not overpower the wearer but allows him and those around him with with a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>best smelling cologne I have ever had - since I was old enough to wear it this is a staple.  </li>
            <li>Z14 is not unpleasant, and is certainly the best cheap fragrance you can find at the average Target.</li>
            <li>So glad to find this large bottle of Halston Z-14 on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to spray a dash on a love letter if you are not with your lover and she or he is long distance.</li>
            <li>really like this stuff been using it for many years</li>
            <li>Good price and delivery always earlier than promised.</li>
            <li>I can tell that this is not a bad cologne , just way to</li>
            <li>Great price for such a large quantity.</li>
            <li>He was happy to get such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>I think this cologne would be geared more towards older people.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to get the larger bottle at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the safe and fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>As good as expected from halston</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say anything about the fragrance, other than it is familiar and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>It used to be easy to find this brand, but of course with so many &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; fragrances in the stores, this one is getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li>For such a less bucks an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Wears nicely and lasts long throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It did not do well in the market, and oak moss, one of its key foundation ingredients, was basically banned by the fragrance regulatory authority, so these two facts have led to a very cheap reformulation that is not especially complex or interesting.</li>
            <li>In thee times of wearing the &amp;#34;IN&amp;#34; fragrences we loose a bit of our own originality.</li>
            <li>Great savings that is hard to find.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>So glad amazon has this and in the larger 8oz size!!!!</li>
            <li>Sprayer doesn&#x27;t work properly, but I love the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a favorite of mine for several decades.</li>
            <li>For some reason I stopped wearing it and probably moved onto a dozen or so other scents popular throughout the years.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty large bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>Good classic fragrance, but the 8 oz bottle is so large, it is not easy to hold and use - the design of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Very diluted, not as strong as smaller size bottle.</li>
            <li>Big size, cheap....</li>
            <li>but very weak...oes</li>
            <li>and i guess that shows how much i like it.</li>
            <li>The spray mechanism doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>There is some debate over the ingredients being slightly different from original formula.</li>
            <li>Now, I wish Halston would bring back their special scent from 1983 Halston 101.  </li>
            <li>If you want a cheap good male fragrance, Azzarro Pour Homme, Grey Flannel by G. Beene or Tuscany by Aramis are only slightly more than this and all smell like something other than a simple Christmas spice.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts for hours and does not wane quickly like that of the larger size.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it AAA+++</li>
            <li>This Cologne is much too mature for my taste...if you are in your teens or 20&#x27;s then I don&#x27;t think this is a cologne for you.</li>
            <li>Just be forewarned that if you get the modern reformulation, you are getting exactly what you pay for: a simple, linear, short-lived fragrance.</li>
            <li>they have weakened it so much until it takes much more to use than what it use to be in the past.</li>
            <li>There was a real value in buying a large bottle but now that I am using the product the container is just too big.</li>
            <li>(Though even there Stetson and Old Spice are highly competitive...)</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Not sure the HALSTON is authentic.</li>
            <li>This huge bottle will last a long time also.  </li>
            <li>Nice cologne but weak on the retention.</li>
            <li>It may be old school, but so am I at 52.</li>
            <li>Or some 50 year old rancher/cowboy wearing this to a hoedown.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for old people that are from ages 30 to 59 years of age.</li>
            <li>The fragrance does not project well, and lasts less than most other masculine fragrances.</li>
            <li>Apparently Z14 used to be a very complex and interesting masculine scent.</li>
            <li>The cologne is great, I&#x27;ve stuck by this brand for years, I just keep forgetting that the sprayer in the 8 oz bottle is really bad, this is not the case with the 4oz bottles.</li>
            <li>it can barely be smelled.  </li>
            <li>I put on 6-8 sprays in the morning with barely a whiff of scent.  </li>

            <li> This huge bottle will last a long time also.  </li>
            <li> Nice cologne but weak on the retention.</li>
            <li> It may be old school, but so am I at 52.</li>
            <li> Or some 50 year old rancher/cowboy wearing this to a hoedown.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for old people that are from ages 30 to 59 years of age.</li>
            <li> The fragrance does not project well, and lasts less than most other masculine fragrances.</li>
            <li> Apparently Z14 used to be a very complex and interesting masculine scent.</li>
            <li> The cologne is great, I&#x27;ve stuck by this brand for years, I just keep forgetting that the sprayer in the 8 oz bottle is really bad, this is not the case with the 4oz bottles.</li>
            <li> it can barely be smelled.  </li>
            <li> I put on 6-8 sprays in the morning with barely a whiff of scent.  </li>
            <li> not last long... 35 years user....</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> stay classic and don&#x27;t pay crazy amounts for the new stuff!</li>
            <li> The cologne just doesn&#x27;t have the same potency as the smaller size I&#x27;ve been buying for at least 7-8 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would want this these days, at least in the modern formulation.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY WATERED DOWN</li>
            <li> The Halston Amazon is selling is so watered down</li>
            <li> Boy does this scent take me down memory lane.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion something is wrong with the larger size.</li>
            <li> Package was opened, Cologne weak...</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks!</li>
            <li> The previous review was trying to offer the consideration that I may be wrong!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I waited until after the return window otherwise I would return it.</li>

            <li> My husband loves this scent and so do I. Nice &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; fragrance. If your guy likes to wear cologne, this is a very good choice.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle of Halston.  Should last quite a while.  I don&#x27;t swim in the stuff.  I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I always get this stuff I love having a calogne that not every Tom, Dick, and Harry haa on, but my jaw hit the floor when I saw the size of this bottle...Wow! You can&#x27;t beat the price, I&#x27;m now bookmarking this seller. 😉</li>

            <li> used it for years, I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to get the larger bottle at a reasonable price.  Z-14 is our favorite fragrance.</li>

            <li> The spray atomizer does not return to the up positition</li>
            <li> Huge bottle with a great price! Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a five star, but the 8oz bottles were very big. This cologne has a great smell!</li>
            <li> really like this stuff been using it for many years the 8 ounce bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> Big size, cheap.... but very weak...oes not last long... 35 years user....</li>
            <li> Have been using the cologne for years!&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they would go back to producing the larger pour bottle- not the spray! I have to break off the sprayer so I can transfer it into my travel sprayer (plastic) for my drop kit!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband and he just loves it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery great price.</li>
            <li> A great scent for an excellent price.  Wish it lasted a bit longer.</li>
            <li> No problems on this end.</li>
            <li> best smelling cologne I have ever had - since I was old enough to wear it this is a staple.  stay classic and don&#x27;t pay crazy amounts for the new stuff!</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Great price.</li>
            <li> It may be old school, but so am I at 52. I&#x27;ve always like Halston Z-14. But remember, a dab will do ya&#x27;. Period!</li>
            <li> Bought this a couple years ago and my husband loves how it smells.  Best yet you can smell it for hours after application and the price is very good.  So glad amazon has this and in the larger 8oz size!!!!</li>
            <li> Good classic fragrance, but the 8 oz bottle is so large, it is not easy to hold and use - the design of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My favorite great cologne. I highly recommend it AAA+++</li>
            <li> Have been using this cologne for years for hubby. He loves it and mostly I love it. Also very good price.</li>
            <li> Great and service to.</li>
            <li> ALREADY REVIEWED IT&#x27;S GREAT</li>
            <li> Always a great selection, larger bottles are the best.</li>
            <li> Smells good. But I don&#x27;t use it because I stay home a lot lol. Putting this on for daytime use isn&#x27;t good. It is nice to spray a dash on a love letter if you are not with your lover and she or he is long distance. So this will be nice for that. Or to put a dash on you before bed for your lover to enjoy.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT ON MY HUBBY!!!!!</li>
            <li> So glad to find this large bottle of Halston Z-14 on Amazon.  My husband has been wearing this fragrance since 1987 and I can&#x27;t imagine him using anything else!  I might not recognize him if he smelled different!!  It used to be easy to find this brand, but of course with so many &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; fragrances in the stores, this one is getting harder to find.  I can&#x27;t really say anything about the fragrance, other than it is familiar and pleasant.  You&#x27;ll have to find a sample someplace to sniff for yourself.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Price...close to what I remember in the 70&#x27;s and brought back memories...fast shipping and product not damaged. There is some debate over the ingredients being slightly different from original formula. I am perfectly happy with this....</li>
            <li> i have worn Halston z14 for 32 years and i guess that shows how much i like it. i am thrilled to be able to find an 8 oz spray on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Package was opened, Cologne weak...</li>
            <li> Happy to be able to still find this product after all these years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this cologne for 20 years.  This was an exceptional value, easy transaction and fast delivery.  Very Pleased.</li>
            <li> Ultimate. Long lasting fragrance. Very nice n pleasant fragrance. Tried this after using davidoff for 2 years. Have to say z14 is must try. just awesome. For such a less bucks an awesome product. I can buy 3 of these for a bottle of davidoff. Bye bye davidoff.</li>
            <li> I pay CVS $27.50 for this in the 2.4 oz.This is 8 oz for $22.00. Great savings that is hard to find. Love this after shave anyway.Women like it on me too.</li>
            <li> As good as expected from halston and it still retains it&#x27;s potency after application&lt;br /&gt;A great price in comparison to the size</li>
            <li> This colonge smells so good!!! I bought this as a gift for my husband and he just loves this cologne!!!  No complaints...</li>
            <li> The cologne is great, I&#x27;ve stuck by this brand for years, I just keep forgetting that the sprayer in the 8 oz bottle is really bad, this is not the case with the 4oz bottles.</li>
            <li> Apparently Z14 used to be a very complex and interesting masculine scent. It did not do well in the market, and oak moss, one of its key foundation ingredients, was basically banned by the fragrance regulatory authority, so these two facts have led to a very cheap reformulation that is not especially complex or interesting. What we have here is the slightest 10 minute duration hint of citrus followed by an almost entirely cinnamon scent that lasts for another 4 hours or so. The fragrance does not project well, and lasts less than most other masculine fragrances. If you want a cheap way to smell like cinnamon, here is a great option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the rave reviews here are probably based on vintage stock of this fragrance before the oak moss was removed and the formula was changed to Eau de Cinnamon. I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would want this these days, at least in the modern formulation. If you want a cheap good male fragrance, Azzarro Pour Homme, Grey Flannel by G. Beene or Tuscany by Aramis are only slightly more than this and all smell like something other than a simple Christmas spice. Z14 is not unpleasant, and is certainly the best cheap fragrance you can find at the average Target. (Though even there Stetson and Old Spice are highly competitive...) Just be forewarned that if you get the modern reformulation, you are getting exactly what you pay for: a simple, linear, short-lived fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect as expected now</li>
            <li> Nice cologne but weak on the retention.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this cologne for years, and it&#x27;s always a great smell. Thanks for the safe and fast shipping!  I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
            <li> I haave used this cologne for 30 years and am still ask, what cologne are you wearing and where can I buy it?</li>
            <li> very good deal/value, sells for twice what I paid at most places</li>
            <li> My husband and i both love this.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes and I could not pass it up for the great Amazon price.</li>
            <li> The boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> they have weakened it so much until it takes much more to use than what it use to be in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mens fragrance for some 15 yhears solely. I believe a man should be known for one scent making that his signature. Many times people have said to me&amp;#34;I knew you were hear, I recognized the cologne you wear. In thee times of wearing the &amp;#34;IN&amp;#34; fragrences we loose a bit of our own originality. This is a warm intimate light scent which does not overpower the wearer but allows him and those around him with with a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This is a very good price and I have used this cologne for over 30 year. It&#x27;s just the best</li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;s favorite at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;Good delivery.</li>
            <li> It reflected a time from before....</li>
            <li> I love this cologne!!</li>
            <li> The only cologne I wear, nothing but compliments !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not sure the HALSTON is authentic. It seems to be a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; product. The spray mechanism doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Great Product and fast shipping, Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great Quality Product. Make the purchase, You&#x27;ll be so glad you did:-)</li>
            <li> Great price.  No problems!</li>
            <li> My dad wears thus faithfully!  He was happy to get such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Sprayer doesn&#x27;t work properly, but I love the product. Just what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> Very diluted, not as strong as smaller size bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty large bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Great scent but bottle is too large for easy use. There was a real value in buying a large bottle but now that I am using the product the container is just too big. The cologne is a long time best seller.</li>
            <li> I have used Halsted Z-14 for years. I decided to purchase the 8oz bottle. In my opinion something is wrong with the larger size. The cologne just doesn&#x27;t have the same potency as the smaller size I&#x27;ve been buying for at least 7-8 years. It seems to be &#x27;dilute&#x27; and the scent soon wanes. I thought I might be imagining things here, so I purchased the 4oz size. I was right. The smaller size has the stronger scent I was used to. The scent lasts for hours and does not wane quickly like that of the larger size. Maybe it was just that &#x27;batch&#x27; of cologne in the 8oz size. I don&#x27;t know. But, it is definitely different. I will likely discard the 8oz and stick with the tried-and-true 4oz size.  Update: Nov 12, 2015 This 8oz size is rediculously diluted. The previous review was trying to offer the consideration that I may be wrong! This stuff sucks! It&#x27;s maybe 1/5 to potency of the 4.2oz size. It is an uscrupulous rip off and the manufacturers should be ashamed! I just tossed it in the garbage. Stick to the smaller size which is a wonderful scent that the ladies love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a favorite of mine for several decades.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY WATERED DOWN - I have worn Halston Z-14 for years.  The Halston Amazon is selling is so watered down it can barely be smelled.  I put on 6-8 sprays in the morning with barely a whiff of scent.  Unfortunately, I waited until after the return window otherwise I would return it.</li>
            <li> Boy does this scent take me down memory lane.  I started wearing Z-14 back in the 80&#x27;s as it was the scent to wear at the time.  For some reason I stopped wearing it and probably moved onto a dozen or so other scents popular throughout the years.  Well, it&#x27;s time to make a comeback!  Wears nicely and lasts long throughout the day.  This huge bottle will last a long time also.  Now, I wish Halston would bring back their special scent from 1983 Halston 101.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> This Cologne is much too mature for my taste...if you are in your teens or 20&#x27;s then I don&#x27;t think this is a cologne for you. It has musky leathery/sarsaparilla woody like smell. Makes me think of like western/barber shop vibe. I think this cologne would be geared more towards older people. I can see a bald guy with receding hair, in his 40&#x27;s wearing this on the way to his accounting job. Or some 50 year old rancher/cowboy wearing this to a hoedown. Or a fat barber named Tony wearing this.. I bought the 8 Ounce spray, even though I don&#x27;t like it, I might as well wear it since I bought the huge bottle. I recommend this for old people that are from ages 30 to 59 years of age. If you want to smell like a cowboy or bald accountant or a barber, this is the cologne for you. I can tell that this is not a bad cologne , just way to mature/old people like/ strong for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. A favorite I&#x27;ve used for many years. Good price and delivery always earlier than promised.</li>
            <li> the scent, the smell, its an awesome cologne every made.</li>
            <li> Great item arrived before x-mas has they said</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful classic scent, my husband has worn it for years and he always smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> My favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
