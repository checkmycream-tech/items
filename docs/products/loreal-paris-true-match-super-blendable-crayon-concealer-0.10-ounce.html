            <li>It lasts all day and blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent concealer.  </li>
            <li>For me maybe&lt;br /&gt;the best</li>
            <li>Insanely awesome at covering things up.</li>
            <li>Brilliant!!</li>
            <li>Very nice stuff!</li>
            <li>I purchased the Fair/Light Neutral and it works wonderfully on my very fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Great price for this product.</li>
            <li>The idea of it is great.  </li>
            <li>Great there.</li>
            <li>I bought this concealer thinking it would be perfect for getting very precise coverage.</li>
            <li>In that area, it is good.</li>
            <li>good value</li>
            <li>Particularly if I set it with powder, I find this concealer very effective, a perfect match for my skin, and very easy to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay because it works as a highlighter too!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but it still works amazing</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly, covers blemishes perfectly, and rubs/blends in easily :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing worth mentioning is that this is a fantastic match for very fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>THEN using a finger tip, blend the top.</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage.</li>
            <li>Just love using it to highlight parts of my face.</li>
            <li>I typically love this product.</li>
            <li>i was just wishing for more concealing</li>
            <li>I love this concealer.</li>
            <li>The heat made the nib melt off and stick to the cap even though it wasnt touching it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first arrived with a good chunk of it detached and concealer had coated the inside of the tube.</li>
            <li>Holding the tube up to my skin in the store it looked like a pretty good match.</li>
            <li>It is easy to put on and like it better than a concealer in a tube.</li>
            <li>Great for touching up worn off makeup or for days when I don&#x27;t want to wear face makeup its a backup in case of sudden redness.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and easy for travel too</li>
            <li>Blends easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>If you have light color skin but tan easily -- DON&#x27;T. The brown spots will get you eventually &amp; trust me</li>
            <li>I may have gotten a shade too light</li>
            <li>I use it primarily over acne blemishes and under-eye circles</li>
            <li>I like this product, but i bought it in the shade light, what a mistake.</li>
            <li>i got it too light</li>
            <li>but it is easy to put on and doesnt smear as super easy either.</li>
            <li>have tried many, many different concealers and this is one of the most comfortable, easiest to apply I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use them for under-eye correction but they&#x27;re great for bronzing and highlighting and for covering minor blemishes.</li>
            <li>It is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>The formula is super creamy and the packaging is convenient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super buildable and blendable.</li>
            <li>Other than that it goes on easy now that i have a smooth nub and it feels nice on my skin</li>
            <li>I went a shade lighter than I normally would so that I could use this more as a highlighting concealer.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my minor facial blemishes.</li>
            <li>Just use one of the rarely used tools in your manicure set &amp; dig out from the crayon.</li>
            <li>It is much more creamy and soft than I had imagined.</li>
            <li>Other than that, seems like a good concealer.</li>
            <li>I imagine this would be good for covering dark undereye circles, freckles, or things of that nature.</li>
            <li>Came in a very large HOT box by itself from amazon.</li>
            <li>The lighter color is applied first.</li>
            <li>When I first got this The tip broke off the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>I noticed the crayon tube was hot, and am attributing the damage to heat+shipping jostle.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m pretty tan.</li>
            <li>The tip breaks off before it arrives or after your first use.  </li>
            <li>You can really pinpoint right where to apply this.</li>
            <li>concealer holds its ground for a few hours--3-4 and pushes 6 under ideal conditions--but doesn&#x27;t really last much longer than that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really expected more of like an eyeliner texture, and it is much softer than that.</li>
            <li>They were very polite, as always, and I received a replacement tube today (8/30/13).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much because of the color...</li>
            <li>The plus side of this, is that it does seem to be very blendable.</li>
            <li>i think because its not covering very well.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s overall commitment to catering to all skin shades in their True Match line...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately when I hit my mid-60s my beautiful skin (I didn&#x27;t even wear foundation until well into my 40s) started picking up the brown dots.</li>
            <li>I wish the coverage was a little better</li>
            <li>I am really undecided so far about whether or not I truly like this concealer.</li>
            <li>For larger areas or when I have something scabby or my skin is especially dry, I put the product on my ring finger, let it warm on my skin a few seconds, then lightly pat it on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never liked liquid concealers because I&#x27;ve never found one that provided good coverage and didn&#x27;t simply blend out during application.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>When I put it on the first time it applied much lighter than I had expected.</li>
            <li>one star, dried up quickly, and hard to apply even if you warm it up</li>
            <li>Afterward, I put a little pressed powder on areas where I used concealer, feathering around the edges, then lightly apply the powder all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>-- you don&#x27;t want them when you are old either.</li>
            <li>I purchased this concealer about 2-3 weeks ago and, overall, am very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>unless something happens that will directly influence my makeup (rain, naps, sweating, etc)</li>
            <li>product itself is nice, if a bit sheer, a but too thick, I do not like the dispenser but</li>
            <li>Because the tips of a new crayon will break off very easily -- the lighter color arrived with the tip broken off.</li>
            <li>Not very impressed, however it may be good for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>To cover a major blemish it just does not work for me.</li>
            <li>Consistency was thick with a lot of slip, did not set well undereye even after being set with a light finishing powder.</li>
            <li>When delivered, top of crayon was melted and broken</li>
            <li>Generally cosmetics from amazon arrive in great condition, but I believe the concealer is too soft to weather the heat of August combined with the violent hustle of shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40+ and need a little extra on certain spots, this does the trick.</li>
            <li>Maybe this was just poor judgement on my part, though it may be better to go with one that looks a little too dark in the tube, and then it might apply just the right color on actual skin.</li>
            <li>It has both good and bad points which I will explain.</li>

            <li> someone who frequently finds that a company&#x27;s \\&quot;lightest shade\\&quot; still manages to be too dark</li>
            <li> but apparently it is no longer made.</li>
            <li> I think I was a little too rough so be gentle.</li>
            <li> typically apply it directly to my face, then tap with my ring finger until the product makes my marks disappear.  </li>
            <li> i havent really noticed much difference sadly</li>
            <li> Produce lasts long and doesn&#x27;t get cakey or travel to crevice around the eyes or nose.</li>
            <li> I like this brand and product because it&#x27;s formulated to work well with skin that has pink undertones rather than yellow or olive.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use a sharpener on it, so the new crayon is bulky, hard to use with any precision.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it to anyone with bad bags under their eyes, and if you get a shade too light</li>
            <li> crayon offers thick, buildable coverage while still blending well.</li>
            <li> It covers my dark circles as well as it does blemishes and/ or redness.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s at least another 1/3 to 1/2&amp;#34; of concealer left.</li>
            <li> Helpful in covering age spots and dark blotches.</li>
            <li> A repeat of my review for a slightly darker color of the crayon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slightly greasy, but doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritate skin.</li>
            <li> It was an unusable mess.</li>
            <li> , I compared it to the covergirl tru blend stick which was dry and hard to blend.</li>
            <li> I preferred the L&#x27;Oreal Cover Girl Concealer that was in a little jar</li>
            <li> I have a lot of pink blotchy areas and a *lot* of broken capillaries, so I use concealer every day, on the occasional blemish, a few marks, and all the broken capillaries.  </li>
            <li> im not sure.</li>
            <li> Too thick for under eye circles...don&#x27;t want you to rub too hard there, but covers the rest of the face.</li>
            <li> It was too much of a hassle to return them, so I&#x27;m using a Q-Tip to get the broken tip of the concealer out of the lid, but what a disappointment to have not one, but two broken concealer pencils arrive.  </li>
            <li> So overall, this isn&#x27;t a horrible concealer, it was just not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Darker in color than expected and very irritating.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and both arrived with the tip of the pencil broken off and smashed into the inside of the lid.  </li>
            <li> The seller sent me a replacement for the one that arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 and one of them had the tip broken</li>
            <li> However, when I received this stick, the product had metled and re-hardend; rendering it impossible to use.</li>

            <li> I purchased the Fair/Light Neutral and it works wonderfully on my very fair skin.  I have a lot of pink blotchy areas and a *lot* of broken capillaries, so I use concealer every day, on the occasional blemish, a few marks, and all the broken capillaries.  Particularly if I set it with powder, I find this concealer very effective, a perfect match for my skin, and very easy to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically apply it directly to my face, then tap with my ring finger until the product makes my marks disappear.  For larger areas or when I have something scabby or my skin is especially dry, I put the product on my ring finger, let it warm on my skin a few seconds, then lightly pat it on.  Afterward, I put a little pressed powder on areas where I used concealer, feathering around the edges, then lightly apply the powder all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many, many different concealers and this is one of the most comfortable, easiest to apply I have ever used.  I cannot speak for how well it will match the skin tone of others, but I am very happy with how it looks on me.</li>
            <li> This was a bit greasy for me given my oily skin. Not very impressed, however it may be good for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use it daily and it covers under eye circles well.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful stick for the use of erasing flaws on my face. I keep it in my purse so as to have it when I&#x27;m not at home. I keep one at home too. Very nice stuff!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my minor facial blemishes. Blends well with my L&#x27;Oreal foundation and can stand alone.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and both arrived with the tip of the pencil broken off and smashed into the inside of the lid.  It was too much of a hassle to return them, so I&#x27;m using a Q-Tip to get the broken tip of the concealer out of the lid, but what a disappointment to have not one, but two broken concealer pencils arrive.  Other than that, seems like a good concealer.</li>
            <li> Perfect purse companion. Great for touching up worn off makeup or for days when I don&#x27;t want to wear face makeup its a backup in case of sudden redness. It covers my dark circles as well as it does blemishes and/ or redness. Produce lasts long and doesn&#x27;t get cakey or travel to crevice around the eyes or nose. Blends easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and easy for travel too</li>
            <li> I may have gotten a shade too light but it still works amazing, I compared it to the covergirl tru blend stick which was dry and hard to blend. But this loreal stick is great! Definitely recommend it to anyone with bad bags under their eyes, and if you get a shade too light it&#x27;s okay because it works as a highlighter too!</li>
            <li> A repeat of my review for a slightly darker color of the crayon.&lt;br /&gt;  I use this color as well as a lighter color. The lighter color is applied first. I dot it on my skin. Then I dot again with this color. THEN using a finger tip, blend the top. Unfortunately when I hit my mid-60s my beautiful skin (I didn&#x27;t even wear foundation until well into my 40s) started picking up the brown dots. Had I know this was going to happen, perhaps I would have not tried to EVER get a tan. If you have light color skin but tan easily -- DON&#x27;T. The brown spots will get you eventually &amp; trust me -- you don&#x27;t want them when you are old either. I also have hypo-allergenic skin and can&#x27;t use just *any ole makeup*. I have no break-out problems using this product. Why the 4 stars? Because the tips of a new crayon will break off very easily -- the lighter color arrived with the tip broken off. Also there is a LOT of crayon left when you no longer can &amp;#34;dot&amp;#34; with the crayon. Just use one of the rarely used tools in your manicure set &amp; dig out from the crayon. There&#x27;s at least another 1/3 to 1/2&amp;#34; of concealer left. I preferred the L&#x27;Oreal Cover Girl Concealer that was in a little jar but apparently it is no longer made. I switched to this.</li>
            <li> Perfect by every mines! Glides on smoothly, covers blemishes perfectly, and rubs/blends in easily :)</li>
            <li> When I first got this The tip broke off the first time i used it. I think I was a little too rough so be gentle. Other than that it goes on easy now that i have a smooth nub and it feels nice on my skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this concealer about 2-3 weeks ago and, overall, am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never liked liquid concealers because I&#x27;ve never found one that provided good coverage and didn&#x27;t simply blend out during application.&lt;br /&gt;This crayon offers thick, buildable coverage while still blending well. I use it primarily over acne blemishes and under-eye circles and it does a 8/10 job covering both.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is with the staying power. I&#x27;m the type of person that applies makeup in the morning and unless something happens that will directly influence my makeup (rain, naps, sweating, etc) I don&#x27;t reapply until the evening.&lt;br /&gt;This concealer holds its ground for a few hours--3-4 and pushes 6 under ideal conditions--but doesn&#x27;t really last much longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing worth mentioning is that this is a fantastic match for very fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;As someone who frequently finds that a company&#x27;s \\&quot;lightest shade\\&quot; still manages to be too dark I really appreciate L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s overall commitment to catering to all skin shades in their True Match line... this concealer included.</li>
            <li> I have received two of these from Amazon. The first arrived with a good chunk of it detached and concealer had coated the inside of the tube. It was an unusable mess. I asked for a replacement item. They were very polite, as always, and I received a replacement tube today (8/30/13). The second tube arrived in the same condition. I noticed the crayon tube was hot, and am attributing the damage to heat+shipping jostle. Generally cosmetics from amazon arrive in great condition, but I believe the concealer is too soft to weather the heat of August combined with the violent hustle of shipping.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but i bought it in the shade light, what a mistake. I&#x27;m Mexican so i&#x27;m pretty tan. I also like the simplicity of this  product. I don&#x27;t use it much because of the color...</li>
            <li> I am really undecided so far about whether or not I truly like this concealer. It has both good and bad points which I will explain. I bought this concealer thinking it would be perfect for getting very precise coverage. In that area, it is good. You can really pinpoint right where to apply this. The issue I have is the formulation of the product. It is much more creamy and soft than I had imagined. I really expected more of like an eyeliner texture, and it is much softer than that. It almost squishes onto your skin as you are applying. To cover a major blemish it just does not work for me. The plus side of this, is that it does seem to be very blendable. I imagine this would be good for covering dark undereye circles, freckles, or things of that nature. It you are looking to cover a blaring blemish....well no dice. Also I was off on the color I chose. I bought the neutral fair/light. Holding the tube up to my skin in the store it looked like a pretty good match. When I put it on the first time it applied much lighter than I had expected. Maybe this was just poor judgement on my part, though it may be better to go with one that looks a little too dark in the tube, and then it might apply just the right color on actual skin. So overall, this isn&#x27;t a horrible concealer, it was just not exactly what I expected. I think I will stick with a liquid concealer next time.</li>
            <li> This is the best drug-store concealer I have ever tried. It lasts all day and blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage.</li>
            <li> These are definitely super-blendale. The formula is super creamy and the packaging is convenient. I wish the coverage was a little better so I don&#x27;t use them for under-eye correction but they&#x27;re great for bronzing and highlighting and for covering minor blemishes.</li>
            <li> Just love using it to highlight parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I typically love this product. However, when I received this stick, the product had metled and re-hardend; rendering it impossible to use. The product just flakes out of the tube.</li>
            <li> i got it too light i think because its not covering very well. maybe i needed a darker shade im not sure. i havent really noticed much difference sadly but it is easy to put on and doesnt smear as super easy either. i was just wishing for more concealing</li>
            <li> Slightly greasy, but doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritate skin. I like this brand and product because it&#x27;s formulated to work well with skin that has pink undertones rather than yellow or olive. Finally, a concealer that doesn&#x27;t make me look jaundiced!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent concealer.  It doesn&#x27;t have any&lt;br /&gt;ingredients  like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid,&lt;br /&gt;but it covers  zits and red spots well.  For me maybe&lt;br /&gt;the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer. It is rich and creamy. It&#x27;s also super buildable and blendable. I went a shade lighter than I normally would so that I could use this more as a highlighting concealer. I love it!</li>
            <li> Insanely awesome at covering things up. I&#x27;m 40+ and need a little extra on certain spots, this does the trick. Too thick for under eye circles...don&#x27;t want you to rub too hard there, but covers the rest of the face. Brilliant!!</li>
            <li> Darker in color than expected and very irritating. Consistency was thick with a lot of slip, did not set well undereye even after being set with a light finishing powder.</li>
            <li> When delivered, top of crayon was melted and broken</li>
            <li> Helpful in covering age spots and dark blotches.</li>
            <li> Came in a very large HOT box by itself from amazon. The heat made the nib melt off and stick to the cap even though it wasnt touching it.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is nice, if a bit sheer, a but too thick, I do not like the dispenser but good value&lt;br /&gt;downrated one star, dried up quickly, and hard to apply even if you warm it up</li>
            <li> I never used the product before. It is easy to put on and like it better than a concealer in a tube.</li>
            <li> The tip breaks off before it arrives or after your first use.  You can&#x27;t use a sharpener on it, so the new crayon is bulky, hard to use with any precision.  The idea of it is great.  The seller sent me a replacement for the one that arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 and one of them had the tip broken</li>
            <li> I use it for my eyes only. Great there. Chalky for cheeks.</li>
