            <li>So economical</li>
            <li>and for the price its atleast worth a try.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find these - definitely more expensive than what I am used to paying, but worth it just to have it!  </li>
            <li>This soap right here is it.</li>
            <li>This bar really helped my face feel clean, but I broke out in a rash all over my face after using it.</li>

            <li>Then I rinse and apply toner and moisturizing and my skin stays smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>Got upset with the company that makes this product as once they came out with the higher priced liquid wash of it</li>

            <li>I have sensitive skin , I cant use anything too wild or with too much fragrance, but this soap really cleans well , doesnt leave my face dry and has a really nice light scent to it.</li>
            <li>Works for the whole body too.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says - it keeps your complexion clear!  </li>
            <li>I use it to clean my face only.</li>
            <li>Best buy for a bar that should last at least 2 months of daily use.</li>
            <li>i used to use and like this in high school</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to keep it in check with this cleansing bar, then I follow up by massaging a little baking soda as an exfoliant on the area.  </li>
            <li>this product is so good that my husband&#x27;s acne was cleared in just a few days of using it!!!</li>
            <li>If you have normal non-sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with a BUNCH of different products, but this one seems to be the right combination of effective-yet-gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old and this product has kept my skin soft, clear and even toned.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;d say give this bar a try, but if you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive skin then stay clear of this product unless you want a rash.</li>
            <li>Apparently Aveeno has discontinued</li>

            <li> Good product.  I&#x27;ve used i for years.  Apparently Aveeno has discontinued this is bar form!</li>
            <li> This bar really helped my face feel clean, but I broke out in a rash all over my face after using it. Turns out my skin doesn&#x27;t care to much for Salicylic acid, even in small amounts. If you have normal non-sensitive skin then I&#x27;d say give this bar a try, but if you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive skin then stay clear of this product unless you want a rash.</li>
            <li> If you have acne or have problems with blemishes. This soap right here is it. INCREDIBLE.

Only downside is it&#x27;s extremely expensive. But for me worth it.</li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin , I cant use anything too wild or with too much fragrance, but this soap really cleans well , doesnt leave my face dry and has a really nice light scent to it. You cant beat the price! and for the price its atleast worth a try. Out of all the products I have used on my face this has to be the best.</li>

            <li> I think Aveeno has stopped making this soap.  Boo!  I was so happy to find these - definitely more expensive than what I am used to paying, but worth it just to have it!  My husband uses this soap twice a day everyday.  Needed the multiple pack.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says - it keeps your complexion clear!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product if you experience acne.  Best buy for a bar that should last at least 2 months of daily use.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. I get contact dermatitis from dust and pollen and this product somehow relives my breakout I get from this problem. I&#x27;m 68 years old and this product has kept my skin soft, clear and even toned. Got upset with the company that makes this product as once they came out with the higher priced liquid wash of it you could not find the bar one in any stores in my home town. For now our Walmart Store is carrying the bar again. Otherwise have purchased it here on Amazon.com in multi-package.</li>
