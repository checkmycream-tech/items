            <li>good deal, ok on the price as it was a little less expensive on line, it served its purpose as a last minute gift</li>
            <li>really feel that this perfume is watered down or this company did something to it.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>

            <li> Recently, I have been having a harder time getting the body lotion</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s as long as you carry it, which I hope it&#x27;s forever.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the shipping was very slow.</li>

            <li> was a little worried that I&#x27;m going to get a copy catter, but I took my chances anyway and purchased from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However bottle cap did not fit and was very hard to take off and put back on.</li>
            <li> The have purchase, when I can afford it, at either Macy&#x27;s or JCPenney&#x27;s which for the same about it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately this is not the case here.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re selling fake stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disappointing</li>

            <li> This is a good purchase and not a watered down version of the perfume. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing DESIGN for many years and it is one of my very favorite fragrances.  Recently, I have been having a harder time getting the body lotion and I don&#x27;t know why, but I keep trying.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it.  So many people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing and really love it as do I.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have it yet but I know i will love it</li>
            <li> spray use daily  used for over 5 years  love light clean scent  get many compliments on smell  love big size available on Amazon</li>

            <li> First of all, the shipping was very slow. Secondly, I feel that they sold me a watered down perfume either that or it&#x27;s a fake.&lt;br /&gt;I bought from this seller because I thought the price was pretty cheapt. It&#x27;s actually cheaper than how much I would normally pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Design for over 10 years. I&#x27;ve always used the Parfum kind.&lt;br /&gt;I recently ran out so I&#x27;ve decided to use Amazon to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried that I&#x27;m going to get a copy catter, but I took my chances anyway and purchased from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, I only have to spray just a little bit to get the smell that last all day.&lt;br /&gt;but unfortunately this is not the case here. With this one I bought from this seller&lt;br /&gt;I have to keep spraying all day to keep the smell up. It&#x27;s very disappointing and I get upset each time I use this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really feel that this perfume is watered down or this company did something to it.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I have over 10 years experience with this brand and I never ones&lt;br /&gt;doubted it. I still don&#x27;t, but I very much doubt this seller. I think they sold me a watered down perfume&lt;br /&gt;and that&#x27;s the bottom line. I&#x27;m very disappointed and I will never buy from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please people if you&#x27;re thinking of buying from this seller&lt;br /&gt;please think twice and investigate first. Please take my review into consideration. You don&#x27;t want to make the same mistake I did.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this company is doing something with their perfume so they could sell them at a low cost and still make profits. Either that&lt;br /&gt;or they&#x27;re selling fake stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleas sellers, stop screwing people over.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, she has had trouble finding it in our local stores. Found it here at Amazon, purchased it, it was delivered timely and was even a larger size bottle than she usually gets. Great deal!</li>
            <li> Fragrance was great. However bottle cap did not fit and was very hard to take off and put back on.</li>

            <li> I love Design.  It&#x27;s been my favorite perfume for many, many years.  The have purchase, when I can afford it, at either Macy&#x27;s or JCPenney&#x27;s which for the same about it&#x27;s expensive.  I too, have purchase it on-line through another company.  The only problem is that the bottle, I guess since it&#x27;s at a tester price, the does not have the top.  However, when I discovered it on amazon.com, I was amazed at the difference in the price (much cheaper).  Same amount, and it brings the top on it.  Hooray!  I had to get some, and as long as I can purchase it for better quality, cheaper and faster delivery services, I will continue to order it on-line.  That&#x27;s as long as you carry it, which I hope it&#x27;s forever.  Honestly, I love my Design.  VERY SATISFIED.  Thank you.</li>
