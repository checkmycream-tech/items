            <li>,just ordered two more bottles,and another atomizer !.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Edens Gardens oils!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much more bearable, even pleasant.</li>
            <li>Delighted with it. :)</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t try this on your own, make sure you see your dermatologist before you just try stuff on your own.</li>
            <li>Good quality strong scent</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase... Will definitely be ordering more when I need some!</li>
            <li>However, the quality as far as purity and aroma seem very good.</li>
            <li>but I have purchased some that smelled better</li>
            <li>I have nothing to add but required to write 12 more words.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Love all of Eden&#x27;s Gardens products.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying this oil.  </li>
            <li>It has so many uses..</li>
            <li>It has so many uses..</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for skin care but see that I can use it for so much more.</li>
            <li>Love ordering from Edens Garden because i get my oil so quickly!</li>
            <li>Been using this brand for nearly a year, and it is great.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderfully and helps me for the therapeutic purposes I use it for (mental clarity, de-stressing).</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Strong, great essential oil!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Edens Garden, quality products, exceptional pricing, and fabulous customer service.</li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>Great product, just ordered my second one.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it .</li>
            <li>FOR MY SKIN TO HELP KEEP SOME OF THE BROWN AGING SPOTS LIGHT IN COLOR.</li>
            <li>It can be used for so much more but the above is what I&#x27;ve been using it for so far, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It can be used for so much more but the above is what I&#x27;ve been using it for so far, and it works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i had bought there other scrented oils and was always happy till this time</li>
            <li>the products all seem to come pretty quickly, I like that!</li>
            <li>The price of Boswellia Carteri is expensive anywhere you find it, however, this is a good price, was packaged well, and I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>Since this one is from the middle east, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s most like what the frankincense that the wise men brought to Jesus at His birth, and so I was most curious about it.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely order more before I run out!</li>
            <li>and I will definitely order more before I run out!</li>
            <li>Purchased and used as a rub to help w/an infection in the joints of my right hand.  </li>
            <li>I do not think the smell is as strong as the doTerra brand, but for the significant difference in price, I will be purchasing this brand for the purposes of diffusing it in my essential oil diffuser and using it in my bath water.  </li>
            <li>This brand was very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>from  various companies and this is one of the better ones</li>
            <li>As usual, all Edens Garden Essential oils are great!</li>
            <li>It really smells Holy!</li>
            <li>For therapeutic purposes, I will most likely splurge and purchase the doTerra brand.  </li>
            <li>I love this essential oil.</li>
            <li>this isvery potent, but amazingly fast acting...</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good carteri frankincense but until now was not able to find one.</li>
            <li>They are just as good (if not better) than the over priced pyramid oils out there, and shipping is FAST</li>
            <li>In general, I find Frankincense to be one of my more useful essential oils.</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>Although some may think the smell is overpowering I really like the woody fragrance.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really want to return it, just after I opened the bottle</li>
            <li>Wow, I didn&#x27;t expect an oil like frankincense, that always seemed so exotic and mysterious to me, to be so inexpensive!</li>
            <li>I dont really like the smell of this particular frankincense.</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>I have also been researching it to find out if it is a high quality version,  </li>
            <li>very weak compared to other brands  wasn&#x27;t that impressed  </li>
            <li>The other three oils I ordered from Edens Garden are equally as good as I had expected, and I give all four of the different oils 5 Stars.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for anything, but was compelled to write about this one, hoping to help others out, since the only way I found this source was spending $$$ to do my own sniff test.</li>
            <li>Then I realized the old bottle I wanted to replace was Boswellia CARTERI.</li>
            <li>My dog developed a severe cancerous mast cell tumor on his foot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very spiritual experience to smell the aroma that was also smelled by the real people in the bible.</li>
            <li>Given his advanced age, chemo, radiation or surgery would likely have killed him faster than the disease.  </li>
            <li>(I have never tried the Young Living essential oils, so I cannot compare it to that brand.)</li>
            <li>Although I like other EOs from this vendor, I will not buy this particular oil ever again.</li>
            <li>After 1 week the tumor was half its original size, and after 3 weeks it is less than a quarter, and is no longer causing my dog any pain.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to evaluate it for its therapeutic qualities, I am using it on an itchy rash,  i will update in the future.  </li>
            <li> I had two bottles of two different brands of boswellia serrata, but they didn&#x27;t smell like that which I had purchased a long time ago.</li>
            <li> As you can likely tell I am not a professional EO tester.</li>
            <li> Frankincense has been long used for mediation and religious rituals for its ability to deepen breathing, this one made me gag.</li>
            <li> i give several drops a day to my dog, and her seizures haave lessened in severity and frequequencyncy.</li>
            <li> (Cold sores and small cysts for example).&lt;br /&gt;Pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> I use it for my sun-damaged skin (actinic keratosis) and unlike expensive toxic chemical prescription products, this is all natural and actually cleaned up my damaged skin areas pretty well after about 3 weeks, 3 applications per day.</li>
            <li> From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> Lacks that subtle ethereal aroma characteristic of higher grade frankincense.</li>
            <li> other brands seem to last longer as well&lt;</li>
            <li> When I ordered other oils, I went back to this brand.  </li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
            <li> Also 3 drops (and 3 drops of sage essential oil) in a small amount of water and ingested.  </li>
            <li> It sounds cheesy but it really transports you to ancient times.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great,I&#x27;m using it on my cancer,I could actually tell the difference on the tumor in my lungs,till the stupid atomizer broke,but I think this stuff is saving my life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for rubbing on the chest and sinuses as an expectorant, putting in a nebulizer to help with sleep, rubbing between the palms and inhaling in times of anger, sadness, anxiety or grief... it seems to have the ability to dissolve negative energy, be it with mental or physical health.</li>
            <li> That maker was prohibitively expensive, since I will be using quite a bit of it for a project, so, I ordered 3 bottles of B. Carteri from 3 different makers.</li>
            <li> Small bottle, wish it was less expensive.</li>

            <li> I dont really like the smell of this particular frankincense.</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> I find Edens Garden Frankincense sweeter than others, but the difference in cost is too good to pass up. The quality and strength are very good too.  In general, I find Frankincense to be one of my more useful essential oils. It&#x27;s good for rubbing on the chest and sinuses as an expectorant, putting in a nebulizer to help with sleep, rubbing between the palms and inhaling in times of anger, sadness, anxiety or grief... it seems to have the ability to dissolve negative energy, be it with mental or physical health.</li>
            <li> Love ordering from Edens Garden because i get my oil so quickly!</li>
            <li> Love edens garden great quality. Very affordable. Permanent customer</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad but I have purchased some that smelled better</li>
            <li> This is a must have for everyone. Great product, just ordered my second one. Edens gardens has the best oils and good prices. the products all seem to come pretty quickly, I like that! From headache, stuffy nose, joint ache, to infections and streach marks THIS IS THE ONE!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great,I&#x27;m using it on my cancer,I could actually tell the difference on the tumor in my lungs,till the stupid atomizer broke,but I think this stuff is saving my life.,just ordered two more bottles,and another atomizer !.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> Purchased and used as a rub to help w/an infection in the joints of my right hand.  Also 3 drops (and 3 drops of sage essential oil) in a small amount of water and ingested.  Found relief.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I am still waiting for it to reduce a tumor. It has been 3 weeks. However, the quality as far as purity and aroma seem very good. The price was good. Plan to continue using it as time will tell.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to add but required to write 12 more words.&lt;br /&gt;Will update again if I have anything to add.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; service.</li>
            <li> Strong, great essential oil! Delighted with it. :)&lt;br /&gt;Smells good and does the job. Small bottle, wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for so many things. I add it to my skin care products for it&#x27;s healing properties. Although some may think the smell is overpowering I really like the woody fragrance.</li>
            <li> very weak compared to other brands  wasn&#x27;t that impressed  other brands seem to last longer as well&lt;br /&gt;i had bought there other scrented oils and was always happy till this time</li>
            <li> I had two bottles of two different brands of boswellia serrata, but they didn&#x27;t smell like that which I had purchased a long time ago. Then I realized the old bottle I wanted to replace was Boswellia CARTERI. That maker was prohibitively expensive, since I will be using quite a bit of it for a project, so, I ordered 3 bottles of B. Carteri from 3 different makers. Edens Garden is closest to what I can sniff from my near empty bottle that I was looking to replace. As you can likely tell I am not a professional EO tester. But I intend to use Edens Garden as my source. The other three oils I ordered from Edens Garden are equally as good as I had expected, and I give all four of the different oils 5 Stars. The price of Boswellia Carteri is expensive anywhere you find it, however, this is a good price, was packaged well, and I&#x27;m a happy customer. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for anything, but was compelled to write about this one, hoping to help others out, since the only way I found this source was spending $$$ to do my own sniff test.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. As advertised. Very happy with this purchase... Will definitely be ordering more when I need some! Great product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Edens Gardens oils! They are just as good (if not better) than the over priced pyramid oils out there, and shipping is FAST</li>
            <li> Love it!  This is my go to face oil mixed with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Best quality at the best price. After trying another brand for a bottle of Lavender, I returned to this company. There was no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy this one for smell. I bought it for relaxation/sleep and mix it with lavender at night. It&#x27;s also great as an astringent.</li>
            <li> The oil was as it stated in the product description. we use for oil dispersion and worked will for that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if this brand is the best or not, but it works on the things I&#x27;ve used it for! (Cold sores and small cysts for example).&lt;br /&gt;Pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> Love all of Eden&#x27;s Gardens products.  Great quality products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to evaluate it for its therapeutic qualities, I am using it on an itchy rash,  i will update in the future.  I have also been researching it to find out if it is a high quality version,  there is a lot of info out there on the various kinds of frankincense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for arthritic pain and it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Whitens my teeth, use it on my face every day.  I like it and will keep using</li>
            <li> I have a certified organic Frankincense to use on my skin and hair so I know what it should smell like. I got this essential oil not for skin, but to scent my car. I must say I was very disappointed to find out it does not smell like the one I use on my skin at all. Its almost synthetic smell made me gag and sick. Frankincense has been long used for mediation and religious rituals for its ability to deepen breathing, this one made me gag. Although I like other EOs from this vendor, I will not buy this particular oil ever again.</li>
            <li> this isvery potent, but amazingly fast acting... i rub it on sore joints at night, and thehe pain is gone by morning.  i give several drops a day to my dog, and her seizures haave lessened in severity and frequequencyncy.</li>
            <li> I use it on my knees to ease my pains.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of wonderful things about Frankincense and wanted to try some.  This brand was very reasonably priced.  I am enjoying this oil.  When I ordered other oils, I went back to this brand.  I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Goes great with Gold and Myrrh.</li>
            <li> Frankincense is a must in everyone&#x27;s  medicine cabinet.  I  have  bought frankincense oil  (Boswellia Carteri)  from  various companies and this is one of the better ones</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very powerful.</li>
            <li> As usual, all Edens Garden Essential oils are great!</li>
            <li> This is the best Frankincense oil around and for such a great price!  It has so many uses.. it can be used as an antiseptic and astringent, for rejuvenating skin, and as an anti-inflammatory for joint pain.  It can be used for so much more but the above is what I&#x27;ve been using it for so far, and it works great.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it for more, it is a wonderful oil and I will definitely order more before I run out!</li>

            <li> Great oil very pleased with my purchas</li>
            <li> This smell is nice and pleasant . I really enjoy it . I also use it on my face to help my skin and reduce the size of my pores</li>
            <li> My dog developed a severe cancerous mast cell tumor on his foot.  Given his advanced age, chemo, radiation or surgery would likely have killed him faster than the disease.  A friend with training in alternative therapies recommended using this oil along with clove and sandalwood oils to shrink the tumor.  After 1 week the tumor was half its original size, and after 3 weeks it is less than a quarter, and is no longer causing my dog any pain.  I was highly skeptical at the start of treatment, but the results speak for themselves.</li>
            <li> Good quality strong scent</li>
            <li> Wow, I didn&#x27;t expect an oil like frankincense, that always seemed so exotic and mysterious to me, to be so inexpensive! The price was so amazing, I couldn&#x27;t resist! I have been looking for a good carteri frankincense but until now was not able to find one. Since this one is from the middle east, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s most like what the frankincense that the wise men brought to Jesus at His birth, and so I was most curious about it. It&#x27;s a very spiritual experience to smell the aroma that was also smelled by the real people in the bible. It sounds cheesy but it really transports you to ancient times. You can see why it was such a holy oil. It really smells Holy!</li>
            <li> Thin, weak aroma, excessively woodsy. Lacks that subtle ethereal aroma characteristic of higher grade frankincense. Try Neal&#x27;s Yard Remedies frankincense to feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS IN ALMOND OR APRICOT KERNAL OIL FOR MY SKIN TO HELP KEEP SOME OF THE BROWN AGING SPOTS LIGHT IN COLOR.</li>
            <li> Great product! It is wonderful for so many things! I call it a miracle oil!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil and was very impressed with its quality. I use it for my sun-damaged skin (actinic keratosis) and unlike expensive toxic chemical prescription products, this is all natural and actually cleaned up my damaged skin areas pretty well after about 3 weeks, 3 applications per day. But don&#x27;t try this on your own, make sure you see your dermatologist before you just try stuff on your own.</li>
            <li> I do not think the smell is as strong as the doTerra brand, but for the significant difference in price, I will be purchasing this brand for the purposes of diffusing it in my essential oil diffuser and using it in my bath water.  For therapeutic purposes, I will most likely splurge and purchase the doTerra brand.  (I have never tried the Young Living essential oils, so I cannot compare it to that brand.)</li>
            <li> This is a great oil and the right size for the price, I will buy again from Eden&#x27;s Garden, excellent company and great quality products. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Besides the smell, they claim that this oil is therapeutic grade, but there is no note that says it on the bottle&#x27;s label. I really want to return it, just after I opened the bottle I felt a disappointment :-(</li>
            <li> I like this as much as it&#x27;s possible to like the smell of Frankincense. Mix it with a Thieves oil and it&#x27;s much more bearable, even pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great!  Received and using.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Edens Garden, quality products, exceptional pricing, and fabulous customer service. I recently purchased Frankincense and was mistakenly sent Patchouli. Not only did this company immediately send my Frankincense, they let me keep the Patchouli! I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I purchased this for skin care but see that I can use it for so much more. I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> Been using this brand for nearly a year, and it is great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Frankincense. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same.</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil. It smells wonderfully and helps me for the therapeutic purposes I use it for (mental clarity, de-stressing). Perfect!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Aroma is woodsy.</li>
