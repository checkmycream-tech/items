    <ol>
            <li>and my hair looks wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was excellent in every way.  </li>
            <li>However the color is iffy at best.  </li>
            <li>It was great!!!!  </li>
            <li>This adds great body and beautiful color to my hair.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product!  </li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS GREAT.  </li>
            <li>I do feel that this is a great solution for someone who already uses a mousse or for someone who does not need a great deal of toning.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>This provides good hold for my hair, and gives it a nice tussled look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to be going gray...tired of all that dyeing, etc.</li>
            <li>so I used more than what I would have liked.</li>
            <li>This mousse is my very favorite for this fine, sparse, head of hair.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of helping me to hold the locks in place while trying to curl with a hot iron.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Gives hair more controllability, shine, &amp; evens out the color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Okay</li>
            <li>MOST SALONS CHARGE AN ARM &amp; LEG FOR THIS ITEM.  </li>
            <li>but, I like mousse that is more pliable.  </li>
            <li>I mix lots of water with it and it works more like hair spray.</li>
            <li>My allergies kick up with most toner products.  </li>
            <li>Also gives a lovely shine to my light hair.  </li>
            <li>My beautician told me that the red in my hair in natural, and sun, chlorine and metals in the water bring it out in spite of her best efforts.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for making gray, silver or white hair shiny and bright.</li>
            <li>My hair was a nice, bright white and soft.so soft</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product and one I will order again.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, although I do have an allergic response to Roux Fanci Full rinse, I do not have that response to this blue toner mousse.  </li>
            <li>I have liked the Roux Fanci Full Rinse and thought I&#x27;d try this because I was hopeful that it would be the same as the rinse without it being so runny.  </li>
            <li>VERY GOOD PRODUCT WHICH I USE DAILY TO KEEP MY GREY HAIR SHINY AND MANAGEABLE.  </li>
            <li>Finally found a product that works on my fine hair!  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>My hair is mostly silver and the white minx turns it more white, which I like.</li>
            <li>I know a lot of my friends with very fine grey hair could use this.  </li>
            <li>Many people stop to ask me if my hair colour is natural, naturally I say yes.</li>
            <li>If you do not have much yellowing to cover</li>
            <li>I have not found it available in local stores.</li>
            <li>I like it far better than the white minx liquid leave in temporary color.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Roux has been around a long time, so they must be doing something right!</li>
            <li>[ I am 64+, and my hair is still mostly mouse brown naturally, some gray, a lot of blonde and red highlights.]  </li>
            <li>This mousse is ok I suppose, but, it is really, really stiff..</li>
            <li>Got this n used it..took the yellow right out.</li>
            <li>Second one they sent me still does not wk right.</li>
            <li>My fine hair seemed weighed down a bit by it.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the old type of Roux I used to use!  </li>
            <li>I use about the size of a half dollar and it is more than enough.</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>It works, but leaves my gray hair more coarse than what it usually is.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after much shopping for something to reduce the brassy red in my blonde streaked hair.  </li>
            <li>I got a new flat iron (which I&#x27;m returning Rusk heat freak )</li>
            <li>I have used several colors while growing my hair out to natural.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t do much as far as whitening the yellow.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out the hair, or make it stiff, sticky, oily, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take much, very dense, washes out in your next shampoo.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> the mousse made my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it help tone down any brassy highlights</li>
            <li> I like the product it covers the blonde, but it gives a slightly blue/gray tint to my hair instead of platinum.</li>

            <li> and I purchased this and two other colors.  </li>
            <li> but it actually gives your hair body without making it heavy!  </li>
            <li> I do not use this everyday, just as needed, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I feel you could use less.</li>
            <li> Also, a little does a lot, so don&#x27;t over use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but it is a little darker than I thought it would be and kinda hard to control the colors evenness.</li>
            <li> I have hair to my earlobes and it isn&#x27;t thin.</li>
            <li> I will not use or purchase again sadly.</li>
            <li> This is a Terrible product.</li>

            <li> Love this product. Gives hair more controllability, shine, &amp; evens out the color. Does not dry out the hair, or make it stiff, sticky, oily, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take much, very dense, washes out in your next shampoo.  I have used several colors while growing my hair out to natural. Buying it from Amazon saves me time because sometimes the beauty supply is out &amp; one has to keep returning to the store, plus you don&#x27;t pay shipping fees &amp; the price for the product is the same as the beauty supplies. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Okay but it is a little darker than I thought it would be and kinda hard to control the colors evenness.</li>
            <li> keeps my white hair white. White hair has a tendency to yellow and this product keeps it white.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product at Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, but could not find in locally in the US.  This product is the only one I have found that keeps the yellow out of my silver locks, luckly I found it online and my hair looks wonderful.  Many people stop to ask me if my hair colour is natural, naturally I say yes.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT WHICH I USE DAILY TO KEEP MY GREY HAIR SHINY AND MANAGEABLE.  THE PRICE IS GREAT.  MOST SALONS CHARGE AN ARM &amp; LEG FOR THIS ITEM.  I LIKE TO KEEP ON HAND.</li>
            <li> This does work. I feel you have to do use quite a lot of it, however. My fine hair seemed weighed down a bit by it. Simply because I used three applications to get the tonality I wanted. If you do not have much yellowing to cover I feel you could use less. I do feel that this is a great solution for someone who already uses a mousse or for someone who does not need a great deal of toning. For me, there was quite a bit of yellow in my bleached hair so I used more than what I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I have liked the Roux Fanci Full Rinse and thought I&#x27;d try this because I was hopeful that it would be the same as the rinse without it being so runny.  It is not the same at all.  I saw no color change and the mousse made my hair dry.  I wanted to send it back but I never heard from the seller.</li>
            <li> This mousse is ok I suppose, but, it is really, really stiff..I like the idea that it tones my hair and all but, I like mousse that is more pliable.  Won&#x27;t buy it again..I mix lots of water with it and it works more like hair spray.</li>
            <li> I like the product it covers the blonde, but it gives a slightly blue/gray tint to my hair instead of platinum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just growing my hair out and I purchased this and two other colors.  I&#x27;m thrilled to be going gray...tired of all that dyeing, etc. This product gives a shade of white that evens out my colors while my hair is growing out.  And, it&#x27;s a styling mousse.  I alternate between this color and #41 and #52</li>
            <li> It works, but leaves my gray hair more coarse than what it usually is. I like it far better than the white minx liquid leave in temporary color. The mouse isn&#x27;t messy and if you have some yellow in your gray, as some people do, it will eliminate the yellowing. My hair is mostly silver and the white minx turns it more white, which I like. Also, a little does a lot, so don&#x27;t over use. I have hair to my earlobes and it isn&#x27;t thin. I use about the size of a half dollar and it is more than enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the gels, the mousse...........Finally found a product that works on my fine hair!  Not only does it help tone down any brassy highlights but it actually gives your hair body without making it heavy!  I am very pleased with this product!  Roux has been around a long time, so they must be doing something right!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after much shopping for something to reduce the brassy red in my blonde streaked hair.  My beautician told me that the red in my hair in natural, and sun, chlorine and metals in the water bring it out in spite of her best efforts.  My allergies kick up with most toner products.  Surprisingly, although I do have an allergic response to Roux Fanci Full rinse, I do not have that response to this blue toner mousse.  It works well to reduce the red tones. [ I am 64+, and my hair is still mostly mouse brown naturally, some gray, a lot of blonde and red highlights.]  I do not use this everyday, just as needed, and a little goes a long way. I took off one star, because, as a mousse, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; my crown hair as well as some.  It also doesn&#x27;t foam high coming out of the bottle, so it is hard to judge the amount to use.  But it isn&#x27;t sticky once it dries.  I know a lot of my friends with very fine grey hair could use this.  Overall, a good product and one I will order again.  I have not found it available in local stores. Similar mousses have ingredients which will cause me to itch on my scalp.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my hair! Gives it lots of body and shine.</li>
            <li> This mousse is my very favorite for this fine, sparse, head of hair. It does a great job of helping me to hold the locks in place while trying to curl with a hot iron.  Also gives a lovely shine to my light hair.  The shipping was excellent in every way.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This is a Terrible product. Made my hair turn purple. I will not use or purchase again sadly. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This adds great body and beautiful color to my hair. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I got a new flat iron (which I&#x27;m returning Rusk heat freak ) my hair is salt n pepper. It made the salt part yellow.&lt;br /&gt;My hair designer tried to get it out with a toner..still some left. Got this n used it..took the yellow right out.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do much as far as whitening the yellow. I biught this product years and years ago- hs not improved.</li>
            <li> Second one they sent me still does not wk right.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Nothing like the old type of Roux I used to use!  I would recommend this for making gray, silver or white hair shiny and bright.</li>
            <li> This provides good hold for my hair, and gives it a nice tussled look.  However the color is iffy at best.  Will try another shade.</li>
            <li> It was great!!!!  My hair was a nice, bright white and soft.so soft I was surprised. Would definitely recommend this to anyone having issues with not so white hair.&lt;br /&gt;A.P.</li>
