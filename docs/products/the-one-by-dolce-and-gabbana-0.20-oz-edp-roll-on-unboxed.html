            <li> I loved this scent on another friend, but was not sure how it would smell on me.  Having the ability to purchase top scents in rollerball is a great idea.  This is the best way to try a new scent without going broke.  The cover screws on so its secure and does not leak anything. The glass enclosure is not flimsy (I&#x27;ve dropped it alrdy and it did not break) and the roller moves with great ease.  The size is great for stashing away and discreetly carry with you to refresh on a whim.  This is the way to go for any future new perfumes purchases!</li>
            <li> I ordered the roll ball in the event I may or may not like this fragrance. To my surprise, I love love love this fragrance. It&#x27;s refreshing and last all day. I will be ordering a 3.5 ounce bottle of The One!</li>
            <li> Tried this perfume for the first time, and I love it !I can&#x27;t wear a lot of perfumes because they give me a headache, and not to many that I even like... But, The One is great !</li>

            <li> This was given as a Valentines gift. It was a hit! Great price and super easy to pop in the purse and go.....</li>
            <li> Smells great, cost more in department stores.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  I have been very pleased with everything about this order.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, everyone always ask?  What are you wearing?</li>
            <li> My fault, it was not the one I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Perfect for every day wear. I receive comliments daily!</li>
            <li> Great price and shipped promptly</li>
            <li> Perfect for your purse and afforable</li>
            <li> Love it. Perfect size to carry around</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic to buy this on Amazon vs. Sephora, but I am very happy I did! The perfume itself smells beautiful, very sophisticated and sexy... and for the price? I might have to stock up! :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing I did not like about this was the roller ball. It was not the best quality and sticks sometimes, but other than that, 5 stars!</li>
