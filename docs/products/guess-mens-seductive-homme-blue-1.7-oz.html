            <li>I like to smell what I wear on my wrist and on a card first for awhile to see if I&#x27;m going to like it.  </li>
            <li>More than enough complements when this is worn!</li>
            <li>for many years been used the same perfume.</li>

            <li>A new fresh fragrance for me to try.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>It is very feminine.</li>
            <li>I bought a whole bunch of these bc</li>
            <li>and yes, it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because I really like how it smell.</li>
            <li>people and older people alike always compliment me when I have this scent on.</li>
            <li>It was highly rated in surveys a magazine that my wife had seen.  </li>
            <li>it is not easy to find in most stores.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and seductive.</li>
            <li>same exact friggin&lt;br /&gt;scent.</li>
            <li>And 20 minutes later all traces of the scent have pretty well dissipated.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this at a store and went back for another one.</li>
            <li>long lasting and was very reasonable in price!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely there and doesn&#x27;t really smell the same.  </li>
            <li>Last me a long while, worth the money.</li>
            <li>a man walked past me and stopped dead in his tracks and asked me what perfume I had on-- I replied &amp;#34;Seductive by Guess.&amp;#34; He complimented my scent and told me that he loved it and would purchase for his daughter.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne, only down side is the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>Really love this scent; its heavenly and subtle!</li>
            <li>thought it was a little too much</li>

            <li> I bought a whole bunch of these bc</li>

            <li> I give it 4 stars because I really like how it smell.</li>
            <li> people and older people alike always compliment me when I have this scent on.</li>

            <li> It is very soft and seductive.</li>
            <li> same exact friggin&lt;br /&gt;scent.</li>
            <li> And 20 minutes later all traces of the scent have pretty well dissipated.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this at a store and went back for another one.</li>

            <li> Due to being picky in my perfume collection, I hardly have a few perfumes in my collection</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was a knock off.</li>
            <li> and I had to stock up before it was too late.</li>

            <li> about 7 months ago, I purchased Armani code for woman. It cost me about $60.00&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a little too much but what the heck.. I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;A week ago I ordered this one, and it came well packed, beautifully on time and many other&lt;br /&gt;compliments about the preparation of the packet. I opened it and guess what! It was the same Armani Code&lt;br /&gt;for woman (obviously)  in a different bottle. My final point: If you are thinking about purchasing Armani Code,&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;re going to end up paying way more just for the brand name, instead buy this one. Different Bottle, same exact friggin&lt;br /&gt;scent. You will save 62%... Now, if I knew then what I know now.....</li>
            <li> Love it !!!! Love it !!! Love it !!!!</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this product and it was not available whereI originally purchased it, till I found it here. The price was also a factor, it was just right</li>

            <li> I love the light fragrance. It&#x27;s not girly/sweet. It&#x27;s clean, mild and neutral. The price is wonderful.</li>

            <li> This perfume smells so great! Perfect for a night out or work. It is a very sexy scent and I always get compliments</li>
            <li> I ordered this months ago from the same supplier here and it was awesome!  I just ordered again (2/2017) and received a bottle that looked the same but the tags were different (no charm on the bottle) and the scent is a lot different.  It&#x27;s barely there and doesn&#x27;t really smell the same.  I used to love this, now not so much.. not sure what changed along the way, but it&#x27;s not the same as what I ordered before.  :-(</li>
            <li> My wife loved this which meant I loved if you know what I mean. She said she would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love it. Very warm and flowery fragrance. I got one for my mom and she loved it too. It is very feminine.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my teenager she luvs it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance! Glad Amazon had it ! Great price !</li>
            <li> Bought it for my fiance......i loved the smell and i&#x27;m guessing she&#x27;d love it too. Nice feminine scent !! Too good for the price</li>
            <li> Birthday present for my daughter that smells so good without being so overpowering</li>
            <li> Loved the smell. Nice size. Felt like it wasnt as strong as i wanted it to be but it was a good light smell that i liked.</li>
            <li> great product  and fast ship buy</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I always buy it.  I love most of the Guess perfumes. Very good size for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. And I like it as well. Good parfum for a great price. What do you want more?</li>
            <li> I bought a whole bunch of these bc they&#x27;re allegedly discontinued.  It&#x27;s my favorite perfume and I had to stock up before it was too late. It&#x27;s a very sexy scent and I always get compliments on it when I wear it. I&#x27;d suggest you buy as many as you can before you can&#x27;t get it anymore. The price was really good too which made it even more necessary to buy them in bulk. Get it before it&#x27;s too late!</li>
            <li> Really love this scent; its heavenly and subtle! It is also not over bearing. I react to strong perfumes and didnt have any issues with this..Highly recommend if you want to smell nice and not choke, lol.</li>
            <li> Very lovely scent. It is a favorite. It was safely packaged and everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> this is m first time buying this cologne and i can say it is really good and it attracts a lot of attention. i get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the perfume from Amazon as I use it almost everyday . Due to being picky in my perfume collection, I hardly have a few perfumes in my collection but this is one of the &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; for daily use.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was a knock off. It did not seem to match the quality,from the one I purchased in the dept store.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and great price.</li>
            <li> A new fresh fragrance for me to try.  Light and a hint of lemon, and should be nice to wear for summer...shipped promptly...thank you!</li>
            <li> I had to look for this colonge it is not easy to find in most stores.  I like to smell what I wear on my wrist and on a card first for awhile to see if I&#x27;m going to like it.  After I tried this one I couldn&#x27;t get it out of my head.  Love the scent very nice a little floral but mostly spice and woods.  Nice!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day, but the scent is very nice.  And at this price, I just use more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Guess fan. And everything by Guess looks like of good taste to me. And it wasn&#x27;t different with the perfume. I love how this one smells and how it stays in your skin.</li>
            <li> I found this scent about 2 years ago, and I think I&#x27;m on my third bottle now. I like it because it&#x27;s not too over powering, but still smells really good and is more &amp;#34;unique&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s so much less expensive here than in stores too! So win-win.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she loves it, She likes it so much she wears it most of the time.</li>
            <li> love this scent! heavier so good for fall/winter or evenings... long lasting and was very reasonable in price!  strongly recommend  :)</li>
            <li> This rating is elegui its compliance&lt;br /&gt;I liked the way of working and effectiveness&lt;br /&gt;friends are encouraged to use all</li>
            <li> Beautiful perfume, not to strong, good for every day wear and a night out. And the price is great. I love everything about it:)</li>
            <li> Smells nice &#x3D;).. Very happy with this</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;Cashmere&amp;#34; scent in this spray which is why I bought it.  But is is very harsh/strong/not pleasant when first sprayed and the sprayer takes too much effort to depress so I sometimes have to use both hands.  And 20 minutes later all traces of the scent have pretty well dissipated.  Well priced but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I love it I wear it every day my type of  cologne I will give my friends and love one a bottle for a gift any time ms. Pat</li>
            <li> I kid you not-- a man walked past me and stopped dead in his tracks and asked me what perfume I had on-- I replied &amp;#34;Seductive by Guess.&amp;#34; He complimented my scent and told me that he loved it and would purchase for his daughter. During the course of the conversation, he revealed that he was BLIND! So you know that his nose is ASTUTE!&lt;br /&gt;Young people and older people alike always compliment me when I have this scent on. It has become a staple in my perfume circle. And for the price offered by Amazon,  I will keep on coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money. Without a doubt.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I bought it as a gift for my mother, but now I&#x27;m constantly using it as well. I love the scent. It&#x27;s girly, and sexy!</li>
            <li> I love it! Is the better price and is the original perfume</li>
            <li> More than enough complements when this is worn!</li>
            <li> muy bueno gracias todo en orden  el envió todo bien  gracias  feliz día perfume muy bueno  100 % gracias ok</li>
            <li> Smells really good and the price is very cheap comparing to the stores . I bought it for 19.99 stores have it for 45.00 big difference .</li>
            <li> I first bought this at a store and went back for another one. After it was finished, I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store so I checked Amazon. I love this perfume, perhaps the best I have used in the past 5 years and yes, it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, only down side is the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Within an hour all the scent is gone :( I give it 4 stars because I really like how it smell.</li>
            <li> The smell comes out very very light, does not stays longer than 2 hours and you end up spending more product trying to keep it longer in your clothes.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for my sister&#x27;s birthday gift. for many years been used the same perfume. if she likes it because it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Amazing price! Fast shipping! Love this perfume!</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear this fragrance I get the absolute greatest response from everyone.  I&#x27;ve even been stopped by strangers to ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.  I used to spend 2-3 times as much for other fragrances that may also have gotten good reviews, but nothing has compared to what people have to say when I wear my Guess Seductive!!!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious on my wife!</li>
            <li> My mother loved the way it smelled it was gone the next day from my room</li>
            <li> Another case of oops I bought the wrong one. I thought it was the EDP not EDT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the same smell... in a huge bottle.. it just doesn&#x27;t linger at all. Not on sheets , clothes or skin.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will just buy a smaller bottle of actual EDP from a different brand for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this smell.. but I need it to last. I wish the EDP was available.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s matched with the description and sent immediately once I made this order.&lt;br /&gt;The packet is neat and well stuffed.</li>
            <li> I have never used EDT spray on a daily basis until now!  I have gotten many compliments of this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This guess perfumes smell very good. They stay very long on me. Everyone ask me what kind of perfume i am  using</li>
