            <li>and i got a great result for a quiff i&#x60;m willing to buy more from this mousse</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t add a lot of lift to your hair wasn&#x27;t to happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mousse</li>
            <li>After getting my hair cut, I tried it again and it was even better.</li>
            <li>The curling iron doesn&#x27;t just slide through my hair any more, and the curl stays all day.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>So glad it was available online.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s lightweight and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Had not been able to find this product locally so was happy Amazon was selling it.  </li>
            <li>Gives my hair some structure, and adds a a beautiful wave to it without adding extra oils.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this for drying my hair straight!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it when my hair was just about dry, and I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it when my hair was fairly wet, and I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fine thin hair, especially on top.</li>
            <li>I was so happy with this product that I went out and bought the shampoo and conditioner, and plan to try other Sassoon Pro products.</li>
            <li>The items were quickly shipped, arriving well protected in adequate packaging.</li>
            <li>I tried this after reading about it in a magazine, and it works really well with my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>As far as how it works, it is very light and gives great flexible volume and does not leave my hair stiff.</li>
            <li>I have fine, colored hair that is easily weighed down by most mousse, and thickening products.</li>
            <li>Use the right amount and</li>
            <li>This product is the perfect weight for my hair - it is light enough to not weigh it down, yet strong enough to hold the curl or wave (day depending ) all day without looking crispy or drying out my hair.  </li>
            <li>I live in the AZ desert and any hair product with even one humectant in it dries out my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>should length hair that is very fine straight on top and curl from the ears down.  </li>
            <li>Just can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s better than comparable products in the same price point.</li>
            <li>this is the first time i try a mousse in my life</li>
            <li>My original product worked fantastic, and I doubted I&#x27;d find anything better, or at least that&#x27;d compare.</li>
            <li>I have very thin hair &amp; this gives me great body!</li>
            <li>and I have tried a lot of products that claim to give your hair more volume, but all they do is make my hair look flat.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling full and soft for hours on end.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that I can wear straight or curly with products and a hair dryer with and without a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>This product works well on my very find, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It absolutely works</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or crunchiness in my hair and really gave it some volume.</li>
            <li>Instead, I found that this product just made my hair very crunchy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t having much luck until I found Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Boost &amp; Lift Foaming Air Mousse.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like to have helmet head.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and it tends to frizz.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t take much either.</li>
            <li>I was trying out a few styling products, looking for a more economical one, then the one I had purchased from a hair salon.</li>
            <li>I chose this mousse as I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the other I was using.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh you down and is very light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say this one did everything the more expensive one did, for much less.</li>
            <li>so I set out to find new products.</li>
            <li>I love the salon brand too, but for everyday, this works!</li>
            <li>The top part stops going down properly, so the product comes out liquid-y instead of as mousse, and it leaks a bunch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this mousse twice, and although the actual product is great at giving my super thick hair a small volume boost and even helps enhance my natural wave, both times</li>
            <li>so far has kept my waves/</li>
            <li>Gives good lift to the roots, does not weigh hair down or leave a greasy residue (and I am prone to greasy hair), and lasts a long time even when it looks like it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li>Not the same like the first use and throwing it away after third time.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin wavy hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super messy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product on clearance at a major drug store chain.</li>
            <li>It smells subtle and a little sweet, so its not annoyingly fragrant.</li>
            <li>This really defines my curls, is not heavy and does not have a heavy scent.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried this my hair styled so easily, and lasted all day into the next--and I desperately needed a haircut.</li>
            <li>If you live in a dry climate, you must give this a try!</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty limp but using this product helped to lift it.</li>
            <li>I wash, condition, &amp; rinse well with my head upside down with whatever shampoo &amp; conditioner I have chosen from my stash, then brush right side up &amp; blow dry the bangs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it when my hair was all dry, and I wasn&#x27;t so happy with it (looked and felt a little weird).</li>
            <li>I have very thick, fine hair, and stopped coloring it last year.</li>

            <li> I have very thick, fine hair, and stopped coloring it last year.</li>
            <li> What I like about it is that the product is not heavy feeling, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, and actually does not leave my hair looking &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; like a lot do.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and bought this product thinking that it would give a little boost and volume so that my curls wouldn&#x27;t hang tight and straight down.</li>
            <li> This stuff does NOT weigh my hair down and while it holds my style, my hair still feels soft.</li>
            <li> I only slightly dry the longer hair scrunching my hair as I do that, then when my hair is about 1/4-1/2 way dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product was damaged before or during shipping, but there is no way I&#x27;m keeping such an item in my bathroom with other combustible items.</li>
            <li> i tried this on a wet hair then dry it</li>
            <li> After a few week the product starts to become different.</li>
            <li> A small amount (I actually use less than the recommended amount),</li>
            <li> and this has not weighed down my hair and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, gives the volume I was looking for, and isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my combs and brushes.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair body without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> applied into towel dried hair allows to to style and end up with body and no frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy for my hair either and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few months ago when I found it at Walmart on clearance.</li>
            <li> You know when it is so stiff you can&#x27;t run your fingers through it?  </li>
            <li> but my hair feels thicker without being stiff.</li>
            <li> my hair is very flat and thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to throw both away twice only half used, so unfortunately I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have just past</li>
            <li> I bought this mousee to help boost my heavy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is not overwhelming, and the foam is luxurious and does provide some lift.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten this the bottle thing it comes in has broken by the time about half the product is gone.</li>
            <li> it added volume and make it thick</li>
            <li> this made it look thick quiff look</li>
            <li> and I usually have to buy it on Amazon because it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This stuff works great for me. And it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Had to discard product immediately. Was terrified it would burst open and cause some sort of fire hazard. I don&#x27;t know if the product was damaged before or during shipping, but there is no way I&#x27;m keeping such an item in my bathroom with other combustible items. Very disappointed. will be requesting a refund. See attached image.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that I can wear straight or curly with products and a hair dryer with and without a diffuser.  I LOVE this for drying my hair straight!!</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t add a lot of lift to your hair wasn&#x27;t to happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Boost and Lift Foaming Air Mousse is a nice product that lives up to its billing of ease and hold.  The items were quickly shipped, arriving well protected in adequate packaging.</li>
            <li> I was trying out a few styling products, looking for a more economical one, then the one I had purchased from a hair salon. My original product worked fantastic, and I doubted I&#x27;d find anything better, or at least that&#x27;d compare. This product did the trick. I noticed that it was&lt;br /&gt;refered to as,\\&quot;foaming air mousse.\\&quot; For me, that was&lt;br /&gt;a correct description. I have fine, colored hair that is easily weighed down by most mousse, and thickening products. I&#x27;m happy to say this one did everything the more expensive one did, for much less.</li>
            <li> This product works well on my very find, frizzy hair. Just can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s better than comparable products in the same price point.</li>
            <li> After a few week the product starts to become different. Not the same like the first use and throwing it away after third time.</li>
            <li> I read about this mousse in a magazine and decided to give it a try.  It absolutely works, it&#x27;s lightweight and is easy to use.  A small amount (I actually use less than the recommended amount), applied into towel dried hair allows to to style and end up with body and no frizz. In the rainy NW this is a treat.</li>
            <li> Finally - A hair product that is not loaded with humectants! I live in the AZ desert and any hair product with even one humectant in it dries out my baby fine hair. After about a year of searching I have finally found something that works for me. I can&#x27;t believe it!! I hope they never ever discontinue this or I will be suicidal! As far as how it works, it is very light and gives great flexible volume and does not leave my hair stiff. I have very fine thin wavy hair and this has not weighed down my hair and so far has kept my waves/curls looking perky. If you live in a dry climate, you must give this a try!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my fine, thinning hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, gives the volume I was looking for, and isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my combs and brushes. A great product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and not a ton of it. I chose this mousse as I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the other I was using. This doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or crunchiness in my hair and really gave it some volume. You can&#x27;t beat the price either compared to some of the Redken products I was using. It&#x27;s not too heavy for my hair either and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or oily. Try it.</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading about it in a magazine, and it works really well with my baby fine hair. It gives my hair body without weighing it down. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have just past should length hair that is very fine straight on top and curl from the ears down.  It has been a struggle all my life until my atitude about my hair changed &amp; just accepted that I&#x27;d always look like a I had a growing out perm.  This product is the perfect weight for my hair - it is light enough to not weigh it down, yet strong enough to hold the curl or wave (day depending ) all day without looking crispy or drying out my hair.  I wash, condition, &amp; rinse well with my head upside down with whatever shampoo &amp; conditioner I have chosen from my stash, then brush right side up &amp; blow dry the bangs.  I only slightly dry the longer hair scrunching my hair as I do that, then when my hair is about 1/4-1/2 way dry I use only one pump of this product rubbed between my hands &amp; scrunch it into my curly hair.  I do use a clip to hold my hair up for a while which probably also helps the curl of the day.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this mousse twice, and although the actual product is great at giving my super thick hair a small volume boost and even helps enhance my natural wave, both times I have gotten this the bottle thing it comes in has broken by the time about half the product is gone. The top part stops going down properly, so the product comes out liquid-y instead of as mousse, and it leaks a bunch. It&#x27;s super messy. I&#x27;ve had to throw both away twice only half used, so unfortunately I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t find this product in the stores after the 1st time i bought it.  Good thing I went online.  i purchased 2.  this product is similar to a salon quality brand, but it&#x27;s actually easier to use.  I love this product.  I love the salon brand too, but for everyday, this works!</li>
            <li> Been using this product and loving it.  It is  a light mousse and does a beautiful job.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mousse and I usually have to buy it on Amazon because it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores. Gives good lift to the roots, does not weigh hair down or leave a greasy residue (and I am prone to greasy hair), and lasts a long time even when it looks like it&#x27;s empty. Also inexpensive which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and bought this product thinking that it would give a little boost and volume so that my curls wouldn&#x27;t hang tight and straight down. Instead, I found that this product just made my hair very crunchy. After using this product for about a week it has not provided volume and causes my hair to just stick together and become coarse and almost brittle feeling. As for curly hair I would avoid this water based mousse.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, fine hair, and stopped coloring it last year. I am finally \\&quot;all natural\\&quot;...er...1/3 gray. I found that the products from my hair coloring days did not work well so I set out to find new products. I wasn&#x27;t having much luck until I found Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Boost &amp; Lift Foaming Air Mousse. The first time I tried this my hair styled so easily, and lasted all day into the next--and I desperately needed a haircut. After getting my hair cut, I tried it again and it was even better. This stuff does NOT weigh my hair down and while it holds my style, my hair still feels soft. I was so happy with this product that I went out and bought the shampoo and conditioner, and plan to try other Sassoon Pro products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for only about a month now and so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  What I like about it is that the product is not heavy feeling, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, and actually does not leave my hair looking &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; like a lot do.  It holds wonderfully. I&#x27;ve used it when my hair was just about dry, and I&#x27;m happy with it.  I&#x27;ve used it when my hair was fairly wet, and I&#x27;m happy with it.  I&#x27;ve used it when my hair was all dry, and I wasn&#x27;t so happy with it (looked and felt a little weird).</li>
            <li> I use this every day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I tried it a few months ago when I found it at Walmart on clearance. When I couldn&#x27;t find it again, I immediately checked Amazon and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very light and doesn&#x27;t leave a buildup of any kind. It smells subtle and a little sweet, so its not annoyingly fragrant. Gives my hair some structure, and adds a a beautiful wave to it without adding extra oils.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light - but good hold - product.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores any longer.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine thin hair, especially on top. I really don&#x27;t like to have helmet head. You know when it is so stiff you can&#x27;t run your fingers through it?  I purchased this product on clearance at a major drug store chain. It not only give lift but my hair feels thicker without being stiff. The curling iron doesn&#x27;t just slide through my hair any more, and the curl stays all day. The only problem now is I can&#x27;t find it in any stores in my area so I decided to try Amazon, Yeah I found it. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Use the right amount and</li>
            <li> Excellent mousse!  Does what it is supposed to do.  Does mot leave residue.  Can not even tell you have any mousse in your hair.</li>
            <li> This really defines my curls, is not heavy and does not have a heavy scent.  I hope they continue to make it.  I cannot find it in stores anymore!</li>
            <li> I saw this on a recommended list in Good Housekeeping.  Found it at one of the local stores, and then never could find it again.  So glad it was available online.  It was well wrapped and sealed so it wouldn&#x27;t  leak during shipping.  I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and it tends to frizz. This stuff works awesome on my hair. It don&#x27;t take much either. I love the smell. People always are telling how nice my hair smells. My husband loves it too!</li>
            <li> I bought this mousee to help boost my heavy, thick hair.  It does a fairly good job for me but would be excellent for someone with thinner hair.  The fragrance is not overwhelming, and the foam is luxurious and does provide some lift.  Sassoon&#x27;s Mousse just did not work as it claimed for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Had not been able to find this product locally so was happy Amazon was selling it.  My hair is pretty limp but using this product helped to lift it.</li>
            <li> this is the first time i try a mousse in my life i tried this on a wet hair then dry it i added a bed head wax to it and i got a great result for a quiff i&#x60;m willing to buy more from this mousse it added volume and make it thick Btw my hair is very flat and thin this made it look thick quiff look</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair &amp; this gives me great body!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! It leaves my hair feeling full and soft for hours on end. It doesn&#x27;t weigh you down and is very light. You won&#x27;t regret getting this.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and I have tried a lot of products that claim to give your hair more volume, but all they do is make my hair look flat. This product actually gave me some lift. I will definitely keep using it.</li>
