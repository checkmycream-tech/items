            <li>I have used Plax for 30 years and I love it.  </li>
            <li>GOD I wondered where my FAVORITE mouthwash went, and I found it&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it and update if there are any more improvements.</li>
            <li>Glad it is still available thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is strong, minty and does remove plaque.</li>
            <li>I was just as happy with the private label versions</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it online because none of my local stores seem to sell it anymore.</li>
            <li>I often get complements of how clean and tartar free my teeth are by my dentist during my annual cleaning.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and this is the first notable change).</li>
            <li>Many supermarkets and drugstores have sold their own private label versions of this product.</li>
            <li>Makes teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>I find that my teeth are clean and that I don&#x27;t have plaque build up on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>When you first start, you can feel that some easy plagues are drops.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;</li>
            <li>Rinsing with Plax before brushing makes it easier to keep them clean, and it has a fresh taste without being too minty.</li>
            <li>Mouth feels so fresh after.</li>
            <li>Been using it for many many years, I prefer it over any other brand.</li>
            <li>the original red one is my favorite</li>
            <li>like this product and the price is right</li>
            <li>The only surprise about this is that it&#x27;s got a fair amount of alcohol in it, so watch out if your mouth is sensitive to this.</li>
            <li>I was ready to give this a one star rating, but this morning as I was flossing, a piece of plaque/tartar on my bottom teeth flaked right off.</li>
            <li>There is still more to get rid of, but I feel like it&#x27;s taking a really long time</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, but the dry mouth was too much for me.</li>
            <li>actual product is probably fine, just overpriced.</li>
            <li>I also found the price extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and it was very well packaged.</li>
            <li>I really think it&#x27;s because I started using Plax.</li>
            <li>but I like this one just as much I like that pre-brushfeeling.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very crowded</li>
            <li>and it really does control the otherwise build-up of plaque.</li>
            <li>Since their prices were much lower than Plax even though the ingredients were exactly the same, I believe that lowered sales for Plax.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>only hope that the private label versions have sold well enough so that those products will continue to be available for us when Plax completely disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within 2 days of stopping the product my mouth felt back to normal.</li>
            <li>I do miss the red flavor, but the green is fine.</li>
            <li>it help clean stain and tartar, but it is not magic as some commented.</li>

            <li> Will remove YEARS of Tatar (and yes, I mean that gray stuff that looks like cement) in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> However, a side effect for me was HORRIBLE dry mouth.</li>

            <li> I love the fact that I was able to purchase this product, in this quantity, without having to go to a &#x27;warehouse&#x27; store.  I also found the price extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li> Plax is great and it works.  When I go to the dentist, I have no plaque.  I contribute all this to plax.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more so I guess it isn&#x27;t manufactured.  I was so happy to find it here.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding this in the stores. It was great to find it online. I finally found a local store that still sells it.  The shipping was fast and it was very well packaged.</li>
            <li> Teeth are noticable whiter and stains are removed easier after brushing. I also like the fact that it gets the job done without burning my mouth like other mouth wash.</li>
            <li> When you first start, you can feel that some easy plagues are drops.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27; m almost using this product for 2 years. Helping but not that perfect of course.&lt;br /&gt;I still have some plagues that I have to go dentist to remove :)</li>
            <li> After a month the of use, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in terms of removing tartar. I guess I&#x27;ll just need a dentist for my issue.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely works!  You can see the difference.  Very glad you can find this online as I never see it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Like the product and not having to remember to pick it up at the store is always a nice side affect of ordering from amazon.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me I have far less plaque.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for several months now. I noticed my teeth are whiter and stronger. I&#x27;ll continue using it.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!!  Will remove YEARS of Tatar (and yes, I mean that gray stuff that looks like cement) in a few weeks.  Stick with it twice a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff does the job but is not cheap.  I found out later that if I can find the generic brand at local retailers and that&#x27;s a bit less pricey.</li>
            <li> Been using it for many many years, I prefer it over any other brand. I do miss the red flavor, but the green is fine.</li>
            <li> it help clean stain and tartar, but it is not magic as some commented.</li>
            <li> I use to have a lot of yellow plax along my gum line that took a dentist a long time to chip it off.  I was amazed when after using it for a short time I found all the plax gone.  I definitely would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Just so you know, Johnson &amp; Johnson stopped manufacturing this product in BOTH flavors a long time ago. I called the company to confirm. They no longer have any stock. That&#x27;s why you can&#x27;t find it locally. What we are purchasing here on Amazon is the last of the stock that independent sellers have in their warehouses and that&#x27;s the last of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They said they stopped production because the product didn&#x27;t sell. I believe there were two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Some of the reviewers here on Amazon shared dental studies that supposedly \\&quot;proved\\&quot; the dental rinse had no benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Many supermarkets and drugstores have sold their own private label versions of this product. Since their prices were much lower than Plax even though the ingredients were exactly the same, I believe that lowered sales for Plax. I was just as happy with the private label versions myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I believe it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, despite those studies/reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only hope that the private label versions have sold well enough so that those products will continue to be available for us when Plax completely disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I was getting so tired of hearing &amp;#34;you&#x27;ve got so much plaque&amp;#34;.  I started using Plax about a year ago and now the dentist says &amp;#34;You are our most improved patient&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s the best endorsement I can give Plax.</li>
            <li> WOW! THIS IS GREAT I USE THIS SUPERB MOUTHWASH EVERY DAY WHEN I USE MY WATERPIC ASSEMBLY...</li>
            <li> This is a great product - and I have difficulty finding it in the stores. I&#x27;m glad I ordered the jumbo size....now I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a month and I did notice that a lot of plaque came off my teeth. However, a side effect for me was HORRIBLE dry mouth. This stuff made my mouth and tongue so dry I found myself clenching my teeth together, which gave me constant headaches and toothaches. Within 2 days of stopping the product my mouth felt back to normal. It seems to have good reviews so I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, but the dry mouth was too much for me.</li>
            <li> You are wasting your money by buying this.  The active ingredient has been proven in clinical testing to do nothing to benefit your teeth.  There is no plaque control, tartar control or antibacterial properties. This is coming from a dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> I use to have tarter build up at the bottom front of my teeth. It was a continuous problem until my friend suggested Plax. I do not have this problem anymore. I often get complements of how clean and tartar free my teeth are by my dentist during my annual cleaning. I really think it&#x27;s because I started using Plax.</li>
            <li> I will not be without my plax I have used this product for years the original red one is my favorite but I like this one just as much I like that pre-brushfeeling.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very crowded so plaque tends to build up. Rinsing with Plax before brushing makes it easier to keep them clean, and it has a fresh taste without being too minty. I was happy to find it online because none of my local stores seem to sell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it is very difficult to find in stores these days. Glad it is still available thru Amazon. Makes teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Massively overpriced. This twin pack is $8 at BJs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product is probably fine, just overpriced. I&#x27;d have stopped by now but amazon wanted more words.</li>
            <li> Aaaaaah.  Mouth feels so fresh after. Love it and the plax fighting is added value</li>
            <li> This product was difficult to find in my local supermarket or pharmacy.  I have used this rinse before and am very happy with this product.  Am delighted to know that Amazon carries it.  I find that my teeth are clean and that I don&#x27;t have plaque build up on my teeth.  I see that my teeth remain white and i don&#x27;t have to use whitening procedures on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with an electric tooth brush since it came on the market (maybe 20 years) instead of tooth paste which is an abrasive that wears tooth enamel away. It&#x27;s easier on the tooth brush mechanism, too!</li>
            <li> like this product and the price is right</li>
            <li> It is much better now that I can rinse my mouth before and after brushing.</li>
            <li> I have used Plax for 30 years and I love it.  The dentist said I am the only one of her patients with no sign of plaque or tartar at my annual check-up.</li>
            <li> GOD I wondered where my FAVORITE mouthwash went, and I found it&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon (of course).  This stuff is the BEST mouthwash EVER&lt;br /&gt;it is strong, minty and does remove plaque.</li>
            <li> find the taste of the mint version to be excellent.....and it really does control the otherwise build-up of plaque.</li>
            <li> I was ready to give this a one star rating, but this morning as I was flossing, a piece of plaque/tartar on my bottom teeth flaked right off. There is still more to get rid of, but I feel like it&#x27;s taking a really long time (I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and this is the first notable change). So I guess this stuff works. I&#x27;ll keep using it and update if there are any more improvements.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell how well this actually works. The only surprise about this is that it&#x27;s got a fair amount of alcohol in it, so watch out if your mouth is sensitive to this. (Mine is . . .)</li>
