            <li> Over the past couple of weeks I have learned that it is not easy to find long lasting polish or great colors.</li>
            <li> I decided when my nails were long enough I would wear nail polish.</li>
            <li> My only problem was it only lasted a day and a half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a really deep forest green.</li>
            <li> I bought this and 3 other colors,</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a dark, hunter-green color.  </li>
            <li> Khloe had a little lam-lam.</li>
            <li> I thought this green would be a little bit lighter based on the swatches I&#x27;d seen online, but that&#x27;s the gamble when you order online.</li>
            <li> I have been admiring O.P.I. Kardashian Nail Polish, Khloe Had a Little Lam Lam for months now!</li>
            <li> My only suggestion when you&#x27;re using it is to definitely use a base coat.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t, the color stains my nails without fail.</li>
            <li> Boo on the seller for having the wrong picture on their listing!</li>
            <li> I just hate that once you remove it, it stains, even with 2 coats of base coat.</li>
            <li> I take the blame for the stains though - I was too eager to put the color on and didn&#x27;t apply the base coat!</li>

            <li> My favorite color for the holidays! Rare color. I have not come across to a nail polish that closely resembles this color.</li>
            <li> I love this color! I once left it at a nail salon and forgot to get back. When I tried looking for it in the stores it was gone :/ glad to have it back!</li>
            <li> I loved this nail polish.The collor is amazing.I collored a week ago,and still great,I recomended.In my opinion the OPI is the best nail polish.</li>
            <li> I got the polish quick and with no problem.  Looks just like in the picture but I didn&#x27;t like it on me. The color wasn&#x27;t as nice as i thought it would be.  I gave it to my sister and she loves it.</li>
            <li> The color is super cute! but more of a winter or fall color. I should have taken that into consideration. But it&#x27;s definitely a cute color!</li>
            <li> I love this color polish! I wish it a as avaliable in a gel polish!</li>
            <li> Never bought an O.P.I. color before, but always hear great things. The color is amazing, it&#x27;s a rich blue-green with a subdue sheen. It&#x27;s the perfect fall color. My only problem was it only lasted a day and a half. I buffed, filed, etc. my nails first, painted them, top coated them, but I still saw chipping. My nails are also stained a light greenish hue after removal. Nothing major that would stop me from using the product.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich dark turquoise color, exactly what I was looking for. It goes on very smoothly and shows up well - only one coat is enough for a dark, vibrant color. This polish is perfect for fans of the Kardashian sisters, as well as anyone looking for a great quality turquoise nail polish.The price is very good, too! Great product, great seller, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite Nicole color so far!</li>
            <li> Great product! I bought this and 3 other colors, cause I&#x27;m a Kardashian-fan.  Only needed 2 coats and it looks perfect!  Excellent quality!</li>
            <li> After 30 years of biting my nails I finally broke the habit! I decided when my nails were long enough I would wear nail polish. Over the past couple of weeks I have learned that it is not easy to find long lasting polish or great colors. I have purchased 10 different bottles of nail polish and finally today I fell in love with one. It was this Kardashian polish... the color Khloe had a little lam-lam. Amazing color! I love it so much I want to wear it everyday. It was easy to apply.. just two coats and it was solid and beautiful. I am so excited about this color. I am not a Kardashian fan any bit... but I am a fan of their polish. I am looking forward to giving their other colors a try. There were so many... but this one definitely caught my eye. Buy it! you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I adore this color. It&#x27;s like a really deep forest green. No shimmer. My only suggestion when you&#x27;re using it is to definitely use a base coat. When I don&#x27;t, the color stains my nails without fail. I take the blame for the stains though - I was too eager to put the color on and didn&#x27;t apply the base coat!</li>
            <li> I thought this green would be a little bit lighter based on the swatches I&#x27;d seen online, but that&#x27;s the gamble when you order online. This is a much darker green than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got it. The delivery was fast and it exactly on the picture. Also,  it have the series number on the bottom at bottle. I can&#x27;t wait to wear on predicure in summer. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The picture on Amazon shows this as a light greenish blue color.  It&#x27;s nothing like that in person at all.  It&#x27;s a dark, hunter-green color.  Not at ALL what I wanted.  Boo on the seller for having the wrong picture on their listing!</li>
            <li> I have been admiring O.P.I. Kardashian Nail Polish, Khloe Had a Little Lam Lam for months now! The first time I saw it in Target I sampled it in the store and loved it immediately. I didn&#x27;t have the cash that day, but I thought about it since. Today I finally purchased it from Target and it was the very last bottle. I applied 2 coats and it is beautiful. It does look darker than in the bottle, but it is still a gorgeous hue! Perfect shade for the Fall and Winter season! Love it!</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere else, I knew that Amazon would have it. I love it and thinks it&#x27;s a beautiful color. I just hate that once you remove it, it stains, even with 2 coats of base coat.</li>
            <li> I should have listin to the reviews. It started chipping off in just one day. Have other colors from there collection that work better.</li>
            <li> I just love the look of this nail colour, and I was sad not to see it in the store. And the name cracks me up.</li>
