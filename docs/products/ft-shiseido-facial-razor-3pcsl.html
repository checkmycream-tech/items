            <li>I purchased these razors because of the good reviews, but they didn&#x27;t turn out to be as great as I thought.  </li>
            <li>Really a nice result!</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size to easily maneuver around my lips, nose and brows.  </li>
            <li>It must be me because everybody else loved these things</li>
            <li>but like i said they got good reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a good product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.  </li>
            <li>These razors were definitely a good buy, if I do say so.</li>
            <li>Good blade length.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I followed with a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>a good reason to order a lot at one time.</li>
            <li>Loved these razors ...</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried them for eyebrow shaping yet, but I think they will work good for that too.</li>
            <li>this is an excellent product, easy to use, and effective on face to get rid of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy!!</li>

            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s best to use a soothing, non-medicated, unscented, gentle cream or alternative afterwards.</li>
            <li>Convienient and handy</li>
            <li>also use Thayers rose witch hazel with no alcohol after shaving.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly to tidy up my eyebrow area.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Wow these are awesome!!</li>
            <li>Out of all the razors I have ever used, these are by far the best!</li>
            <li>The razor edge is very fine and doesn&#x27;t nick the skin as some of the coarser razors do.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these and they seem to be a great deal price wise. :)</li>
            <li>However they were a great deal and were exactly what I was looking for to start dermaplaning.  </li>
            <li>this is a treatment that can be safely done every two months or so.</li>
            <li>sure took forever to receive them though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a myth that hair grows back darker and/or thicker, do don&#x27;t hesitate another minute - buy this awesome product now!</li>
            <li>; in the case that I wasn&#x27;t able to make it to my monthly appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad i found them on Amazon</li>
            <li>Wish I ordered more.</li>
            <li>It more than met our expectation.</li>
            <li>It arrived safely~</li>
            <li>If the price dropped, I&#x27;d snatch them up real quick.</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase.  </li>
            <li>These are ok.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for trimming facial hair.  </li>
            <li>i love that it exfoliates my face.</li>
            <li>Okay for a stray hair or so.</li>
            <li>Takes off hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Ordered even more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller and they have great quality products!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I told them the first razor worked beautifully and the second was not so great.  </li>
            <li>I saw that they were made of pretty good material; you don&#x27;t have to worry about these breaking or getting damaged under pressure.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good, but I&#x27;m not planning to reorder.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>Keep you blades clean!</li>
            <li>These facial razors are great and very easy to use .</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic and I love the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, great product!!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair on my face and these tools make it easy to use and get rid of hair.  </li>
            <li>Really easy to use, takes 1 minute to remove hair.</li>
            <li>It worked well, but the blade dulled very quickly.</li>
            <li>The handle makes it easy to hold and control.</li>
            <li>Convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>How cool to be able to take off outer layers and reveal as it did for me a bit smoother skin.</li>
            <li>Of the many facial and eyebrow razors I have purchased, these Shiseido razors are the absolute best!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and leave me skin so smooth when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>When ordering these I didn&#x27;t realize that they were coming from another country, which is fine</li>
            <li>Perfect for face, bikini area, or anywhere you may need to easily eliminate a few hairs.</li>
            <li>These are great &amp; takes care of any unwanted facial hair!</li>
            <li>Took a while to get but well worth the price I love</li>
            <li>Make your skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li>It defoliates, use a soft soap and apply a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>Shiseido facial razors are amazing!  </li>
            <li>this is way better and much safer product!</li>
            <li>Depending on your skin, use it first thing in morning if you use good moisturizers at night, and that way your skin will still be soft and easy to apply the razor.</li>
            <li>I had never used one before but it was extremely easy to maneuver, it was just a matter of getting the angle of the blade right.</li>
            <li>These are really cute, and the packaging is superior to other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have upgraded this to a 4 star because they do a good clean job and the hair does not seem to grow back thicker.</li>
            <li>Very good, very sharp, get&#x27;s the job done!</li>
            <li>These are not really that great.</li>
            <li>Now that I know the product works, I&#x27;ll buy more packages since it&#x27;s very inexpensive</li>
            <li>and you really pay more in shipping</li>
            <li>The Feather Flamingo is good for 4-5 uses but only takes off the hair.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe that the hype of dermaplaning could be true, but it is.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you are very moisturized.  </li>
            <li>have never tried dermaplaning before but the learning curve is pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to gently shave the fine hairs off of the side of my face so that I have a smooth canvas to apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li>and they get the job done better than most regular razors.</li>
            <li>Good product, but long shipping time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut myself a couple of times, mostly on my chin, and let me tell you, stopping a minor cut on your face from bleeding seems to take forever. :-)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very sturdy, easy to grasp</li>
            <li>I have only tried these razors once and they seem to do a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>these are great for little areas and quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li>Works really well on those fine hairs all over my face.  </li>
            <li>Great product- dull quickly but very worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>These are great little razors for getting rid of peach fuzz on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Omg close shave and sooo soft!!!!!</li>
            <li>Its so smooth on the face and really gentle.</li>
            <li>But well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>These are very nifty for exfoliating all of the skin without rubbing!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying them since they&#x27;re gentler and work good for everyday exfoliating/ light hair removal!</li>
            <li>it makes my face look so soft and make up go on so smooth!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have the dermaplaning done professionally, my skin looks smoother and more radiant. ..</li>
            <li>I have used another brand of razor intended for eyebrow shaping, and these are far better.  </li>
            <li>Worth the wait.</li>
            <li>The first razor was great and very sharp.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m not using them the right way are what</li>
            <li>and maybe i&#x27;m not using them the right way</li>
            <li>Also, the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; itself was just the right amount of sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just right for a women&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>the price was right on these aswell</li>
            <li>Far and above the best facial razor I have used.</li>
            <li>These are good for the price and very sharp.</li>
            <li>The razor also acts as an awesome exfoliant during the &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; process, as dead skin comes off while getting rid of baby/fuzzy facial hair.</li>
            <li>It was amazing to see the fine fuzz and probably dead skin that came off, leaving my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but, I find that they are somewhat duller than tinkle.&lt;br /&gt;Though these are very gentle for the face vs tinkle, they don&#x27;t quite get the hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They do an amazing job of getting rid of all of the tiny, fine facial hair...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>do the job, removing fine facial hair and dry, scaly skin-a light touch is all that&#x27;s needed and be sure to keep the blade at an angle when using.</li>
            <li>This comes from experience;the first time I did this at home</li>
            <li>do find that they work better than tinkle to exfoliate skin, which is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my first one</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come back darker or thicker, and your makeup looks so much better.</li>
            <li>A regular razor does a better job</li>
            <li>Able to use several times.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think its much better than waxing, that irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I have found that there are better facial razors for the price...</li>
            <li>Better than the drugstore brand that can be bought locally.  </li>
            <li>Never knew how much I needed these until I tried them!  </li>
            <li>They really wok!</li>
            <li>I love these facial razors.</li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>In addition to getting rid of my peach fuzz and helping to trim my &amp;#34;girl sideburns&amp;#34;, these removed a good amount of dead skin from my face.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>The first blade I pulled from the packet worked really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Usable on pretty much any part of the body</li>
            <li>They work great on my eyebrows and other unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>Get it done professionally and get true results.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, but do caution as they are sharp.  </li>
            <li>First time use may cut the skin, more so than a normal razor (I suggest going easy when using these things for the first time because it&#x27;s very easy to put too much pressure on the razor and end up cutting yourself)&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend these facial razors to anyone, just because they&#x27;re so easy to use</li>
            <li>An easy facial razor that really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and will absolutely buy these again!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get much use out of it.  </li>
            <li>These are essentially straight razors.  </li>
            <li>however, I highly recommend them to all women!</li>
            <li>It makes it much easier.</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of times to really get the hang of it, but</li>
            <li>What a waster of money, although it wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>If you like a straight edge razor you will like this but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to shape and control the shape of eyebrows with this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Works better than expected</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>very good.ship from japan.made in</li>
            <li>It shaves very close, be mindful.</li>
            <li>product was just as expected :)</li>
            <li>They work really well.  </li>
            <li>The listing should really be updated.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not a razor, more of a scraper type device.</li>
            <li>I had read reviews that were very favorable to this product.</li>
            <li>Good quality product , works as expected , I suggest watching videos on youtube use to learn their proper management , A must have it!</li>
            <li>Very useful tool for tidying up facial area.</li>
            <li>because I haven&#x27;t used them long enough to give an honest review.  </li>
            <li>I had no trouble using them even though it was my first time.  </li>
            <li>I was extra careful because I didn&#x27;t want to scratch or cut my skin, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Having to put down more words than I have makes me not want to review any products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to use it small areas by using the top portion of the blade only.</li>
            <li>A third use of this one is better than using a brand new Twink facial razor.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to get in smaller and more delicate areas of my face.</li>
            <li>they were so dull they just kind of scrape your skin.</li>
            <li>Just use on clean dry skin and follow with solmething soothing: toner or cream.</li>
            <li>These razors are the perfect length and width to get larger areas like your cheeks or forehead but still small enough to go between the brows and smaller areas.  </li>
            <li>okay for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t last as long as razor guard but worked ok.  </li>
            <li>this product came in foreign  shiseido packaging, but worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a facial razor and these rock.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was long but well worth</li>
            <li>Should be easy to do brows with a little practice.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend ordering several packages at once so you have an adequate supply between orders, unless you wish to pay for expedited international shipping.</li>
            <li>These little razors do a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>Clean shave, no stubble left over for long periods of time</li>
            <li>I expected them to be light and flimsy but they&#x27;re actually is solid and have some weight to them.</li>
            <li>I guess I can use each of them for at least 3 and at most 6 times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These do make the skin soft and you&#x27;ll see the flakes you&#x27;ve removed on the blade.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this for interval use between professional sessions.</li>
            <li>Its also gentle enough to use as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Really recommend it for facial hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed that as time went on and I continued using them, the hair and stubble would not come back as fast, and would allow even up to a week of hairless skin.</li>
            <li>I was so happily surprised at the quality of these.</li>
            <li>Got myself my mom &amp; a mother figure in my life completely hooked</li>
            <li>so you needn&#x27;t worry about the handle snapping or flexing and causing unexpected injury.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a gentle way to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li>I have had professional dermaplaning done</li>
            <li>so much better then the facial razors purchased in drug store the razor is much bigger and the handle longer worked extremely well</li>
            <li>Work well and last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>They are pretty rough</li>
            <li>This is the exact tool, however, you have to be careful.</li>
            <li>It takes away all your hair like magic and it doesn&#x27;t feel rough and hurt like other facial hair removers.</li>
            <li>am in my mid fifties and really recommend facial shaving.</li>
            <li>But either way my facial hair grows back fast</li>
            <li>The plastic handle, while appearing delicate and feminine, is unexpectedly strong</li>
            <li>not sharp at all, they could scrap your skin but not cut hair</li>
            <li>I like this Shiseido Facial Razor because it&#x27;s sharp enough that you can easily remove facial hair after swiping once or twice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dark or thick hair, but really super fine thin blonde vellus hair, but I still can&#x27;t believe how much better</li>
            <li>The 3rd razor was even more dull than the 2nd</li>
            <li>Shiseido is the clear winner in facial razors---clearly a lot of thought went into designing this item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After having had facial planing done professionally, I decided ti try it at home.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can use these, although I can only do one pass on an area before my skin gets irritated.  </li>
            <li>Slight razor burn after first couple of uses</li>
            <li>It seems to work very well for other people.</li>
            <li>Sharp enough to work but not so much it&#x27;s a hazard or nicks me.</li>
            <li>It takes a very gentle stroke straight down, with very little angle, along your cheeks and chin.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth the price and each razor can be used 3-5 times before it gets dull.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these and the shipping time wasn&#x27;t nearly as long as expected.</li>

            <li> Really a nice result!</li>
            <li> They are the perfect size to easily maneuver around my lips, nose and brows.  </li>
            <li> It must be me because everybody else loved these things</li>
            <li> but like i said they got good reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a good product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Does a good job.  </li>
            <li> These razors were definitely a good buy, if I do say so.</li>
            <li> Good blade length.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> I followed with a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> a good reason to order a lot at one time.</li>
            <li> Loved these razors ...</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them for eyebrow shaping yet, but I think they will work good for that too.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product, easy to use, and effective on face to get rid of unwanted hair.</li>

            <li> I love these razors!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s best to use a soothing, non-medicated, unscented, gentle cream or alternative afterwards.</li>
            <li> Convienient and handy</li>
            <li> also use Thayers rose witch hazel with no alcohol after shaving.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly to tidy up my eyebrow area.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Wow these are awesome!!</li>
            <li> Out of all the razors I have ever used, these are by far the best!</li>
            <li> The razor edge is very fine and doesn&#x27;t nick the skin as some of the coarser razors do.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these and they seem to be a great deal price wise. :)</li>
            <li> However they were a great deal and were exactly what I was looking for to start dermaplaning.  </li>
            <li> this is a treatment that can be safely done every two months or so.</li>
            <li> sure took forever to receive them though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a myth that hair grows back darker and/or thicker, do don&#x27;t hesitate another minute - buy this awesome product now!</li>
            <li> ; in the case that I wasn&#x27;t able to make it to my monthly appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad i found them on Amazon</li>
            <li> Wish I ordered more.</li>
            <li> It more than met our expectation.</li>
            <li> It arrived safely~</li>
            <li> If the price dropped, I&#x27;d snatch them up real quick.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.  </li>
            <li> These are ok.  </li>
            <li> These are perfect for trimming facial hair.  </li>
            <li> i love that it exfoliates my face.</li>
            <li> Okay for a stray hair or so.</li>
            <li> Takes off hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Ordered even more.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller and they have great quality products!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I told them the first razor worked beautifully and the second was not so great.  </li>
            <li> I saw that they were made of pretty good material; you don&#x27;t have to worry about these breaking or getting damaged under pressure.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, but I&#x27;m not planning to reorder.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> Keep you blades clean!</li>
            <li> These facial razors are great and very easy to use .</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic and I love the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, great product!!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair on my face and these tools make it easy to use and get rid of hair.  </li>
            <li> Really easy to use, takes 1 minute to remove hair.</li>
            <li> It worked well, but the blade dulled very quickly.</li>
            <li> The handle makes it easy to hold and control.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> How cool to be able to take off outer layers and reveal as it did for me a bit smoother skin.</li>
            <li> Of the many facial and eyebrow razors I have purchased, these Shiseido razors are the absolute best!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and leave me skin so smooth when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> When ordering these I didn&#x27;t realize that they were coming from another country, which is fine</li>
            <li> Perfect for face, bikini area, or anywhere you may need to easily eliminate a few hairs.</li>
            <li> These are great &amp; takes care of any unwanted facial hair!</li>
            <li> Took a while to get but well worth the price I love</li>
            <li> Make your skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li> It defoliates, use a soft soap and apply a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> Shiseido facial razors are amazing!  </li>
            <li> this is way better and much safer product!</li>
            <li> Depending on your skin, use it first thing in morning if you use good moisturizers at night, and that way your skin will still be soft and easy to apply the razor.</li>
            <li> I had never used one before but it was extremely easy to maneuver, it was just a matter of getting the angle of the blade right.</li>
            <li> These are really cute, and the packaging is superior to other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have upgraded this to a 4 star because they do a good clean job and the hair does not seem to grow back thicker.</li>
            <li> Very good, very sharp, get&#x27;s the job done!</li>
            <li> These are not really that great.</li>
            <li> Now that I know the product works, I&#x27;ll buy more packages since it&#x27;s very inexpensive</li>
            <li> and you really pay more in shipping</li>
            <li> The Feather Flamingo is good for 4-5 uses but only takes off the hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe that the hype of dermaplaning could be true, but it is.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you are very moisturized.  </li>
            <li> have never tried dermaplaning before but the learning curve is pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to gently shave the fine hairs off of the side of my face so that I have a smooth canvas to apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li> and they get the job done better than most regular razors.</li>
            <li> Good product, but long shipping time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut myself a couple of times, mostly on my chin, and let me tell you, stopping a minor cut on your face from bleeding seems to take forever. :-)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very sturdy, easy to grasp</li>
            <li> I have only tried these razors once and they seem to do a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> these are great for little areas and quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Works really well on those fine hairs all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Great product- dull quickly but very worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> These are great little razors for getting rid of peach fuzz on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Omg close shave and sooo soft!!!!!</li>
            <li> Its so smooth on the face and really gentle.</li>
            <li> But well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> These are very nifty for exfoliating all of the skin without rubbing!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying them since they&#x27;re gentler and work good for everyday exfoliating/ light hair removal!</li>
            <li> it makes my face look so soft and make up go on so smooth!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have the dermaplaning done professionally, my skin looks smoother and more radiant. ..</li>
            <li> I have used another brand of razor intended for eyebrow shaping, and these are far better.  </li>
            <li> Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The first razor was great and very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m not using them the right way are what</li>
            <li> and maybe i&#x27;m not using them the right way</li>
            <li> Also, the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; itself was just the right amount of sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just right for a women&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> the price was right on these aswell</li>
            <li> Far and above the best facial razor I have used.</li>
            <li> These are good for the price and very sharp.</li>
            <li> The razor also acts as an awesome exfoliant during the &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; process, as dead skin comes off while getting rid of baby/fuzzy facial hair.</li>
            <li> It was amazing to see the fine fuzz and probably dead skin that came off, leaving my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but, I find that they are somewhat duller than tinkle.&lt;br /&gt;Though these are very gentle for the face vs tinkle, they don&#x27;t quite get the hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They do an amazing job of getting rid of all of the tiny, fine facial hair...</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> do the job, removing fine facial hair and dry, scaly skin-a light touch is all that&#x27;s needed and be sure to keep the blade at an angle when using.</li>
            <li> This comes from experience;the first time I did this at home</li>
            <li> do find that they work better than tinkle to exfoliate skin, which is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using my first one</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come back darker or thicker, and your makeup looks so much better.</li>
            <li> A regular razor does a better job</li>
            <li> Able to use several times.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think its much better than waxing, that irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I have found that there are better facial razors for the price...</li>
            <li> Better than the drugstore brand that can be bought locally.  </li>
            <li> Never knew how much I needed these until I tried them!  </li>
            <li> They really wok!</li>
            <li> I love these facial razors.</li>
            <li> Pretty color.</li>
            <li> In addition to getting rid of my peach fuzz and helping to trim my &amp;#34;girl sideburns&amp;#34;, these removed a good amount of dead skin from my face.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> The first blade I pulled from the packet worked really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Usable on pretty much any part of the body</li>
            <li> They work great on my eyebrows and other unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> Get it done professionally and get true results.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, but do caution as they are sharp.  </li>
            <li> First time use may cut the skin, more so than a normal razor (I suggest going easy when using these things for the first time because it&#x27;s very easy to put too much pressure on the razor and end up cutting yourself)&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend these facial razors to anyone, just because they&#x27;re so easy to use</li>
            <li> An easy facial razor that really works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and will absolutely buy these again!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get much use out of it.  </li>
            <li> These are essentially straight razors.  </li>
            <li> however, I highly recommend them to all women!</li>
            <li> It makes it much easier.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of times to really get the hang of it, but</li>
            <li> What a waster of money, although it wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> If you like a straight edge razor you will like this but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to shape and control the shape of eyebrows with this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works better than expected</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> very good.ship from japan.made in</li>
            <li> It shaves very close, be mindful.</li>
            <li> product was just as expected :)</li>
            <li> They work really well.  </li>
            <li> The listing should really be updated.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a razor, more of a scraper type device.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews that were very favorable to this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality product , works as expected , I suggest watching videos on youtube use to learn their proper management , A must have it!</li>
            <li> Very useful tool for tidying up facial area.</li>
            <li> because I haven&#x27;t used them long enough to give an honest review.  </li>
            <li> I had no trouble using them even though it was my first time.  </li>
            <li> I was extra careful because I didn&#x27;t want to scratch or cut my skin, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Having to put down more words than I have makes me not want to review any products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to use it small areas by using the top portion of the blade only.</li>
            <li> A third use of this one is better than using a brand new Twink facial razor.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to get in smaller and more delicate areas of my face.</li>
            <li> they were so dull they just kind of scrape your skin.</li>
            <li> Just use on clean dry skin and follow with solmething soothing: toner or cream.</li>
            <li> These razors are the perfect length and width to get larger areas like your cheeks or forehead but still small enough to go between the brows and smaller areas.  </li>
            <li> okay for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last as long as razor guard but worked ok.  </li>
            <li> this product came in foreign  shiseido packaging, but worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a facial razor and these rock.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was long but well worth</li>
            <li> Should be easy to do brows with a little practice.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend ordering several packages at once so you have an adequate supply between orders, unless you wish to pay for expedited international shipping.</li>
            <li> These little razors do a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> Clean shave, no stubble left over for long periods of time</li>
            <li> I expected them to be light and flimsy but they&#x27;re actually is solid and have some weight to them.</li>
            <li> I guess I can use each of them for at least 3 and at most 6 times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These do make the skin soft and you&#x27;ll see the flakes you&#x27;ve removed on the blade.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this for interval use between professional sessions.</li>
            <li> Its also gentle enough to use as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Really recommend it for facial hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed that as time went on and I continued using them, the hair and stubble would not come back as fast, and would allow even up to a week of hairless skin.</li>
            <li> I was so happily surprised at the quality of these.</li>
            <li> Got myself my mom &amp; a mother figure in my life completely hooked</li>
            <li> so you needn&#x27;t worry about the handle snapping or flexing and causing unexpected injury.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a gentle way to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have had professional dermaplaning done</li>
            <li> so much better then the facial razors purchased in drug store the razor is much bigger and the handle longer worked extremely well</li>
            <li> Work well and last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> They are pretty rough</li>
            <li> This is the exact tool, however, you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> It takes away all your hair like magic and it doesn&#x27;t feel rough and hurt like other facial hair removers.</li>
            <li> am in my mid fifties and really recommend facial shaving.</li>
            <li> But either way my facial hair grows back fast</li>
            <li> The plastic handle, while appearing delicate and feminine, is unexpectedly strong</li>
            <li> not sharp at all, they could scrap your skin but not cut hair</li>
            <li> I like this Shiseido Facial Razor because it&#x27;s sharp enough that you can easily remove facial hair after swiping once or twice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark or thick hair, but really super fine thin blonde vellus hair, but I still can&#x27;t believe how much better</li>
            <li> The 3rd razor was even more dull than the 2nd</li>
            <li> Shiseido is the clear winner in facial razors---clearly a lot of thought went into designing this item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After having had facial planing done professionally, I decided ti try it at home.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can use these, although I can only do one pass on an area before my skin gets irritated.  </li>
            <li> Slight razor burn after first couple of uses</li>
            <li> It seems to work very well for other people.</li>
            <li> Sharp enough to work but not so much it&#x27;s a hazard or nicks me.</li>
            <li> It takes a very gentle stroke straight down, with very little angle, along your cheeks and chin.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth the price and each razor can be used 3-5 times before it gets dull.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these and the shipping time wasn&#x27;t nearly as long as expected.</li>
            <li> I do think the Shiseido blade is slightly sharper- reasonably priced but the Shiseido did take a long time to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even my 10 year old daughter uses them on her arms to get rid of embarrassing dark hair.</li>
            <li> Need to use it on a dry face and follow the directions in pictures on the package as the instructions are in Japanese.</li>
            <li> The slight curve in the handle, elevates your hand out of the way so that your grip on the device doesn&#x27;t interfere with the action of the blade.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, I use these guys every other day, and with excessive use, you&#x27;ll need to buy replacements pretty quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> I have had dermaplaning done by a professional esthitician on several occasions in the past</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see it remove any dead skin (as I am accustomed to seeing when I have it done professionally).</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t realize was that the item is shipped from Asia so shipping time was longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Razor&#x27;s not sharp enough and not easily manipulated on face.</li>
            <li> Haha.. but other than my lack of expertise, getting used to this will save time and money while getting rid of dead skin and fuzz!</li>
            <li> I got these when I read an article online about using razor blades to remove dry skin from your face.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of plucking out the whiskers on my chin and brows, and facial shaving is much cheaper than waxing and Dermaplaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the Gabriela a short handle that folds down.</li>
            <li> Very sharp for facial work</li>
            <li> First, there were no instructions included--everything was in Japanese, which, unfortunately, I cannot read, write, or speak.  </li>
            <li> The second one was dull like it had already been used several times.  </li>
            <li> it was with a heavy hand and it took several days for my skin to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Shiseido not only removes peach fuzz, but works like Dermaplaning, taking off a layer of (dead) skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as I expected it would.</li>
            <li> Even after spending the July 4 day out on the lake and using sunscreen, there is absolutely no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> not performing as well as expected</li>
            <li> I felt the blade was like a rough saw blade.</li>
            <li> Sharper than what I could get at Target, walmart, or any other grocery store.</li>
            <li> I also trust and use other Shiseido products so buying these was a no brainer.  </li>
            <li> The razor is extremely well designed and extremely well made.</li>
            <li> Sharp but does not hurt.</li>
            <li> Be careful when using them -- they are definitely sharp!</li>
            <li> I found this method of peach fuzz removal a little too rough on my face.  </li>
            <li> This product took over a month to receive (but I expected longer shipping time), a little longer than stated on the site.  </li>
            <li> Downside is that the shaver gets dull after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> However, it was very tough on my skin and didn&#x27;t seem to pick up much hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy here, just 3 sharp little scrapers.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp though and may cause a little razor burn.</li>
            <li> They are quite sharp so be careful!!!</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Getting into small areas is tricky because the blades on these are longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> These little beauties do the trick.</li>
            <li> I use it just to shave those unsightly little chin hairs I get</li>
            <li> Great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few of these type razors and have sliced the hooha out of myself before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i thought they were a waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a few repeated swipes, but so does my licensed aesthetician.</li>
            <li> waste your money or your time.</li>
            <li> I did wait a few weeks for shipment from Japan -</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks for mine to ship from overseas, but maybe Amazon stocks them now?</li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice and don&#x27;t freak out if you nick yourself a few times, it does take practice!</li>
            <li> The only thing bad I have to say about these are that it takes a long time to get to you...</li>
            <li> At times, not sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Then I use my usual moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for ordinary peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s what happened to me, I&#x27;m not sure if everyone&#x27;s skin and hair would act the same.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure of price differences so that may account for it.</li>
            <li> Product quality is about as expected but shipping took a CRAZY long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results with a dull disposable razor, very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Maybe another brand would be a bit less irritating?</li>
            <li> One of the razors was broken &amp; it came in a little padded envelope.</li>
            <li> Reusable (You can reuse these things like crazy, and the dullness kicks in about the 20th time)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not get the results I had expected.  </li>
            <li> No more &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; to interfere with my makeup, no more &#x27;whiskers&#x27; on my chinny chin chin!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are sturdy, NOT good for course</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; are dull and useless.</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking like a peach.</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending $50 per dermaplane treatment.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but bow a believer,</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are totally useless.</li>
            <li> These work well without cutting my skin or being too abrasive.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, very irritating to skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that when I bought them.  :(</li>
            <li> Hated these, these do not offer a close shave.</li>
            <li> seriously, terrible product</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!! Omg close shave and sooo soft!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these razors because of the good reviews, but they didn&#x27;t turn out to be as great as I thought.  The first razor was great and very sharp.  The second one was dull like it had already been used several times.  The company contacted me during use of the 2nd razor to ask for my feedback.  I told them the first razor worked beautifully and the second was not so great.  I never heard back.  The 3rd razor was even more dull than the 2nd and I didn&#x27;t get much use out of it.  I will not be purchasing these razors again.</li>
            <li> A beauty, youtube vlogger mentioned this item as it&#x27;s not sold in the US and I just tried it and love it!! Need to use it on a dry face and follow the directions in pictures on the package as the instructions are in Japanese. Now that I know the product works, I&#x27;ll buy more packages since it&#x27;s very inexpensive and you really pay more in shipping and it takes 3 weeks to arrive. Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase, and a great transaction.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> love these they&#x27;re great for shaping your brows or if you have peach fuzz on your cheeks</li>
            <li> These are essentially straight razors.  I didn&#x27;t realize that when I bought them.  :(</li>
            <li> I guess I can use each of them for at least 3 and at most 6 times. The result is great!</li>
            <li> Every girl needs one!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these and the Gabriela blades and they&#x27;re similar-the Shiseido have a longer handle and separate cover-the Gabriela a short handle that folds down. I do think the Shiseido blade is slightly sharper- reasonably priced but the Shiseido did take a long time to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having had facial planing done professionally, I decided ti try it at home. I read the reviews and the Shiseido blades were recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do the job, removing fine facial hair and dry, scaly skin-a light touch is all that&#x27;s needed and be sure to keep the blade at an angle when using. Overzealous use will result in abrasions &amp; cuts. This comes from experience;the first time I did this at home it was with a heavy hand and it took several days for my skin to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some redness may occur after use so it&#x27;s best to use a soothing, non-medicated, unscented, gentle cream or alternative afterwards. I use Algernist Overnight Restorative Cream which is similar in consistency to a plant based petroleum jelly alternative; it&#x27;s soothes and moisturizes without burning or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do make the skin soft and you&#x27;ll see the flakes you&#x27;ve removed on the blade. A pro treatment uses a regular surgical blade and I do think the at home results are similar. this is a treatment that can be safely done every two months or so.</li>
            <li> Great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few of these type razors and have sliced the hooha out of myself before.&lt;br /&gt;These are sturdy, NOT good for course hair, just whispy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like the thickness of the handles.</li>
            <li> Wow these are awesome!! Out of all the razors I have ever used, these are by far the best! They are quite sharp so be careful!!! I should&#x27;ve ordered 5!! And they take forever to arrive! But well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> These are really cute, and the packaging is superior to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;The overall product is sturdy and well made....but, I find that they are somewhat duller than tinkle.&lt;br /&gt;Though these are very gentle for the face vs tinkle, they don&#x27;t quite get the hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;I do find that they work better than tinkle to exfoliate skin, which is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have rosacea and my skin tends to &amp;#34;flake&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; often. These are very nifty for exfoliating all of the skin without rubbing!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying them since they&#x27;re gentler and work good for everyday exfoliating/ light hair removal!</li>
            <li> forget it.. used one time and it rusted</li>
            <li> It must be me because everybody else loved these things but they did nothing for me I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m not using them the right way are what but i couldn&#x27;t get them to remove any hair on my face I even ran them over my arm just to see if they would cut the hair and they did nothing they did not remove any hair they were so dull they just kind of scrape your skin. I want be buying them again but like i said they got good reviews and maybe i&#x27;m not using them the right way so you may want to try them but i thought they were a waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER be without this product!!! No more &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; to interfere with my makeup, no more &#x27;whiskers&#x27; on my chinny chin chin!! Every morning I take literally 45 seconds to rid my face of fuzzies!! I bought 3 pks this last time so i&#x27;d have one oh hand always!!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but bow a believer,</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for self dermaplaning</li>
            <li> I decided to start to shave my face because I&#x27;m acne prone. It helps by removing layers of skin with a mechanical exfoliation. Sharp enough to work but not so much it&#x27;s a hazard or nicks me. It makes it easy to get in smaller and more delicate areas of my face.</li>
            <li> Works about as well to remove hair as a dinner knife, that is, not at all.</li>
            <li> Convienient and handy</li>
            <li> Still getting the hang of it.  At times, not sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Great product and price. Great seller</li>
            <li> The only thing bad I have to say about these are that it takes a long time to get to you...however, I highly recommend them to all women! These are great &amp; takes care of any unwanted facial hair!</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy here, just 3 sharp little scrapers.  I found this method of peach fuzz removal a little too rough on my face.  Maybe another brand would be a bit less irritating?</li>
            <li> I like this item and just used it yesterday.  I recieved it in a pompt fashion.  I do wish the blades were smaller.  Getting into small areas is tricky because the blades on these are longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Sharper than what I could get at Target, walmart, or any other grocery store.</li>
            <li> It ships from Japan, so expect it to come a month later or so. Other than that, great product!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I appreciate the safety feature. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> excellent product and delivery! thank you!</li>
            <li> It seems to work very well for other people. However, it was very tough on my skin and didn&#x27;t seem to pick up much hair. (Really only got the longest ones.)  It&#x27;s probably a good product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> An easy facial razor that really works.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Especially after I worked out how to use it.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, but do caution as they are sharp.  Follow directions and plan on doing it once or twice a week.  After about 3 weeks your skin will look clearer and remember to Moisturizer!  Keep you blades clean!</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for. I have a mustache growing at the corners of my mouth. I tried a regular disposable razor and another that was battery operated. Neither worked at all. These do. I&#x27;m still using my first one but it&#x27;s reassuring to have two backups. I highly recommend these and the shipping time wasn&#x27;t nearly as long as expected.</li>
            <li> I am middle eastern and I can tell you I will never be without this again. It was delivered on time. I use it and them use retinol 2X a week. I swear my skin glows.</li>
            <li> I purchased the FT Shiseido and the Feather Flamingo shavers. The Shiseido not only removes peach fuzz, but works like Dermaplaning, taking off a layer of (dead) skin. Really a nice result! Downside is that the shaver gets dull after only a couple of uses. But at the price, it&#x27;s still a great deal. The Feather Flamingo is good for 4-5 uses but only takes off the hair.  So it depends on what you&#x27;re looking for. For peach fuzz, I need to shave every couple of weeks, so I alternate between the 2 shavers. I wouldn&#x27;t want to dermaplane myself every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my mid fifties and really recommend facial shaving. It doesn&#x27;t come back darker or thicker, and your makeup looks so much better. I got tired of plucking out the whiskers on my chin and brows, and facial shaving is much cheaper than waxing and Dermaplaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Thayers rose witch hazel with no alcohol after shaving. It soothes the skin and reduces irritation and I have fewer ingrown hairs. Then I use my usual moisturizer. I like to shave before bed so the skin gets a break before wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get but well worth the price I love it makes my face look so soft and make up go on so smooth!</li>
            <li> I like them.....sure took forever to receive them though.</li>
            <li> This was recommended for women to shave their face.  I have a lot of hair on my face and these tools make it easy to use and get rid of hair.  Great for exfoliation too.  Takes a while to get in but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I do regular dermaplaning sessions every four weeks. The first blade I pulled from the packet worked really well. Yes, it takes a few repeated swipes, but so does my licensed aesthetician. Would recommend this for interval use between professional sessions.</li>
            <li> A+++great item and love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would. I&#x27;m going to try another brand (Tinkle) next time.</li>
            <li> A regular razor does a better job</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive.  No directions in English so I tried once then never again.</li>
            <li> I love these razors! They are extremely sharp though and may cause a little razor burn.</li>
            <li> Shiseido facial razors are amazing!  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a facial razor and these rock.  They are easy to use and leave me skin so smooth when I&#x27;m done.  I had no trouble using them even though it was my first time.  They are the perfect size to easily maneuver around my lips, nose and brows.  Just bit of advice, pull your skin taut when using them.  It makes it much easier.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works as designed. Watch YouTube videos to get an idea of the technique for using this to &amp;#34;dry shave.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a myth that hair grows back darker and/or thicker, do don&#x27;t hesitate another minute - buy this awesome product now! The razor also acts as an awesome exfoliant during the &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; process, as dead skin comes off while getting rid of baby/fuzzy facial hair.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for ordinary peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Delivery and product as describedl</li>
            <li> I had been trying to save money by using tinkle brand .....this is way better and much safer product! I will be purchasing these again!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase experience</li>
            <li> I love them! Even my 10 year old daughter uses them on her arms to get rid of embarrassing dark hair.</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking like a peach. I wanted something to remove my &amp;#34;face-fuzz&amp;#34; without waxing or yanking on my skin. These little beauties do the trick. It takes a couple of times to really get the hang of it, but once you do...it&#x27;s so easy!! I was extra careful because I didn&#x27;t want to scratch or cut my skin, and so far so good. Makes it simple to keep the fuzz away.</li>
            <li> not sharp at all, they could scrap your skin but not cut hair will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> These facial razors are great and very easy to use . Able to use several times. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Everything as promised</li>
            <li> Very sharp. Best out there</li>
            <li> These are great little razors for getting rid of peach fuzz on your skin.  I have sensitive skin and can use these, although I can only do one pass on an area before my skin gets irritated.  Be careful when using them -- they are definitely sharp! I&#x27;ve cut myself a couple of times, mostly on my chin, and let me tell you, stopping a minor cut on your face from bleeding seems to take forever. :-)  I got these when I read an article online about using razor blades to remove dry skin from your face.  This type of razor was recommended.  They work great for that purpose.  In addition to getting rid of my peach fuzz and helping to trim my &amp;#34;girl sideburns&amp;#34;, these removed a good amount of dead skin from my face.</li>
            <li> Can not figure out how to work this?</li>
            <li> These are not really that great. I have had dermaplaning done by a professional esthitician on several occasions in the past but I purchased these to &amp;#34;hold me over&amp;#34; in the case that I wasn&#x27;t able to make it to my monthly appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are totally useless. I couldn&#x27;t see it remove any dead skin (as I am accustomed to seeing when I have it done professionally). My skin didn&#x27;t look any different than it did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have the dermaplaning done professionally, my skin looks smoother and more radiant. .. These &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; are dull and useless. The only difference I see in my skin is it looks drier after using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time. Get it done professionally and get true results.</li>
            <li> What a waster of money, although it wasn&#x27;t much. If you like a straight edge razor you will like this but seriously, terrible product</li>
            <li> these are great for little areas and quick touch-ups. Used to buy them at Target but after last December, i no longer shop there. Glad i found them on Amazon</li>
            <li> Amazing. Wish I ordered more.</li>
            <li> Very useful tool for tidying up facial area. No irritation. Just use on clean dry skin and follow with solmething soothing: toner or cream.</li>
            <li> When ordering these I didn&#x27;t realize that they were coming from another country, which is fine but it did take about three weeks to arrive. However they were a great deal and were exactly what I was looking for to start dermaplaning.  I highly recommend this seller and they have great quality products!&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried dermaplaning before but the learning curve is pretty easy.  These razors are the perfect length and width to get larger areas like your cheeks or forehead but still small enough to go between the brows and smaller areas.  I also trust and use other Shiseido products so buying these was a no brainer.  I highly recommend these and they seem to be a great deal price wise. :)</li>
            <li> These are miracle workers! I didn&#x27;t believe that the hype of dermaplaning could be true, but it is.  I did my entire face - I don&#x27;t have dark or thick hair, but really super fine thin blonde vellus hair, but I still can&#x27;t believe how much better my face feels now that I&#x27;ve used this product.  The price was fantastic and I love the way my skin feels.  So much peach fuzz and dead skin removed.  Didn&#x27;t knick myself even once!  Very easy to use.  Try a video tutorial online if you&#x27;re unsure.</li>
            <li> Product was just what I was looking for.  Does a good job.  Having to put down more words than I have makes me not want to review any products.</li>
            <li> okay for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with results.</li>
            <li> It more than met our expectation. It&#x27;s so much easier to shape and control the shape of eyebrows with this.</li>
            <li> All the way from Japan! It arrived safely~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results with a dull disposable razor, very disappointed.  Doesn&#x27;t shave as I expected it would.</li>
            <li> Its so smooth on the face and really gentle. It takes away all your hair like magic and it doesn&#x27;t feel rough and hurt like other facial hair removers. Its also gentle enough to use as an exfoliator. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Perfect razor! Really easy to use, takes 1 minute to remove hair. The hair does not grow back thicker or faster. Personally, I think its much better than waxing, that irritated my skin. Really recommend it for facial hair.</li>
            <li> Hated these, these do not offer a close shave.</li>
            <li> Razor&#x27;s not sharp enough and not easily manipulated on face.</li>
            <li> These razors were definitely a good buy, if I do say so. I saw that they were made of pretty good material; you don&#x27;t have to worry about these breaking or getting damaged under pressure. Also, the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; itself was just the right amount of sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now for the pros and cons...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very sturdy, easy to grasp&lt;br /&gt;- Reusable (You can reuse these things like crazy, and the dullness kicks in about the 20th time)&lt;br /&gt;- Clean shave, no stubble left over for long periods of time if done correctly&lt;br /&gt;- Usable on pretty much any part of the body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re like me, I use these guys every other day, and with excessive use, you&#x27;ll need to buy replacements pretty quickly&lt;br /&gt;- First time use may cut the skin, more so than a normal razor (I suggest going easy when using these things for the first time because it&#x27;s very easy to put too much pressure on the razor and end up cutting yourself)&lt;br /&gt;- Slight razor burn after first couple of uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these facial razors to anyone, just because they&#x27;re so easy to use and they get the job done better than most regular razors. I noticed that as time went on and I continued using them, the hair and stubble would not come back as fast, and would allow even up to a week of hairless skin. (That&#x27;s what happened to me, I&#x27;m not sure if everyone&#x27;s skin and hair would act the same.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only really big downside of these guys is the price... If the price dropped, I&#x27;d snatch them up real quick.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected</li>
            <li> I really like these. These are good for the price and very sharp. Work well and last a decent amount of time. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> First, there were no instructions included--everything was in Japanese, which, unfortunately, I cannot read, write, or speak.  I used it in a way that made sense to me--that is, essentially like a razor.  It worked well, but the blade dulled very quickly.</li>
            <li> I was so happily surprised at the quality of these. I expected them to be light and flimsy but they&#x27;re actually is solid and have some weight to them. I had never used one before but it was extremely easy to maneuver, it was just a matter of getting the angle of the blade right. It&#x27;s also easy to use it small areas by using the top portion of the blade only. This is a package of three. I highly recommend and will absolutely buy these again! Perfect for face, bikini area, or anywhere you may need to easily eliminate a few hairs.</li>
            <li> This item took about 6 weeks to arrive. One of the razors was broken &amp; it came in a little padded envelope. It works pretty good, but I&#x27;m not planning to reorder.</li>
            <li> I have found that there are better facial razors for the price... I felt like these razors left me with razor burn:(&lt;br /&gt;BUT customer service from this seller was AWESOME</li>
            <li> Very good, very sharp, get&#x27;s the job done!</li>
            <li> How cool to be able to take off outer layers and reveal as it did for me a bit smoother skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last as long as razor guard but worked ok.  Not sure of price differences so that may account for it.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp. Good blade length. Good price. I use these to &amp;#34;dermaplane&amp;#34; my face.</li>
            <li> These little razors do a fantastic job.  I received the package yesterday and promptly tried one out.  It takes a very gentle stroke straight down, with very little angle, along your cheeks and chin.  It was amazing to see the fine fuzz and probably dead skin that came off, leaving my skin soft and smooth.  I followed with a good moisturizer.  Even after spending the July 4 day out on the lake and using sunscreen, there is absolutely no irritation.  I have used another brand of razor intended for eyebrow shaping, and these are far better.  I did wait a few weeks for shipment from Japan - a good reason to order a lot at one time. v</li>
            <li> Item as described.  Arrived sooner than expected.  Pleased with purchase.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love these! Got myself my mom &amp; a mother figure in my life completely hooked</li>
            <li> Of the many facial and eyebrow razors I have purchased, these Shiseido razors are the absolute best! The razor is extremely well designed and extremely well made. The slight curve in the handle, elevates your hand out of the way so that your grip on the device doesn&#x27;t interfere with the action of the blade. The plastic handle, while appearing delicate and feminine, is unexpectedly strong so you needn&#x27;t worry about the handle snapping or flexing and causing unexpected injury.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t realize was that the item is shipped from Asia so shipping time was longer than expected. I would recommend ordering several packages at once so you have an adequate supply between orders, unless you wish to pay for expedited international shipping. I only ordered one package because I wanted to be assured of product quality. Shiseido is the clear winner in facial razors---clearly a lot of thought went into designing this item.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.  Bought this to gently shave the fine hairs off of the side of my face so that I have a smooth canvas to apply my makeup.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> I have only tried these razors once and they seem to do a pretty good job.  I did not give them a 5-star because I haven&#x27;t used them long enough to give an honest review.  I have upgraded this to a 4 star because they do a good clean job and the hair does not seem to grow back thicker.</li>
            <li> very good.ship from japan.made in jp.like it.</li>
            <li> They work quite well.  Better than the drugstore brand that can be bought locally.  Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Good quality product , works as expected , I suggest watching videos on youtube use to learn their proper management , A must have it!</li>
            <li> These are ok.  Product quality is about as expected but shipping took a CRAZY long time.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for trimming facial hair.  The razor edge is very fine and doesn&#x27;t nick the skin as some of the coarser razors do.</li>
            <li> I like this Shiseido Facial Razor because it&#x27;s sharp enough that you can easily remove facial hair after swiping once or twice. The handle makes it easy to hold and control. I use it mainly to tidy up my eyebrow area. This product is worth the price and each razor can be used 3-5 times before it gets dull.</li>
            <li> too quite a while to ship, but product quality is very good for dermaplaning</li>
            <li> I use it just to shave those unsightly little chin hairs I get and it works great for that.</li>
            <li> this product came in foreign  shiseido packaging, but worked just fine.  i love that it exfoliates my face.</li>
            <li> Never knew how much I needed these until I tried them!  They do an amazing job of getting rid of all of the tiny, fine facial hair...</li>
            <li> Work great even if we had to wait a while to get. They were still earlier then predicted</li>
            <li> Ouch!  Make sure you are very moisturized.  Okay for a stray hair or so. They are pretty rough so I will not use again.</li>
            <li> Far and above the best facial razor I have used. A third use of this one is better than using a brand new Twink facial razor. It took a few weeks for mine to ship from overseas, but maybe Amazon stocks them now?</li>
            <li> Takes off hair nice and smooth. But either way my facial hair grows back fast ):</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product, easy to use, and effective on face to get rid of unwanted hair. It shaves very close, be mindful. Depending on your skin, use it first thing in morning if you use good moisturizers at night, and that way your skin will still be soft and easy to apply the razor. It defoliates, use a soft soap and apply a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> Good product, but long shipping time.</li>
            <li> Just right for a women&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already thinking about ordering another set!  They really wok!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a gentle way to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> product was just as expected :)</li>
            <li> Loved these razors ... They work so well do what they are suppose to .. The shipping was long but well worth it coming from Japan😆 the price was right on these aswell</li>
            <li> not performing as well as expected</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Cleans the face very well, removing hair and dead skin.</li>
            <li> I love these facial razors. They work great on my eyebrows and other unwanted facial hair. I will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li> Very sharp for facial work</li>
            <li> Good quality. Perfect size. Sharp but does not hurt. Pretty color.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use. Great product- dull quickly but very worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> They work really well.  I haven&#x27;t tried them for eyebrow shaping yet, but I think they will work good for that too.</li>
            <li> Works really well on those fine hairs all over my face.  Easy to hold.  This product took over a month to receive (but I expected longer shipping time), a little longer than stated on the site.  The listing should really be updated.  Should be easy to do brows with a little practice.  Like product.</li>
            <li> These work well without cutting my skin or being too abrasive. I just wish they lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Works great. No irritation. Use for facial hair</li>
            <li> Great product! I was tired of spending $50 per dermaplane treatment. This is the exact tool, however, you have to be careful. Very sharp! I accidentally took a chunk of my eyebrow off! Haha.. but other than my lack of expertise, getting used to this will save time and money while getting rid of dead skin and fuzz! Shipping was about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> so much better then the facial razors purchased in drug store the razor is much bigger and the handle longer worked extremely well</li>
            <li> If you need this item you will find it very effective.</li>
            <li> Make your skin so smooth.  They are essentially what an esthetician uses when you get dermaplaning done.  It does take a little practice and don&#x27;t freak out if you nick yourself a few times, it does take practice!</li>
            <li> great product, would recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a razor, more of a scraper type device.</li>
            <li> I have had professional dermaplaning done &amp; I had hoped to get a product that would allow me to do it myself &amp; get the same results.  I had read reviews that were very favorable to this product. Unfortunately I did not get the results I had expected.  I felt the blade was like a rough saw blade.</li>
            <li> best ones I have ever used! Ordered even more.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, very irritating to skin.</li>
