    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a sonicare user for years and think this one is the best ever.</li>
            <li>If Sonicare would increase the size of the toothpaste packets, or reduce the price of the toothpaste, I would consider this a perfect toothbrush.   </li>
            <li>As the title indicates, it&#x27;s the best product I ever experimented to brush teeths.</li>
            <li>returned mine to my dentist and got Oral B instead and very impressed with it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It has turned out to be wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>Very good result.</li>
            <li>Great item, very happy</li>
            <li>The Quadpace system I find to be a great help in creating consistancy when brushing.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, my teeth and gums feel great after using this.</li>
            <li>This is one of those great ideas that just didn&#x27;t work out.  </li>
            <li>What a treat to own!  </li>
            <li>the latest and greatest Sonicare had to offer.  </li>
            <li>Still the best toothbrush around - glad</li>
            <li>I agree with everyone here that their toothbrushes do a superior job in oral hygiene</li>
            <li>I give them credit for good customer service for sending me replacement.</li>
            <li>I have LOVED this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Seems like a very nice feature for travel, kind of all-in one conception.</li>
            <li>but I find the whitening toothpaste to be effective and pleasant tasting.</li>
            <li>and I want to say I am very very satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased with our two years use of them.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and will never use anything else again!</li>
            <li>Gates with all his 5 billion dollars can&#x27;t buy something better for his teeths!</li>
            <li>I spend more time cleaning my toothbrush than I do brushing my teeth!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also fantastic tastefull (very good tastes, can&#x27;t wait for more options).</li>
            <li>Honestly, I thought Sonicare was just an overpriced electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I find they are especially good for those who don&#x27;t like to floss very often.  </li>
            <li>I even bought the kids their own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, and still going strong, but I decided to upgrade to the latest and greatest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, you can use up the toothpaste fairly quickly, but it seems to work best with that special toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Once you try it you won&#x27;t be satisfied with the own fashioned toothbrush</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, I should say that if you clean the inside of the brush every day, maybe you will not have a mold problem.  </li>
            <li>Trust me, you&#x27;re better off.</li>
            <li>Since there is an elaborate design to deliver the toothpaste to the brush head, there are many crevices in which water can remain after use.</li>
            <li>The performance is phenomenal, leaving my teeth feeling cleaner and smoother than any manual toothbrush ever had.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I was hoping my kids would brush better.  </li>
            <li>but I am so pleased with my IntelliClean i8500 that I felt I should.  </li>
            <li>My dentist has also complimented on how healthy my teeth are.</li>
            <li>But when I have more time like at home, it&#x27;s most efficient to use toothpaste from a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one, it gives more options than Crest.</li>
            <li>These days better battery technologies are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I taught it would not be more than4or5 days.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT IS THE ULTIMATE, BEST EVER TOOTHBRUSH SYSTEM.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>the toothpaste issue, I am pleased with this toothbrush and plan to buy another for my husband to use when he travels.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Rotation-oscillation toothbrushes, like the  &lt;br /&gt;ProfessionalCare 7000, reduce plaque and  &lt;br /&gt;gingivitis by between 7% and 17% more  &lt;br /&gt;than manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;sonic,\\&quot; proved to be any better  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;toothbrushing is just as safe as manual  </li>
            <li>Most stores have discontinued selling the heads and the toothpaste for this brush.</li>
            <li>I decided after this visit to the dentist that I was going to take better care of my teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that I may even be able to avoid the rooting and scaling procedure.  </li>
            <li>I will know in a couple of weeks as to whether it has alleviated the need for the rooting and scaling procedure.</li>
            <li>My biggest problem with this toothbrush is that the insides get filled with gunk so easily!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>now is the most important question.</li>
            <li>It turns out that there is a study on the National Institute of Health web site proving that the Sonicare brush really does improves dental hygiene and that it is superior to its leading competitor.  </li>
            <li>(I use the cool mint intelliclean + whitening catridge), but more important, my gums are in MUCH better condition than they were.  </li>
            <li>Better than the original.</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling I have afterward.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have to brush many times in order to feel clean.</li>
            <li>Setting it up was easy, charging it up was even easier, and using it...</li>
            <li>The brush is not as strong as my Oral B one.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>it is a HUGE help.  </li>
            <li>My friend has been using a Sonicare Elite for years now and constantly tells me what a great job it does on his teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Listen, just buy better Oral B product which are superior and smaller.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my new Sonicare Crest i8500 power toothbrush&#x27;s self contained toothpaste refill capability.</li>
            <li>*I* need to brush (I smoke cigars and drink Cuban coffee, two things not generally conducive to a brilliant smile)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure one of the tabs is going to break off one day and that&#x27;ll be the end of that.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush may seem pricy to some people, but believe my it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I have been using the original Sonicare toothbrush for years.</li>
            <li>My husband is one and it has made significant improvements in his oral health.  </li>
            <li>, I did not notice any significant improvement since I started using this thing, and my dentist did&#x27;nt either.  </li>
            <li>Reputable 3rd party Cochrane study state that Oral B&#x27;s rotating brush are better!</li>
            <li>Seeing them for significantly cheaper here than anywhere else, I decided to get one.  </li>
            <li>have no complaints about the ability of the brush to clean teeth</li>
            <li>My mouth has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>It meets my expectations - nothing special.</li>
            <li>The integrated toothpaste is good, but I recommend using your regular toothpaste as well</li>
            <li>the full on-line report, visit  &lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m as happy with this as I was with the old one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be lucky to get a week out of each one.  </li>
            <li>Battery will last many many uses before needing to be placed on the charger again.</li>
            <li>This is another advantage that I&#x27;ve noticed is that I&#x27;m more compliant with brushing my teeth and doing a decent effort every time (with my manual toothbrush, I knwo there were days when I do the sprint brushing).</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to apply fresh toothpaste half-way through brushing, w/o having to pick up a tube and do it manually, but other than that</li>
            <li>And no matter how hard you scrub, no matter what kind of fancy-schmancy toothpaste you use, you never seem to get any kind of reward commensurate with that effort.  </li>
            <li>Nothing short of absolutely amazing results....  </li>
            <li>Then, I finally did some research of my own.  </li>
            <li>In addition, as the handle has to be removed to change the toothpaste cartridges quite frequently, they could have made the mechanism for opening and closing it a lot more sturdy than it is.</li>
            <li>This was worth the price paid.  </li>
            <li>Its performance is not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>I rarely write a review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun and practic</li>
            <li>Ain&#x27;t nothing fun about going to use your toothbrush</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth that feeling.</li>
            <li>, this toothbrush is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I know from using Red-Cote tablets that I&#x27;m getting rid of more plaque along the gumline - a significant amount more than I brushed off with a manual brush or even my old spin-pro.  </li>
            <li>Another bonus: the intelliclean is gentle on your gums (mine are very sensitive and it hasn&#x27;t hurt at all) and makes it so much easier to brush (it&#x27;s even kind of fun now).  </li>
            <li>I have fun and pleasure for first time in my life.</li>
            <li>I have been able to get a reasonable amount of use out of one pouch so far, so</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, the dentist reported NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF PLAQUE.  </li>
            <li>The first generation suffered from premature battery failures (replaced by the company twice at no charge).</li>
            <li>I got it when it first came out, so I didn&#x27;t have the luxury of looking at the reviews.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone and after seeing my results, so would my dentist. :-)</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is doing exactly what I purchased it for, cleaning my teeth, improving the health of my gums, and preventing me from requiring gum surgery.  </li>
            <li>next because studies I&#x27;ve read says that the oscillating motion of Oral-B removes plaque better that a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Intelliclean i8500 is a real winner!</li>
            <li>This is the first Sonic Powered Toothbrush I have invested in</li>
            <li>/&gt;The original Sonicare toothbrush felt like a fairly well sealed and tight unit, this new one has large gaps and a feeling that it is about to come apart in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I used the sample whitening toothpaste that came with the initial package and even after using that for just a week, I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are much whiter and so have many others.</li>
            <li>have realized that I have to open the toothbrush up and squeeze the toothpaste toward the center and top of the pouch for it to dispense more onto the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my teeth incredibly clean between dental visits, travels well and the whitening toothpaste is the first I have tried that I feel actually works.  </li>
            <li>It really does make your teeth and gums feel so much cleaner and healthier.  </li>
            <li>, I noticed that I was hitting the toothpaste dispenser a bit too often and using up toothpaste really fast.  </li>
            <li>You can smell it after a while and no matter how much cleaning you do, it doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, having built-in toothpaste is a real benefit.</li>
            <li>I really like how my mouth feels after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>After trying the i8500 myself I must say that it works very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how much I like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Why pay so much?  </li>
            <li>It really cleans your teeth well.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>but after years of not going to the dentist (thanks to a lack of a dental plan while in grad school)</li>
            <li>The longer bristles at the ends clean spaces between the teeth, and elongated shape allow brushing hard to reach places better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to *easily* reach my back teeth and navigate along the inside of my teeth &amp; gums without a mess.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush bristles seem gentle enough to clean along the gum line without causing any harm to my gums.  </li>
            <li>Now I go every 6 months like most other people.  </li>
            <li>You have to constantly keep opening it up to clean it.</li>
            <li>again this is not a knock on the method in which SonicCare as a whole makes their brushes, just this particular model.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a waste of time trying to push the button until it all comes out, it&#x27;s easier just putting your own paste on the brush like normally.</li>
            <li>Also, the color scheme looks less elegant than the pure ivory.</li>
            <li>So if your product is unreliable then call to complain and demand a brand new replacment!  </li>
            <li>faster for her, slower for me (the older models came with a metal ring that could be dropped into the chamber before the brush was attached.</li>
            <li>I would suggest the older version, or maybe even the newer version.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;An independent research group The Cochrane Collaboration, recently completed the most comprehensive review of power toothbrush  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the IntelliClean.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>This product was highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>instance, that feature&#x27;s great when I&#x27;m at work and want to brush quickly - no tubes/no mess.</li>
            <li>I have to clean it off and dry it out before storing it on the charger.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush only a week or two ago, but so far overall, I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sonicare is well worth the extra money if you are concerned about oral health as you age</li>
            <li>Because unlike many other gadgets on the market, this one has real value attached to it, enough to make me forget about the planned consumables associated with the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>it vibrates all that junk out of your teeth, helped by a new formula of Crest toothpaste which is the equivalent of Agent Orange for home dental care.  </li>
            <li>I decided I rather spend the money to buy a new power brush than keep using this thing.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been Cybersonic users for a number of years but after seeing the new IntelliClean closer to Flossing toothbrush</li>
            <li>Not only that the replacement brushes are much cheaper than Sonicare!  </li>
            <li>First of all, the liquid toothpaste that comes with this doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans as well as traditional \\&quot;paste.\\</li>
            <li>And I like it so much that I sat down to pen this, my very first Amazon review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t particularly care for with the i8500 is the toothpaste pouches, which is one of the main reasons I upgraded.   </li>
            <li>The toothbrush turns off 2 minutes after turned on, as a part of the designers idea on how to help the public brush for a certain period of time.  </li>
            <li>I am certain that once you use a Sonicare, you will refuse to use a regular analog toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Our Intelliclean is just sitting there unused right now because I&#x27;m not willing to buy more brush heads so that I can use it because I use Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste--this toothbrush is not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Sonicare claims the i8500 IntelliClean System even cleans below the surface of the gum line with it&#x27;s ultrasonic cleaning action of 32,000 brush strokes per minute.   </li>
            <li>You just touch softly your teeth, the velocity creates micro drops that goes everywhere in your month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now always self conscious that this is what my mouth smells like.</li>
            <li>No messy tooth paste in the sink and on the counter.</li>
            <li>I bought this thing a few months ago, it&#x27;s fine, nothing special, and a little overpriced.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going back to the older model that I had before it.</li>
            <li>This is the only model I have ever tried, so I don&#x27;t know if the older models leak inside or not.</li>
            <li>so I would just recommend that you get the simple older models.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li>However, I would highly reccomend only using the Crest toothpaste inside the toothbrush when you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, sure, it might look a little daunting, especially if your only recollection of a powered toothbrush is that hair-curler-sized one that hit the market twenty years ago.  </li>
            <li>I never used to think about how long I brushed and this ensures I get a full 2 minutes of brushing with a beep to remind me to move to the next quadrant.  </li>
            <li>His dentist recommended a Sonicare for his gums, but we were not really expecting how much whiter his teeth have become in just three weeks!  </li>
            <li>I found out that I needed some major cleaning of my teeth.</li>
            <li>well, to quote the old commercial, it was like there was a party in my mouth and everyone was invited.  </li>
            <li>If you are going on a prolonged trip though, be aware, that the charger is not very compact, and it only supports 110-120 Volts, you would need a transformer to use it with 220-240 Volt outlets.</li>
            <li>In addition, my gums are looking much healthier going from the diseased redness to the healthy pinkness that they are suppose to be.</li>
            <li>the way, I was concerned (and curious) about how many days the small and tiny toothpaste would last.</li>
            <li>In addition, the 2.5 minute interval my toothbrush is set on (you can either set it for 2 or 2.5 minutes) doesn&#x27;t seem entirely long enough, so I brush twice as long as night before bed and therefore use twice as much toothpaste then.</li>
            <li>Of course, stain removal was occurring even with the regular toothpaste, but I noticed a more dramatic result when I used the whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ts fast; The eletronic (\\&quot;ionic\\&quot;) I already had on my previous sonycare (thousands of toothbrushes per second); I see people doing FORCE to brush and Sonicare</li>
            <li>We were a little reluctant about spending so much money on a toothbrush.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also fantastic tastefull (very good tastes, can&#x27;t wait for more options).</li>
            <li> Honestly, I thought Sonicare was just an overpriced electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I find they are especially good for those who don&#x27;t like to floss very often.  </li>
            <li> I even bought the kids their own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, and still going strong, but I decided to upgrade to the latest and greatest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, you can use up the toothpaste fairly quickly, but it seems to work best with that special toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Once you try it you won&#x27;t be satisfied with the own fashioned toothbrush</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, I should say that if you clean the inside of the brush every day, maybe you will not have a mold problem.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, you&#x27;re better off.</li>
            <li> Since there is an elaborate design to deliver the toothpaste to the brush head, there are many crevices in which water can remain after use.</li>
            <li> The performance is phenomenal, leaving my teeth feeling cleaner and smoother than any manual toothbrush ever had.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I was hoping my kids would brush better.  </li>
            <li> but I am so pleased with my IntelliClean i8500 that I felt I should.  </li>
            <li> My dentist has also complimented on how healthy my teeth are.</li>
            <li> But when I have more time like at home, it&#x27;s most efficient to use toothpaste from a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one, it gives more options than Crest.</li>
            <li> These days better battery technologies are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I taught it would not be more than4or5 days.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS THE ULTIMATE, BEST EVER TOOTHBRUSH SYSTEM.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> the toothpaste issue, I am pleased with this toothbrush and plan to buy another for my husband to use when he travels.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Rotation-oscillation toothbrushes, like the  &lt;br /&gt;ProfessionalCare 7000, reduce plaque and  &lt;br /&gt;gingivitis by between 7% and 17% more  &lt;br /&gt;than manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;sonic,\\&quot; proved to be any better  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;toothbrushing is just as safe as manual  </li>
            <li> Most stores have discontinued selling the heads and the toothpaste for this brush.</li>
            <li> I decided after this visit to the dentist that I was going to take better care of my teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that I may even be able to avoid the rooting and scaling procedure.  </li>
            <li> I will know in a couple of weeks as to whether it has alleviated the need for the rooting and scaling procedure.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with this toothbrush is that the insides get filled with gunk so easily!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> now is the most important question.</li>
            <li> It turns out that there is a study on the National Institute of Health web site proving that the Sonicare brush really does improves dental hygiene and that it is superior to its leading competitor.  </li>
            <li> (I use the cool mint intelliclean + whitening catridge), but more important, my gums are in MUCH better condition than they were.  </li>
            <li> Better than the original.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling I have afterward.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have to brush many times in order to feel clean.</li>
            <li> Setting it up was easy, charging it up was even easier, and using it...</li>
            <li> The brush is not as strong as my Oral B one.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li> it is a HUGE help.  </li>
            <li> My friend has been using a Sonicare Elite for years now and constantly tells me what a great job it does on his teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Listen, just buy better Oral B product which are superior and smaller.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my new Sonicare Crest i8500 power toothbrush&#x27;s self contained toothpaste refill capability.</li>
            <li> *I* need to brush (I smoke cigars and drink Cuban coffee, two things not generally conducive to a brilliant smile)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure one of the tabs is going to break off one day and that&#x27;ll be the end of that.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush may seem pricy to some people, but believe my it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the original Sonicare toothbrush for years.</li>
            <li> My husband is one and it has made significant improvements in his oral health.  </li>
            <li> , I did not notice any significant improvement since I started using this thing, and my dentist did&#x27;nt either.  </li>
            <li> Reputable 3rd party Cochrane study state that Oral B&#x27;s rotating brush are better!</li>
            <li> Seeing them for significantly cheaper here than anywhere else, I decided to get one.  </li>
            <li> have no complaints about the ability of the brush to clean teeth</li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> It meets my expectations - nothing special.</li>
            <li> The integrated toothpaste is good, but I recommend using your regular toothpaste as well</li>
            <li> the full on-line report, visit  &lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m as happy with this as I was with the old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be lucky to get a week out of each one.  </li>
            <li> Battery will last many many uses before needing to be placed on the charger again.</li>
            <li> This is another advantage that I&#x27;ve noticed is that I&#x27;m more compliant with brushing my teeth and doing a decent effort every time (with my manual toothbrush, I knwo there were days when I do the sprint brushing).</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to apply fresh toothpaste half-way through brushing, w/o having to pick up a tube and do it manually, but other than that</li>
            <li> And no matter how hard you scrub, no matter what kind of fancy-schmancy toothpaste you use, you never seem to get any kind of reward commensurate with that effort.  </li>
            <li> Nothing short of absolutely amazing results....  </li>
            <li> Then, I finally did some research of my own.  </li>
            <li> In addition, as the handle has to be removed to change the toothpaste cartridges quite frequently, they could have made the mechanism for opening and closing it a lot more sturdy than it is.</li>
            <li> This was worth the price paid.  </li>
            <li> Its performance is not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> I rarely write a review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun and practic</li>
            <li> Ain&#x27;t nothing fun about going to use your toothbrush</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth that feeling.</li>
            <li> , this toothbrush is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I know from using Red-Cote tablets that I&#x27;m getting rid of more plaque along the gumline - a significant amount more than I brushed off with a manual brush or even my old spin-pro.  </li>
            <li> Another bonus: the intelliclean is gentle on your gums (mine are very sensitive and it hasn&#x27;t hurt at all) and makes it so much easier to brush (it&#x27;s even kind of fun now).  </li>
            <li> I have fun and pleasure for first time in my life.</li>
            <li> I have been able to get a reasonable amount of use out of one pouch so far, so</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, the dentist reported NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF PLAQUE.  </li>
            <li> The first generation suffered from premature battery failures (replaced by the company twice at no charge).</li>
            <li> I got it when it first came out, so I didn&#x27;t have the luxury of looking at the reviews.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone and after seeing my results, so would my dentist. :-)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is doing exactly what I purchased it for, cleaning my teeth, improving the health of my gums, and preventing me from requiring gum surgery.  </li>
            <li> next because studies I&#x27;ve read says that the oscillating motion of Oral-B removes plaque better that a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Intelliclean i8500 is a real winner!</li>
            <li> This is the first Sonic Powered Toothbrush I have invested in</li>
            <li> /&gt;The original Sonicare toothbrush felt like a fairly well sealed and tight unit, this new one has large gaps and a feeling that it is about to come apart in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I used the sample whitening toothpaste that came with the initial package and even after using that for just a week, I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are much whiter and so have many others.</li>
            <li> have realized that I have to open the toothbrush up and squeeze the toothpaste toward the center and top of the pouch for it to dispense more onto the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my teeth incredibly clean between dental visits, travels well and the whitening toothpaste is the first I have tried that I feel actually works.  </li>
            <li> It really does make your teeth and gums feel so much cleaner and healthier.  </li>
            <li> , I noticed that I was hitting the toothpaste dispenser a bit too often and using up toothpaste really fast.  </li>
            <li> You can smell it after a while and no matter how much cleaning you do, it doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, having built-in toothpaste is a real benefit.</li>
            <li> I really like how my mouth feels after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After trying the i8500 myself I must say that it works very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much I like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Why pay so much?  </li>
            <li> It really cleans your teeth well.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> but after years of not going to the dentist (thanks to a lack of a dental plan while in grad school)</li>
            <li> The longer bristles at the ends clean spaces between the teeth, and elongated shape allow brushing hard to reach places better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to *easily* reach my back teeth and navigate along the inside of my teeth &amp; gums without a mess.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush bristles seem gentle enough to clean along the gum line without causing any harm to my gums.  </li>
            <li> Now I go every 6 months like most other people.  </li>
            <li> You have to constantly keep opening it up to clean it.</li>
            <li> again this is not a knock on the method in which SonicCare as a whole makes their brushes, just this particular model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a waste of time trying to push the button until it all comes out, it&#x27;s easier just putting your own paste on the brush like normally.</li>
            <li> Also, the color scheme looks less elegant than the pure ivory.</li>
            <li> So if your product is unreliable then call to complain and demand a brand new replacment!  </li>
            <li> faster for her, slower for me (the older models came with a metal ring that could be dropped into the chamber before the brush was attached.</li>
            <li> I would suggest the older version, or maybe even the newer version.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;An independent research group The Cochrane Collaboration, recently completed the most comprehensive review of power toothbrush  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the IntelliClean.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> instance, that feature&#x27;s great when I&#x27;m at work and want to brush quickly - no tubes/no mess.</li>
            <li> I have to clean it off and dry it out before storing it on the charger.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush only a week or two ago, but so far overall, I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sonicare is well worth the extra money if you are concerned about oral health as you age</li>
            <li> Because unlike many other gadgets on the market, this one has real value attached to it, enough to make me forget about the planned consumables associated with the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> it vibrates all that junk out of your teeth, helped by a new formula of Crest toothpaste which is the equivalent of Agent Orange for home dental care.  </li>
            <li> I decided I rather spend the money to buy a new power brush than keep using this thing.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been Cybersonic users for a number of years but after seeing the new IntelliClean closer to Flossing toothbrush</li>
            <li> Not only that the replacement brushes are much cheaper than Sonicare!  </li>
            <li> First of all, the liquid toothpaste that comes with this doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans as well as traditional \\&quot;paste.\\</li>
            <li> And I like it so much that I sat down to pen this, my very first Amazon review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t particularly care for with the i8500 is the toothpaste pouches, which is one of the main reasons I upgraded.   </li>
            <li> The toothbrush turns off 2 minutes after turned on, as a part of the designers idea on how to help the public brush for a certain period of time.  </li>
            <li> I am certain that once you use a Sonicare, you will refuse to use a regular analog toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Our Intelliclean is just sitting there unused right now because I&#x27;m not willing to buy more brush heads so that I can use it because I use Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste--this toothbrush is not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Sonicare claims the i8500 IntelliClean System even cleans below the surface of the gum line with it&#x27;s ultrasonic cleaning action of 32,000 brush strokes per minute.   </li>
            <li> You just touch softly your teeth, the velocity creates micro drops that goes everywhere in your month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now always self conscious that this is what my mouth smells like.</li>
            <li> No messy tooth paste in the sink and on the counter.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing a few months ago, it&#x27;s fine, nothing special, and a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going back to the older model that I had before it.</li>
            <li> This is the only model I have ever tried, so I don&#x27;t know if the older models leak inside or not.</li>
            <li> so I would just recommend that you get the simple older models.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> However, I would highly reccomend only using the Crest toothpaste inside the toothbrush when you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , sure, it might look a little daunting, especially if your only recollection of a powered toothbrush is that hair-curler-sized one that hit the market twenty years ago.  </li>
            <li> I never used to think about how long I brushed and this ensures I get a full 2 minutes of brushing with a beep to remind me to move to the next quadrant.  </li>
            <li> His dentist recommended a Sonicare for his gums, but we were not really expecting how much whiter his teeth have become in just three weeks!  </li>
            <li> I found out that I needed some major cleaning of my teeth.</li>
            <li> well, to quote the old commercial, it was like there was a party in my mouth and everyone was invited.  </li>
            <li> If you are going on a prolonged trip though, be aware, that the charger is not very compact, and it only supports 110-120 Volts, you would need a transformer to use it with 220-240 Volt outlets.</li>
            <li> In addition, my gums are looking much healthier going from the diseased redness to the healthy pinkness that they are suppose to be.</li>
            <li> the way, I was concerned (and curious) about how many days the small and tiny toothpaste would last.</li>
            <li> In addition, the 2.5 minute interval my toothbrush is set on (you can either set it for 2 or 2.5 minutes) doesn&#x27;t seem entirely long enough, so I brush twice as long as night before bed and therefore use twice as much toothpaste then.</li>
            <li> Of course, stain removal was occurring even with the regular toothpaste, but I noticed a more dramatic result when I used the whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ts fast; The eletronic (\\&quot;ionic\\&quot;) I already had on my previous sonycare (thousands of toothbrushes per second); I see people doing FORCE to brush and Sonicare</li>
            <li> We were a little reluctant about spending so much money on a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is the drawback of the expensive toothpaste and the unique smell that develops, but the gains far outweigh the losses for me.</li>
            <li> We are handing them down to our daughters (with new heads of course).  </li>
            <li> Also, you won&#x27;t go through $8 6-pack refills in no time flat if you brush several times/day like I do.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste packet is so small that you spend just as much time changing packets every week or two as you would simply applying toothpaste to the brush</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll see how long they last.   </li>
            <li> It looks like Sonicare has discovered the cell phone companies&#x27; secret of financial success: lock in the customer and keep selling him stuff.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Lastly, as other reviewers have noted, the toothpaste cartridges don&#x27;t last too long (we used 3 on a recent 2 week vacation)</li>
            <li> Overall a great product, it is a little difficult if 2 people are using this product, to remove one brush and put another brush on is a little redundant.</li>
            <li> (Both the 8300 and 8500 have the quadpacer; the one on the 8500 can be set to values other than 4 thirty second intervals.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist told me a couple months ago that I have gingivitis and that I would have to be extremely diligent with my oral hygiene or it could progress further.</li>
            <li> I do use a mouth rinse, so that smell doesn&#x27;t linger very long</li>
            <li> I have a few spots of periodontitis and after a few week this is really helping.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the toothpaste packets only last 10 to 14 days, and they cost about $8 for a three-pack.  </li>
            <li> In an effort to have healthier teeth, I have been brushing on average 3 times daily.</li>
            <li> Even if I still need the procedure, I do believe this toothbrush will prevent me from having any further problems with my gums and teeth down the road</li>
            <li> And yes, I&#x27;ve even noticed that my teeth are slightly whiter after only a  week&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> I am not that lazy, I can take an extra second to put the toothpaste on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It would regularly hurt in those areas and now it MUCH less.</li>
            <li> Your choices of toothpaste are very limited.</li>
            <li> sometimes and only brush a little</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a month, but I can say that after each brushing my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> If you have a few extra coins hanging around and don&#x27;t mind the price, get this!  </li>
            <li> The intelligence behind this toothbrush is really just the vibrating bristles...</li>
            <li> other form of power toothbrushes,  </li>
            <li> The mildewy residue will get stuck in all the small tiny crevices inside...</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to keep the brush clean.</li>
            <li> , they are pretty expensive and not readily available.</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have is with regards to the cleaning of this.  </li>
            <li> but hopefully that will come down if the system catches on.  </li>
            <li> And six months down the road you&#x27;re sitting in a dentist&#x27;s chair listening to yet another lecture about how you should be brushing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;d suggest the previous model.</li>
            <li> Instead of taking an hour at the dentist for cleaning, it takes less than half that time.  </li>
            <li> Disclaimer - I consider myself a typical guy.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste is expensive, but when I am low I just put on some regular toothpaste</li>
            <li> I owned older model and it died within 2 years or just shy of 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save a little up front and a lot down the road.</li>
            <li> This causes toothpaste to seep out of the packet and make a mess inside the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> (it goes a little faster than advertised.</li>
            <li> Because the water and any residual toothpaste caught in the little crevices on this thing will start to stink in about a day.  </li>
            <li> A product feature needed is missing.  </li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral B brush for a few years now and thought it was time to upgrade.</li>
            <li> It is really just like regular gel toothpaste, but it comes up through the neck of the brush to the base of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> If you do not disassemble the toothbrush and run scalding hot water over its interior after EVERY use then let is dry before reassembling it begins to mildew and smell very bad.  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly small mouth</li>

            <li> never liked brushing my teeths.</li>
            <li> Sonicare lets me down!!!</li>
            <li> do agree with the other reviewers that the toothpaste is a bit expensive</li>
            <li> The big problem with it (and the reason I no longer use it) is that mold and other disgusting stuff grows on the inside compartment that holds the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Why contend with hard to find and expensive toothpaste?</li>
            <li> better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, citizens, I got tired of it.  </li>
            <li> and it can pay off in decreased dental cleanings and repair.</li>
            <li> &quot; The refills are very expensive and the toothbrush dispenser system never lets you use it all, almost half of it stays stuck inside the refill cartridge because it can&#x27;t all get sucked up the tubing in the head.</li>
            <li> I will admit that since I got this toothbrush I have started to floss, but I doubt I would see this dramatic of a result without the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Friends, the cost of this bad boy is a little up there.  </li>
            <li> I thought they would like having the toothpaste in the handle, but they don&#x27;t like either of the flavors of toothpaste and the toothpaste is expensive anyway.  </li>
            <li> Also, this toothbrush uses Nickel Cadmium batteries; which for the year 2005 is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a procedure called rooting and scaling where they go in an numb half your mouth, scrape the crap out of your roots and rinse the pockets around your teeth with antibiotic.</li>
            <li> A complaint on this feature was sent to the manufacturer and ignored, also annoying.  </li>
            <li> It turns yellowish green and STINKS BAD!!</li>
            <li> This feature is not deselectable and is annoying to someone who brushes for longer than 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> So, I hate the dentist</li>
            <li> and I hate flossing,</li>
            <li> I am very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s boring, just standing there in the bathroom staring at yourself in the mirror as you manually scrub plaque off your teeth.  </li>
            <li> That can be very disgusting.</li>

            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. I would recommend this awsome toothbrush to everyone!!</li>
            <li> What a treat to own!  If you have a few extra coins hanging around and don&#x27;t mind the price, get this!  What a treat</li>
            <li> Great item, very happy</li>
            <li> My friend has been using a Sonicare Elite for years now and constantly tells me what a great job it does on his teeth.  Honestly, I thought Sonicare was just an overpriced electric tooth brush.  Then, I finally did some research of my own.  It turns out that there is a study on the National Institute of Health web site proving that the Sonicare brush really does improves dental hygiene and that it is superior to its leading competitor.  That plus a gift card finally spurred me into ordering and trying out the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful that I ordered this!  It really does make your teeth and gums feel so much cleaner and healthier.  And yes, I&#x27;ve even noticed that my teeth are slightly whiter after only a  week&#x27;s use.  This makes your teeth feel like they do when you come out of a dental cleaning... Nothing short of absolutely amazing results....  Purchase one; you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish I had done differently is order the 8300 instead-- it&#x27;s almost identical and $20 cheaper. There are 2 extra features on the 8500 that I don&#x27;t use-- programmable quadpacer and dual speed control.  (Both the 8300 and 8500 have the quadpacer; the one on the 8500 can be set to values other than 4 thirty second intervals.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I noticed that I was hitting the toothpaste dispenser a bit too often and using up toothpaste really fast.  If you hit it once for every quarter of your mouth, you&#x27;ll run out fast!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW UP NOTE:  I recently visited my dentist after a year of using the Sonicare Intelliclean system.  For the first time in my life, the dentist reported NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF PLAQUE.  I floss on and use the Intelliclean religiously.</li>
            <li> This is our third Sonicare. The first generation suffered from premature battery failures (replaced by the company twice at no charge). The second seemed to remedy that problem and worked quite well but disappeared one day. This model was purchased to replace the one that went MIA and to take advantage of the integrated toothpaste dispenser.  &lt;br /&gt;It seems to work as well as the second generation, though I must say I like the dual speed option--faster for her, slower for me (the older models came with a metal ring that could be dropped into the chamber before the brush was attached. It deadened the vibration somewhat but it was too clumsy to change for each user&#x27;s preference). &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, what I&#x27;m not too crazy about is the larger size of the handle (of course it has to accommodate the toothpaste) and the seemingly cheaper plastic it&#x27;s made from. Also, the color scheme looks less elegant than the pure ivory. In addition, as the handle has to be removed to change the toothpaste cartridges quite frequently, they could have made the mechanism for opening and closing it a lot more sturdy than it is. I&#x27;m pretty sure one of the tabs is going to break off one day and that&#x27;ll be the end of that. &lt;br /&gt;Lastly, as other reviewers have noted, the toothpaste cartridges don&#x27;t last too long (we used 3 on a recent 2 week vacation), they are pretty expensive and not readily available. It looks like Sonicare has discovered the cell phone companies&#x27; secret of financial success: lock in the customer and keep selling him stuff.  &lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;d suggest the previous model. You&#x27;ll save a little up front and a lot down the road.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a while now and I&#x27;m going back to the older model that I had before it. Because this version opens up in the front where the toothpaste goes, the water leaks into there and into the entire area where you replace the head. So all of your backwash and suds from the toothpaste goes in and causes bacteria. You have to constantly keep opening it up to clean it. You can smell it after a while and no matter how much cleaning you do, it doesn&#x27;t help. I am not that lazy, I can take an extra second to put the toothpaste on my toothbrush. Trust me, you&#x27;re better off. I got it when it first came out, so I didn&#x27;t have the luxury of looking at the reviews. I hope this helps someone out there. I would suggest the older version, or maybe even the newer version. Any version except this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve my Intelliclean for about two months now and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  My teeth have gotten whiter (I use the cool mint intelliclean + whitening catridge), but more important, my gums are in MUCH better condition than they were.  My dentist told me a couple months ago that I have gingivitis and that I would have to be extremely diligent with my oral hygiene or it could progress further. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I know some here have said that it&#x27;s unwieldy and hard to use, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all.  I have a fairly small mouth and I&#x27;m able to *easily* reach my back teeth and navigate along the inside of my teeth &amp; gums without a mess.  I know from using Red-Cote tablets that I&#x27;m getting rid of more plaque along the gumline - a significant amount more than I brushed off with a manual brush or even my old spin-pro.  Another bonus: the intelliclean is gentle on your gums (mine are very sensitive and it hasn&#x27;t hurt at all) and makes it so much easier to brush (it&#x27;s even kind of fun now).  I love the clean feeling I have afterward.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone and after seeing my results, so would my dentist. :-)</li>
            <li> A product feature needed is missing.  The toothbrush turns off 2 minutes after turned on, as a part of the designers idea on how to help the public brush for a certain period of time.  This feature is not deselectable and is annoying to someone who brushes for longer than 2 minutes.  A complaint on this feature was sent to the manufacturer and ignored, also annoying.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a sonicare user for years and think this one is the best ever. Believe it or not, having built-in toothpaste is a real benefit. No more messy tubes! And, it saves time. I really like how my mouth feels after using this toothbrush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I&#x27;m used to turning the brush off by using the button in front, and that&#x27;s the button to dispense the toothpaste. Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This was worth the price paid.  I never used to think about how long I brushed and this ensures I get a full 2 minutes of brushing with a beep to remind me to move to the next quadrant.  I have noticed a definite improvement in the whiteness of my teeth and I feel as though I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist&#x27;s office for a cleaning after each brushing.</li>
            <li> I have used electric toothrbrushes for over 10 years. I started with the Oral-B, but last Christmas, I decided to buy a SonicCare Intelliclean. DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL. Take the time and use a toothpaste tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about the ability of the brush to clean teeth (although I have reverted to the Oral-B brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint with this model is with the built in toothpaste dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The toothpaste is not sold everywhere. Not a big deal if you&#x27;re an Amazon junkie like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The device holding the toothpaste packet in the brush does not always seal properly. This causes toothpaste to seep out of the packet and make a mess inside the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Your choices of toothpaste are very limited. Last I checked there are only 2 flavors, and only one of which is a whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The toothpaste packet is so small that you spend just as much time changing packets every week or two as you would simply applying toothpaste to the brush daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT... It is very difficult to keep the brush clean. Since there is an elaborate design to deliver the toothpaste to the brush head, there are many crevices in which water can remain after use. I would rinse the entire brush once a week and I would still get stinky mold on the inside of the brush. Not very pleasant given the device is used inches from your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again this is not a knock on the method in which SonicCare as a whole makes their brushes, just this particular model.</li>
            <li> this item made a big hole in my teeth, then that hole turned into a cavity. I went through a lot of pain and suffering with this product.</li>
            <li> I have a receding gum line, so I decided to invest in the i8500 IntelliClean toothbrush.  The performance is phenomenal, leaving my teeth feeling cleaner and smoother than any manual toothbrush ever had.  The toothbrush bristles seem gentle enough to clean along the gum line without causing any harm to my gums.  In fact, my gums look and feel healthier than ever before.  Sonicare claims the i8500 IntelliClean System even cleans below the surface of the gum line with it&#x27;s ultrasonic cleaning action of 32,000 brush strokes per minute.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the toothpaste packets only last 10 to 14 days, and they cost about $8 for a three-pack.  If Sonicare would increase the size of the toothpaste packets, or reduce the price of the toothpaste, I would consider this a perfect toothbrush.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I purchased this toothbrush for performance, however, not cost.  This toothbrush is doing exactly what I purchased it for, cleaning my teeth, improving the health of my gums, and preventing me from requiring gum surgery.  On the merit of exemplary performance, I give this product a score of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral B brush for a few years now and thought it was time to upgrade. My dental hygenist recommended this one so I decided to try it. My teeth feel a lot cleaner and are noticable whiter after only 1 week&#x27;s use. The integrated toothpaste is good, but I recommend using your regular toothpaste as well (it goes a little faster than advertised. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my new Sonicare Crest i8500 power toothbrush&#x27;s self contained toothpaste refill capability.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was hoping my kids would brush better.  I thought they would like having the toothpaste in the handle, but they don&#x27;t like either of the flavors of toothpaste and the toothpaste is expensive anyway.  I had another regular Sonicare that I&#x27;ve used for years, but it just died and I think I&#x27;m going to try Oral-B next because studies I&#x27;ve read says that the oscillating motion of Oral-B removes plaque better that a Sonicare.  Our Intelliclean is just sitting there unused right now because I&#x27;m not willing to buy more brush heads so that I can use it because I use Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste--this toothbrush is not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Well, the title says it all. Its performance is not as good as I expected. I feel like I have to brush many times in order to feel clean. The brush is not as strong as my Oral B one. I am very very disappointed. Sonicare lets me down!!!</li>
            <li> I rarely write a review but I am so pleased with my IntelliClean i8500 that I felt I should.  I have been using it for over three months now and while this system does not totally eliminate the need to floss it is a HUGE help.  It keeps my teeth incredibly clean between dental visits, travels well and the whitening toothpaste is the first I have tried that I feel actually works.  The Quadpace system I find to be a great help in creating consistancy when brushing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do agree with the other reviewers that the toothpaste is a bit expensive but hopefully that will come down if the system catches on.  My one somewhat negative comment is that I do not like the Fresh Mint toothpaste but I find the whitening toothpaste to be effective and pleasant tasting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My Intelliclean i8500 is a real winner!</li>
            <li> This is the first Sonic Powered Toothbrush I have invested in and I want to say I am very very satisfied. My mouth has never felt so clean. I have been using this toothbrush for about 7 months and my teeth look amazingly white. I am constatly asked if I bleach my teeth. My dentist has also complimented on how healthy my teeth are. This toothbrush may seem pricy to some people, but believe my it&#x27;s worth it! I love this toothbrush and will never use anything else again!</li>
            <li> I bought this before it actually hit the market and thought I would be getting the latest and greatest Sonicare had to offer.  I agree with everyone here that their toothbrushes do a superior job in oral hygiene however, the Intelliclean series has a fatal flaw and I see that I am not the only one who has noticed this.  If you do not disassemble the toothbrush and run scalding hot water over its interior after EVERY use then let is dry before reassembling it begins to mildew and smell very bad.  And this mildew is what your breath smells like if you don&#x27;t.  I wish I had bought a Sonicare that was watertight.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought one of these models!</li>
            <li> Before this I had the Sonicare Advance. The i8500 is bulky and the power seems the same as the Advance, so I am trying to justify the $150 retail price. Well, the toothpaste in a toothbrush gimmick sold me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m as happy with this as I was with the old one. It meets my expectations - nothing special. However, I would highly reccomend only using the Crest toothpaste inside the toothbrush when you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, that feature&#x27;s great when I&#x27;m at work and want to brush quickly - no tubes/no mess. But when I have more time like at home, it&#x27;s most efficient to use toothpaste from a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, it gives more options than Crest. I&#x27;m a Colgate person. Also, you won&#x27;t go through $8 6-pack refills in no time flat if you brush several times/day like I do.</li>
            <li> I have been using the original Sonicare toothbrush for years. It&#x27;s a great product, and still going strong, but I decided to upgrade to the latest and greatest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the integrated toothpaste concept. Seems like a very nice feature for travel, kind of all-in one conception. If you are going on a prolonged trip though, be aware, that the charger is not very compact, and it only supports 110-120 Volts, you would need a transformer to use it with 220-240 Volt outlets. Also, this toothbrush uses Nickel Cadmium batteries; which for the year 2005 is unfortunate. These days better battery technologies are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original Sonicare toothbrush felt like a fairly well sealed and tight unit, this new one has large gaps and a feeling that it is about to come apart in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now is the most important question. How well does it work? After trying the i8500 myself I must say that it works very well. Better than the original. The longer bristles at the ends clean spaces between the teeth, and elongated shape allow brushing hard to reach places better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much I like this toothbrush.  I had three different Braun brushes before my dentist talked to me about the IntelliClean.  I have had this since after Christmas of 2005.  Until I started using IntelliClean I had to have my teeth cleaned at the dentist every 4 months.  This has been my schedulae for the last 15 or so years.  Now I go every 6 months like most other people.  Instead of taking an hour at the dentist for cleaning, it takes less than half that time.  I would tell anyone and everyone to buy the IntelliClean!!!</li>
            <li> As the title indicates, it&#x27;s the best product I ever experimented to brush teeths. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ts fast; The eletronic (\\&quot;ionic\\&quot;) I already had on my previous sonycare (thousands of toothbrushes per second); I see people doing FORCE to brush and Sonicare don&#x27;t need that. You just touch softly your teeth, the velocity creates micro drops that goes everywhere in your month. &lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT is a big step forward. It&#x27;s so fun and practic that you don&#x27;t have to unscrew and/or open a toothpaste, it&#x27;s just already there. &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also fantastic tastefull (very good tastes, can&#x27;t wait for more options). &lt;br /&gt;I never liked brushing my teeths. Did it for higienic needs only. Now I do it before and after food, about 4 to 5 times a day minimum. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! &lt;br /&gt;By the way, I was concerned (and curious) about how many days the small and tiny toothpaste would last. Brushing 5 times a day, I had it work for about 12 to 15 days (one person). Very good result. I taught it would not be more than4or5 days. &lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s because I \\&quot;push\\&quot; the paste button two times, not one each time. &lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT IS THE ULTIMATE, BEST EVER TOOTHBRUSH SYSTEM. I have fun and pleasure for first time in my life. &lt;br /&gt;Bill Gates with all his 5 billion dollars can&#x27;t buy something better for his teeths! This is THE thing!</li>
            <li> Why do they call this liquid toothpaste?  I took it literally, thinking it would shoot out as I brushed (each time I pushed the button) - they should call it automatic toothpaste dispenser.  It is really just like regular gel toothpaste, but it comes up through the neck of the brush to the base of the bristles.  It is nice to be able to apply fresh toothpaste half-way through brushing, w/o having to pick up a tube and do it manually, but other than that, I don&#x27;t see a benefit.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product, it is a little difficult if 2 people are using this product, to remove one brush and put another brush on is a little redundant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably a lot like you.  I procrastinate brushing.  It&#x27;s boring, just standing there in the bathroom staring at yourself in the mirror as you manually scrub plaque off your teeth.  And no matter how hard you scrub, no matter what kind of fancy-schmancy toothpaste you use, you never seem to get any kind of reward commensurate with that effort.  And six months down the road you&#x27;re sitting in a dentist&#x27;s chair listening to yet another lecture about how you should be brushing better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, citizens, I got tired of it.  So after doing some research and reading reviews, I decided to take the plunge, part with a bill, and get myself a Sonicare.  And I&#x27;m here to tell you I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, sure, it might look a little daunting, especially if your only recollection of a powered toothbrush is that hair-curler-sized one that hit the market twenty years ago.  This is 2006, and we have no time for any of that nonsense.  The brush moves around at an ungodly rate of speed, but it doesn&#x27;t actually rotate...it vibrates all that junk out of your teeth, helped by a new formula of Crest toothpaste which is the equivalent of Agent Orange for home dental care.  Setting it up was easy, charging it up was even easier, and using it...well, to quote the old commercial, it was like there was a party in my mouth and everyone was invited.  Everyone, that is, except halitosis-causing bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends, the cost of this bad boy is a little up there.  The toothpaste cartridges are small and with the way *I* need to brush (I smoke cigars and drink Cuban coffee, two things not generally conducive to a brilliant smile) I&#x27;ll be lucky to get a week out of each one.  But I don&#x27;t care.  Because unlike many other gadgets on the market, this one has real value attached to it, enough to make me forget about the planned consumables associated with the Sonicare.  And I like it so much that I sat down to pen this, my very first Amazon review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look...you&#x27;re reading these reviews because you want a real-world report.  Well, here it is:  It Works.  Get one.ou&#x27;re reading these reviews because you want a real-world report.  Well, here it is:  It Works.  Get one. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush only a week or two ago, but so far overall, I&#x27;m pleased with it.  We upgraded from the sonicare standard toothbrush and I was very pleased with our two years use of them.  We are handing them down to our daughters (with new heads of course).  The only thing I don&#x27;t particularly care for with the i8500 is the toothpaste pouches, which is one of the main reasons I upgraded.   &lt;br /&gt;I have realized that I have to open the toothbrush up and squeeze the toothpaste toward the center and top of the pouch for it to dispense more onto the toothbrush.  I have been able to get a reasonable amount of use out of one pouch so far, so we&#x27;ll see how long they last.   &lt;br /&gt;Despite the toothpaste issue, I am pleased with this toothbrush and plan to buy another for my husband to use when he travels.  I find they are especially good for those who don&#x27;t like to floss very often.  My husband is one and it has made significant improvements in his oral health.  &lt;br /&gt;Sonicare is well worth the extra money if you are concerned about oral health as you age and it can pay off in decreased dental cleanings and repair.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing a few months ago, it&#x27;s fine, nothing special, and a little overpriced. The big problem with it (and the reason I no longer use it) is that mold and other disgusting stuff grows on the inside compartment that holds the toothpaste. That can be very disgusting. I decided I rather spend the money to buy a new power brush than keep using this thing.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I should say that if you clean the inside of the brush every day, maybe you will not have a mold problem.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a final note, I did not notice any significant improvement since I started using this thing, and my dentist did&#x27;nt either.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Why upgrade to this bulky product? Why contend with hard to find and expensive toothpaste? Why limit your toothpaste choices? Why pay so much?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Listen, just buy better Oral B product which are superior and smaller.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I returned mine to my dentist and got Oral B instead and very impressed with it! You&#x27;re supposed to replace brush often and Sonicare&#x27;s replacement are RIP OFF.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sonicares are unreliable. I owned older model and it died within 2 years or just shy of 2 year warranty. I give them credit for good customer service for sending me replacement. So if your product is unreliable then call to complain and demand a brand new replacment!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Want proof? Reputable 3rd party Cochrane study state that Oral B&#x27;s rotating brush are better! Not only that the replacement brushes are much cheaper than Sonicare!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;[...]  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;An independent research group The Cochrane Collaboration, recently completed the most comprehensive review of power toothbrush  &lt;br /&gt;studies ever undertaken.  &lt;br /&gt;Rotation-oscillation toothbrushes, like the  &lt;br /&gt;ProfessionalCare 7000, reduce plaque and  &lt;br /&gt;gingivitis by between 7% and 17% more  &lt;br /&gt;than manual toothbrushes.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No other form of power toothbrushes,  &lt;br /&gt;including \\&quot;sonic,\\&quot; proved to be any better  &lt;br /&gt;than a manual toothbrush in reducing  &lt;br /&gt;plaque and gingivitis.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The evidence also proved that power  &lt;br /&gt;toothbrushing is just as safe as manual  &lt;br /&gt;brushing.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the full on-line report, visit  &lt;br /&gt;[...]  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been Cybersonic users for a number of years but after seeing the new IntelliClean closer to Flossing toothbrush I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have a few spots of periodontitis and after a few week this is really helping. You still have to floss but when I do floss now you can feel the difference. It would regularly hurt in those areas and now it MUCH less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and am very happy with it. I like the two minute timer option a lot because I find myself \\&quot;rushed\\&quot; sometimes and only brush a little, this forces me to finish.  My teeth are a lot cleaner now.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ok, the only complaint I have is with regards to the cleaning of this.  Disclaimer - I consider myself a typical guy.  I&#x27;m used to washing my toothbrush off and sitting it by the sink and that&#x27;s about it.  You can&#x27;t do that with this toothbrush.  I have to clean it off and dry it out before storing it on the charger.  Why?  Because the water and any residual toothpaste caught in the little crevices on this thing will start to stink in about a day.  Ain&#x27;t nothing fun about going to use your toothbrush and it smells like, well, I&#x27;ll just leave that area of the body off this post.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended to both my husband and I by our dentist.  We were a little reluctant about spending so much money on a toothbrush.  Now that we have it we wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Every time I use it I feel like I just came from a cleaning at the dentist.  It really cleans your teeth well.  You still need to floss, but a difference!!  Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, my teeth and gums feel great after using this. My frustrations is with the design of this \\&quot;IntelliClean\\&quot; system. First of all, the liquid toothpaste that comes with this doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans as well as traditional \\&quot;paste.\\&quot; The refills are very expensive and the toothbrush dispenser system never lets you use it all, almost half of it stays stuck inside the refill cartridge because it can&#x27;t all get sucked up the tubing in the head. It&#x27;s just a waste of time trying to push the button until it all comes out, it&#x27;s easier just putting your own paste on the brush like normally. My biggest problem with this toothbrush is that the insides get filled with gunk so easily! It is not watertight so everytime you brush your teeth, toothpaste and water always gets inside. After just one day, it will start to get moldy and mildewy. It turns yellowish green and STINKS BAD!! I&#x27;m now always self conscious that this is what my mouth smells like. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth that feeling. The mildewy residue will get stuck in all the small tiny crevices inside... and oh boy there are a lot of crevices... the cartridge reservoir, the slot where the head sits inside the body, and even inside the toothbrush head. I spend more time cleaning my toothbrush than I do brushing my teeth!  This is the only model I have ever tried, so I don&#x27;t know if the older models leak inside or not. I think the flaw might just be in the fancy-schmancy dispenser system, it was made to be opened often.  The intelligence behind this toothbrush is really just the vibrating bristles... so I would just recommend that you get the simple older models. I wish I could trade mine in!</li>
            <li> I was leary of purchasing this toothbrush with the toothpaste installed inside, but my husband wanted a Sonicare and he didn&#x27;t specify which one.  It has turned out to be wonderful.  His dentist recommended a Sonicare for his gums, but we were not really expecting how much whiter his teeth have become in just three weeks!  I would highly recommend the IntelliClean.</li>
            <li> This is one of those great ideas that just didn&#x27;t work out.  Having your toothpaste inside the toothbrush sounds like a life changing novelty but the toothpaste is really expensive and without it the inside of the head gets really gross.  Most stores have discontinued selling the heads and the toothpaste for this brush.</li>
            <li> Cleans well. Battery will last many many uses before needing to be placed on the charger again. I would have no problems with living home for a couple weeks without my charger.    Toothpaste only comes in two kinds to my knowledge. And the toothpaste packet supply seems to drying up. It&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find. Once it&#x27;s gone, you&#x27;re stuck with an enormous version of the regular sonicare.     I am certain that once you use a Sonicare, you will refuse to use a regular analog toothbrush. haha</li>
            <li> Still the best toothbrush around - glad there&#x27;s still  a place to get them!</li>
            <li> So, I hate the dentist and I hate flossing, but after years of not going to the dentist (thanks to a lack of a dental plan while in grad school) I found out that I needed some major cleaning of my teeth. It&#x27;s a procedure called rooting and scaling where they go in an numb half your mouth, scrape the crap out of your roots and rinse the pockets around your teeth with antibiotic. It takes two 90 min dental visits and I&#x27;m not looking forward to it. I decided after this visit to the dentist that I was going to take better care of my teeth and I had been recommended by the hygenist the Sonicare toothbrushes. Seeing them for significantly cheaper here than anywhere else, I decided to get one.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a month, but I can say that after each brushing my teeth feel cleaner. Also, I used the sample whitening toothpaste that came with the initial package and even after using that for just a week, I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are much whiter and so have many others. Of course, stain removal was occurring even with the regular toothpaste, but I noticed a more dramatic result when I used the whitening toothpaste. In addition, my gums are looking much healthier going from the diseased redness to the healthy pinkness that they are suppose to be. This effect is occuring throughout the gums, not just those areas lying close to the exposed tooth. I will admit that since I got this toothbrush I have started to floss, but I doubt I would see this dramatic of a result without the toothbrush. I&#x27;m hoping that I may even be able to avoid the rooting and scaling procedure.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is the drawback of the expensive toothpaste and the unique smell that develops, but the gains far outweigh the losses for me. I do use a mouth rinse, so that smell doesn&#x27;t linger very long and I wash my toothbrush out weekly with the hottest possible water. The toothpaste is expensive, but when I am low I just put on some regular toothpaste and it seems to work just fine.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been getting about 10 days usage out of my toothpaste packets. In an effort to have healthier teeth, I have been brushing on average 3 times daily. In addition, the 2.5 minute interval my toothbrush is set on (you can either set it for 2 or 2.5 minutes) doesn&#x27;t seem entirely long enough, so I brush twice as long as night before bed and therefore use twice as much toothpaste then. This is another advantage that I&#x27;ve noticed is that I&#x27;m more compliant with brushing my teeth and doing a decent effort every time (with my manual toothbrush, I knwo there were days when I do the sprint brushing). So, you can use up the toothpaste fairly quickly, but it seems to work best with that special toothpaste.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, this toothbrush is well worth the purchase. I will know in a couple of weeks as to whether it has alleviated the need for the rooting and scaling procedure. Even if I still need the procedure, I do believe this toothbrush will prevent me from having any further problems with my gums and teeth down the road and I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have LOVED this toothbrush. I even bought the kids their own. No messy tooth paste in the sink and on the counter. This product was highly recommended by my dentist. Once you try it you won&#x27;t be satisfied with the own fashioned toothbrush</li>
