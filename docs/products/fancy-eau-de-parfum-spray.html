            <li>it&#x27;ll be sure to satisfy!</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s floral - I like spicy scents - so if you like \\&quot;loves baby soft\\&quot; kind of products, this perfume is for you.</li>
            <li>+ - so I&#x27;m not going to knock the perfum - its nice -</li>
            <li>really liked this perfume and quality</li>
            <li>As always Amazon has the best prices for the real deal.</li>
            <li>It is pleasant, not too strong, yet people can smell the fragrance even when the one wearing it can not.  </li>
            <li>She smells wonderful, great price too, shipping was pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect soft scent for any occation.</li>
            <li>It came right on time, and it smells REALLY NICE!</li>
            <li>It is her favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I would compare this scent to Can Can by Paris Hilton, which is another one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>THe seller, however, Perfumania, was outstanding they are FIVE STARS -</li>
            <li>also OK .Overall</li>
            <li>but I love having this one in my collection for winter.</li>
            <li>Scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>i love this smell</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy this perfume, but it&#x27;s VERY strong.  </li>
            <li>It is a warm, sweet scent</li>
            <li>When I sampled this in the department store I don&#x27;t remember it smelling ssoooooo sweet!</li>
            <li>This item arrived VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li>Just one spritz lasts all day and is almost too strong at times.  </li>
            <li>They said it was a definitely a head turner and pleasant to smell.</li>
            <li>Nice young scent.</li>
            <li>Sweet smell.</li>
            <li>This scent is so sticky sweet &amp; sugary.</li>
            <li>It has a really sweet smell...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and heavenly.</li>
            <li>its fakeeeeeeeee, very Terribly sweet ...</li>
            <li>its fakeeeeeeeee, very Terribly sweet</li>
            <li>Im 19 And love soft scents as this one!</li>
            <li>It smells kinda powdery to me, and yes I know exactly what she means by smelling like a candle!   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fragrance expert, so I can&#x27;t tell you about sandalwood undertones with floral highlights, but it&#x27;s a great smell, not some little girl scent at all.</li>
            <li>it is super comforting very warm with sweet vanilla and slightly floral not powdery smelling like Jessica  Simpsons Fancy Love perfume which is gross to me.</li>
            <li>I received it right on time.</li>
            <li>The only difference i can smell is that this perfume has a more powerful element of vanilla, which could be attributed to the caramel as well.</li>
            <li>i can say people interested in this brand can have trail by trying this once.</li>
            <li>To see if other people liked it</li>
            <li>If you do not like sugary sweet fragrances however, you should stray away from this one, as it is sweet enough to give you a toothache...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going pretty strong over 9 hours later!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more, it is not what I had expected, &amp; yes my daughter walked in my room after putting it on asked me if I had a new candle??</li>
            <li>It is not for older women (65andup)or pre-teens.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>at first spay it goes on smelling ok but after dry-down like a half hour the smell turns into this creamy yummi smell hard to explain maybe like a calm but sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li>but if you are not a vanilla person don&#x27;t buy it you won&#x27;t be able to get past it</li>
            <li>Actually, when I first put it on (one spray)</li>
            <li>but I was very happily surprised.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this perfume for young or middle-aged professional women.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 17 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice scent, a little warmer that I usually wear.  </li>
            <li>better than the rest of the line ,, but not great</li>
            <li>(aka the guy I like and his friends), I wore it to a social gathering.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never smelled Aqualina Pink Sugar, but from the description, I believe this may smell similar to it as well, but also with a possible stronger vanilla note.</li>

            <li> Came even earlier than expected!</li>

            <li> The frangrance puts me in the mind of vanilla, jasmine, and maybe a little sandalwood.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy celebrity perfumes</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice young scent. Sweet smell.</li>
            <li> better than the rest of the line ,, but not great</li>
            <li> It was a gift. She loved it. It is her favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a present and she loves it. She wears it all of the time and I enjoy it because it smells very good on her.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance blindly, based on the reviews &amp; descriptions. I do not regret my choice at all! This scent is so sticky sweet &amp; sugary. I would describe it as a cotton candy/vanilla/caramel scent, almost smelling like a sugar cookie at times. The fruits hide out in the background, but peek out here &amp; there throughout the day. The caramel/vanilla clings on me the most &amp; lasts almost all day! I applied 2 sprays this morning, one on my neck, &amp; one on my wrists, which i rubbed on my shirt as well, to test the holding power. It&#x27;s still going pretty strong over 9 hours later! If you do not like sugary sweet fragrances however, you should stray away from this one, as it is sweet enough to give you a toothache...lol. I would compare this scent to Can Can by Paris Hilton, which is another one of my favorite scents. The only difference i can smell is that this perfume has a more powerful element of vanilla, which could be attributed to the caramel as well. I&#x27;ve never smelled Aqualina Pink Sugar, but from the description, I believe this may smell similar to it as well, but also with a possible stronger vanilla note. If you have a craving for sweets, this perfume is for you...it&#x27;ll be sure to satisfy!</li>
            <li> I saw this perfume in a department store for double the price.  I did not expect to receive the identical product but I was very happily surprised.  It is a warm, sweet scent and I love it.  what a great deal.  This item arrived VERY quickly.  thank you !</li>
            <li> Fancy has the most wonderful scent.  The frangrance puts me in the mind of vanilla, jasmine, and maybe a little sandalwood.  It is pleasant, not too strong, yet people can smell the fragrance even when the one wearing it can not.  The perfume lasts for hours. I recommend this perfume for young or middle-aged professional women.  It is not for older women (65andup)or pre-teens.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  It is light and perfect for Spring/Summer.  On me it lasts about 6 hours.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the perfume - not the best I&#x27;ve ever smelled but for the price - it&#x27;s nice. THe seller, however, Perfumania, was outstanding they are FIVE STARS - I received my order in 2 days - no shipping fee and they provided me samples as well as the perfume - I won&#x27;t hesitate to order from Perfumania again. I was very impressed with their service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Perfume - it&#x27;s floral - I like spicy scents - so if you like \\&quot;loves baby soft\\&quot; kind of products, this perfume is for you. It feels a little too \\&quot;young\\&quot; for me. This is for the 16-28 range - not 40+ - so I&#x27;m not going to knock the perfum - its nice - but it&#x27;s for a younger woman.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to present it .She really liked this perfume and quality also OK .Overall i can say people interested in this brand can have trail by trying this once.</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy this perfume, but it&#x27;s VERY strong.  Just one spritz lasts all day and is almost too strong at times.  It&#x27;s lovely, but do keep that in mind!  I don&#x27;t usually buy celebrity perfumes but I love having this one in my collection for winter.</li>
            <li> It has a really sweet smell... I love it! It keeps all day long the smell on me.</li>
            <li> Came even earlier than expected! Scent is lovely. Im 19 And love soft scents as this one! Amazing by for its great price. It is the perfect soft scent for any occation.</li>
            <li> This is a nice scent, a little warmer that I usually wear.  Scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as a pricier perfume.</li>
            <li> my very favorite for now /feminine ambery not a girly smell</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more, it is not what I had expected, &amp; yes my daughter walked in my room after putting it on asked me if I had a new candle?? ahh, NO!! It smells kinda powdery to me, and yes I know exactly what she means by smelling like a candle!   would not buy again!</li>
            <li> i love this smell it is super comforting very warm with sweet vanilla and slightly floral not powdery smelling like Jessica  Simpsons Fancy Love perfume which is gross to me. basically when you spray it its the notes i described are very potent them it dries to a warm honey floral on myself so good but if you are not a vanilla person don&#x27;t buy it you won&#x27;t be able to get past it</li>
            <li> When I sampled this in the department store I don&#x27;t remember it smelling ssoooooo sweet! I tried it a couple of times and couldn&#x27;t tolerate it.  I need to find another perfume to mix it with and hopefully dilute the sweetness!! ACK!!</li>
            <li> a guy that bought it for my sisters birthday. at first spay it goes on smelling ok but after dry-down like a half hour the smell turns into this creamy yummi smell hard to explain maybe like a calm but sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li> I received my perfume sealed in the box.  It smells great on me. I have gotten numerous compliments on it.  I received it right on time.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it.  I&#x27;m not a fragrance expert, so I can&#x27;t tell you about sandalwood undertones with floral highlights, but it&#x27;s a great smell, not some little girl scent at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and heavenly. As always Amazon has the best prices for the real deal. I can&#x27;t believe I bought this for $50 at Macy&#x27;s before this!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 year old daughter.  She smells wonderful, great price too, shipping was pretty fast.  Would recommend to other buyers.</li>
            <li> It came right on time, and it smells REALLY NICE! To see if other people liked it (aka the guy I like and his friends), I wore it to a social gathering. I got compliments from him, his friends, my friends, strangers, etc. They said it was a definitely a head turner and pleasant to smell. Actually, when I first put it on (one spray) my roommate said she loved it and that she could smell it from where she stood, about five feet away (I only sprayed one spray on the wrist and I rubbed both wrists together afterwards). A little goes a long way, and it last me all day. Idk about others, but even when I think it&#x27;s worn off, others can still smell it. Lovely purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just good to them who do not have a taste. its fakeeeeeeeee, very Terribly sweet ...It&#x27;s just good to them who do not have a taste. its fakeeeeeeeee, very Terribly sweet</li>
