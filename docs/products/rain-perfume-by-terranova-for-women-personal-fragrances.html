            <li>I have allergies to alcohol in fragrance, this is my favorite, husband likes it too.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this size as I felt it would be good for travel.</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent, floral at first, then a good light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This clean, floral scent lasts and lasts!  </li>
            <li>It is clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Why?&lt;br /&gt;Who knows - many tried and true get bumped for &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; &amp;#34;better.&amp;#34; I like to stick with favorites&lt;</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>I ove perfume and once I found this &amp;#34;RAIN&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;CHINA RAIN&amp;#34; just &amp;#34;RAIN&amp;#34; I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;Fresh, always gets noticed, makes me happy wearing it…used to be in stores - now only on line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great to rub on the scalp when you have to go an extra day before washing your hair--such a clean smell.</li>
            <li>Unique fragrance gets me compliments everywhere I go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of flowery at first, a little bright, but after a bit it softens and is more clean and powdery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m into good, natural smells and this one strikes me just right.</li>
            <li>this roll on has more staying power than essential oil and smells great after a long work day.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, simple clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean smell, yet has enough musky fragrances to be sexy.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light, subtle and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Once the fragrance dries down on your skin, it has a fresh floral essence to it that is very refreshing, and the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I had never tried this before , I received this today and have fallen in love with the scent I am actually going to order the body mist to layer the scent .</li>
            <li>I really like the way this one dries down on me, and the way I can still smell it on my clothes days afterward -- not in a strong way, but a nice, soft reminder of the perfume.  </li>
            <li>Been a favorite for summer for a long time.</li>
            <li>It smells a little bit like soap--which is nice, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend the $20 again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>The same clean accent I&#x27;ve always known.</li>
            <li>The scent is definitely very clean, as other reviews have said.</li>
            <li>My normal perfume is Jessica McClintock which is also very floral smelling</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the smell of this.... but the fragrance in this wears out very quickly.</li>
            <li>the scent seems to last much longer then the perfumes with an alcohol base to them, one happy buyer :)</li>
            <li>but Rain has replaced hat and is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like old grandpa&#x27;s stuff.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s comprised of essential oils, the scent stays around (ie: don&#x27;t use too much).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent since the late 70&#x27;s,was nice to find it on line at such a reduced rate !</li>
            <li>The last few year&#x27;s I hadn&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Each is elegant, noticeable and yet subtle.  </li>

            <li> I have been using Terranova perfume essence for many years.  I get many compliments whenever I wear it.  My husband started me using this back in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume oil. It has a light clean scent that is pleasant and not too overpowering. Once the fragrance dries down on your skin, it has a fresh floral essence to it that is very refreshing, and the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya!  This clean, floral scent lasts and lasts!  I have been looking for an essential oil type fragrance and this roll on has more staying power than essential oil and smells great after a long work day.  Highly recommended!  My normal perfume is Jessica McClintock which is also very floral smelling but Rain has replaced hat and is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product!</li>
            <li> Great for summer. Very light.  Convenient roll on.</li>

            <li> I had never tried this before , I received this today and have fallen in love with the scent I am actually going to order the body mist to layer the scent . Will probably order the China rain to , I am a big fan of the oil perfumes the scent seems to last much longer then the perfumes with an alcohol base to them, one happy buyer :)</li>
            <li> Not caring for fragrance. It was ok. Not what I thought it would be. Would not buy again. Thank you</li>

            <li> Heaven in a bottle.  This is my everyday scent.  I always get compliments on this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;This is great to rub on the scalp when you have to go an extra day before washing your hair--such a clean smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product, simple clean fresh scent.  Have been using this for 10 plus years.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  It is extremely light, subtle and pleasant.  I am not someone who enjoys overpowering fragrances.  I have used Terranova Rain for years.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this size as I felt it would be good for travel.</li>
            <li> A lovely fragrance, just as I remember.</li>
            <li> These scents are a delight.  Each is elegant, noticeable and yet subtle.  Rain is my favorite, but any of the Terra Nova fragrances are wonderful.  Oil based, the fragrances have a lingering longevity which go with any attire, from gardening or attending an opera.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Unique fragrance gets me compliments everywhere I go. It has a clean smell, yet has enough musky fragrances to be sexy.</li>
