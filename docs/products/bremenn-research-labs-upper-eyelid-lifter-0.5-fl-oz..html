            <li>, it arrived very quickly and on time.</li>

            <li>but usually works great.  </li>
            <li>If anything, my eyelids are sagging more since I&#x27;m not using the product prior to this one.</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper at Walmart...</li>
            <li>lifts\\&quot; but it does what I was looking for, which was to keep the upper eye area smooth.</li>
            <li>It was packaged really well so not damaged in transit.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>The product works very well</li>
            <li>Surprising to find this product slightly lifts a lid or two a tiny bit.  </li>
            <li>This is the only eye cream my super sensitive eyelids can tolerate.  </li>
            <li>Saw results very early on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got the small tube just to try it.</li>
            <li>What does work for me, instantly and consistently, is Perricone MD&#x27;s eyelid serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still young.</li>
            <li>The cream looked as if it was old.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and think it really does work.  </li>
            <li>My 75 year old eyelids were beginning to droop, and they don&#x27;t any longer.  </li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and am told I don&#x27;t look it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like a fresh smear which I would attribute to transit, but older and dried.  </li>
            <li>I went from red, scaly, flaky &amp; puffy to smooth, pale &amp; serene.  </li>

            <li> As far  as I am concerned, it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as well.  </li>
            <li> A truly expensive product is something that doesn&#x27;t work at all, which is true in this case.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve only had this cream for less than a month, I believe it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> It costs much more, unfortunately, but at least I get some results.</li>
            <li> Because I think some people put other things in the bottle  </li>

            <li> This particular one smells weird and does nothing for my hooded eyelids-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but you only use a very small amount and after applying it twice a day, I am seeming results in the &amp;#34;eye-flap&amp;#34; decrease.</li>
            <li> If traveling, carry a little pin to poke the dispenser which can clog overnight under changing weather conditions.</li>
            <li> so mad that I didn&#x27;t research first...</li>
            <li> What a waste.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to at least match the results of Olay Definity eye cream</li>
            <li> It tightened up the loose lids making me look less tired.</li>
            <li> I usually do...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some small improvement but overall, I&#x27;m disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several eye creams and am always disappointed in the results.  </li>
            <li> made problem worse.</li>
            <li> Even though this is expensive..</li>
            <li> and then very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Caused my eyelids to flake. Did not notice any improvement</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product and then very disappointed.  It not only didn&#x27;t work, it discolored my eyelid.  I haven&#x27;t returned it because I cannot find my receipt.</li>
            <li> Works great lifts the eye works both instantaneous and cumulatively</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve only had this cream for less than a month, I believe it&#x27;s working. I think I won&#x27;t see a big difference for a while - I will try and provide another review in a couple months. It&#x27;s not instantaneous - surgery is for that! :)</li>
            <li> I use it every day. It works well.</li>
            <li> Surprising to find this product slightly lifts a lid or two a tiny bit.  If traveling, carry a little pin to poke the dispenser which can clog overnight under changing weather conditions.</li>
            <li> This is much cheaper at Walmart...so mad that I didn&#x27;t research first...I usually do...only $24.00 there...does work pretty good, though.</li>
            <li> This WORKS !  I actually have eyelids as the droopy skin below the brow has tightened.  I will use this forever.</li>
            <li> Did not see a difference whether I used it or not. I would not purchase either of these products again.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 2 weeks, I have not seen any results. As far  as I am concerned, it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and feel it is effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this because some reviews were very good. Mine is not. This product doesn&#x27;t work. At all. If anything, my eyelids are sagging more since I&#x27;m not using the product prior to this one. In fact, I am going back to it. It&#x27;s been close to 2 months. Nothing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it \\&quot; lifts\\&quot; but it does what I was looking for, which was to keep the upper eye area smooth.</li>
            <li> I have actually been using this product for about three years and it actually works! I can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> What a waste.  Been using this product for a while and have not seen a difference.  I&#x27;m glad I got the small tube just to try it.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream my super sensitive eyelids can tolerate.  I went from red, scaly, flaky &amp; puffy to smooth, pale &amp; serene.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> This particular one smells weird and does nothing for my hooded eyelids- but usually works great.  I feel like it makes a difference where you order this problem. Because I think some people put other things in the bottle  In the bottle.  Because sometimes it&#x27;s got a funky smell textures off or something is not right about it And I can say that because I&#x27;ve been using it for a while with great results</li>
            <li> Amazing! My mom thought I had my eyes done. Saw results very early on. Will be using this forever.</li>
            <li> Love this product can&#x27;t buy in the store anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good success with this product. Applies easily. No eye irritation. I&#x27;m still young. I hope this will help me delay or avoid the surgery. It tightened up the loose lids making me look less tired.</li>
            <li> I expected it to at least match the results of Olay Definity eye cream but it hasn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve noticed some small improvement but overall, I&#x27;m disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the product. I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable results. I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> made problem worse. The cream looked as if it was old. It had two consistency, watery, and a lot of air in it. I returned it.</li>
            <li> the product is good, I have used it before but couldn&#x27;t remember what site I purchased it from.  I would have given it five stars. But this product arrived and the cream is not only smeared in the bottom of the cap but also along the dispensing area for over 1/4 inch.  It doesn&#x27;t look like a fresh smear which I would attribute to transit, but older and dried.  It was packaged really well so not damaged in transit.  The product itself is a good one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several eye creams and am always disappointed in the results.  This is a product that I found worked for me.  I saw results within a week and my upper eye lid appeared firmer and not as droopy.  I am 56 and have tried many products, and this one is a nice find.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and think it really does work.  My 75 year old eyelids were beginning to droop, and they don&#x27;t any longer.  (I can hide the fact of my age!)  I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product did zero for my eyelids, so I would give it zero stars if I could. What does work for me, instantly and consistently, is Perricone MD&#x27;s eyelid serum. It costs much more, unfortunately, but at least I get some results. A truly expensive product is something that doesn&#x27;t work at all, which is true in this case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year.  My sister just asked me what I was doing because it looked like I had my eyes done!</li>
            <li> This eye lifting cream seems to actually be working for me. It&#x27;s a little pricey but you only use a very small amount and after applying it twice a day, I am seeming results in the &amp;#34;eye-flap&amp;#34; decrease. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product, I have tried many eye lifters that cost a lot less and worked better than&lt;br /&gt;Bremenn&#x27;s Clinical.  Will never but again, just a bunch of hype</li>
            <li> Great product.  Pricey, but you will be able to tell the difference in 7 days.  Doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> Good presentation, simple and practical. i will puirchase it again, it arrived very quickly and on time. seems to work fine</li>
            <li> Great product at a really good price. I&#x27;ll shop here again</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye lift cream. Nothing I have tried works better.</li>
            <li> Even though this is expensive..it reaaly does lift your upper eyelids which is quite something.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks and saw an improvement in my upper lids almost immediately.  They are much less wrinkled.  I will continue to use this product twice a day and hope to see even more of an improvement.</li>
            <li> I  find it very easy to use/blends right in and not greasy/actually works/I have allergy problems to some eye products but none with this</li>
            <li> These cosmetics really are fantastic! And prompt careful shipping was excellent! Thank u!</li>
            <li> The product works very well and I can definitely tell a difference on the days I forget to use it. You do have to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and am told I don&#x27;t look it.  I have droopy eyelids and this cream helps tremendously.  I have tried a lot of things and can&#x27;t afford the surgery.  This is the next best thing.  It lasts a long time as well.  Worth the money.</li>
