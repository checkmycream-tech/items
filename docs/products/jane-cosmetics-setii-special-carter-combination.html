            <li>The fragrance of both wasn&#x27;t as appealing as the nourish &amp; shine pomade.  </li>
            <li>This product line makes her hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>This is a Way better product with Mizani</li>
            <li>In fact, it made it more tangled.  </li>
            <li>The leave-in condition is awesome and doesn&#x27;t have a smell that lingers all day long.</li>
            <li>Its great for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have used better products to make her hair more controllable, but for the price, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>With Mizani  thermosmooth line there was a huge amount of smoke coming off my hair as if there was a fire in my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product twice and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and smell so good.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair looking and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I have used these products for several weeks now and can&#x27;t begin to describe how much I LOVE them!  </li>
            <li>Did nothing to clear up dry scales on my scalp, smells nice, detangles hair, but I bought it for my scalp and it did nothing I could have used a lot cheaper set to have nice smelling detangled hair.</li>
            <li>The leave in conditioner definitely had a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The package was right on time.</li>
            <li>These products have changed the texture of my relaxed, medium length, 4a hair so much that I my roller set hair will hold its curls and body for 2 to 3 days!  </li>
            <li>This is WELL worth a buy if your hair is SUPER natural as mine</li>
            <li>I am positive I will not purchase these items again.</li>
            <li>and it was SHINEY and felt clean and light, as for the smell there is not a heavy product smell after as well and there was no smoke coming off my hair while blow drying and flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li>I love these products and will be a lifelong consumer of Jane Carter products.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;d heard wonderful things about these products, my experience was extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I get up, fluff it up lightly with a large tooth comb and done!  </li>
            <li>I spent 3 days looking online for a good natural hair product and this did wonders and trying 4 different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li>After rinsing the conditioner and towel drying my hair, I apply a light even spritz of the leave-in conditioner on my hair and then a pea-sized amount of the nourish and shine and blow dry.  </li>
            <li>These products created more dryness----not less.</li>
            <li>However, the shampoo is particularly stinging to the eyes.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly, long hair that gets dry very easily.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for nature hair</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than purchasing it at the store or directly through the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>Of the trio, I found the &#x27;leave in&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer-conditioner to be the least effective.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and with natural hair it tangles when shampooed, but this shampoo works well to keep hair from tangling.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a wow factor.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo is not harsh to natural hair</li>
            <li>My hair is soft n manageable</li>
            <li>My hair is as natural as it gets</li>
            <li>What I like most is that you only have to use a small amount to get the results.</li>
            <li>I was able to detangle the front of my hair but not the back (possibly due to the different textures of my hair or scab hair in the back).  </li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by several of my friends who wear natural hair.</li>
            <li>I use it on my daughters hair and it has definitely helped with keeping it soft and manageable.</li>

            <li> This product may work IF you have somewhat manageable hair, but IF you have coarse dry hair DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I believe that is because it does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate which strips the hair and makes it feel brittle and dry.</li>

            <li> This was recommended to me by several of my friends who wear natural hair. I use this product and it works great. My hair is naturally curly and with natural hair it tangles when shampooed, but this shampoo works well to keep hair from tangling. The conditioner smells good and continues to soften the hair. A good leave in is always needed.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says that it will do.  The leave-in condition is awesome and doesn&#x27;t have a smell that lingers all day long.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this trio for my next wash.  The package was right on time. Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t feeling the shampoo or the conditioner. The fragrance of both wasn&#x27;t as appealing as the nourish &amp; shine pomade.  The shampoo has sulfates. I was expecting a wow factor.  The leave in conditioner definitely had a nice fragrance.  I was able to detangle the front of my hair but not the back (possibly due to the different textures of my hair or scab hair in the back).  Different strokes for different folks.  Perhaps I have to use multiple times to appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Products smell great and work well for my locked hair.  However, the shampoo is particularly stinging to the eyes.  The leave-in conditioner has a great scent.</li>
            <li> the product is great&lt;br /&gt;love the way it make my hair feel and smell.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for nature hair</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction! :) Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used these products for several weeks now and can&#x27;t begin to describe how much I LOVE them!  I use the shampoo, apply the conditioner and leave it in for 5-7 minutes.  After rinsing the conditioner and towel drying my hair, I apply a light even spritz of the leave-in conditioner on my hair and then a pea-sized amount of the nourish and shine and blow dry.  These products have changed the texture of my relaxed, medium length, 4a hair so much that I my roller set hair will hold its curls and body for 2 to 3 days!  I&#x27;ve never had hair ready-to-go ever in my life!!!  I get up, fluff it up lightly with a large tooth comb and done!  My hair looks and feels healthier with these products and even my relaxer lasts longer.  The last time I went for a retouch, it was week 11 and my stylist thought that my hair was just recently relaxed!  She was so shocked to hear that I hadn&#x27;t done anything but changed hair products since she last retouched it.  She wanted to know what I used and where I purchased them!  I love these products and will be a lifelong consumer of Jane Carter products.</li>
            <li> Great price to quantity ratio!! The value is always important to me and with this product the value is EXCELLENT!!</li>
            <li> Its great for natural hair. Leaves hair looking and feeling clean. I use it on my daughters hair and it has definitely helped with keeping it soft and manageable. Great online price because its $15 per bottle at Target! Will definitely use Amazon to buy it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! I sent some to my daughter-in-law. Her comment was that her felt like it does when she has it deep conditioned at the salon.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product line to me. My daughter has very curly, long hair that gets dry very easily. This product line makes her hair more manageable. I feel like I have used better products to make her hair more controllable, but for the price, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;d heard wonderful things about these products, my experience was extremely disappointing. Of the trio, I found the &#x27;leave in&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer-conditioner to be the least effective. I am positive I will not purchase these items again.</li>
            <li> Product was recommended by a friend, it made hair feel softer, cleaner. Shampoo is not harsh to natural hair I believe that is because it does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate which strips the hair and makes it feel brittle and dry. The conditioner has a pleasant refreshing fragrance. I am very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Works very good so far!!</li>
            <li> Great products for curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice and so far so good.  My hair is soft n manageable</li>
            <li> Great for those morning &amp;#34;sticking up places on your head&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Makes my hair soft and smell so good.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it since I have never heard of it but I went ahead and purchased  this along with Mizani therosmooth set. This is a Way better product with Mizani I did not see a difference in my hair with Mizani  the end result was  as if I used any ole product on the market NO DIFFERENCE. My hair is as natural as it gets I have not had a perm in 5 years I bought these minus the leave in conditioner because all wet products leave my hair an instant puff., I got the nourishing  and shine with the shampoo and conditioner after i washed it i put the nourishing and shine product i blow dried my hair and flat ironed it. Minimal heat was need to straighten my hair and it was SHINEY and felt clean and light, as for the smell there is not a heavy product smell after as well and there was no smoke coming off my hair while blow drying and flat ironing my hair. With Mizani  thermosmooth line there was a huge amount of smoke coming off my hair as if there was a fire in my hair. I also purchased  the wrap and set product for Jane Carter I won&#x27;t use it because since my hair is extremely natural any wet products cause instant frizz. This is WELL worth a buy if your hair is SUPER natural as mine I am sure it would produced excellent result if your hair is relaxed. I spent 3 days looking online for a good natural hair product and this did wonders and trying 4 different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> Did nothing to clear up dry scales on my scalp, smells nice, detangles hair, but I bought it for my scalp and it did nothing I could have used a lot cheaper set to have nice smelling detangled hair.</li>
            <li> What I like most is that you only have to use a small amount to get the results. It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> These are not great products.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo left my hair hard, as well as the conditioner.  The leave in conditioner did not detangle my hair.  In fact, it made it more tangled.  This product may work IF you have somewhat manageable hair, but IF you have coarse dry hair DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  These products created more dryness----not less.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than purchasing it at the store or directly through the manufacturer.  I love getting a discounted rate!</li>
