    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Dermal K is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Skin should be moist when the cream is applied for best results.</li>
            <li>Perfect under makeup.</li>
            <li>This has been THE BEST weapon against rosacea!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful cream to get rid of bruises.</li>
            <li>This is a superior product!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with my spider veins but it works great to accelerate bruise healing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great services.</li>
            <li>Works great around ankles and on legs.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>sleeper for T zone type skin great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what it can do without any surgery!</li>
            <li>Good working product, good smell, happy customer.</li>
            <li>This does about as good a job as the Reviva Vitamin K cream (2% Vitamin K) even though it claims to be 4% Vitamin K.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good skin cream.</li>
            <li>I found a 4oz jar online at a really good price.</li>
            <li>Might be good on bruises but not for those spider veins.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the skin without any irritation.</li>
            <li>She laughed..</li>
            <li>I feeling good about using this for the safety factors vs bleaching creams.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING THANK</li>
            <li>I find Dermal K to be an effective treatment for bruises on my hands.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still very happy with the results since my main issue is spider veins anyway.</li>
            <li>It is amazing in how it treats so many skin problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried competitors, this is the most effective for bruise healing.</li>
            <li>I think it would have been more effective if it had.</li>
            <li>K Solution is faster and more effective.</li>
            <li>This very light and moisturing cream is helpful in fading bruises.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice llight cream, which smells fresh and nice.  </li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s when the laser people tell you that they need more sessions).</li>
            <li>So glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It worked a lot better than arnica gel for my bruises.</li>
            <li>but I think thats from the dimethicone which isn&#x27;t a healthy thing to use.</li>
            <li>It will not permanently go away, but it does seem to help better than steroid creams prescribed by her Dr.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better in some places on my skin than others.</li>
            <li>I find this the greatest cream for speeding the fading of bruises and always keep it on hand just for the occasional one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay more for a cream that could get rid of them altogether, but I probably couldn&#x27;t afford it if it exists.</li>
            <li>so it sure works for me.</li>
            <li>Very happy to find the product is the same I use years ago and still works!</li>
            <li>Be sure you read the instructions.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>Best facial cream.</li>
            <li>Nice and clean transaction</li>
            <li>Love this cream for healing bruises quickly!</li>
            <li>The one catch to the product is that it is important to use it every day and though it improves the appearance somewhat, it is not going to magically make the spider veins vanish.</li>
            <li>This one provides a more noticeable relief more quickly for varicose veins.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and I have actually used it before and was happy to see that Amazon carries it at such a good price.  </li>
            <li>I have spider veins and sometimes I bruise easily.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly from Dixie Health.</li>
            <li>The cream is not &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and applies easily.</li>
            <li>bruise easily, and had a bruise on my leg from running into a desk</li>
            <li>I bought this cream to see if it would help with the age spots and easy bruising on my forearms.  </li>
            <li>So good to have this wonderful soothing cream back on my daily regiment.</li>
            <li>a month ago and have used it two times a day faithfully, I have some dark spots on my legs and the spots are wonderfully fading!!</li>
            <li>Do a little research and find out what is best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a brunette with very fair skin and absolutely no tan, so I do show marks and veins quite noticeably.</li>
            <li>Great, same as always!</li>
            <li>I noticed some spider veins and decided to see if it was still available.</li>
            <li>At this price though, I&#x27;ll let most bruises clear up on their own.</li>
            <li>The bruise on my leg went away about a week after the one on my arm, and faded significantly slower.</li>
            <li>- yeah right!</li>
            <li>But over the use of that much product, it should have worked better.</li>
            <li>Silky feel, absorbs quickly, helped fade a bruise quickly.  </li>
            <li>Who knows if it really works, but it is light and has a light fragrance that dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I bruise easily and this cream really helps me.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and really helps reduce the redness of Rosecea</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li>It does make my skin so soft and has made my face more even toned.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the $ $ for me.</li>
            <li>I used it diligently and it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort each time.  </li>
            <li>The jar was much bigger than I expected too, so that was a pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li>The cost comes out to about the same and it will erase bruises about twice as quickly as they would go away naturally -- maybe even faster if you use it more than once a day!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve almost finished my first jar and my spider veins are almost gone.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice daily for more than one month.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first 2oz jar at the local pharmacy, but they didn&#x27;t have any more when I ran out.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt better, it definitely is something I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>Anybody who has a tissue healing disorder should consider this (check with your doctor first).</li>
            <li>Dermal-k Clarifying Cream started fading my bruises from the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>It must be used daily (I use it in the evenings more heavily and only lightly in the mornings) but works quickly and continues to work more over time as well.</li>
            <li>This cream enabled me to put on a bathing suit during my vacation without large bruises on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on older surgical scars,within 2 weeks they are almost unfindable!</li>
            <li>so I  didn&#x27;t really have much hope that this would do much either.  </li>
            <li>A couple weeks later, I fell and had a huge, purple bruise on my leg.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any results from this product.</li>
            <li>was anticipating so much with this product .  </li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing to help my bruises</li>
            <li>It reduces redness on my face and still feels very moist in the morning.</li>
            <li>Seems to really work to help minimize discoloring/bruising on my arms.  </li>
            <li>did not see much difference on skin</li>
            <li>but I really saw nothing but smoother skin.  </li>
            <li>I really do think it has helped with the pain/irritation.</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>This product works very well on bruises.  </li>
            <li>This cream does absolutely nothing for spider veins on legs.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stop the bruising, but I know they go away much quicker.  </li>
            <li>Really makes my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third 8 oz not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it works better for other skin types.</li>
            <li>It is better by comparing with other products used.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It seems to be working better than other creams I&#x27;ve used previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another spot I&#x27;ve been treating for the full three jars simply hasn&#x27;t changed at all.</li>
            <li>While this cream felt nice on my skin, it didn&#x27;t get rid of any of the small veins around my nose</li>
            <li>This cream was high priced and ineffective.</li>
            <li>Being Irish and 60+ years old I also have freckles and age spotted hands,these have faded significantly.</li>
            <li>In some places, the skin looks normal again.</li>
            <li>The bruises clear quickly with daily use.</li>
            <li>This worked great following a facelift, but I only used a small amount and no longer needed it.  </li>
            <li>It might just be a good moisturizer, I am not 100% sold on the fact they claim it gets rid of the spider like broken capillaries that I endured after my first (and last) microdemabrasion!</li>
            <li>These are not small scars-several in excess of 5\\&quot; and a 1/2 inch in width.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s harmless, but I&#x27;m not sure it helps at all.</li>
            <li>Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>It did not work on age spots, bruises, light spider veins, or slightly aged skin (I&#x27;m 61, but have always looked younger than I really am).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe the hype, completely untrue!</li>
            <li>I used a small amount of hers prior to purchasing my own jar of it.</li>
            <li>Make sure if you stand on your feet or sit down a lot you are spending those ten minute breaks taking a brisk walk or doing some stretches to promote circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for bruises and for those tiny broken blood vessels on my face! \\&quot;Sugar\\</li>
            <li>I have several autoimmune diseases some of which involve platelets, so I may be expecting too much of Dermal K.</li>
            <li>That spot is almost completely gone</li>
            <li>It is runny and I think that it is old.</li>
            <li>After several weeks of diligent application, I didn&#x27;t see any real change in the appearance of the veins.</li>
            <li>I bruise frequently</li>
            <li>I was enlightened by my twenty five year old daughter who loves this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve nearly finished the jar.  </li>
            <li>I found this product through a friend and have loved it ever since without fail.</li>
            <li>The bruise was completely gone in two weeks, but faded significantly after a few days (about 4) of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything over the past forty years available and this does it.</li>
            <li>Got major bruises around the eye after a surgery</li>
            <li>Use it daily to keep looking young!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen very little improvement over the use of three full jars.</li>
            <li>Works great for redness and small broken veins.  </li>
            <li>With daily use, this has helped clear up the Shamburg&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;really works to clear up the red vines.</li>
            <li>It was barely thicker than milk from the fridge.</li>
            <li>Remember ladies + gents that broken capillaries is caused by an accumulation of many things.</li>
            <li>forget that straining yourself during exercise and hot yoga also causes broken capillaries, take the right</li>
            <li>MedSpa places are not certified &amp; the trauma from the laser can actually cause more broken capillaries on the skin&#x27;s surface</li>
            <li>It works, the container lasts a long time and it helps my skin stay soft, too.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with under eye circles, as well as minor spider veins and I am only 30 years old.</li>

            <li> This product did absolutely nothing to help my bruises</li>
            <li> It reduces redness on my face and still feels very moist in the morning.</li>
            <li> Seems to really work to help minimize discoloring/bruising on my arms.  </li>
            <li> did not see much difference on skin</li>
            <li> but I really saw nothing but smoother skin.  </li>
            <li> I really do think it has helped with the pain/irritation.</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> This product works very well on bruises.  </li>
            <li> This cream does absolutely nothing for spider veins on legs.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stop the bruising, but I know they go away much quicker.  </li>
            <li> Really makes my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third 8 oz not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it works better for other skin types.</li>
            <li> It is better by comparing with other products used.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It seems to be working better than other creams I&#x27;ve used previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another spot I&#x27;ve been treating for the full three jars simply hasn&#x27;t changed at all.</li>
            <li> While this cream felt nice on my skin, it didn&#x27;t get rid of any of the small veins around my nose</li>
            <li> This cream was high priced and ineffective.</li>
            <li> Being Irish and 60+ years old I also have freckles and age spotted hands,these have faded significantly.</li>
            <li> In some places, the skin looks normal again.</li>
            <li> The bruises clear quickly with daily use.</li>
            <li> This worked great following a facelift, but I only used a small amount and no longer needed it.  </li>
            <li> It might just be a good moisturizer, I am not 100% sold on the fact they claim it gets rid of the spider like broken capillaries that I endured after my first (and last) microdemabrasion!</li>
            <li> These are not small scars-several in excess of 5\\&quot; and a 1/2 inch in width.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s harmless, but I&#x27;m not sure it helps at all.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> It did not work on age spots, bruises, light spider veins, or slightly aged skin (I&#x27;m 61, but have always looked younger than I really am).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype, completely untrue!</li>
            <li> I used a small amount of hers prior to purchasing my own jar of it.</li>
            <li> Make sure if you stand on your feet or sit down a lot you are spending those ten minute breaks taking a brisk walk or doing some stretches to promote circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for bruises and for those tiny broken blood vessels on my face! \\&quot;Sugar\\</li>
            <li> I have several autoimmune diseases some of which involve platelets, so I may be expecting too much of Dermal K.</li>
            <li> That spot is almost completely gone</li>
            <li> It is runny and I think that it is old.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of diligent application, I didn&#x27;t see any real change in the appearance of the veins.</li>
            <li> I bruise frequently</li>
            <li> I was enlightened by my twenty five year old daughter who loves this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve nearly finished the jar.  </li>
            <li> I found this product through a friend and have loved it ever since without fail.</li>
            <li> The bruise was completely gone in two weeks, but faded significantly after a few days (about 4) of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything over the past forty years available and this does it.</li>
            <li> Got major bruises around the eye after a surgery</li>
            <li> Use it daily to keep looking young!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen very little improvement over the use of three full jars.</li>
            <li> Works great for redness and small broken veins.  </li>
            <li> With daily use, this has helped clear up the Shamburg&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;really works to clear up the red vines.</li>
            <li> It was barely thicker than milk from the fridge.</li>
            <li> Remember ladies + gents that broken capillaries is caused by an accumulation of many things.</li>
            <li> forget that straining yourself during exercise and hot yoga also causes broken capillaries, take the right</li>
            <li> MedSpa places are not certified &amp; the trauma from the laser can actually cause more broken capillaries on the skin&#x27;s surface</li>
            <li> It works, the container lasts a long time and it helps my skin stay soft, too.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with under eye circles, as well as minor spider veins and I am only 30 years old.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I wish it had a higher percentage of vitamin k.  </li>
            <li> I have reason to believe that this cream helped clear up my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Anxious to see just how much improvement he might get by the end of a month.</li>
            <li> It really works can&#x27;t hardly see the spider veins.....</li>
            <li> After a fall, that resulted in leaving a black eye, within the  week of daily using Dermal K, the improvement was obvious and welcomed.&lt;br /&gt;Tricia</li>
            <li> I was using it to fade some dark spider veins on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> It also did nothing to fade dark leftover red marks from a mosquito bite, which you would think would fade a lot faster!</li>
            <li> This product really does diminish the redness and visibility of small veins, though only small ones.</li>
            <li> He is in remission but dark blotches on his forearms have been present since about 2007.</li>
            <li> It has had no significant impact on my forearm bruises and the subsequent brown spots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it did much to reduce small capillaries.</li>
            <li> used this cream twice a day faithfully until the jar was empty</li>
            <li> My container is almost empty, we will see if anything changes once i am done.  </li>
            <li> This product was not quite what I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t commit to continued regular use don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback I have is the price I find it to be very expensive, but it beats the price of laser treatments, so I will continue to purchase till I get the desired results (no more spots) and then use more sparingly as maintenance.</li>
            <li> I thought I might as well try applying Dermal-K to that rather than throw it away and after only a few days, the dark purple on the surface skin of the skin cleared up, although I could still see a darker area in the skin underneath.</li>
            <li> little can go a long way!</li>
            <li> I bruise easily due to RA and cortisone.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was exactly what I was looking for, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely high-priced moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> It did not take the small red spot under.my eye away.</li>
            <li> For instance, it is really helpful at improving the appearance of a pattern of veins on the inside of each knee, but where I have broken veins on the lower part of each shin, it has little or no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps with dark spots and discoloration.</li>
            <li> For something touted to work on dark spots and spider veins-</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now that my bruises are gone, I am using it as an under eye cream for dark circles.</li>
            <li> Vitamin K naturally improves broken capillaries on the skin.</li>
            <li> So there goes $30.00 down the drain.  </li>
            <li> If you are, the healing time is cut in half.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to believe it would make the spider veins less noticeable</li>
            <li> soaks in quickly is not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> I do like how it plumps up my skin a little</li>
            <li> Works a little slower than I&#x27;d hoped</li>
            <li> My spouse has very dark patches on both forearms.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about how my vein looked, but I really purchased the cream to try to alleviate the symptoms it was causing.</li>
            <li> The product, Dermal K, increases healing time of the broken blood vessels under the skin that produces red marks on the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I saw no improvement to my tiny broken capilaries on my face.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it doing anything to spider veins and, as far as I can see, no Vitamin K cream does anything for spider veins.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money bought this for my wife , pricey and ineffective.</li>
            <li> a few days before my subway incident.</li>
            <li> Remember broken capillaries will never go away, but they can fade from a darker color to a general lighter color hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> There is no listing of vitamin K strength, and I presume from slow response that it has little.</li>
            <li> You must use this product during morning and night routines EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> Also, take a small amount along on trips.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it&#x27;s quite expensive, but I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> recommend this product and any other vitamin k broken that has at least 5% vitamin k.</li>
            <li> There was no change at all with the broken capillaries or the dark circles that I also have.</li>
            <li> Think hard about your lifestyle and do some improvements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You must be diligent about applying this to bruises at least twice per day.  </li>
            <li> One spot that wasn&#x27;t very bad faded just a bit after using two jars&#x27; worth.</li>
            <li> He got these areas of discoloration after a serious bout of vasculitis.</li>
            <li> In fact, I had a spot on my leg that was a large cluster of spider veins which was very painful.  </li>
            <li> my small budget, this product is too expensive to use generously.</li>
            <li> I use it on my arms for broken blood vessels under the skin.</li>
            <li> I was using it for broken capillaries around my nose.</li>
            <li> No improvement in broken capillaries</li>
            <li> Broken capillaries are almost gone.</li>
            <li> ( This may have been an expensive vitamin K product that didnt work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not THAT expensive...</li>
            <li> This cream was fairly expensive and I took a chance ordering it.</li>
            <li> I found cream at a beauty supply store for 6 dollars which has truly reduced the rash to a mere shadow of what it once was.</li>
            <li> My husband has very thin skin</li>
            <li> It was expensive &amp; I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended taking horse chestnut but that just made me sick to my stomach.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this cream.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference at all.  :(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible formulation.  </li>
            <li> Worst s</li>
            <li> I had a nasty bruise on my arm from getting slammed into a pole on the subway.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Helps with dark spots and discoloration.</li>
            <li> Nice and clean transaction</li>
            <li> I used to use arnica gel for my easily-bruised skin, but someone mentioned that I try Vitamin K... This stuff works like a charm. Also, I feel like it helps the treated area from getting bruised.</li>
            <li> This stuff works...wish it worked on bruises faster though.</li>
            <li> The product description says it has 5% vitamin K, but there&#x27;s no indication that this is the case on the label, so who knows???  This is a nice llight cream, which smells fresh and nice.  I&#x27;m not sure it did much to reduce small capillaries.</li>
            <li> It is amazing in how it treats so many skin problems.</li>
            <li> This is the third product i have used that didnt work. I wanted my spider veins on my legs to be gone....I gave it 3 weeks and nothing...the veins never went away...I used it twice a day...I even used it on my rosacea spider vein spots on my face, nada there too:( This may have been an expensive vitamin K product that didnt work</li>
            <li> Dermal K is an excellent product. I use it on my arms for broken blood vessels under the skin. The product, Dermal K, increases healing time of the broken blood vessels under the skin that produces red marks on the skin.  The shipment of the product was almost immediate.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any results from this product.</li>
            <li> This worked great following a facelift, but I only used a small amount and no longer needed it.  I passed it on to a masseuse who had several clients who would benefit from it.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of of research regarding circulation. Vitamin K naturally improves broken capillaries on the skin. You must use this product during morning and night routines EVERYDAY! Remember broken capillaries will never go away, but they can fade from a darker color to a general lighter color hardly noticeable. Remember ladies + gents that broken capillaries is caused by an accumulation of many things. Make sure if you stand on your feet or sit down a lot you are spending those ten minute breaks taking a brisk walk or doing some stretches to promote circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little can go a long way! Don&#x27;t give up and if you do want to get a laser treatment (for those that want to spend that money) keep in mind MedSpa places are not certified &amp; the trauma from the laser can actually cause more broken capillaries on the skin&#x27;s surface (that&#x27;s when the laser people tell you that they need more sessions). Think hard about your lifestyle and do some improvements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and any other vitamin k broken that has at least 5% vitamin k. If it doesn&#x27;t contain enough vitamin k then its not going to make a difference. Do a little research and find out what is best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget that straining yourself during exercise and hot yoga also causes broken capillaries, take the right precautions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This is a superior product! I recently had surgery that left me with a 10\\&quot; scar. This was recomended by my Doctor to minimize the appearence of this. I tried it on older surgical scars,within 2 weeks they are almost unfindable! These are not small scars-several in excess of 5\\&quot; and a 1/2 inch in width. Being Irish and 60+ years old I also have freckles and age spotted hands,these have faded significantly. ( a friend asked if I had laser resurfacing).I have just re-ordered several jars.</li>
            <li> My husband has very thin skin and this was recommended by dr.    So glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Silky feel, absorbs quickly, helped fade a bruise quickly.  My spider veins are taking a while to fade, but they are fading, as promised.</li>
            <li> I have spider veins and sometimes I bruise easily. I have several autoimmune diseases some of which involve platelets, so I may be expecting too much of Dermal K. I have mixed views of it. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s harmless, but I&#x27;m not sure it helps at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this around my nose where I noticed blood veins on the surface of my skin. I think it is helping. Will see...</li>
            <li> Works great for redness and small broken veins.  Also seems to be making my facial liver spots disappear.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with my spider veins but it works great to accelerate bruise healing. I&#x27;ve tried competitors, this is the most effective for bruise healing.</li>
            <li> I was tkd that this cream fades your surgery scars of any scars and so that&#x27;s why I bought 2... Hope it works.</li>
            <li> Great for bruises and for those tiny broken blood vessels on my face! \\&quot;Sugar\\&quot; gave a sample to me. It worked a lot better than arnica gel for my bruises. I ordered a larger jar from Amazon, and it came rith away.</li>
            <li> I was using it for broken capillaries around my nose. I do like how it plumps up my skin a little but I think thats from the dimethicone which isn&#x27;t a healthy thing to use. No improvement in broken capillaries</li>
            <li> Horrible formulation.  It was barely thicker than milk from the fridge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried similar products that didn&#x27;t work at all so I  didn&#x27;t really have much hope that this would do much either.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!  I&#x27;ve almost finished my first jar and my spider veins are almost gone.  In fact, I had a spot on my leg that was a large cluster of spider veins which was very painful.  That spot is almost completely gone and so is the pain.  My varicose veins did not respond as well but I&#x27;m still very happy with the results since my main issue is spider veins anyway.</li>
            <li> My mother has Shamburg&#x27;s on her feet and legs.  With daily use, this has helped clear up the Shamburg&#x27;s.  It will not permanently go away, but it does seem to help better than steroid creams prescribed by her Dr.</li>
            <li> was anticipating so much with this product .  I bruise easily due to RA and cortisone.  This product did absolutely nothing to help my bruises</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this cream. For something touted to work on dark spots and spider veins- I&#x27;ve seen very little improvement over the use of three full jars. I was using it to fade some dark spider veins on the back of my legs. One spot that wasn&#x27;t very bad faded just a bit after using two jars&#x27; worth. Another spot I&#x27;ve been treating for the full three jars simply hasn&#x27;t changed at all. It also did nothing to fade dark leftover red marks from a mosquito bite, which you would think would fade a lot faster! I did only apply it once a day, after a shower, when my pores were open and my skin was moist. The instructions indicate a twice a day usage, so perhaps that might factor in. But over the use of that much product, it should have worked better. I&#x27;m a brunette with very fair skin and absolutely no tan, so I do show marks and veins quite noticeably. Perhaps it works better for other skin types.</li>
            <li> It is runny and I think that it is old. There is no date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended it and that I should buy it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor choic. I would like a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> used this cream twice a day faithfully until the jar was empty and I saw no improvement to my tiny broken capilaries on my face.  The cream smells god and didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> This does about as good a job as the Reviva Vitamin K cream (2% Vitamin K) even though it claims to be 4% Vitamin K.  But why quibble?  The cost comes out to about the same and it will erase bruises about twice as quickly as they would go away naturally -- maybe even faster if you use it more than once a day!  I was skeptical about it doing anything to spider veins and, as far as I can see, no Vitamin K cream does anything for spider veins.  Maybe some smaller ones but I will believe it when I see it!</li>
            <li> Who knows if it really works, but it is light and has a light fragrance that dissipated quickly. I guess it&#x27;s worth a try.  My container is almost empty, we will see if anything changes once i am done.  It might just be a good moisturizer, I am not 100% sold on the fact they claim it gets rid of the spider like broken capillaries that I endured after my first (and last) microdemabrasion! It&#x27;s not THAT expensive... give it a try</li>
            <li> This product was not quite what I expected it to be.  I did not see the promised results.  The price was agreeable.</li>
            <li> Love this cream for healing bruises quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third 8 oz not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> I thought this was exactly what I was looking for, but I was wrong. The only thing it did was soften my skin, like any cream would do. It did not work on age spots, bruises, light spider veins, or slightly aged skin (I&#x27;m 61, but have always looked younger than I really am). I used it on the back of my hands, my legs, my face, and my arm. I was very disappointed and will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I have actually used it before and was happy to see that Amazon carries it at such a good price.  The one catch to the product is that it is important to use it every day and though it improves the appearance somewhat, it is not going to magically make the spider veins vanish.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for spider veins or bruises so I can&#x27;t comment on that. It does make my skin so soft and has made my face more even toned. Only use at night.  It reduces redness on my face and still feels very moist in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product really does diminish the redness and visibility of small veins, though only small ones. It seems to work better in some places on my skin than others. For instance, it is really helpful at improving the appearance of a pattern of veins on the inside of each knee, but where I have broken veins on the lower part of each shin, it has little or no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my small budget, this product is too expensive to use generously.</li>
            <li> I have looked and looked for a cream to help with the purple blotches that are called senile purpura. The only thing that clears them up is time.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try reducing spider veins on my face and legs. After several weeks of diligent application, I didn&#x27;t see any real change in the appearance of the veins. A couple weeks later, I fell and had a huge, purple bruise on my leg. I thought I might as well try applying Dermal-K to that rather than throw it away and after only a few days, the dark purple on the surface skin of the skin cleared up, although I could still see a darker area in the skin underneath. At this price though, I&#x27;ll let most bruises clear up on their own.</li>
            <li> It really works can&#x27;t hardly see the spider veins.....I would recommend it to the women with this problem.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely high-priced moisturizing cream.  It has had no significant impact on my forearm bruises and the subsequent brown spots.  I used it twice daily for more than one month.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great, same as always!</li>
            <li> This is a really good skin cream. I bought my first 2oz jar at the local pharmacy, but they didn&#x27;t have any more when I ran out. I found a 4oz jar online at a really good price. It arrived very quickly from Dixie Health.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt better, it definitely is something I will continue to buy. The cream makes my face feel refreshed .</li>
            <li> This cream was fairly expensive and I took a chance ordering it. I have Lupus which can create a wolf face rash- which does not go away. I was hoping that this cream would help with the redness, per the reviews. There was no change at all with the broken capillaries or the dark circles that I also have. I found cream at a beauty supply store for 6 dollars which has truly reduced the rash to a mere shadow of what it once was. This cream was high priced and ineffective.</li>
            <li> My spouse has very dark patches on both forearms. Dermal-K seems to be minimizing the look. In some places, the skin looks normal again.He&#x27;s only been using for about 2 weeks 2 times a day. Anxious to see just how much improvement he might get by the end of a month. He got these areas of discoloration after a serious bout of vasculitis. He is in remission but dark blotches on his forearms have been present since about 2007. I&#x27;m encouraged by this cream to reduce and eliminate these patches</li>
            <li> This product is the only dermatological agent that controls my rosacea. I&#x27;ve used everything over the past forty years available and this does it.</li>
            <li> Seems to really work to help minimize discoloring/bruising on my arms.  I think it&#x27;s worth the $ $ for me.</li>
            <li> Stuff made me break out and gave me zits galore.  Didnt work for spider veins or reddness. Don&#x27;t waste your money. People suck misleading others. Worst s*** ever.</li>
            <li> I find this the greatest cream for speeding the fading of bruises and always keep it on hand just for the occasional one.  Also, take a small amount along on trips.</li>
            <li> I bruise easily and this cream really helps me.</li>
            <li> did not see much difference on skin</li>
            <li> You must be diligent about applying this to bruises at least twice per day.  If you are, the healing time is cut in half.  I bruise frequently and this is a problem in the summer time.  This cream enabled me to put on a bathing suit during my vacation without large bruises on my legs.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without a jar.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to help spider veins with this product. Forget it.  I have tried it twice.  Once years ago and again later.  I used it diligently and it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort each time.  I wanted to believe it would make the spider veins less noticeable but I really saw nothing but smoother skin.  When I read the claims I now say - yeah right! Might be good on bruises but not for those spider veins.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with under eye circles, as well as minor spider veins and I am only 30 years old. I found this product through a friend and have loved it ever since without fail. It must be used daily (I use it in the evenings more heavily and only lightly in the mornings) but works quickly and continues to work more over time as well. It&#x27;s amazing what it can do without any surgery!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. I could have use any cream and paid $5. and gotten the same results. Don&#x27;t believe the hype, completely untrue!</li>
            <li> I just started using it.  But, I&#x27;ve read that if you have spider veins it will reduce the appearance of them!</li>
            <li> This works well but you have to use it religiously and keep using it. If you can&#x27;t commit to continued regular use don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have reason to believe that this cream helped clear up my dark circles.  Got major bruises around the eye after a surgery and they wouldn&#x27;t go away for months.  Started using this and began clearing up in a couple weeks.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s causation or correlation, though.  Anybody who has a tissue healing disorder should consider this (check with your doctor first).</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the great reviews. I bought it because I have a deep varicose vein in my leg that started causing pain. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about how my vein looked, but I really purchased the cream to try to alleviate the symptoms it was causing. I haven&#x27;t noticed a sizeable difference in the vein, however, after 2 months of use (2 times a day) I haven&#x27;t had any days where I had to get off my feet and ice my leg/vein (after using it for 2 weeks).  My doctor recommended taking horse chestnut but that just made me sick to my stomach.  It hasn&#x27;t worked miracles for reducing the appearance, but I&#x27;m also not dealing with spider veins.  I really do think it has helped with the pain/irritation. The jar was much bigger than I expected too, so that was a pleasant surprise! If you&#x27;re on the fence...I&#x27;d go for it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money bought this for my wife , pricey and ineffective.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works a little slower than I&#x27;d hoped but it&#x27;s working. Feels good on the skin without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I had my legs done by laser for spider veins, and thought this would help what the laser did not.  After using it faithfully for 4 weeks (day and night applications) I saw no difference at all.  :(</li>
            <li> Great product. Very helpful. Great services. Thank you guys!</li>
            <li> This one provides a more noticeable relief more quickly for varicose veins. Only downside is that it&#x27;s quite expensive, but I guess sometimes you get what you pay for. I&#x27;d pay more for a cream that could get rid of them altogether, but I probably couldn&#x27;t afford it if it exists.</li>
            <li> This product works very well on bruises.  This is my second order for this so it sure works for me.</li>
            <li> I find Dermal K to be an effective treatment for bruises on my hands. The bruises clear quickly with daily use. The cream is not &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and applies easily.</li>
            <li> I used this product over 10 years ago. I noticed some spider veins and decided to see if it was still available. Very happy to find the product is the same I use years ago and still works! Works great around ankles and on legs. Be sure you read the instructions. Skin should be moist when the cream is applied for best results.</li>
            <li> It works, the container lasts a long time and it helps my skin stay soft, too. Prompt delivery, fragrance-free and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> It is better by comparing with other products used.&lt;br /&gt;The spider veins on my face fade away.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I was enlightened by my twenty five year old daughter who loves this product. I used a small amount of hers prior to purchasing my own jar of it. I love the way it feels on my face. It is not at all greasy. It absorbs into my skin quickly. My skin feels like silk after using. Perfect under makeup.</li>
            <li> This very light and moisturing cream is helpful in fading bruises.  After a fall, that resulted in leaving a black eye, within the  week of daily using Dermal K, the improvement was obvious and welcomed.&lt;br /&gt;Tricia</li>
            <li> After running out of Dermal-K I used several supposedly similar products before I finally reordered Dermal-K. So good to have this wonderful soothing cream back on my daily regiment. Best facial cream. Nothing compares.</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes on easily and really helps reduce the redness of Rosecea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face for spider viens for about 6 months  and it&lt;br /&gt;really works to clear up the red vines. I like the product and it works for me!</li>
            <li> Dermal-k Clarifying Cream started fading my bruises from the first time I used it.  But, I am waiting for it to work on my spider veins.</li>
            <li> I see improvement...soaks in quickly is not at all greasy. Broken capillaries are almost gone. No breakouts either</li>
            <li> It did not take the small red spot under.my eye away. It was expensive &amp; I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Use it daily to keep looking young!</li>
            <li> This has been THE BEST weapon against rosacea!  Twice a day, and it keeps my skin moisturized, too.</li>
            <li> I had a nasty bruise on my arm from getting slammed into a pole on the subway. It was probably the size of a baseball and deep purple. I ordered this a couple of days after I got the bruise, and put it on several times a day. The bruise was completely gone in two weeks, but faded significantly after a few days (about 4) of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bruise easily, and had a bruise on my leg from running into a desk (ouch!) a few days before my subway incident. I chose not to put this on my leg, just to see if it worked. The bruise on my leg went away about a week after the one on my arm, and faded significantly slower. So, I&#x27;ll call the cream a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my bruises are gone, I am using it as an under eye cream for dark circles. It seems to be working better than other creams I&#x27;ve used previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish it had a higher percentage of vitamin k.  I think it would have been more effective if it had.</li>
            <li> While this cream felt nice on my skin, it didn&#x27;t get rid of any of the small veins around my nose and I&#x27;ve nearly finished the jar.  I applied it on a damp face and massaged it in as instructed.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.  This cream does absolutely nothing for spider veins on legs.  I mentioned getting this to my MD. She laughed.. So there goes $30.00 down the drain.  Save your money!</li>
            <li> I just bought this approx. a month ago and have used it two times a day faithfully, I have some dark spots on my legs and the spots are wonderfully fading!! I feeling good about using this for the safety factors vs bleaching creams. The only drawback I have is the price I find it to be very expensive, but it beats the price of laser treatments, so I will continue to purchase till I get the desired results (no more spots) and then use more sparingly as maintenance. Good working product, good smell, happy customer.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream to get rid of bruises.</li>
            <li> sleeper for T zone type skin great product.</li>
            <li> There is no listing of vitamin K strength, and I presume from slow response that it has little. The fragrance is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vita K Solution is faster and more effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to see if it would help with the age spots and easy bruising on my forearms.  It doesn&#x27;t stop the bruising, but I know they go away much quicker.  Really makes my skin feel smoother.</li>
