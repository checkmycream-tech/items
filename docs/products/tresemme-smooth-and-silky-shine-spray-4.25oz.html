            <li>and it&#x27;ll be perfect.</li>
            <li>but this one seems to the best job.  </li>
            <li>but I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling/looking greasy.</li>
            <li>The control of the hair is good.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair shiny and looking good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky and by the end of the day, you can&#x27;t tell it was on your hair.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, leaves your hair shining.</li>
            <li>It smells very good and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Try it at a lower heat setting, it will set better, and give you great, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I love the spray!</li>
            <li>I really love this shine spray!</li>
            <li>So glad for amazon!</li>
            <li>It gives the hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li>good product love it, does everything it says it does.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy more Tresemme products!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and does exactly what it says!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and gives my hair a lot of shine-- no grease and no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>But whatever color you have, it will smooth and add a nice shine to your hair, set off from the heat of your styler.</li>
            <li>Most anti-frizz products are a serum or cream that you must rub on with your hands.</li>
            <li>It does control most of the frizz when applied to damp hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing for fly aways.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It is a light liquid, NOT a serum!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t prevent static, which is what I had hoped.</li>
            <li>it is easy to spray.</li>
            <li>I have fine gray hair that is thinning and out of control without some hair product.  </li>
            <li>I have really fine blond hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is always so smooth and silky afterwards.</li>
            <li>I ordered two bottles of TRESemme&#x27; Shine Spray Smooth &amp; Silky.</li>
            <li>i really enjoy this product</li>
            <li>Tresemme Smooth &amp; Silky Shine Spray does not compare to Frizz Ease shine spray.</li>
            <li>This is a light weight, non-greasy spray that makes my hair super shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of anti-frizz products</li>
            <li>I give my hair a quick spray and if fixes it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spritz on a fine spray of 4-6 pumps on my wet hair, let air dry and hair turns out GREAT and really nice.  </li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair.</li>
            <li>If you use too high of a heat, as with any shine product, and the oils in them, it will kind of &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; just know that your heat styling product, is probably set too high.</li>
            <li>It shows up so much more on light hair, than dark.</li>
            <li>I wish that it held style a little better - I find myself using some on damp hair, then more after hair is dry, but for the price, that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>My hair is pretty dry and becomes frizzy easily.</li>
            <li>I expected much more from Tresemme.  </li>
            <li>much in 1 area can make the hair look damp though.</li>
            <li>Ship time was amazingly fast and product was well protected.</li>
            <li>me - I got through this stuff reeeaaally fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Moroccan oil that makes your hair/ weave soft I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I bought this on clearance and since then can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I live in GA so you can imagine how frizzy hair can get in the humidity.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this thinking it would help with the frizz and baby hairs on the top of my head, instead it&#x27;s just really oily and hard to work with.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>Although I generally like TRESemme products, I much prefer the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>, It does have a slight drying affect on the hair which is not something that works for me, but as for adding shine and making the hair smooth and silky it does do as it states.</li>
            <li>no matter how little I use of Tres Semme #7 strength that should be lowest hold available.  </li>
            <li>If I use it sparingly enough to avoid the greasiness then I don&#x27;t get much shine.</li>
            <li>I hope they don&#x27;t ever completely stop making this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>You need to hold the bottle pretty far away from your head or else you will have greasy and wet looking spots.</li>
            <li>Anything else I&#x27;ve ever used either hasn&#x27;t made my hair shiny or it left it feeling sticky, so I highly recommend this spray.</li>
            <li>This Spray is so light and non-fragrant you can use it several times a day without fear of sticky hair ot stiff hair or scent.  </li>
            <li>One of the bottles was not closed and about 1/4 of the contents was in the package, not the bottle.</li>
            <li>It leaves a litte sheen, just enough to look natural and helps the hair to brush into waves or curls between shampoos or trips to the beauty</li>
            <li>I have thick, frizzy hair and it makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be like on thin, fine hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be like on thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> apparently did not hold far enough away from my hair as my hair was &#x27;gummy&#x27; ... too hard to create enough distance with arms and without spraying all over surrounding things.</li>
            <li> Another problem is this product has alcohol in it which in the long run will likely dry out the hair even further.</li>
            <li> Not only does the product not give hair any extra shine, but it makes it extremely greasy and flat no matter now</li>
            <li> The hair also still feels dry to the touch and not soft as you would expect.</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> This protects my ends which tend to dry out.</li>
            <li> My fingers just glide through my hair while I dry it after putting this stuff on.</li>
            <li> , if my hair starts to feel a little dry later in the day.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got blonde hair, so the strands are thin (as opposed to brown or black hair where the follicles are much thicker) and it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I wash my hair no matter what other products I use as well.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to spray it too close to your hair or else it will become somewhat greasy, mist it all over about half an arms distance away</li>
            <li> I also have long, thick hair - but I use about a bottle a week.</li>
            <li> little you use.  </li>
            <li> and I use the product after the shower on towel dried hair before I blowdry.</li>
            <li> I use about 4-5 pumps when my hair is towel dried after the shower and comb through.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore, so I bought a few of them online.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> I wanted something like this - hold style without heavy oily look and feel and without crunchy hairspray.  </li>
            <li> The spray nozzle on this product is messy and I feel like my hand is covered in shine spray every time I use it, even after just one mist.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for anyone with thin and/or frizzy hair who needs it to be tamed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing these in bulk online since it&#x27;s near impossible to find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, too.  </li>
            <li> I have medium to thin hair</li>
            <li> It was quite useless!</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I buy this product all the time and I really love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and find that it keeps my hair smoother in our high-humidity area.</li>
            <li> I bought this on clearance and since then can&#x27;t live without it.  They have modified the label on the product and I saw it both as No Frizz and Shine Spray with no frizz in smaller letters below.  I have fine gray hair that is thinning and out of control without some hair product.  Mousse is greasy no matter how little I use of Tres Semme #7 strength that should be lowest hold available.  I spritz on a fine spray of 4-6 pumps on my wet hair, let air dry and hair turns out GREAT and really nice.  One reviewer said this is a greasy product...............no way Jose when I use it and I know greasy when I experience it</li>
            <li> I have really fine blond hair. The last thing we want with blond hair, are ends that look frizzed in humid weather. It shows up so much more on light hair, than dark. But whatever color you have, it will smooth and add a nice shine to your hair, set off from the heat of your styler. If you use too high of a heat, as with any shine product, and the oils in them, it will kind of &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; just know that your heat styling product, is probably set too high. Try it at a lower heat setting, it will set better, and give you great, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product.  I expected much more from Tresemme.  Not only does the product not give hair any extra shine, but it makes it extremely greasy and flat no matter now little you use.  I have thick hair, too.  I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be like on thin, fine hair.  Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Most anti-frizz products are a serum or cream that you must rub on with your hands. I love the spray! I have thick, frizzy hair and it makes my hair smooth and shiny. I use it on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is a light weight, non-greasy spray that makes my hair super shiny.  Anything else I&#x27;ve ever used either hasn&#x27;t made my hair shiny or it left it feeling sticky, so I highly recommend this spray.</li>
            <li> I do like this product. It does control most of the frizz when applied to damp hair. The control of the hair is good. It gives the hair a nice shine. I use it on a daily basis. I would recommend this product to anyone with frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I would not repurchase this again. My hair is pretty dry and becomes frizzy easily. I have straight fine hair. When you spray it, it does seem to initially add shine and gets rif of some frizz but if you brush your hair it gets frizzy again. The hair also still feels dry to the touch and not soft as you would expect. Another problem is this product has alcohol in it which in the long run will likely dry out the hair even further.</li>
            <li> This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s very light and gives my hair a lot of shine-- no grease and no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Too much in 1 area can make the hair look damp though. I love it and will continue to buy more Tresemme products!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, I have been using it for years. I have medium to thin hair and I use the product after the shower on towel dried hair before I blowdry. I use anywhere from 6 to 10 sprays and brush it through. My hair is always so smooth and silky afterwards. Just be careful not to spray it too close to your hair or else it will become somewhat greasy, mist it all over about half an arms distance away and it&#x27;ll be perfect.</li>
            <li> I really love this shine spray! I use about 4-5 pumps when my hair is towel dried after the shower and comb through. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling/looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles of TRESemme&#x27; Shine Spray Smooth &amp; Silky. When the order arrived, the contents were awash in shine spray. One of the bottles was not closed and about 1/4 of the contents was in the package, not the bottle. Accidents happen. A bit of a turn for quality control would have avoided this happening.</li>
            <li> This Spray is so light and non-fragrant you can use it several times a day without fear of sticky hair ot stiff hair or scent.  It leaves a litte sheen, just enough to look natural and helps the hair to brush into waves or curls between shampoos or trips to the beauty shop.&lt;br /&gt;I came to Florida for a visit without my TRESemme, thinking to buy a bottle but could not find it in a shop and had to purchase another product which called itself &amp;#34;shine spray&amp;#34;.  It was not the same!  It was quite useless!</li>
            <li> I live in GA so you can imagine how frizzy hair can get in the humidity.  This spray helps a lot!  I have a drawer full of anti-frizz products but this one seems to the best job.  I gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t yet found perfection in the anti-frizz department but I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a refill order. Ship time was amazingly fast and product was well protected. I use this product every time I wash my hair no matter what other products I use as well.  This protects my ends which tend to dry out. Keeps my hair shiny and looking good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Moroccan oil that makes your hair/ weave soft I like it very much. It smells very good and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> apparently did not hold far enough away from my hair as my hair was &#x27;gummy&#x27; ... too hard to create enough distance with arms and without spraying all over surrounding things.</li>
            <li> This is just so-so. Definitely adds some shine, but tends to make my hair seem greasy if I spray enough to get the shine I want. If I use it sparingly enough to avoid the greasiness then I don&#x27;t get much shine. Although I generally like TRESemme products, I much prefer the [[ASIN:B000NOFZTY Garnier Fructis Style Brilliantine Shine Glossing Spray, 3 Fluid Ounce]].</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it would help with the frizz and baby hairs on the top of my head, instead it&#x27;s just really oily and hard to work with. Does absolutely nothing for fly aways.</li>
            <li> This item complies with condicones Information. In terms of price and quality is acceptable. I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky and by the end of the day, you can&#x27;t tell it was on your hair.</li>
            <li> good product love it, does everything it says it does. it is easy to spray. i really enjoy this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only no-frizz spray that&#x27;s compatible with my hair. I&#x27;ve got blonde hair, so the strands are thin (as opposed to brown or black hair where the follicles are much thicker) and it does not weigh my hair down. I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore, so I bought a few of them online. It is a light liquid, NOT a serum!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Despite googling where I could purchase it locally no stores carried it. So glad for amazon!</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference in my hair as I spray it on while blow drying. My fingers just glide through my hair while I dry it after putting this stuff on. I&#x27;ve been purchasing these in bulk online since it&#x27;s near impossible to find it in stores anymore. I hope they don&#x27;t ever completely stop making this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if my hair starts to feel a little dry later in the day.....I give my hair a quick spray and if fixes it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me - I got through this stuff reeeaaally fast. I wash my hair everyday and I use a lot of product. I also have long, thick hair - but I use about a bottle a week.</li>
            <li> I wanted something like this - hold style without heavy oily look and feel and without crunchy hairspray.  I wish that it held style a little better - I find myself using some on damp hair, then more after hair is dry, but for the price, that&#x27;s okay.  It doesn&#x27;t prevent static, which is what I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Tresemme Smooth &amp; Silky Shine Spray does not compare to Frizz Ease shine spray. The spray nozzle on this product is messy and I feel like my hand is covered in shine spray every time I use it, even after just one mist. You need to hold the bottle pretty far away from your head or else you will have greasy and wet looking spots. Would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> It is a good product, leaves your hair shining.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations but I dont think I would personally purchase it again, It does have a slight drying affect on the hair which is not something that works for me, but as for adding shine and making the hair smooth and silky it does do as it states.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and does exactly what it says!  Definitely recommend for anyone with thin and/or frizzy hair who needs it to be tamed.</li>
