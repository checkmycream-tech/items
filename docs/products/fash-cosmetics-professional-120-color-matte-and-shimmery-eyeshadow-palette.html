            <li>Great product, so many bright colors!</li>
            <li>The Palette came in impeccable condition and the colors are gorgeous.   </li>
            <li>The colors are really bright</li>
            <li>I adore all of the bright colors.</li>
            <li>im just not that good at eyeshadow yet</li>
            <li>Bought this for myself about 6 months ago and loved it, so I bought one as a Xmas gift.</li>
            <li>The brushes are good quality but also think they should be numbered.  </li>
            <li>all my classmates loved it and asked where I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I think that is why you get good pay off.</li>
            <li>I loved the price on the 120 palette and the quality.</li>
            <li>This palette arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be a good deal.</li>
            <li>The colors just don&#x27;t look good on me and don&#x27;t look like they did on the palette like they did on my eyes.</li>
            <li>But still a good deal.</li>
            <li>Also, The blacks and silvers are gorgeous when it comes to doing a smokey eye.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend and she loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>I arrive in perfect condition, very pigmented product of very good quality, very pleased with the purchase, I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I loved this super bright colors !!</li>
            <li>This palette has proven to be extremely suitable for this and is also great to use as eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>I love the fash eyeshadow beautiful colors</li>
            <li>The colors are even more beautiful in person.</li>
            <li>I am not a master of makeup but after buying this product I surely will be watching some YouTube tutorials to make sure that I make the best use of it.</li>
            <li>but Im sure it will be great also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will be purchasing again...</li>
            <li>We were very pleased with all of the color selections.</li>
            <li>THIS IS AMAZING , I LOVED THIS PRODUCT AND EVERY COLOR</li>
            <li>Darker colors are great but lighter/brighter ones need more than one or two coats.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the price also</li>

            <li>Im glad I got this palette!</li>

            <li>They arrived in excellent condition and very timely.  </li>
            <li>Everything came nice and neat.</li>
            <li>Waterproof though, so you better have a good makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Came in a nice case, and wrap to protect it.</li>
            <li>Sooo the colors are really nice, instead all color</li>

            <li>The colors are fantastic and her artwork looks amazing!</li>
            <li>Very pleased and considering the neutrals palette from FASH, which is probably more eyeshadow than I&#x27;ll use in a lifetime. ^_^</li>
            <li>The colours are bright and easily applied.</li>
            <li>is pretty good!</li>
            <li>But, it is very good quality, beautiful collor, very pigmented (really!).</li>
            <li>They do no look cheap or tacky, good quality item.</li>
            <li>So far Fash has impressed me with the quality in their products and I will continue to buy from them again.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and there is so much variety!</li>
            <li>I ordered this a while ago, but I wanted to make sure I liked it before giving a review.  </li>

            <li>It has a great selection of colors and arrived in a pretty timely fashion.</li>
            <li>Had issues with item, case is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The colours are vibrant and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The pallet itself is beautiful, sturdy and the colors look just as vibrant in person as they do in the photos.</li>
            <li>Beautiful vibrant colors I love it</li>
            <li>Huge varity of colors and shades!</li>
            <li>There were so many colors and also it was cheap!</li>
            <li>It was okay, thought it was going to better quality</li>
            <li>but i think they need to find a better way to ship there product so that they dont get damage.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many many brands.</li>
            <li>Honestly I didn&#x27;t see any difference quality wise only price wise for sure.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell that some of the colors were shimmery and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I am an eyeshadow enthusiast of all makeup I tend to buy eye products the most as I believe they make the most impact.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s $14 more than when i bought it, and i bought it using a gift card,</li>
            <li>but I was able to repair.</li>
            <li>This palette is basically the equivalent of the BH Cosmetics 120 palette except there are a mixture of matte and glitter shadows which i love.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these shadows.</li>
            <li>Now, about the quality, it&#x27;s beyond the price, even though some colors are way more pigmented than others.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>if i ever need to. :)</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the handling of the package.</li>

            <li>Some of the colors aren&#x27;t as bright or intense as I&#x27;d like when applied, but most of them that I&#x27;ve tried look lovely.</li>
            <li>For the price, the quality seems good and there is such a huge color selection I think it will keep her happy for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I so far have made my eyes like a beautiful peacock feather and got tons of compliments.</li>
            <li>The colors are so vivid and applies great to your eyes.</li>
            <li>Why pay more for individual eye shadow if you can get a great selection for an outstanding price  : )  </li>

            <li>I love this palette, it has all the colors that i need, its worth it,</li>
            <li>A fantastic buy I recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li>I say anyone who is experienced in makeup and looking for a more \\&quot;wide ranged\\&quot; variety, or someone who is learning to apply multi toned shades, this is a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li>but when applied it looks light.</li>
            <li>Great product overall though.</li>
            <li>this item was worth your money...... :)</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this palette.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy having this eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>Really cheap for the amount of colors you get.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth and stays put for hours.  </li>
            <li>The colors are FABULOUS</li>
            <li>I have played with different looks using the palette and even without primer the color payoff is still great.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Very Happy that my money was spent on something worth</li>

            <li>I am a very colorful person and you are too then</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be good make up,  true to its color etc.</li>
            <li>Its good quality the only thing is that it has a strong chemical smell .but</li>
            <li>so worth it!</li>
            <li>We all love the vibrant and bold colors, the ease of application and most of all the price can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>Many people thought it was a higher end eyeshadows when I had applied it with a primer/base.</li>
            <li>I try it on and its totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>Love the colors, smooth, and soft :).</li>
            <li>Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li>FASH eye shadows came packaged pretty ok.</li>
            <li>This was my first makeup palette, and I love everything about it.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, I also have three reds in my palette that work pretty well, but need time to be layered to look stunning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite eyeshadow palette that I&#x27;ve ordered so far. :)</li>
            <li>I just love this product I mix up the different colors to make my own.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled when I got my package a bit early!</li>
            <li>Ladies, if you are a makeup person like I am, I eyeshadow is right on the dollar!</li>
            <li>Wow, this palette is amazing.</li>
            <li>Another thing that bothered me more than the chip was that the pictures aren&#x27;t quite true to what you&#x27;re really getting.</li>
            <li>Colors are bright and last all day..</li>
            <li>I love the colors and they blend really well.</li>
            <li>Seems good until i come back to this page and holy C**P!</li>
            <li>I love this pallet so much.</li>
            <li>It is very compact-friendly and cute.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter bought this with her own money</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s some nice natural colors.</li>
            <li>but mine was very well handled I will be buying this again :) for christmas gifts</li>
            <li>Purchased for my teenage daughter and she has loved it.</li>
            <li>This product thus far is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re some makeup enthusiast with little money looking for bright colors, this is your product!</li>
            <li>The pigmentation of the shadows is pretty good, and with primer, or NYx&#x27;s milk on your lids, they sit well and stay pretty vibrant</li>
            <li>Other than that I think it is great</li>
            <li>other than that I was happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>great shadow for the price the imagination and color combos are endless</li>
            <li>I also like how quickly they were sent to me and how the company puts the ingredients of the shadow on the box (not the palette but the box).</li>
            <li>love the vibrant colors and the quality of the shadows</li>
            <li>I love the coastal scents pallets and thought I&#x27;d try FASH since the colors looked so vibrant in the pictures.</li>
            <li>it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I have several blues and greens, which is okay, but I wish there weren&#x27;t so many.  </li>
            <li>They blends super well and with this  </li>
            <li>and it came in quick like 3 days.</li>
            <li>Colors are just as they seem bold or shimmery.</li>
            <li>The case comes with 2 eyeshadow palletes stacked one on top of the other and the top palette is not that easy to remove so</li>
            <li>I actually bought these for nail designing, but liked them so much, I&#x27;m using them for my eyes as well. :-)</li>
            <li>These colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Every day she is trying to come up with new ways to creatively combine the colors.</li>
            <li>and since I first bought it I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with my shadows (except one which is my fault because my brush was still wet from the brush cleaner</li>
            <li>I love the colors and very hapy whit the product, soo pretty and usefull 100% recomemended.</li>
            <li>The Colors selection is great they really pop and are easy to apply long lasting better than sephora pallet also</li>
            <li>I def would recommend this palette more for those who are either learning to apply make up and would like to learn what colors works best for them or if not a starting make up artist with a small budget.</li>
            <li>this eyeshadow are very pigmented and colorfull!!</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and they last a long time , no need to go out and spend 50, 60 dollars on MAC or another trendy make-up line.</li>
            <li>I will say that a few of the lighter colors need a couple of coats, but otherwise, I found these to be great.</li>
            <li>Its Sooo Worth it.</li>
            <li>Well this eyeshadow rivals my love of MAC, cheaper and sooooo soft, I am so picky about eyeshadow&#x27;s and these have won me over.</li>
            <li>it is a beginner - intermediate palette and also worth it if you are just learning a technique</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It arrived in perfect condition, nothing broken.  </li>
            <li>love it beatiful colors, arrived early</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best quality of eyeshadow, but you don&#x27;t pay much for them and the colors at least show up well.</li>
            <li>Came in perfect condition,no broken shadows.</li>
            <li>worth 25?</li>
            <li>It is so colorful</li>
            <li>Once unwrapping the eye shadows themselves, there is a clear plastic sheet on top of both pannels.</li>
            <li>Inside came PERFECT nothing broken.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before ordering this palette and I was not at all surprised when I fell in love with it right away.</li>
            <li>I bought them for Halloween because I needed several colors, but I know I&#x27;ll get much more use out of it than originally intended.  </li>
            <li>No palettes where broken, which is great!!!&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product and the colors are very poppy! :)</li>
            <li>They add the right touch needed for my modeling gigs as well as for a night out.</li>
            <li>We used it right away.</li>
            <li>Not a bad choice for my first time purchasing a palette, would definately recommend to others who are first time users with cosmetics.</li>
            <li>wit no regrets :)</li>
            <li>The glittery eyeshadows in the palette are glittery all the way through, there&#x27;s even a gorgeous glitter black color, greens, purples, blues.</li>
            <li>You can also achieve various looks which is great if you don&#x27;t have a lot of money to buy individual shadows.</li>
            <li>This palette is amazing in every single way.</li>
            <li>AND THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and well packaged..</li>

            <li>;)</li>
            <li>an this is the second pallette ive boutghn. :)</li>
            <li>When I first bought it and tested the matte shades on my fingers</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong on this one, it stays on all day the colors are awesome.</li>
            <li>the eyeshaows are EXACTLY like the picture</li>
            <li>The pigments of the shadows are awesome but most of the shadows broke or popped out the palette :( ..</li>
            <li>There are more than enough colors to match anything in my wardrobe.</li>
            <li>and i love it however when i opened the package too colors were mixed</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and also comes on really pretty and shows.</li>
            <li>Some are more of a flat color while others have a shimmer to them.  </li>
            <li>This palette has a wonderfully wide selection of color, and the quality is great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Its was nicely packaged, nothing was broken, i love it.</li>
            <li>very good product, came very fast and was in great condition only one eyeshadow was a little broken</li>
            <li>I like the colors very much but the packaging needs much improvement.</li>
            <li>Nice assortment for my dark skin tone.</li>
            <li>the colors are very pigmented and i love the variety, and they last well and dont fade too much in brightness thru the night.</li>
            <li>I use them every day because eyeshadow is the main make-up item that I really like to have fun with.</li>
            <li>Very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>The only drawback to this product is that it seems not to stay on, all day and/or it fades...especially if you&#x27;re someone who sweats easily, in the face or has oily skin.</li>
            <li>These colors are very vibrant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the colors are very vibrant and go on and stay on well&lt;br /&gt;there</li>

            <li>Not only did it get here within 2 days with standard shipping, The colors are bright and vivid!</li>
            <li>Enough rambling, great product, great price, fast shipping due to my location, poor packaging.</li>
            <li>They are very high pigmented.  </li>
            <li>you risk pulling the top pallet a little too hard that it will fly out of your hand</li>
            <li>If you ever used Sephora brand eyeshadow, well you know that doesn&#x27;t work very well with out</li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and last til the night is over (with a primer).</li>
            <li>I really like all the colors that come in this palette.</li>

            <li>and they blend very well.</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product, except when I got this palette 5 eyeshadows were broken, over all I love it.</li>
            <li>The colors are rich and deep.</li>
            <li>Yes, I just threw away the palette because I felt it was not eye safe due to the films.</li>
            <li>I got this today in the mail &amp; I was really excited to open it</li>
            <li>I love my new eye shadows, only one of them came broken, but all the other ones are perfect.  </li>
            <li>The colors is this palette are very pigmented and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Owning this palette beats buying single pots just to own different colors.</li>
            <li>The wide variety of colour makes it easy for me to subtly wear bright colours and not look clownish.</li>
            <li>There is a pull tab to help lift the second shadow palette (cool colors)up.</li>
            <li>I got this for large color choice only, for a week&#x27;s worth of themed makeup.</li>
            <li>It blends well and the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and matte.</li>
            <li>but I feel like I have to use A LOT just to get a decent amount of color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright w/o primer, but i recommend using a primer to wear these eyeshadows if ya want vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>colors arent vibrant at all, there too shear and dont show up as they look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive that this palette would&#x27;ve been completely destroyed.</li>
            <li>All of the colors are vibrant and high pigmented.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for anyone who is into makeup.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I was thinking about buying either FASH or a high end brand palette.</li>
            <li>I was truly taken away by how highly pigmented these babies are.</li>
            <li>This product I place up there with some of my high end makeup, For me I didn&#x27;t have to put on any eye primer and this eyeshadow stays on all day  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommed this product.  </li>
            <li>My overall thoughts on this product is its worth money and would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li>However, upon receiving the product, the red turned out to be a shimmery dark pink-magenta (by the way, some colors are matte and some are shimmery, I liked that though.)</li>
            <li>I will have a review posted on youtube in a few weeks :)</li>
            <li>i rate it its okay as the pallate had a few colors craked in it.</li>
            <li>the reason why i said that, is because i got tired of going to the store to see if i can find a good eyeshadow, so when i brought the fash 120 palette, i wasnt worried about looking for another eyeshadow again.</li>
            <li>When you put them back into the hardcase, there is a ribbon attached to the back of one of the pannels for easy removal from the hardcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I live in Albuquerque NM.</li>
            <li>My co-workers are always waiting to see what new color I will wear.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much we will be making future purchases.</li>
            <li>They last a long time and are easily removed with remover or soap.</li>
            <li>sure do the only thing i have noticed is that they do chalk up but that could just be due to brushes.</li>
            <li>The first purchase was for myself, the second I purchased two; one for my daughter and one for my granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>Had several friends try to buy the pallet off of me the first time they saw the colors.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY THE SAME WAY</li>
            <li>The colors show up vividly without primer and they are such pretty colors.</li>
            <li>With all of the colors this product offers there isn&#x27;t a look that I can&#x27;t create!</li>
            <li>Pretty colors, although I wish there were a brighter red color.</li>
            <li>I apply them over a gel primer(is like a common primer, but like... a very light gel I apply over the eyelid)</li>
            <li>the color became hard and I had to chip the top layer off</li>
            <li>I love MAC but times are hard these days, and it&#x27;s either the 30 shoes or the one color eyeshadow</li>
            <li>This product is very highly pigmented and will definitely  be a factor in my Make-up artistry tools from Now on.</li>
            <li>(most of my other eyeshadows don&#x27;t stay on very long, even with the primer).</li>
            <li>it is just a bright as pictured and none of mine were broken when it was received!</li>
            <li>I was a bit scared because people always complained about broken eyeshadows and so, but when I opened the box, all the shadows were in perfect conditions!</li>
            <li>it is very sheik and fits inside a regular purse with ease.  </li>
            <li>As far as the \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell</li>
            <li>My only thing is that I wish that the red was more defined, because it can be mistaken as pink.</li>
            <li>:) There were also two damaged eye shadows when it arrived, but I happen to have a rude mailman who throws packages over the fence</li>
            <li>As far as smell...</li>
            <li>I bought this because my old palette broke during a move</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever had, by far.</li>
            <li>I like this product and the variety of colors that it offers.</li>
            <li>I am having so much fun mixing and matching different shade and creating multiple looks.  </li>
            <li>I was excited after reading the reviews about the quality of the pigments, but a little unnerved about the condition that I would receive it in.</li>
            <li>I have not used this product yet because I am trying to find a case big enough so the palettes will sit side by side instead of on top of each other</li>
            <li>Another thing is you have to be careful with the palette because the eyeshadows can fall right out.</li>
            <li>My personal favorites are [Palette 1,Column 1,Row6;P1,C9,R6; all of the reds (there is an orange red at the bottom that looks like a true red</li>
            <li>Other than that in the package it looks amazingly colorful</li>
            <li>HAS A TEENAGE (or older) DAUGHTER THAT WEARS MAKE UP</li>
            <li>The color turned out to be really pretty, so not getting a red in the palette was too big of a deal to me.  </li>
            <li>The colors are highly pigmented and they do last all day.</li>
            <li>the colors are high pigmented and they last.</li>
            <li>The size of the eyeshadows are a little bigger than a dime, however there are so many different colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to find other product lines that match up standard wise.</li>
            <li>Well, I bought this a month ago and, since I live outside the US, I got a friend of mine to bring it from the US to my country.</li>
            <li>The colors are also very organized within the different shades of individual colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only possible downside is that they are a little chalky, but the chalkiness is comparable to my urban decay shadows, and for the price, I have no complaints!  &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise one to not throw away the 2 films that come on top of the shadows because the glittery colors can become a little powdery/flaky/loose and will mix with the other colors if those films are not there.</li>
            <li>I have used only high end eye shadows and these were no different.</li>
            <li>well pigmented, and much faster shipping than I expected.</li>
            <li>Recaived the 120 color palette and the case alone with all of the top color&#x27;s were broken.</li>
            <li>I love the eye shadows, but 7 of the colors were broken</li>
            <li>So many colors sometimes i myself get confused on what color i want to try on for the day</li>
            <li>but it is not, the 4th red is, and a military green P2,C5,R5 &#x3D; ).</li>
            <li>one came broken but its okay</li>
            <li>was very much amazed at quality and shipping of color palette and found it priced less than ebay.</li>
            <li>The main reason I got this palette was because it looked as if it had a red eyeshadow, and I had been looking for a red eyeshadow that didn&#x27;t cost me a ton for a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>The shipping as extreme fast as well</li>
            <li>Even without a white eye shadow base, they are very bright.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and if you want the colors to come through even more, especially in the evenings, a little primer goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Once I opened it not a single shade was broken, there was bubble wrap inside its individual box inside the ups box and that was sealed and sitting on top of air pouch bags.  </li>
            <li>I wear pretty extravagent makeup on a daily basis, and for someone who mixes on average three to four colors a look (like myself)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty messy.</li>
            <li>Other than that the color is vibrant and there are lots to choose from</li>
            <li>One con that I could think of is that a tiny piece of one of the black eyeshadows was chipped, easily fixable though since the chip was smaller than my pinkie nail, and there are two black eyeshadows in the palette.</li>
            <li>I do recommend a primer or shadow base if you want to layer it for vibrancy but are noticable and pretty on their own.</li>
            <li>Not a single shadow had broken off in the process of shipment, and the bubble wrap was a good two inches thick.</li>
            <li>when i recieve this product, everything looks fine, nothing were broken.</li>
            <li>and they stay all day long, even though my skin is very greasy and my other eyeshadows lasted only about six hours when using the primer (and about two when I didn&#x27;t use it).  </li>

            <li> Great product, so many bright colors!</li>
            <li> The Palette came in impeccable condition and the colors are gorgeous.   </li>
            <li> The colors are really bright</li>
            <li> I adore all of the bright colors.</li>
            <li> im just not that good at eyeshadow yet</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself about 6 months ago and loved it, so I bought one as a Xmas gift.</li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality but also think they should be numbered.  </li>
            <li> all my classmates loved it and asked where I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I think that is why you get good pay off.</li>
            <li> I loved the price on the 120 palette and the quality.</li>
            <li> This palette arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> and I thought this would be a good deal.</li>
            <li> The colors just don&#x27;t look good on me and don&#x27;t look like they did on the palette like they did on my eyes.</li>
            <li> But still a good deal.</li>
            <li> Also, The blacks and silvers are gorgeous when it comes to doing a smokey eye.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> I arrive in perfect condition, very pigmented product of very good quality, very pleased with the purchase, I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I loved this super bright colors !!</li>
            <li> This palette has proven to be extremely suitable for this and is also great to use as eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> I love the fash eyeshadow beautiful colors</li>
            <li> The colors are even more beautiful in person.</li>
            <li> I am not a master of makeup but after buying this product I surely will be watching some YouTube tutorials to make sure that I make the best use of it.</li>
            <li> but Im sure it will be great also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased and will be purchasing again...</li>
            <li> We were very pleased with all of the color selections.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AMAZING , I LOVED THIS PRODUCT AND EVERY COLOR</li>
            <li> Darker colors are great but lighter/brighter ones need more than one or two coats.  </li>
            <li> There are so many colors to choose from and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the price also</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this palette.</li>
            <li> The case is very cute</li>
            <li> Great colors arrived perfectly and early ..  !</li>
            <li> Like most cheap eyeshadow palettes, I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s the best makeup I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Im glad I got this palette!</li>
            <li> but it was okay to make your eyeshadows the way you want them to too!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love this palette!</li>

            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> but its greatly pigmented, granted I use Urban Decay Primer Potion for any eyeshadow but this sticks on and looks great even with out!!</li>
            <li> is incredibly nice.</li>
            <li> They arrived in excellent condition and very timely.  </li>
            <li> Everything came nice and neat.</li>
            <li> Waterproof though, so you better have a good makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Came in a nice case, and wrap to protect it.</li>
            <li> Sooo the colors are really nice, instead all color</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This product was/is awesome, It came very promptly.</li>
            <li> Really nice color palette.</li>
            <li> and it does come out nicely.</li>
            <li> This palette is great, it has a variety of shades to find out what works best for you and create different looks.</li>
            <li> The colors are fantastic and her artwork looks amazing!</li>
            <li> Very pleased and considering the neutrals palette from FASH, which is probably more eyeshadow than I&#x27;ll use in a lifetime. ^_^</li>
            <li> The colours are bright and easily applied.</li>
            <li> is pretty good!</li>
            <li> But, it is very good quality, beautiful collor, very pigmented (really!).</li>
            <li> They do no look cheap or tacky, good quality item.</li>
            <li> So far Fash has impressed me with the quality in their products and I will continue to buy from them again.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and there is so much variety!</li>
            <li> I ordered this a while ago, but I wanted to make sure I liked it before giving a review.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for a teen/young adult</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to blend!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it!</li>
            <li> , it arrived on time, i am so happy i chose it, thanks!</li>
            <li> It has a great selection of colors and arrived in a pretty timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Had issues with item, case is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The colours are vibrant and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The pallet itself is beautiful, sturdy and the colors look just as vibrant in person as they do in the photos.</li>
            <li> Beautiful vibrant colors I love it</li>
            <li> Huge varity of colors and shades!</li>
            <li> There were so many colors and also it was cheap!</li>
            <li> It was okay, thought it was going to better quality</li>
            <li> but i think they need to find a better way to ship there product so that they dont get damage.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many many brands.</li>
            <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t see any difference quality wise only price wise for sure.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that some of the colors were shimmery and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I am an eyeshadow enthusiast of all makeup I tend to buy eye products the most as I believe they make the most impact.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $14 more than when i bought it, and i bought it using a gift card,</li>
            <li> but I was able to repair.</li>

            <li> Fair price, huge selection of beautiful colors, and they all apply vibrant and beautiful ONLY WHEN USED WITH AN EYESHADOW PRIMER!</li>
            <li> For the price, the quality is great and some of the most highly pigmented colors Iâ€™ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors aren&#x27;t as bright or intense as I&#x27;d like when applied, but most of them that I&#x27;ve tried look lovely.</li>
            <li> For the price, the quality seems good and there is such a huge color selection I think it will keep her happy for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I so far have made my eyes like a beautiful peacock feather and got tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> The colors are so vivid and applies great to your eyes.</li>
            <li> Why pay more for individual eye shadow if you can get a great selection for an outstanding price  : )  </li>
            <li> i love the colors and the price was fine</li>
            <li> they are very vibrant and look good.  </li>

            <li> The colors are amazing and bright and last all day.  </li>

            <li> they last forever and have a nice bright color.</li>
            <li> , the shadows do the trick, they stay on and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of these beautiful shadows.  </li>
            <li> It came so fast and they blend very easy with my Cheeky brushes :3</li>
            <li> I tried this with my new brushes and everything is just gorgeous.</li>
            <li> and they were fine.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for me and came just as it should have.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was lucky!</li>

            <li> I love this palette, it has all the colors that i need, its worth it,</li>
            <li> A fantastic buy I recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I say anyone who is experienced in makeup and looking for a more \\&quot;wide ranged\\&quot; variety, or someone who is learning to apply multi toned shades, this is a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li> but when applied it looks light.</li>
            <li> Great product overall though.</li>
            <li> this item was worth your money...... :)</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this palette.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy having this eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> Really cheap for the amount of colors you get.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth and stays put for hours.  </li>
            <li> The colors are FABULOUS</li>
            <li> I have played with different looks using the palette and even without primer the color payoff is still great.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Very Happy that my money was spent on something worth</li>
            <li> But overall I love the colors and the quality of pigmentation!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this palette, it has all the colors you need!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a very colorful person and you are too then</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be good make up,  true to its color etc.</li>
            <li> Its good quality the only thing is that it has a strong chemical smell .but</li>
            <li> so worth it!</li>
            <li> We all love the vibrant and bold colors, the ease of application and most of all the price can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> Many people thought it was a higher end eyeshadows when I had applied it with a primer/base.</li>
            <li> I try it on and its totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love the colors, smooth, and soft :).</li>
            <li> Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> FASH eye shadows came packaged pretty ok.</li>
            <li> This was my first makeup palette, and I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, I also have three reds in my palette that work pretty well, but need time to be layered to look stunning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite eyeshadow palette that I&#x27;ve ordered so far. :)</li>
            <li> I just love this product I mix up the different colors to make my own.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled when I got my package a bit early!</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you are a makeup person like I am, I eyeshadow is right on the dollar!</li>
            <li> Wow, this palette is amazing.</li>
            <li> Another thing that bothered me more than the chip was that the pictures aren&#x27;t quite true to what you&#x27;re really getting.</li>
            <li> Colors are bright and last all day..</li>
            <li> I love the colors and they blend really well.</li>
            <li> Seems good until i come back to this page and holy C**P!</li>
            <li> I love this pallet so much.</li>
            <li> It is very compact-friendly and cute.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter bought this with her own money</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s some nice natural colors.</li>
            <li> but mine was very well handled I will be buying this again :) for christmas gifts</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenage daughter and she has loved it.</li>
            <li> This product thus far is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re some makeup enthusiast with little money looking for bright colors, this is your product!</li>
            <li> The pigmentation of the shadows is pretty good, and with primer, or NYx&#x27;s milk on your lids, they sit well and stay pretty vibrant</li>
            <li> Other than that I think it is great</li>
            <li> other than that I was happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> great shadow for the price the imagination and color combos are endless</li>
            <li> I also like how quickly they were sent to me and how the company puts the ingredients of the shadow on the box (not the palette but the box).</li>
            <li> love the vibrant colors and the quality of the shadows</li>
            <li> I love the coastal scents pallets and thought I&#x27;d try FASH since the colors looked so vibrant in the pictures.</li>
            <li> it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I have several blues and greens, which is okay, but I wish there weren&#x27;t so many.  </li>
            <li> They blends super well and with this  </li>
            <li> and it came in quick like 3 days.</li>
            <li> Colors are just as they seem bold or shimmery.</li>
            <li> The case comes with 2 eyeshadow palletes stacked one on top of the other and the top palette is not that easy to remove so</li>
            <li> I actually bought these for nail designing, but liked them so much, I&#x27;m using them for my eyes as well. :-)</li>
            <li> These colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Every day she is trying to come up with new ways to creatively combine the colors.</li>
            <li> and since I first bought it I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with my shadows (except one which is my fault because my brush was still wet from the brush cleaner</li>
            <li> I love the colors and very hapy whit the product, soo pretty and usefull 100% recomemended.</li>
            <li> The Colors selection is great they really pop and are easy to apply long lasting better than sephora pallet also</li>
            <li> I def would recommend this palette more for those who are either learning to apply make up and would like to learn what colors works best for them or if not a starting make up artist with a small budget.</li>
            <li> this eyeshadow are very pigmented and colorfull!!</li>
            <li> The colors are bright and they last a long time , no need to go out and spend 50, 60 dollars on MAC or another trendy make-up line.</li>
            <li> I will say that a few of the lighter colors need a couple of coats, but otherwise, I found these to be great.</li>
            <li> Its Sooo Worth it.</li>
            <li> Well this eyeshadow rivals my love of MAC, cheaper and sooooo soft, I am so picky about eyeshadow&#x27;s and these have won me over.</li>
            <li> it is a beginner - intermediate palette and also worth it if you are just learning a technique</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition, nothing broken.  </li>
            <li> love it beatiful colors, arrived early</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best quality of eyeshadow, but you don&#x27;t pay much for them and the colors at least show up well.</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition,no broken shadows.</li>
            <li> worth 25?</li>
            <li> It is so colorful</li>
            <li> Once unwrapping the eye shadows themselves, there is a clear plastic sheet on top of both pannels.</li>
            <li> Inside came PERFECT nothing broken.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before ordering this palette and I was not at all surprised when I fell in love with it right away.</li>
            <li> I bought them for Halloween because I needed several colors, but I know I&#x27;ll get much more use out of it than originally intended.  </li>
            <li> No palettes where broken, which is great!!!&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product and the colors are very poppy! :)</li>
            <li> They add the right touch needed for my modeling gigs as well as for a night out.</li>
            <li> We used it right away.</li>
            <li> Not a bad choice for my first time purchasing a palette, would definately recommend to others who are first time users with cosmetics.</li>
            <li> wit no regrets :)</li>
            <li> The glittery eyeshadows in the palette are glittery all the way through, there&#x27;s even a gorgeous glitter black color, greens, purples, blues.</li>
            <li> You can also achieve various looks which is great if you don&#x27;t have a lot of money to buy individual shadows.</li>
            <li> This palette is amazing in every single way.</li>
            <li> AND THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and well packaged..</li>
            <li> I have all the pretty colors I need to create new and exciting looks for my nights out!</li>
            <li> u really need to work with these!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> an this is the second pallette ive boutghn. :)</li>
            <li> When I first bought it and tested the matte shades on my fingers</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong on this one, it stays on all day the colors are awesome.</li>
            <li> the eyeshaows are EXACTLY like the picture</li>
            <li> The pigments of the shadows are awesome but most of the shadows broke or popped out the palette :( ..</li>
            <li> There are more than enough colors to match anything in my wardrobe.</li>
            <li> and i love it however when i opened the package too colors were mixed</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and also comes on really pretty and shows.</li>
            <li> Some are more of a flat color while others have a shimmer to them.  </li>
            <li> This palette has a wonderfully wide selection of color, and the quality is great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Its was nicely packaged, nothing was broken, i love it.</li>
            <li> very good product, came very fast and was in great condition only one eyeshadow was a little broken</li>
            <li> I like the colors very much but the packaging needs much improvement.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment for my dark skin tone.</li>
            <li> the colors are very pigmented and i love the variety, and they last well and dont fade too much in brightness thru the night.</li>
            <li> I use them every day because eyeshadow is the main make-up item that I really like to have fun with.</li>
            <li> Very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to this product is that it seems not to stay on, all day and/or it fades...especially if you&#x27;re someone who sweats easily, in the face or has oily skin.</li>
            <li> These colors are very vibrant.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the colors are very vibrant and go on and stay on well&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
            <li> It came SUPER early ordered March 31 got it two-</li>
            <li> and i recommend it to all looking for a variety of bright long lasting colors.</li>
            <li> BUT because I needed this palette by a certain date</li>
            <li> Not only did it get here within 2 days with standard shipping, The colors are bright and vivid!</li>
            <li> Enough rambling, great product, great price, fast shipping due to my location, poor packaging.</li>
            <li> They are very high pigmented.  </li>
            <li> you risk pulling the top pallet a little too hard that it will fly out of your hand</li>
            <li> If you ever used Sephora brand eyeshadow, well you know that doesn&#x27;t work very well with out</li>
            <li> They go on smoothly and last til the night is over (with a primer).</li>
            <li> I really like all the colors that come in this palette.</li>
            <li> very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Shadows not broken, as it says in some reviews.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS VERY WELL ORGANIZED</li>
            <li> but it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> The delivery service was fast.</li>
            <li> The texture of the shadows is very velvety and they blend well.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much colors to pick and choose from.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Africian American but have a light skin tone</li>
            <li> well  for shipping, &amp; arrived fast, just in time for christmas.</li>

            <li> I really recommmend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the color choices.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for daily use or important days like a wedding or prom.</li>
            <li> Some of the eyeshadows were crushed which means I wasn&#x27;t able to use the crumbled ones because I had to dump it.  </li>
            <li> This item was bought for my mom and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This item shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li> so you buy another oppurtunity in to see your offer thanks</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Was really noce</li>
            <li> really recommend it.</li>
            <li> and they blend very well.</li>
            <li> I really like them.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product, except when I got this palette 5 eyeshadows were broken, over all I love it.</li>
            <li> The colors are rich and deep.</li>
            <li> Yes, I just threw away the palette because I felt it was not eye safe due to the films.</li>
            <li> I got this today in the mail &amp; I was really excited to open it</li>
            <li> I love my new eye shadows, only one of them came broken, but all the other ones are perfect.  </li>
            <li> The colors is this palette are very pigmented and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Owning this palette beats buying single pots just to own different colors.</li>
            <li> The wide variety of colour makes it easy for me to subtly wear bright colours and not look clownish.</li>
            <li> There is a pull tab to help lift the second shadow palette (cool colors)up.</li>
            <li> I got this for large color choice only, for a week&#x27;s worth of themed makeup.</li>
            <li> It blends well and the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and matte.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I have to use A LOT just to get a decent amount of color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright w/o primer, but i recommend using a primer to wear these eyeshadows if ya want vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> colors arent vibrant at all, there too shear and dont show up as they look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive that this palette would&#x27;ve been completely destroyed.</li>
            <li> All of the colors are vibrant and high pigmented.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for anyone who is into makeup.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was thinking about buying either FASH or a high end brand palette.</li>
            <li> I was truly taken away by how highly pigmented these babies are.</li>
            <li> This product I place up there with some of my high end makeup, For me I didn&#x27;t have to put on any eye primer and this eyeshadow stays on all day  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommed this product.  </li>
            <li> My overall thoughts on this product is its worth money and would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> However, upon receiving the product, the red turned out to be a shimmery dark pink-magenta (by the way, some colors are matte and some are shimmery, I liked that though.)</li>
            <li> I will have a review posted on youtube in a few weeks :)</li>
            <li> i rate it its okay as the pallate had a few colors craked in it.</li>
            <li> the reason why i said that, is because i got tired of going to the store to see if i can find a good eyeshadow, so when i brought the fash 120 palette, i wasnt worried about looking for another eyeshadow again.</li>
            <li> When you put them back into the hardcase, there is a ribbon attached to the back of one of the pannels for easy removal from the hardcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I live in Albuquerque NM.</li>
            <li> My co-workers are always waiting to see what new color I will wear.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much we will be making future purchases.</li>
            <li> They last a long time and are easily removed with remover or soap.</li>
            <li> sure do the only thing i have noticed is that they do chalk up but that could just be due to brushes.</li>
            <li> The first purchase was for myself, the second I purchased two; one for my daughter and one for my granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> Had several friends try to buy the pallet off of me the first time they saw the colors.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY THE SAME WAY</li>
            <li> The colors show up vividly without primer and they are such pretty colors.</li>
            <li> With all of the colors this product offers there isn&#x27;t a look that I can&#x27;t create!</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, although I wish there were a brighter red color.</li>
            <li> I apply them over a gel primer(is like a common primer, but like... a very light gel I apply over the eyelid)</li>
            <li> the color became hard and I had to chip the top layer off</li>
            <li> I love MAC but times are hard these days, and it&#x27;s either the 30 shoes or the one color eyeshadow</li>
            <li> This product is very highly pigmented and will definitely  be a factor in my Make-up artistry tools from Now on.</li>
            <li> (most of my other eyeshadows don&#x27;t stay on very long, even with the primer).</li>
            <li> it is just a bright as pictured and none of mine were broken when it was received!</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared because people always complained about broken eyeshadows and so, but when I opened the box, all the shadows were in perfect conditions!</li>
            <li> it is very sheik and fits inside a regular purse with ease.  </li>
            <li> As far as the \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell</li>
            <li> My only thing is that I wish that the red was more defined, because it can be mistaken as pink.</li>
            <li> :) There were also two damaged eye shadows when it arrived, but I happen to have a rude mailman who throws packages over the fence</li>
            <li> As far as smell...</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old palette broke during a move</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever had, by far.</li>
            <li> I like this product and the variety of colors that it offers.</li>
            <li> I am having so much fun mixing and matching different shade and creating multiple looks.  </li>
            <li> I was excited after reading the reviews about the quality of the pigments, but a little unnerved about the condition that I would receive it in.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet because I am trying to find a case big enough so the palettes will sit side by side instead of on top of each other</li>
            <li> Another thing is you have to be careful with the palette because the eyeshadows can fall right out.</li>
            <li> My personal favorites are [Palette 1,Column 1,Row6;P1,C9,R6; all of the reds (there is an orange red at the bottom that looks like a true red</li>
            <li> Other than that in the package it looks amazingly colorful</li>
            <li> HAS A TEENAGE (or older) DAUGHTER THAT WEARS MAKE UP</li>
            <li> The color turned out to be really pretty, so not getting a red in the palette was too big of a deal to me.  </li>
            <li> The colors are highly pigmented and they do last all day.</li>
            <li> the colors are high pigmented and they last.</li>
            <li> The size of the eyeshadows are a little bigger than a dime, however there are so many different colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find other product lines that match up standard wise.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this a month ago and, since I live outside the US, I got a friend of mine to bring it from the US to my country.</li>
            <li> The colors are also very organized within the different shades of individual colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only possible downside is that they are a little chalky, but the chalkiness is comparable to my urban decay shadows, and for the price, I have no complaints!  &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise one to not throw away the 2 films that come on top of the shadows because the glittery colors can become a little powdery/flaky/loose and will mix with the other colors if those films are not there.</li>
            <li> I have used only high end eye shadows and these were no different.</li>
            <li> well pigmented, and much faster shipping than I expected.</li>
            <li> Recaived the 120 color palette and the case alone with all of the top color&#x27;s were broken.</li>
            <li> I love the eye shadows, but 7 of the colors were broken</li>
            <li> So many colors sometimes i myself get confused on what color i want to try on for the day</li>
            <li> but it is not, the 4th red is, and a military green P2,C5,R5 &#x3D; ).</li>
            <li> one came broken but its okay</li>
            <li> was very much amazed at quality and shipping of color palette and found it priced less than ebay.</li>
            <li> The main reason I got this palette was because it looked as if it had a red eyeshadow, and I had been looking for a red eyeshadow that didn&#x27;t cost me a ton for a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> The shipping as extreme fast as well</li>
            <li> Even without a white eye shadow base, they are very bright.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and if you want the colors to come through even more, especially in the evenings, a little primer goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Once I opened it not a single shade was broken, there was bubble wrap inside its individual box inside the ups box and that was sealed and sitting on top of air pouch bags.  </li>
            <li> I wear pretty extravagent makeup on a daily basis, and for someone who mixes on average three to four colors a look (like myself)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty messy.</li>
            <li> Other than that the color is vibrant and there are lots to choose from</li>
            <li> One con that I could think of is that a tiny piece of one of the black eyeshadows was chipped, easily fixable though since the chip was smaller than my pinkie nail, and there are two black eyeshadows in the palette.</li>
            <li> I do recommend a primer or shadow base if you want to layer it for vibrancy but are noticable and pretty on their own.</li>
            <li> Not a single shadow had broken off in the process of shipment, and the bubble wrap was a good two inches thick.</li>
            <li> when i recieve this product, everything looks fine, nothing were broken.</li>
            <li> and they stay all day long, even though my skin is very greasy and my other eyeshadows lasted only about six hours when using the primer (and about two when I didn&#x27;t use it).  </li>
            <li> came with one shade broken, but the colors fix more than I expected.</li>
            <li> only complaint is when opened the package smelled strongly of freshly dyed paint/chemicals/something strange.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors and how vivid they are, but when the package arrived, at least 6 of the eyeshadows were broken and all over the place.</li>
            <li> The colors last a very long time too especially if you wear an eye primer underneath.</li>
            <li> Though the colors are beautiful, you either need to pack the heck out of each layer you apply (which even then is not exactly perfect)or apply a base coat before applying.     </li>
            <li> the only problem i have had is that they have a tendency to fall a little bit from the eyelid and down under the eyes a bit, but maybe i just put too much on.</li>
            <li> I simply flipped it over the sink and tapped out the excess powder that had become loose</li>
            <li> I bougth this palette afraid about The qualit because it is very cheap.</li>
            <li> The colors looks fine but the edge of the palette and 4 eyeshadows were broken it!</li>
            <li> the colors are vibrant and last at least 12 hours</li>
            <li> They are also very durable/ hard to smudge and take off.</li>
            <li> I am a dark african american and the colors</li>
            <li> This eye shadow has all the colors I need for my various styles, bringing a wide range of artistc designs to my eyes.</li>
            <li> They have a strange chemical smell, as well.</li>
            <li> the only complaint I can think of would be that the eyeshadow seems to be soft &amp; fragile, the case took a minor fall&amp; 4 of the colors crumbled.</li>
            <li> if you wet your brush and put it in the shadow it will darken a specific color/intensify that color (when you have a primer on over your lid).</li>
            <li> Received my package earlier than expected and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> so I know I&#x27;ll need a good base when I do wear them.</li>
            <li> I have to say the product is really good for the price you are paying for, though I would not wear these eyeshadows without a primer or some type of base underneath.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I paid more for this item on Amazon when I could&#x27;ve gotten it straight from the company and paid less.</li>
            <li> I received the palette very soon after ordering and not a single eyeshadow was broken or cracked.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, and can create a number of different looks ranging from high end fashion, to everyday.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on February 29th and received it on March 2nd, I think that&#x27;s mostly due to the fact that this shipped from Phoenix AZ</li>
            <li> It came to me with only ONE color broken which was a pretty baby pink color.</li>
            <li> was all over the inside of the case &amp; mixed in with the other eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I have dry eyelids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the loose powder form anyways</li>
            <li> I had maybe one or two loose powders in the set, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> A little eyeshadow goes a long way in this palette, making it last longer.  </li>
            <li> and you got a big mess.</li>
            <li> Works well with and without a base :) The neon colors are hard to apply but luckily I know a little bit about makeup.</li>
            <li> every single one!</li>
            <li> The broken ones you can still use like a loose pigmented shadow, but that&#x27;s not what really want to expect.</li>
            <li> A little colour goes a long way, so long as you don&#x27;t touch it a lot.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I personally think there could be a brighter selection of reds.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Now the majority of the colors in this palette is shimmery then matte and the eyeshadows are the size of dimes, but I expected that.</li>
            <li> BUT ONE ITEM IS MISSING FROM THE ACTUAL SHOWN ITEM.  </li>
            <li> None of those were colors that she would use and she was too impatient to try sending it back.</li>
            <li> I expected all intact.</li>
            <li> I have green eyes, so I look FORWARD to trying the different shades of purple!!!</li>
            <li> You have a wide selection of reds, blues, greens, yellows, oranges and even browns.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow isnt clued inside the case though, so you gotta be careful</li>
            <li> I accidently left it in the car for a few days &amp; when i pulled it out eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I have absolutely NO complaints.</li>
            <li> :/ Just be careful with it &amp; it&#x27;ll last you years.</li>
            <li> well they smell like mineral/any other shadow.</li>
            <li> Along with synthetic colours that are usually derived from coal and are human carcinogens.</li>
            <li> and once you remove the plastic wrap there is nothing to cover the eyeshadow from other elements and contamanation.</li>
            <li> A few shadows came broken which really sort of pissed me off.</li>
            <li> Only one little square was broken but there were other shades of the same color</li>
            <li> Two eyeshadows were crumbled and partially exploded all over the bottom palette but nothing a little tissue and pressing couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> not as pigmented as i expected, but putting them on with my fingers and/or add a little bit of moisturizer</li>
            <li> Sometimes you may have to build on color for your preference of intensity, but for me to have dark skin and get compliments on the boldness of color</li>
            <li> Our only complaint was that the item was not packaged well for shipping.</li>
            <li> With the base, they are amplified even more.</li>
            <li> and we have given each other little mini makeovers and everyone who has used this product</li>
            <li> No colors were cracked or broken no mess at all.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant, especially with primer or white creme base underneath.</li>
            <li> Other than a few of the colors within the palette</li>
            <li> They also stay on forever with the help of a little primer</li>
            <li> Also the product came to me with no broken pieces, i was afraid that would happen</li>
            <li> and they had said the only problem was that sometimes the palette would come to them and one or two colors would be broken.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve poked at a few of the brightest mattes and the color payoff</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on expensive eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> A lot of different colors Ive read that some people pallets came broken</li>
            <li> Thought it would get a few cracks on some eyeshadow like some ppl said</li>
            <li> My Only issue is that 5 of the colors were broken.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> There was only one color broken.</li>
            <li> When I opened the palette the smell like gave off instantly, which caused me later to get a BAD headache due to the films.</li>
            <li> i like how i get plain and shimmer of each color and the eyeshadow stays on all day</li>
            <li> anything it happen to be very tight in the box :</li>
            <li> My only one complaint is some of the eyeshadows came in broken...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was during the shipping process or because they were not fully inspected before they were shipped.</li>
            <li> Worst part is that once i go to return it, i can only get a refund, so i can only get my money back.</li>
            <li> Mine came the same way unfortunately.</li>
            <li> and I happen to know how to fix broken eyeshadows (which I have to say only one came in really completely broken</li>
            <li> But the colors are not very bright.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I really have to say about this is that a base is a MUST!</li>
            <li> i was disappointed to open the box and about a dozen of the colors were broken, I&#x27;m guessing from being in the back of the delivery truck.</li>
            <li> sThe eye shadow is in a hard case, when opened there are 2 eye shadow pannels, which were individualy wrapped.  </li>
            <li> The colors are pigmented well, none of the pots were broken and I use this nearly everyday, and have for months.</li>
            <li> I am not very happy with this product and there is no way to contact seller with any issues.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use several of the shadows and will continue to use when pigmentation isn&#x27;t of concern, however I am disappointed that these are not better pigmented.</li>
            <li> With NYX base a little eyeshadow goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see the size of the box when it was dropped off, I had imagined that the palette was axtually larger</li>
            <li> The colors are not bright even with primer.  </li>
            <li> The color payoff is weak and there is a lot of fall out with these shadows.</li>
            <li> and I am happy,my Palette did not come broken or</li>
            <li> Though some of the colors (approximately 4) were cracked I managed to fix it.</li>
            <li> then it is its approximately 9&#x27;x 6&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Three out of the 120 were broken</li>
            <li> Two of them were broken, but  </li>
            <li> Three of my shadows came broken but nothing to cry over.  </li>
            <li> When we opened it there were 3 colors that had been broken.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any broken shadows when I got the palette in</li>
            <li> The box itself was bubble wrapped, then the palette was bubble wrapped as well as a thin plastic sheet covering the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> the case was broken on the side</li>
            <li> everything was in tack and nothing broken.</li>
            <li> its thin and compact.</li>
            <li> My package arrived before time, and none of the product was broken.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t come broken.</li>
            <li> None of my shades were broken.</li>
            <li> , I received it within a week from purchase ,while reading some reviews about colors coming in broken</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed, I&#x27;ll keep using it</li>
            <li> AND SAY YOU DID NOT LOVE IT !!!</li>
            <li> I received this palette within three business days and there weren&#x27;t any broken pots in the palette at all!</li>
            <li> Yes, it isn&#x27;t that expensive</li>
            <li> How could you go wrong with this one, because you just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Let me be one to say nothing broken!</li>
            <li> The part that I did not like was the palette had a weird smell.</li>
            <li> If you are a make-up artist you can make any and all brands work and look as expensive as MAC.</li>
            <li> But one of my eyeshadows came broken :(</li>
            <li> YOU WOULD ABSOLUTELY CRAZY TO BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> lame!</li>
            <li> the others were just a bit cracked) and it was like about 5 eyeshadows out of 120 of them, I figure its not that bad.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad.</li>
            <li> I say buy it you wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when i received this item.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you put a base on your eyelid before applying, the colors may pop.</li>
            <li> I threw it out after 2 uses disappeared even with base.</li>
            <li> and i hate that in eyeshadows</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase it!!</li>

            <li> I really liked this product. There were so many colors and also it was cheap! Im glad I got this palette!</li>
            <li> It was okay, thought it was going to better quality but it was okay to make your eyeshadows the way you want them to too! Palette is nothing like the Mac shadows u really need to work with these! But are still good but not that good!!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it! Ordered it so I could take it with me on vacation from Afghanistan, believe it or not made it all the way to Afghanistan without one shadow being broke. Haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it yet but Im sure it will be great also *smiles*</li>
            <li> Recaived the 120 color palette and the case alone with all of the top color&#x27;s were broken. The order came on time but i think they need to find a better way to ship there product so that they dont get damage.</li>
            <li> after seeing some of the reviews, I was nervous to receive my palette but I was really impressed! so worth it!</li>
            <li> I received the palette very soon after ordering and not a single eyeshadow was broken or cracked. I love the colors and they blend really well. I use them every day because eyeshadow is the main make-up item that I really like to have fun with. They do no look cheap or tacky, good quality item. Every girl/woman should get this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  The Palette came in impeccable condition and the colors are gorgeous.   Why pay more for individual eye shadow if you can get a great selection for an outstanding price  : )  I looooooooooooooove makeup and I&#x27;ve tried many many brands. Honestly I didn&#x27;t see any difference quality wise only price wise for sure.</li>
            <li> This was everything I wanted and then some. I couldn&#x27;t tell that some of the colors were shimmery and I absolutely love it. Im hoping to use this to get my make up artist certification.</li>
            <li> I love the eye shadows, but 7 of the colors were broken I&#x27;m not sure if it was during the shipping process or because they were not fully inspected before they were shipped.</li>
            <li> Plenty of colors to choose from. I am a dark african american and the colors definitely show up on me.</li>
            <li> Arrived quckly and i like it im just not that good at eyeshadow yet</li>
            <li> The pigments on this is wonderful. Though some of the colors (approximately 4) were cracked I managed to fix it. It arrived sooner than I expected. So far so good. I&#x27;ve used this for clubbing makeup and a wedding event.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see the size of the box when it was dropped off, I had imagined that the palette was axtually larger then it is its approximately 9&#x27;x 6&#x27;.  Once I opened it not a single shade was broken, there was bubble wrap inside its individual box inside the ups box and that was sealed and sitting on top of air pouch bags.  So Bravo to them for taking the feedback and actually fixing the issue that was my biggest concern when I purchased it.  The colors are amazing and bright and last all day.  I am having so much fun mixing and matching different shade and creating multiple looks.  I am an eyeshadow enthusiast of all makeup I tend to buy eye products the most as I believe they make the most impact.  I have had friends over and we have given each other little mini makeovers and everyone who has used this product is now buying one for themselves.  My only recommendation would be to put the colors in order instead of having purples in 4 different locations.  I would highly recommend this product and I especially love the size and the style of container they used it is very sheik and fits inside a regular purse with ease.  Love it Love it Love it</li>
            <li> I love my new eye shadows, only one of them came broken, but all the other ones are perfect.  I only wish the colors would look brighter on my eyes! But they are Great!</li>
            <li> I got the package on time which was great, but when i opened it eyeshadow was everywhere!!! 34 of the eyeshadows where powderd, and about 15 others cracked. Worst part is that once i go to return it, i can only get a refund, so i can only get my money back. Seems good until i come back to this page and holy C**P! It&#x27;s $14 more than when i bought it, and i bought it using a gift card, so basicaly i am ooutta luck. Not to mention that pieces of the case itself are falling off -.-&#x27;</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself about 6 months ago and loved it, so I bought one as a Xmas gift.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003EO466S FASH Eyeshadow, 120 Color Palette]] I love this palette, it has all the colors that i need, its worth it, the reason why i said that, is because i got tired of going to the store to see if i can find a good eyeshadow, so when i brought the fash 120 palette, i wasnt worried about looking for another eyeshadow again.</li>
            <li> I love this pallet so much. The colours are vibrant and beautiful. Well pigmented and applies easily. A fantastic buy I recommend to all my friends. The price was great too!</li>
            <li> I received the package as promised in a timely manner.  I believe the packaging with the palette can be improved though.  Three out of the 120 were broken but I was able to repair. The brushes are good quality but also think they should be numbered.  All in all great purchase, will use them again.    JLo</li>
            <li> very good product, came very fast and was in great condition only one eyeshadow was a little broken but I still love!!!!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had this eyeshadow palette for about a week now and I absolutely love it! The colors are highly pigmented and they do last all day. I wish I had bought 2 at the same time so when I run out I wouldn&#x27;t have to reorder but I will definetly buy this palette again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought brushes from fash and they are also great as well. So far Fash has impressed me with the quality in their products and I will continue to buy from them again.</li>
            <li> The colors are pigmented well, none of the pots were broken and I use this nearly everyday, and have for months. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This palette is basically the equivalent of the BH Cosmetics 120 palette except there are a mixture of matte and glitter shadows which i love. For those of you that like to switch up your look with brights and neutrals you will looooove this palette;I sure do the only thing i have noticed is that they do chalk up but that could just be due to brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intention of using it to find colors and buy them in different brands. Well this eyeshadow rivals my love of MAC, cheaper and sooooo soft, I am so picky about eyeshadow&#x27;s and these have won me over. I so far have made my eyes like a beautiful peacock feather and got tons of compliments. Not just that but its greatly pigmented, granted I use Urban Decay Primer Potion for any eyeshadow but this sticks on and looks great even with out!! If you ever used Sephora brand eyeshadow, well you know that doesn&#x27;t work very well with out primer well this actually does! BUY THIS YOU WONT REGRET IT! Oh and only two colors had to be repressed from shipping but it was easy and they look great! :)</li>
            <li> Great product, so many bright colors! Works well with and without a base :) The neon colors are hard to apply but luckily I know a little bit about makeup. ;)</li>
            <li> was very much amazed at quality and shipping of color palette and found it priced less than ebay. all my classmates loved it and asked where I purchased it. of course I said amazon!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these shadows. It&#x27;s the perfect combo of matte and shimmer, and the color selection is great. I even use the shadows as all over face make-up for Halloween looks.   The only possible downside is that they are a little chalky, but the chalkiness is comparable to my urban decay shadows, and for the price, I have no complaints!  &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this a month ago and, since I live outside the US, I got a friend of mine to bring it from the US to my country. I was a bit scared because people always complained about broken eyeshadows and so, but when I opened the box, all the shadows were in perfect conditions! every single one! So, kudos for packaging!  Now, about the quality, it&#x27;s beyond the price, even though some colors are way more pigmented than others. I apply them over a gel primer(is like a common primer, but like... a very light gel I apply over the eyelid) and they stay all day long, even though my skin is very greasy and my other eyeshadows lasted only about six hours when using the primer (and about two when I didn&#x27;t use it).  So, if you&#x27;re some makeup enthusiast with little money looking for bright colors, this is your product!</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing! They add the right touch needed for my modeling gigs as well as for a night out. This eye shadow has all the colors I need for my various styles, bringing a wide range of artistc designs to my eyes. It&#x27;s easy to use. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> This pallet is amazing. All of the colors are vibrant and high pigmented. They go on smoothly and last til the night is over (with a primer). the shipping wasn&#x27;t that great however. Before I brought it I read some reviews and they had said the only problem was that sometimes the palette would come to them and one or two colors would be broken. Mine came the same way unfortunately. Don&#x27;t let that discourage you from buying the product, it works just as well. I love this palette!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on February 29th and received it on March 2nd, I think that&#x27;s mostly due to the fact that this shipped from Phoenix AZ and I live in Albuquerque NM. The packaging was horrid and had I not lived closer I&#x27;m positive that this palette would&#x27;ve been completely destroyed. Two eyeshadows were crumbled and partially exploded all over the bottom palette but nothing a little tissue and pressing couldn&#x27;t fix. I have yet to fully swatch these colors but I&#x27;ve poked at a few of the brightest mattes and the color payoff is incredibly nice. Like most cheap eyeshadow palettes, I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s the best makeup I&#x27;ve ever used BUT for the price you&#x27;re getting a very reasonable deal!! As far as the \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell I&#x27;ve seen people mention, it&#x27;s just the way that eyeshadow smells, doesn&#x27;t bother me but I&#x27;m used to it. Enough rambling, great product, great price, fast shipping due to my location, poor packaging. Will update review once all swatches have been tested :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW MARCH 9TH 2012: I&#x27;ve had this palette for about a week and I absolutely adore it, love love LOVE it! There are only 3 colors that didn&#x27;t show up well on my skin so I know I&#x27;ll need a good base when I do wear them. The glittery eyeshadows in the palette are glittery all the way through, there&#x27;s even a gorgeous glitter black color, greens, purples, blues. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great deal, i pay a great price to get what i like, it arrived on time, i am so happy i chose it, thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like all the colors that come in this palette. Two of them were broken, but  I don&#x27;t mind I&#x27;m used to the loose powder form anyways lol. I think its a great buy for the price. I am a very colorful person and you are too then this is the palette for you.</li>
            <li> came with one shade broken, but the colors fix more than I expected. very pigmented.</li>
            <li> This palette has a wonderfully wide selection of color, and the quality is great, especially for the price. Some of the colors aren&#x27;t as bright or intense as I&#x27;d like when applied, but most of them that I&#x27;ve tried look lovely. This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> The shadows have come for 2 days before! Colors are juicy and bright! Shadows not broken, as it says in some reviews. Maybe I was lucky! Everything is wonderful, thank you!</li>
            <li> I bougth this palette afraid about The qualit because it is very cheap. But, it is very good quality, beautiful collor, very pigmented (really!). I reccomend 100%!!! Great purchase!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of these beautiful shadows.  The first purchase was for myself, the second I purchased two; one for my daughter and one for my granddaughter.  We all love the vibrant and bold colors, the ease of application and most of all the price can&#x27;t be beat.  They arrived in excellent condition and very timely.  I highly recommend these for anyone who is into makeup. I&#x27;ve been wearing them for a while now and they last all day without any creases/lines or fading.  I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> I have to say the product is really good for the price you are paying for, though I would not wear these eyeshadows without a primer or some type of base underneath. I think that is why you get good pay off. Many people thought it was a higher end eyeshadows when I had applied it with a primer/base. My only one complaint is some of the eyeshadows came in broken... BUT because I needed this palette by a certain date and I happen to know how to fix broken eyeshadows (which I have to say only one came in really completely broken the others were just a bit cracked) and it was like about 5 eyeshadows out of 120 of them, I figure its not that bad. Another thing is you have to be careful with the palette because the eyeshadows can fall right out. Now the majority of the colors in this palette is shimmery then matte and the eyeshadows are the size of dimes, but I expected that. I def would recommend this palette more for those who are either learning to apply make up and would like to learn what colors works best for them or if not a starting make up artist with a small budget.</li>
            <li> The size of the eyeshadows are a little bigger than a dime, however there are so many different colors to choose from. Three of my shadows came broken but nothing to cry over.  My overall thoughts on this product is its worth money and would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this palette!! the colors are amazing i totally recommend it!!! and for the price is very nice too!!  this eyeshadow are very pigmented and colorfull!! Don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase it!!</li>
            <li> Words cannot even describe how happy i am that i purchased this product. These are some of the best colors I have seen in one palette. The colors are rich and deep.There are mattes as well as shimmers. With NYX base a little eyeshadow goes a long way. If you are on the fence about this product GET OFF! You won&#x27;t regret it. Especially at this price. I am very pleased and will be purchasing again... if i ever need to. :)</li>
            <li> I received this palette within three business days and there weren&#x27;t any broken pots in the palette at all! I was so pleased with the handling of the package. Also The colors are bold bright and shows up really well. Sometimes you may have to build on color for your preference of intensity, but for me to have dark skin and get compliments on the boldness of color is pretty good! My only thing is that I wish that the red was more defined, because it can be mistaken as pink. But overall I love the colors and the quality of pigmentation!!</li>
            <li> My item came in perfect condition! The colors are beautiful and so bright! It&#x27;s my favorite eyeshadow palette that I&#x27;ve ordered so far. :)</li>
            <li> I got this kit almost a month ago and I think it&#x27;s great. It has a great selection of colors and arrived in a pretty timely fashion. My only complaint is I personally think there could be a brighter selection of reds. Other than that I think it is great :) There were also two damaged eye shadows when it arrived, but I happen to have a rude mailman who throws packages over the fence so, I believe that may have been the cause. They were not too damaged to use anyway. I simply flipped it over the sink and tapped out the excess powder that had become loose and they were fine.</li>
            <li> I loveeeeee alll the beautiful colors! Came way before the delivery date! Its a must buy! Mines came in great condition, no broken ones at all. I have all the pretty colors I need to create new and exciting looks for my nights out!</li>
            <li> THE REVIEW I WILL GIVE IS THIS.  THE PRODUCT IS VERY WELL ORGANIZED BUT ONE ITEM IS MISSING FROM THE ACTUAL SHOWN ITEM.  THE BRUSH IS PICTURED WITH THE ITEM BUT IT DIDNT SHOW UP WHEN  IT WAS RECEIVED.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. So many colors sometimes i myself get confused on what color i want to try on for the day lol The colors last a very long time too especially if you wear an eye primer underneath. Very vibrant colors. Some colors are regular and some have a shimmer to them. Also the product came to me with no broken pieces, i was afraid that would happen but it was packaged very well. Owning this palette beats buying single pots just to own different colors. You will find just about every color in this palette. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my teenage daughter. We were very pleased with all of the color selections. It definitely has any color that you could ever want. It blends well and the colors are vibrant. Our only complaint was that the item was not packaged well for shipping. When we opened it there were 3 colors that had been broken. None of those were colors that she would use and she was too impatient to try sending it back.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are GREAT! Last long, beautiful colors for day or night :) I would recomend for anyone who loves good products with special price!</li>
            <li> This Item was wonderful.  Bought for my daughters Birthday and she uses it all the time now.  Thanks so much we will be making future purchases.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeshadow as a gift for my niece. When it came i was blown away by the colors! They are bright and beautiful. Only one little square was broken but there were other shades of the same color so it was ok. I really love it!</li>
            <li> I will say that a few of the lighter colors need a couple of coats, but otherwise, I found these to be great. I actually bought these for nail designing, but liked them so much, I&#x27;m using them for my eyes as well. :-)</li>
            <li> the colors are great. ordered it for someone else. i was disappointed to open the box and about a dozen of the colors were broken, I&#x27;m guessing from being in the back of the delivery truck.</li>
            <li> The color pay off is great. Had several friends try to buy the pallet off of me the first time they saw the colors.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before ordering this palette and I was not at all surprised when I fell in love with it right away. The colors are so rich and allow you to create beautiful blends. I am not a master of makeup but after buying this product I surely will be watching some YouTube tutorials to make sure that I make the best use of it.</li>
            <li> &lt;3 Its was nicely packaged, nothing was broken, i love it. The colors are really bright an this is the second pallette ive boutghn. :)</li>
            <li> YOU WOULD ABSOLUTELY CRAZY TO BUY THIS PRODUCT AND SAY YOU DID NOT LOVE IT !!! THIS IS AMAZING , I LOVED THIS PRODUCT AND EVERY COLOR THEY SHOWED ON THE PICTURE LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS IT DOES WHEN IT ARRIVES AND IT CAME IN PERFECT PIECE ! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND I WOULD ADVISE ANY AND EVERY WOMAN THAT USES MAKE UP OR HAS A TEENAGE (or older) DAUGHTER THAT WEARS MAKE UP TO DEFINITELY GET THIS ! :D</li>
            <li> Very good product, excellent</li>
            <li> This was a great buy! Fair price, huge selection of beautiful colors, and they all apply vibrant and beautiful ONLY WHEN USED WITH AN EYESHADOW PRIMER! You can get eyeshadow primers fairly cheap from brands like ELF and NYX, by the way! I love these, they come with nudes for every day wear and bright colors for cosplay and the like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is when opened the package smelled strongly of freshly dyed paint/chemicals/something strange. It was quite bothersome. It faded a bit after a while, but it still noticeable every time I use the palette. Still it&#x27;s not unbearable, and I really love this! I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I had been searching for an eyeshadow palette for awhile now. I was thinking about buying either FASH or a high end brand palette.Unsure of what types of quality I would receive from FASH. Id never heard of the brand before. Well I received the package way sooner than.I expected all intact. The packaging was great no broken eyeshadows. The colors were amazing!!! I have used only high end eye shadows and these were no different. With a primer, my color last all day till the next!!! Amazing buy!!!! I loved the price on the 120 palette and the quality. Do not waste your money on expensive eyeshadows. I highly recommend this palette, it has all the colors you need!!!! Remember use a primer prior to applying.</li>
            <li> when i recieve this product, everything looks fine, nothing were broken. I try it on and its totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I arrive in perfect condition, very pigmented product of very good quality, very pleased with the purchase, I recommend this product to anyone. The delivery service was fast. GREAT THANKS</li>
            <li> This palette is great, it has a variety of shades so you can play around and find out what works best for you if your a beginner. You can also achieve various looks which is great if you don&#x27;t have a lot of money to buy individual shadows. I love how you get a combination of matte, shimmer, and even some glittery colors. None of my shadows came broken(it was packaged in double-sided bubble wrap) and since I first bought it I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with my shadows (except one which is my fault because my brush was still wet from the brush cleaner and I couldn&#x27;t wait:the color became hard and I had to chip the top layer off but it was my fault). When I first bought it and tested the matte shades on my fingers I didn&#x27;t like it because it seemed like they were non-pigmented. However when I tried the color on my brush with a concealer on my eye they popped. It is very compact-friendly and cute. I&#x27;d advise one to not throw away the 2 films that come on top of the shadows because the glittery colors can become a little powdery/flaky/loose and will mix with the other colors if those films are not there. There is a pull tab to help lift the second shadow palette (cool colors)up. The texture of the shadows is very velvety and they blend well. As far as smell...well they smell like mineral/any other shadow. I also like how quickly they were sent to me and how the company puts the ingredients of the shadow on the box (not the palette but the box). Some of the colors seem the same (like the matte blacks) but they are only similar. My personal favorites are [Palette 1,Column 1,Row6;P1,C9,R6; all of the reds (there is an orange red at the bottom that looks like a true red but it is not, the 4th red is, and a military green P2,C5,R5 &#x3D; ). All in all it is a beginner - intermediate palette and also worth it if you are just learning a technique and you don&#x27;t know how your creation will turn out or if you like to play around with your makeup around the house. They are also very durable/ hard to smudge and take off. I tested 3 shadows on my hand for pigmentation and put the shadows under water and they did not come off until i scrubbed my hand with soap. I have dry eyelids so I have no problem with these staying on all day.</li>
            <li> Wow, this palette is amazing. The colors are vibrant and matte. I am extremely pleased with this product, except when I got this palette 5 eyeshadows were broken, over all I love it.</li>
            <li> Had issues with item, case is very cheaply made. I am not very happy with this product and there is no way to contact seller with any issues. Order with caution.</li>
            <li> Like any product, there are pros and cons. Let&#x27;s start with the pros:  This palette arrived on time and in good condition. The colors are beautiful and there is so much variety! They also stay on forever with the help of a little primer (most of my other eyeshadows don&#x27;t stay on very long, even with the primer). A little eyeshadow goes a long way in this palette, making it last longer.  There weren&#x27;t many cons to the product. One con that I could think of is that a tiny piece of one of the black eyeshadows was chipped, easily fixable though since the chip was smaller than my pinkie nail, and there are two black eyeshadows in the palette. Another thing that bothered me more than the chip was that the pictures aren&#x27;t quite true to what you&#x27;re really getting. The main reason I got this palette was because it looked as if it had a red eyeshadow, and I had been looking for a red eyeshadow that didn&#x27;t cost me a ton for a tiny amount. However, upon receiving the product, the red turned out to be a shimmery dark pink-magenta (by the way, some colors are matte and some are shimmery, I liked that though.) The color turned out to be really pretty, so not getting a red in the palette was too big of a deal to me.  Anyway, the pros outweigh the cons, and I give this product 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors and how vivid they are, but when the package arrived, at least 6 of the eyeshadows were broken and all over the place.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for me and came just as it should have.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance, a while back and she liked it, a lot! She uses it everyday. There&#x27;s so much colors to pick and choose from. The only drawback to this product is that it seems not to stay on, all day and/or it fades...especially if you&#x27;re someone who sweats easily, in the face or has oily skin.</li>
            <li> I was unsure when making this purchase, though please when it arrived. Not a single shadow had broken off in the process of shipment, and the bubble wrap was a good two inches thick. I wear pretty extravagent makeup on a daily basis, and for someone who mixes on average three to four colors a look (like myself) something like this is perfect. There are more colors in here then you know what to do with, and beautiful shades. The only negative thing I really have to say about this is that a base is a MUST! Though the colors are beautiful, you either need to pack the heck out of each layer you apply (which even then is not exactly perfect)or apply a base coat before applying.     I say anyone who is experienced in makeup and looking for a more \\&quot;wide ranged\\&quot; variety, or someone who is learning to apply multi toned shades, this is a fantastic buy. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> El producto llegÃ³ en buenas condiciones, los colores son muy lindos, era para un regalo y la persona quedo muy contenta, siempre la usa</li>
            <li> The colors show up vividly without primer and they are such pretty colors. With all of the colors this product offers there isn&#x27;t a look that I can&#x27;t create!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product; however, it takes time to put on the bright colors. Maybe if you put a base on your eyelid before applying, the colors may pop. Other than that in the package it looks amazingly colorful but when applied it looks light. Great product overall though.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old palette broke during a move and I thought this would be a good deal. Yes, it isn&#x27;t that expensive but I soon found out why. The colors just don&#x27;t look good on me and don&#x27;t look like they did on the palette like they did on my eyes. I was a little disappointed, I&#x27;ll keep using it but I feel like I have to use A LOT just to get a decent amount of color.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow palette. The pigmentation of the shadows is pretty good, and with primer, or NYx&#x27;s milk on your lids, they sit well and stay pretty vibrant</li>
            <li> This Eyeshadow that I bot was very good they came in very great condition this item was worth your money...... :)</li>
            <li> Does not stay on. Poor quality and pigmentation. Save your money. I threw it out after 2 uses disappeared even with base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to blend! I love it. But one of my eyeshadows came broken :( other than that I was happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Its good quality the only thing is that it has a strong chemical smell .but i recomend this</li>
            <li> Gr8 for the price and I love all of the shades of Color it&#x27;s amazing I get so many compliments about my eyeshadow</li>
            <li> This product contains parabens. Parabens possess estrogen-mimicking properties that have been linked to breast cancer. Along with synthetic colours that are usually derived from coal and are human carcinogens.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!! it is just a bright as pictured and none of mine were broken when it was received! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Not to bring buy jus perfect... just had to buy a eye primer but love all the colors</li>
            <li> I love this makeup kit! The colors are fun an bright. I applied only, once went roller skating and dancing after that. There was no need to re-apply. Stayed on all through the night and it didn&#x27;t crease, smudge, smear or fade. Best eye makeup I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow pallet alot...i do wish it had a shimmer white tho..but over all this is awesome..good price and awesome product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong on this one, it stays on all day the colors are awesome. How could you go wrong with this one, because you just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, smooth, and soft :). I just got it today. A day before its delivery date. It came to me with only ONE color broken which was a pretty baby pink color. I don&#x27;t mind. The rest is perfect in place and shape :D. Can&#x27;t wait to play with the colors. I have green eyes, so I look FORWARD to trying the different shades of purple!!! Worth the money. Would recommend this to friends, family, and strangers ;D. And will order from them again.</li>
            <li> I am so happy! I just got this palette! Let me be one to say nothing broken! Everything was protected great and awesome shipping! Got it within two days! I am in love the eyeshaows are EXACTLY like the picture and it is beautiful! I love these! They are going to come great when majorette starts! I also got the Fash 42 deluxe with the eyeshadow and blush and lets just say a great bargain and investment!</li>
            <li> This palette is medium-sized  but the colors are great! It&#x27;s alright w/o primer, but i recommend using a primer to wear these eyeshadows if ya want vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> The colours are bright and easily applied. Everything came nice and neat. The case reminds me of a tiny laptop. A little colour goes a long way, so long as you don&#x27;t touch it a lot. Primer also helps. I tried this with my new brushes and everything is just gorgeous. The wide variety of colour makes it easy for me to subtly wear bright colours and not look clownish. Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeshadow palette for my daughter who is taking a fashion and design course.  Her teacher told her there are eyeshadows that can be used to color in her artwork.  This palette has proven to be extremely suitable for this and is also great to use as eyeshadow.  The colors are fantastic and her artwork looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I am an eye shadow queen. This compact from Fash is wonderful, what you see is what you get and it came along at a great price.</li>
            <li> FASH eye shadows came packaged pretty ok. I had maybe one or two loose powders in the set, nothing to write home about. the colors are high pigmented and they last. I am satisfied with this purchase and have referred friends to purchase the set.</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows are amazing!  I bought them for Halloween because I needed several colors, but I know I&#x27;ll get much more use out of it than originally intended.  Great price and it doesn&#x27;t fade or crease even after sweating and wearing it for several hours.</li>
            <li> THE COLORS ARE AWESOME, I LOVE THESE BRIGHT COLORS AND THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST</li>
            <li> the colors are vibrant and last at least 12 hours</li>
            <li> colors arent vibrant at all, there too shear and dont show up as they look and i hate that in eyeshadows</li>
            <li> It smells really bad. I wish I would of saved my money and got another palette.</li>
            <li> AMAZING COLORS, WORKS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT WITH MY SKIN (WHITE) AND I USE PRIMER BEFORE MY EYESHADOW AND IT LAST ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT. I DANCE 7 HOURS A DAY AND THEY STAY PERFECT.</li>
            <li> These colors are very vibrant.  I did use a primer with them so I&#x27;m sure that helped.  I didn&#x27;t have any broken shadows when I got the palette in so I have no complaints.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> OMG!! so many bright pigments. Mix and match night and day. Awesome palette</li>
            <li> I love it! Thank you a lot!</li>
            <li> love the vibrant colors and the quality of the shadows</li>
            <li> I love the coastal scents pallets and thought I&#x27;d try FASH since the colors looked so vibrant in the pictures. The pallet itself is beautiful, sturdy and the colors look just as vibrant in person as they do in the photos. However, that vibrancy doesn&#x27;t transfer once you use it. The color payoff is weak and there is a lot of fall out with these shadows. They have a strange chemical smell, as well. I have tried to use several of the shadows and will continue to use when pigmentation isn&#x27;t of concern, however I am disappointed that these are not better pigmented.</li>
            <li> I was so scared because of the complaints stating that their eye shadow was damaged during transit. When I received my product, not only was it speedy but it was well wrapped and handled well. The box itself was bubble wrapped, then the palette was bubble wrapped as well as a thin plastic sheet covering the eye shadows. I guess they learned their lesson because it was unharmed. I was truly taken away by how highly pigmented these babies are. Even without a white eye shadow base, they are very bright. With the base, they are amplified even more. They last a long time and are easily removed with remover or soap. The color selection really impressed me. You have a wide selection of reds, blues, greens, yellows, oranges and even browns. This palette includes some of the best highlight colors Iâ€™ve ever used before. This specific palette is comparable to BH cosmetics 2nd edition palette, with the only difference of a row of colors being in the BH palette. (some more yellows/gold tints.)  I just canâ€™t get enough of this palette. I use it everyday, and can create a number of different looks ranging from high end fashion, to everyday. For the price, the quality is great and some of the most highly pigmented colors Iâ€™ve ever used.</li>
            <li> These colors are good...not a lot of fall out...very bright and pigmented mattes and shimmers! I like them! The reason I&#x27;m giving a three out of five is bc the case was broken on the side may have happened during shipping.</li>
            <li> This was my first makeup palette, and I love everything about it. I love the colors...I love it all!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome palette, everyone should purchase this one...</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s a wonderful product and I will recommend to others. It goes well with my complexion.</li>
            <li> Great product. Flawless when I got it. Goes on great. Waterproof though, so you better have a good makeup remover. I tried getting it off with water &amp; rubbing my finger on my eyelid &amp; it wouldnt budge, even with soap &amp; water. The eyeshadow isnt clued inside the case though, so you gotta be careful or it&#x27;ll fall out &amp; that&#x27;s the end of your eyeshadow. I accidently left it in the car for a few days &amp; when i pulled it out eyeshadow was all over the inside of the case &amp; mixed in with the other eyeshadows. :/ Just be careful with it &amp; it&#x27;ll last you years. Best eyeshadow I&#x27;ve ever had, by far. Definately underpriced.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and well packaged..everything was in tack and nothing broken. I&#x27;m not an expert makeup artist but wanted a variety of colors. Darker colors are great but lighter/brighter ones need more than one or two coats.  I&#x27;m Africian American but have a light skin tone and I needed a primer. Very nice palette for the price!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t come with brushes? lame!</li>
            <li> The case the eyeshadow comes in is very nice. There are two layers of eyeshadow in just about every shade of color you can think of. It was surrounded w/ bubble wrap/packaged well  for shipping, &amp; arrived fast, just in time for christmas. So far it seems to be good make up,  true to its color etc. the only complaint I can think of would be that the eyeshadow seems to be soft &amp; fragile, the case took a minor fall&amp; 4 of the colors crumbled.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter bought this with her own money and she loves it.  It arrived in perfect condition, nothing broken.  The shadows seem very pigmented.  For the price, the quality seems good and there is such a huge color selection I think it will keep her happy for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Some color are more pigmented then the others. But still a good deal.</li>
            <li> I like this product and the variety of colors that it offers. Nice assortment for my dark skin tone.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled when I got my package a bit early! It was so worth the money, the quality of the eyeshadow is great many pigments and beautiful colors. Came in a nice case, and wrap to protect it. Definitely going to buy from them again! Very Happy that my money was spent on something worth</li>
            <li> great shadow for the price the imagination and color combos are endless</li>
            <li> Awesome! the colors are very pigmented and i love the variety, and they last well and dont fade too much in brightness thru the night. the only problem i have had is that they have a tendency to fall a little bit from the eyelid and down under the eyes a bit, but maybe i just put too much on. a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Totally awesome for a beginner :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful vibrant colors I love it</li>
            <li> love it beatiful colors, arrived early</li>
            <li> I did not like the product, but the colors were amazing when I swatch them. The part that I did not like was the palette had a weird smell. When I opened the palette the smell like gave off instantly, which caused me later to get a BAD headache due to the films. I contacted amazon about the problem and they really toke care of it. Yes, I just threw away the palette because I felt it was not eye safe due to the films.</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing. it shipped quickly. its thin and compact.I love the two layers of colors. It makes it easy to travel.</li>
            <li> This product thus far is pretty good.  Other than a few of the colors within the palette they are very vibrant and look good.  Not a bad choice for my first time purchasing a palette, would definately recommend to others who are first time users with cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this palette.  I ordered this a while ago, but I wanted to make sure I liked it before giving a review.  My package arrived before time, and none of the product was broken.  I have several blues and greens, which is okay, but I wish there weren&#x27;t so many.  I LOVE the yellows and oranges!! Also, The blacks and silvers are gorgeous when it comes to doing a smokey eye.  They are very pigmented and shimmery.  The matte colors look well also!! Oh yeah, I also have three reds in my palette that work pretty well, but need time to be layered to look stunning.  I will have a review posted on youtube in a few weeks :)</li>
            <li> Sooo the colors are really nice, instead all color there&#x27;s some nice natural colors. A few shadows came broken which really sort of pissed me off. The broken ones you can still use like a loose pigmented shadow, but that&#x27;s not what really want to expect. It&#x27;s also pretty messy. I&#x27;d recommend instead get the bhcosmetics 120 palette. Sounds like there&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t come broken.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and very hapy whit the product, soo pretty and usefull 100% recomemended. This my second purchase and was succesfull</li>
            <li> I got this today in the mail &amp; I was really excited to open it I loved this super bright colors !! A lot of different colors Ive read that some people pallets came broken but mine was very well handled I will be buying this again :) for christmas gifts :) I&#x27;m to excited to try this soon</li>
            <li> everything is perfect with this palette&lt;br /&gt;the colors are very vibrant and go on and stay on well&lt;br /&gt;there are No broken colors and it was packed very nicely&lt;br /&gt;I will def shop here again</li>
            <li> I ordered this palette back in March. The pigments of the shadows are awesome but most of the shadows broke or popped out the palette :( ..great for the price</li>
            <li> I love this eye make-up! :) It was packaged perfectly and the pigment in the colors are awesome. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it for the colour to show. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> the makeup is great. My daughter loves the bright colors ! they go on well and she can be very creative in her designs ! I would recommend it !</li>
            <li> This doesnt have 4 pallets.....only two....they are showing pics of what it looks like when you have the two pallets inside the case and that they can come out of the case....</li>
            <li> This palette arrived swaddled in several layers of bubble wrap, and every pan was intact. The handsome case is compact and fits into my makeup case. The colors are vibrant, especially with primer or white creme base underneath. Very pleased and considering the neutrals palette from FASH, which is probably more eyeshadow than I&#x27;ll use in a lifetime. ^_^</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This product was/is awesome, It came very promptly. I was excited after reading the reviews about the quality of the pigments, but a little unnerved about the condition that I would receive it in. However Upon receipt I was very impressed and satisfied. The product is awesome the pigment is an A+ as a Mac and Urban Decay fan it&#x27;s hard to find other product lines that match up standard wise. This product is very highly pigmented and will definitely  be a factor in my Make-up artistry tools from Now on. It was received in immaculate condition, Not one of the shadows was cracked or damaged. I give this seller an A+ for both product and packaging.</li>
            <li> The colors are not bright even with primer.  I thought primer would help enhance the pigment.  I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This product I place up there with some of my high end makeup, For me I didn&#x27;t have to put on any eye primer and this eyeshadow stays on all day  everytime I have used it. The colors are amaaaazing.</li>
            <li> The product is ok! But the colors are not very bright.</li>
            <li> I love the fash eyeshadow beautiful colors the only thing is that 8 of them were broke when I got it. I really recommmend this product.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and in tact. I really enjoy having this eyeshadow palette. There are more than enough colors to match anything in my wardrobe. It is long lasting and if you want the colors to come through even more, especially in the evenings, a little primer goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when i received this and it was not damaged, the colors are beautiful and bright. I bought this for a friend and she loved it. We used it right away. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a affordable palette.</li>
            <li> I really like the color choices. I got this for large color choice only, for a week&#x27;s worth of themed makeup. Works great for that sort of thing. It&#x27;s not the best quality of eyeshadow, but you don&#x27;t pay much for them and the colors at least show up well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for daily use or important days like a wedding or prom.</li>
            <li> I just got this and I&#x27;m so happy with it. The colors are even more beautiful in person. They blends super well and with this  you have all the colors that u ever gonna need. The packaging was great. None of my shades were broken. I would recommend this palette to all of u guys.</li>
            <li> I like the colors very much but the packaging needs much improvement.The case comes with 2 eyeshadow palletes stacked one on top of the other and the top palette is not that easy to remove so you risk pulling the top pallet a little too hard that it will fly out of your hand and you got a big mess.Second each palette comes with a plastic wrap and once you remove the plastic wrap there is nothing to cover the eyeshadow from other elements and contamanation.I have not used this product yet because I am trying to find a case big enough so the palettes will sit side by side instead of on top of each other which is what it is packaged like in now.</li>
            <li> I love this pallette it is amazing I totally recommend it I love the colors that are so bright n so pigmented I loved it I defenetly buy this pallette again wit no regrets :)</li>
            <li> Thought it would get a few cracks on some eyeshadow like some ppl said but no! They are all in great condition n arrived in time :D i love it</li>
            <li> Really nice color palette. My Only issue is that 5 of the colors were broken. Other than that the color is vibrant and there are lots to choose from</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier then stated.Came in perfect condition,no broken shadows.Colors are bright and last all day..Great buy.Perfect for a teen/young adult</li>
            <li> For a make-up wear-er this is a great set! I actually droped mine and non of tge color crumbled! I bought it last christmas Last for ever!</li>
            <li> This was great i got it from my mom for christmas and i love it however when i opened the package too colors were mixed but i made it work</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when i received this item.  Some of the eyeshadows were crushed which means I wasn&#x27;t able to use the crumbled ones because I had to dump it.  I was disappointed that I paid more for this item on Amazon when I could&#x27;ve gotten it straight from the company and paid less.</li>
            <li> not as pigmented as i expected, but putting them on with my fingers and/or add a little bit of moisturizer and it helps.  i do love all the colors.</li>
            <li> The Colors selection is great they really pop and are easy to apply long lasting better than sephora pallet also</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you are a makeup person like I am, I eyeshadow is right on the dollar! FYI if you wet your brush and put it in the shadow it will darken a specific color/intensify that color (when you have a primer on over your lid). I love MAC but times are hard these days, and it&#x27;s either the 30 shoes or the one color eyeshadow worth 25? I&#x27;ll go with the shoes please. These colors remind me of MACs. If you are a make-up artist you can make any and all brands work and look as expensive as MAC. FASH has my vote!</li>
            <li> This item was bought for my mom and she absolutely loves it. The colors are so vivid and applies great to your eyes. Must buy item. I may just buy myself one as well.</li>
            <li> To start , The item came in within the 2 days shipping that I had chosen and was packaged well , with no damaged shadows. The colors, however the size of a US dime, are absolutely beautiful in person and go on smooth. I do recommend a primer or shadow base if you want to layer it for vibrancy but are noticable and pretty on their own. I am more than pleased with the purchase and the product. Highly recommend , Great for an experienced make up artist or a student just starting out! ( and for an amazing price as well )</li>
            <li> It is so colorful and it came in quick like 3 days. No palettes where broken, which is great!!!&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product and the colors are very poppy! :)&lt;br /&gt;Consider this product !</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenage daughter and she has loved it. Every day she is trying to come up with new ways to creatively combine the colors. I am thinking of purchasing one for myself. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that, with an eyeshadow primer, she needs touch ups.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors! Good size!</li>
            <li> Really cheap for the amount of colors you get.The colors blend well together even without primer. I use the shades of pinks as blush  and it does come out nicely. I&#x27;ve had this product for over 3 months and still haven&#x27;t run out of any of the colors. The colors are just like the pictures shown and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Great colors arrived perfectly and early ..  !</li>
            <li> This palette is great, it has a variety of shades to find out what works best for you and create different looks. I love the combination of matte, shimmer, and glittery colors.</li>
            <li> I have to say the condition of this package I received I was so impressed with.  It was in bubble wrap, then an outer box, then more bubble wrap.  sThe eye shadow is in a hard case, when opened there are 2 eye shadow pannels, which were individualy wrapped.  Once unwrapping the eye shadows themselves, there is a clear plastic sheet on top of both pannels. The pannels remove easily from it&#x27;s hardcase. When you put them back into the hardcase, there is a ribbon attached to the back of one of the pannels for easy removal from the hardcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye shadows themselves are very impressive.  They are very high pigmented.  Some are more of a flat color while others have a shimmer to them.  The colors are also very organized within the different shades of individual colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommed this product.  You can tell they take pride in the quality of product and the detail in shipping a package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this company, and I look forward to shopping with you in the future.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely NO complaints. This item shipped fast. The product is great. I adore all of the bright colors.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors!!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. A friend recommended it to me and I&#x27;m really happy I bought it.  Quite the variety in colors, well pigmented, and much faster shipping than I expected.</li>
            <li> Colors are just as they seem bold or shimmery. Just what I was looking for that didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> I got this pallet forever ago. still have all of my colors left. i like how i get plain and shimmer of each color and the eyeshadow stays on all day</li>
            <li> Not only did it get here within 2 days with standard shipping, The colors are bright and vivid! Absolutely LOVE! It&#x27;s perfect for my dace makeup and even work. Will recommend to everybody.</li>
            <li> These colors are as bright and beautiful as the picture. goes on smooth and stays put for hours.  would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> i rate it its okay as the pallate had a few colors craked in it. but its ok i can deal with it. over all colors are so beautiful</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much but it works! Pretty colors, although I wish there were a brighter red color. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. The eyeshadow stays on. I love how many colors it has. I would definitely order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I just love this product I mix up the different colors to make my own. My co-workers are always waiting to see what new color I will wear.</li>
            <li> Everything seemed excellent Lords recommend them to all buyers hope to continue so you buy another oppurtunity in to see your offer thanks</li>
            <li> This palette is amazing in every single way. There are so many colors to choose from and the packaging was great. This is a big thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Huge varity of colors and shades! truly amazing! Everything fits into the palette with ease, its light and portable! I&#x27;m so glad i purchased it!</li>
            <li> Received my package earlier than expected and was well packaged. No colors were cracked or broken no mess at all. Very satisfied customer!!!!!</li>
            <li> Really nice vibrant colors! and also comes on really pretty and shows. It&#x27;s not like others that you have to struggle and keep rubbing it on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost all out of my fav colors will get another one soon</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. I ordered this as a gift for my mother and she loves it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> It came SUPER early ordered March 31 got it two- three days later. Amazing look as well. Inside came PERFECT nothing broken. The colors are FABULOUS</li>

            <li> love these eyeshadows. they last forever and have a nice bright color. really recommend it. one came broken but its okay i can still use it.</li>
            <li> I love it. There was only one color broken. Great colors and they blend very well. I&#x27;m very pleased with the price also</li>
            <li> The colors looks fine but the edge of the palette and 4 eyeshadows were broken it! I&#x27;m so upset about it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this palette. The colors is this palette are very pigmented and vibrant. I have played with different looks using the palette and even without primer the color payoff is still great.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with my purchase, probably the best deal on here! The colors are bright and they last a long time , no need to go out and spend 50, 60 dollars on MAC or another trendy make-up line. The shipping as extreme fast as well , I received it within a week from purchase ,while reading some reviews about colors coming in broken I was a bit hesitate but ,none of the colors were broken because there packaging was really secure, The set was in the middle of a sturdy bubble wrap .I would definitely purchase this again and i recommend it to all looking for a variety of bright long lasting colors.</li>
            <li> These colors are very pretty. The case is very cute, the shadows do the trick, they stay on and are easy to apply. I really like them.</li>
