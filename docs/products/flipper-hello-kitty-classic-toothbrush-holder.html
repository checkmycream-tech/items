            <li>It sticks on the mirror pretty well.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>simple and cute.</li>

            <li>It does not stick very well to mirrors, walls, cabinets.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than it sitting out in a cup on the counter.</li>
            <li>Very durable and practical.  </li>
            <li>Really holds toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>i purchase the hello kitty toothbrush holder for myself...and even though i am a senior citizen i really like the hello kitty things...</li>

            <li>The toothbrush comes right out and clicks back in with ease.</li>
            <li>The holder does not fit all toothbrush, have to find a certain toothbrush to fit it.</li>
            <li>This was a LOT bigger than I was expecting, haha!</li>
            <li>My 3 year old loves this toothbrush holder!</li>
            <li>I brought the cute cow last time so it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li>Cute, just a little big.</li>
            <li>a little big and bulky but really cute for any hello kitty lover who is protecting their tooth brush</li>
            <li>I received this toothbrush holder through the Vine program and let my 6 year old daughter test it out.</li>
            <li>The mechanism still works perfectly fine for the past three years, but it sits in the bathroom cabinet now.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than the other holders we had that couldn&#x27;t accommodate chunkier toothbrush handles.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This toothbrush holder is a great place to hold a toothbrush.  I like to keep my kids toothbrushes off of the sink counter so they do not get dirty.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves Hello Kitty.  Shirts, bedspreads, backpack, birthday cake decorations, the works.  She even has a Hello Kitty electric toothbrush.  She was quite excited when we showed her this product.  It was easy to install -- two suction cups on the mirror (we&#x27;ll see how well they hold up).  And it&#x27;s easy to use - Hello Kitty&#x27;s stomach divides into two panels which open up; put the toothbrush into the holder brush side up, close Kitty&#x27;s tummy, and voila!  And yes, it&#x27;s strong enough to hold an electronic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was expecting. It sticks to the bathroom mirror via suction cups and opens up when you pull the handle of your toothbrush. The suction cups stick really well (I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and they haven&#x27;t come undone yet). Plus, how could you go wrong with Hello Kitty?</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush holder. It&#x27;s easy to open and close, plus I feel better than leaving it on the counter. I might get one of those cool UV light ones, but until then, I&#x27;ll keep using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably clean this holder weekly so it doesn&#x27;t end up being counter productive. My toothbrush is perfectly dry in the morning and then again at night. Only problem is that I stick mine on the mirror and sometimes the water drops from the toothbrush handle slides down the mirror and onto the wood frame around my mirror. I might have to move this to my shower stall so it won&#x27;t damage my mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I ended up throwing this away because the hassle of cleaning it was too annoying for me. Plus, I recently changed to an electric toothbrush so I no longer need this holder. I hated cleaning it by using hot water and soap, it was just an unnecessary step that I didn&#x27;t want to add to my busy life. If I don&#x27;t clean it, it gets all nasty inside, just from water residue and the humidity of the bathroom even though I have the ceiling fan in the bathroom. The mechanism still works perfectly fine for the past three years, but it sits in the bathroom cabinet now. I can&#x27;t be bothered to give it a weekly cleaning.</li>
            <li> This was a LOT bigger than I was expecting, haha! But totally cute and will do the job I want, which is protect my brush while traveling, I can also suction cup it to the window, nifty!</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my daugther after my mom gave my 4 yrs old a different kind, they are very convenient and protects toothbrush while holding it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters toothbrush months ago; I wet the suction cups and fastened it on the mirror above the sink. Its never fallen or had to be re-applied; BETTER than I thought itd would be.</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted a toothbrush holder because I read a lot of stories about all the germs flying around bathrooms. I wanted to ensure that those particles were not landing on the brush I was to be cleaning my teeth with. I was happy to try this toothbrush holder and was pleasantly surprised. It was smaller than I thought it would be but it covered the head of my tootbrush and stuck against the mirror in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very cute, being Hello Kitty and I&#x27;m sure little kids would love the fun design and character. I do find it a little hard to open the bottom sometimes though but that may be my own issue.</li>
            <li> I have a 5-year-old daughter who loves Hello Kitty, and now thanks to Sonicare toothbrush, also loves brushing her teeth. This is a well-made toothbrush holder with a good closing mechanism. It is not a drawback, but this is a bit bigger than other toothbrush holders. Very happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush holder through the Vine program and let my 6 year old daughter test it out. She loved the Hello Kitty hanging on the end of her toothbrush and it was great for our frequent travels to Grandma&#x27;s house. I ended up buying more of these as stocking stuffers for all the cousins at Christmas time.</li>
            <li> this is the cutest little tooth brush holder ever! if you &amp;lt;3 hello kitty this is a must have. my bathroom couldn&#x27;t look better.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  Sticks to the mirror and airs out the tooth brush nicely.  Great gift for a little girl.</li>
            <li> it fits full sized toothbrushes. works as advertised. much more hygienic than a tooth brush cup or travel case (toothbrush dries fully each time so there&#x27;s no standing water for bacteria to grow, and the case protects the brush from \\&quot;floating\\&quot; bacteria)</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she loves it. It sticks well to our mirror and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it coming off. Its easy to use and cute.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old loves this toothbrush holder! The toothbrush comes right out and clicks back in with ease. Much easier to use than the other holders we had that couldn&#x27;t accommodate chunkier toothbrush handles. The suction cups are strong, too. Wish I came across this sooner!</li>
            <li> It does not stick very well to mirrors, walls, cabinets. The holder does not fit all toothbrush, have to find a certain toothbrush to fit it. The look of the toothbrush holder was in good condition when I received it. The product just don&#x27;t achieve my purpose.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping it would be. It&#x27;s small and great</li>
            <li> this holder stays attached to the mirror, many suction cups don&#x27;t work, this suction cup works wells</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush holder a while ago. I have been using this for 2 years now, It still works perfect. It sticks on the mirror pretty well.</li>
            <li> Cute, just a little big. My daughter loves it!!</li>
            <li> Daughter received from Santa in her stocking. He also brought her an electric toothbrush though, so the usefulness of this toothbrush holder is somewhat limited. It is very cute, however.</li>
            <li> Great for any Hello Kitty fan - works great and makes me happy happy happy when I brush my teeth!</li>
            <li> I looked for a toothbrush holder for my 20 month old, and ran into one of her favorite characters Hello Kitty.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product five stars for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s absolutely adorable! My daughter loves the fact that her toothbrush is stored in a Hello Kitty holder.&lt;br /&gt;2) Good suctions on the back make it stable.&lt;br /&gt;3) Good quality - opens and closes easily.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to those looking for a fun way to store their children&#x27;s toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and just as cute as you can imagine...</li>
            <li> Very nice tooth brush holder for kids</li>
            <li> I took this with me on a trip and hung it on the mirror of hotels I stayed in. Very nice to have a place to put my toothbrush instead of leaving it on a questionable counter top. It is vented so that my toothbrush dried between use. Pull your toothbrush and it opens; push your toothbrush back in and it closes. On top of that, it just makes me smile when I see it.</li>
            <li> My 17 month old has a little toothbrush that does not fit in our toothbrush holder so I was looking for something just for her. This is perfect! The suction cups have yet to fail me. Hello Kitty has faithfully held on to our mirror/medicine cabinet for over 2 months now. When it&#x27;s time to brush my daughter&#x27;s teeth, I pull on the handle of her toothbrush, the holder stays put but opens up easily. When we&#x27;re all done, I push the toothbrush against the back of the holder and it closes. Simple! And cute!</li>
            <li> I ma loving it. So cute and conveniently store the brush clean ans dry.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush holder. It easily suctions to the mirror and stays put, yet is easy to remove and clean when necessary. Holds my daughters child size toothbrush without a problem. Much nicer than it sitting out in a cup on the counter.</li>
            <li> So cute and neat for bathroom.  Very durable and practical.  Suction stays good.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now.</li>
            <li> Cute and great for home or as a travel case.</li>

            <li> Very cute. Exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> This Kitty did not hold up. Suction no longer works. It is very cute though. But it does not stay put.</li>

            <li> Good to keep my daughter&#x27;s toothbrush hygienic.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Stays on on the mirror of the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have a very little bathroom counter space.  This holder takes my toothbrush and puts it on up on the mirror.  Pull on brush and kitty opens.  Push brush back in and kitty closes to keep brush protected.</li>
            <li> Super cute! If you are a big HK fan like I am, you will enjoy this adorable toothbrush holder. My daughter enjoys it very much. It was so cute, that i had to order another for myself.</li>
            <li> I brought the cute cow last time so it was time to replace it. Its cute and it keeps my tooth brush away from yuck yuck. Easy to clean</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s ok, a good piece, grand seller</li>
            <li> this is super cute.  a little big and bulky but really cute for any hello kitty lover who is protecting their tooth brush</li>
            <li> very nice and funny holder. Quality is also good.</li>
            <li> What else can I say?  It helps to get the kids engaged in brushing their teeth, and is a great place to put the toothbrush for drying.  And the kids never forget to put their tooth brushes away (ok, well almost never).</li>
            <li> i purchase the hello kitty toothbrush holder for myself...and even though i am a senior citizen i really like the hello kitty things...and  i got it mainly for a good cover for my toothbrush..and this one was cute plus it fulfilled its purpose..keep my toothbrush clean and dust free...i had a little trouble opening up the cover but with the help of my grandaughter i learned how and no problem since...&lt;br /&gt;it is a very nice cover for your toothbrush if you want something different...suction cups in back sucks to any glass surface...</li>
