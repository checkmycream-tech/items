            <li>I am glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this lotion for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love the effect of this lotion.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, wish i would have found it earlier.</li>
            <li>This lotion is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Makes an excellent  personal lube.</li>
            <li>Also just make sure to shake before you use.  </li>
            <li>The formula is quick to sink in, smells nice, and feels like there is a protective coat on your skin after it sets</li>
            <li>my husband and sons work road construction and insist this is the best for their rough hands</li>
            <li>If you adore strong scents, get this lotion.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know about this product until a lady that started here as a nurse, and she showed me that this product is very good for relieving dry, cracked skin on hands.</li>
            <li>Works fabulous</li>
            <li>and rubbing it in, it is completely sticky/oil FREE which is nice.  </li>
            <li>The cool thing is that after treatment, the moisture is still on my hands, and I can wait till things get out of control before using it again.</li>
            <li>It actually dries up good and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards.</li>
            <li>It works great, doesn&#x27;t smell feminine or like medicine, and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune like some other types of lotions.</li>
            <li>Mild scent.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped my wife&#x27;s chapped hands and the lack of perfumes or scents is a huge boon.</li>
            <li>This is the best product around for moisturizing your hands without leaving behind an oily residue.</li>
            <li>always effective for dry skin</li>
            <li>I work outside and gloves can&#x27;t be used most of the time.</li>
            <li>Glad I only bought the 4 pk.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands with an oily feeling and has a cooling feeling when first applied.</li>
            <li>I have been using Corn Huskers for over 20 years now, and it has been the ONLY product that keeps my hands from becoming chapped and cracked.</li>
            <li>I mix a half a bottle of this with a half bottle of witch hazel and a tube of benzoyl peroxide for a perfect moisturizer/aftershave/acne</li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes my hands even more dry is that I wash them so often.</li>
            <li>the best cold weather non greasy hand protection.</li>
            <li>Cracked and rough, I&#x27;ve tried so many creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The men in my house really like this product....</li>
            <li>It is gentle and soothing and moisturizing and never greasy.</li>
            <li>I love how I can put it on and wash my hands a hour later and they still feel moist and soft.</li>
            <li>I had to have finger printing done, and the lady gave me this lotion because they couldn&#x27;t get a decent print.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order some more in the future.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in 25 years, but my hands have hit the point where they need an intervention beyond my normal lotions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using this stuff pretty regularly and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Works like magic on dry hands especially during winter.  </li>
            <li>It completely dissolves into your skin leaving them very soft as if you just washed your hands with moisturizing hand soap.</li>
            <li>lotion is clear and feels abit slimy on application.</li>
            <li>My hands and feet are soft sine using this product.  </li>
            <li>They stopped selling this at the grocery store I frequent, so I bought it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Corn Huskers dissolves completely in maybe a minute.</li>
            <li>throw away every thing else , this the only thing worth buying I first used it while in the U.S.Army Ranger Course during ,the  mountain phase, in the dead of the winter the rock climbing and rappelling tears y ones r hands  the skin splits</li>
            <li>I use it for absolutely everything--my dry, cracked feet, my hands, even my face.  </li>
            <li>Only slight downside is that it smells kinda strongly of a lotion/cleaner type smell, but no big deal based on how well it works.</li>
            <li>Corn huskers lotion removes dry dead skin and leaves my hands soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also is very beneficial to the cracking and raswness and thus helps allebviate pain assciated with very dry, cracked skin on hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything with little success, I was told to try this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it - also it works extremely well in this lotion pump which I also got 2 of from Amazon  http://www.amazon.com/simplehuman-15-Ounce-Square-Push-Chrome/dp/B007EAROSK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1408633303&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;lotion+pump+square</li>
            <li>However, I rarely use it because of the sickly baby powder smell that is incredibly strong.</li>

            <li> However, I rarely use it because of the sickly baby powder smell that is incredibly strong.</li>
            <li> I use it all up and down my arms (not just the hands), keeps the dry skin under control very well.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky after a few minutes and it really heals dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has no strong smell and does go on thin but after applying it in the evening, before bedtime, when I know I won&#x27;t be washing it off, I wake up to wonderfully soft, smooth hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wide open Corn Huskers was the only thing that help to heal.</li>
            <li> This fixed it up within a few days tops.</li>
            <li> His job makes his hand dry and cracked in the winter.  </li>
            <li> she has dry hands because of her work.  </li>
            <li> In thwe winter, my hands get painfully dry.</li>
            <li> Since it has no oil I hoped it would help mt dry hands.</li>
            <li> I work with cleaning chemicals and they dry my hands out.</li>
            <li> My hands have always gotten extremely dry and cracked in the winter</li>
            <li> I gave one bottle to a friend with severely dry hands</li>
            <li> who also had dry hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After applying it on my dry skin it dries off and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily which I like a lot</li>
            <li> My hands tend to dry up a lot in the winter months.</li>
            <li> When I met my husband, he had a bottle of Corn Huskers that a previous roommate had left</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is not very inviting, and I haven&#x27;t seen the results on yet.</li>
            <li> A little drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit of &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It certainly helps heal &amp;#34;farm hands&amp;#34; from working in the garage, working outside in the cold weather when you cannot wear gloves.  </li>
            <li> so I tried it and found that it cleared up my dry scaly hands with just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I did notice that it smells a little bit different than the ones I had in the past.  </li>
            <li> It really helps out in the winter with the cold dry air.</li>
            <li> I have to use a second, heavily perfumed lotion behind this for a few days, because I cant handle the scent.</li>
            <li> He uses corn huskers everyday.  </li>
            <li> I also do wash my dishes and my neighbor&#x27;s dishes, usually every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used make my hands very dry, corn huskers help heal my hands without making them  greasy and hard to hold my brushes!!</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores these days.</li>
            <li> My father is diabetic  and his skin on his hands are thin due to age and winter cold .</li>
            <li> I know about this lotion from growing up in Iowa and the tough winters.  </li>
            <li> He is a farmer and his hands get real dirty and this keep his hands soft</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not sticky or weird.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me, but I was skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> If you hate greasy hand lotion, this is for you.</li>

            <li> Best thing for chapped hands!!</li>
            <li> the best cold weather non greasy hand protection. period</li>
            <li> second order of these.... my husband and sons work road construction and insist this is the best for their rough hands</li>
            <li> Ideal to restore moisture to hands of those who handle paper which dries out finger tips.</li>
            <li> This lotion is head and shoulders above any lotion on the market today. It has resurfaced from days gone by...</li>
            <li> great interaction thanks</li>
            <li> My grandpa always used corn huskers lotion and it worked, so i wanted to try it as well. Works fabulous</li>
            <li> I use this stuff year around. It really helps out in the winter with the cold dry air. I work outside and gloves can&#x27;t be used most of the time.</li>
            <li> If you hate greasy hand lotion, this is for you. Without it I would not use any lotion at all</li>
            <li> This is the best product around for moisturizing your hands without leaving behind an oily residue. A little drop goes a long way. The 4pack is a great way to save if you use this every day, however, even one at a time is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Good product. This is hard to find in stores these days.</li>
            <li> My hands are literally peeling away during the summer/fall transition. I had to have finger printing done, and the lady gave me this lotion because they couldn&#x27;t get a decent print. I guess i don&#x27;t remember the smell then, but I did remember the transformation of my fingers. So I bought some. Glad I only bought the 4 pk. I will only use this during this time of year. I have to use a second, heavily perfumed lotion behind this for a few days, because I cant handle the scent. (to me it&#x27;s like fish with perfume) after a while, I stop using this, scrub the scent out, and follow up with hand sanitizer. The cool thing is that after treatment, the moisture is still on my hands, and I can wait till things get out of control before using it again.</li>
            <li> Corn huskers lotion is a very good product . My husband can&#x27;t do with out it. His job makes his hand dry and cracked in the winter.  It&#x27;s heals his hands and prevents further discomfort .  My father is diabetic  and his skin on his hands are thin due to age and winter cold . He uses corn huskers everyday.  My sister has a cleaning business she didn&#x27;t know about the product  she has dry hands because of her work.  Now she uses it.</li>

            <li> Great product. Does a really good job.</li>
            <li> This stuff in the bomb for those pesky winter splits in your fingertips.</li>
            <li> During the winter, I get cracking bleeding hands. This fixed it up within a few days tops. Applied 3-4 times a day, especially before putting on gloves before driving. Works great!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know about this product until a lady that started here as a nurse, and she showed me that this product is very good for relieving dry, cracked skin on hands.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels goopy at first, but once you get past that, and it absorbs into the skin, you feel the benefits. I just need to get used to the initial feel of it on my skin.</li>
            <li> They stopped selling this at the grocery store I frequent, so I bought it on Amazon. I used this daily on my hands and feet when I was working construction to prevent and help heal the damage caused from handling material and the elements. It works great, doesn&#x27;t smell feminine or like medicine, and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune like some other types of lotions.</li>
            <li> Great lotion at a great price. My only recommendation is a pump bottle or different style cap to  make dispensing easier.</li>
            <li> I work with cleaning chemicals and they dry my hands out. Corn huskers lotion removes dry dead skin and leaves my hands soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband use this year around.  He is a farmer and his hands get real dirty and this keep his hands soft and they don&#x27;t crack open in the winter .  this was a good buy...</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this lotion for many years.  Not greasy.  Mild scent.  Works like magic on dry hands especially during winter.  Will definitely order some more in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the effect of this lotion. It is not sticky after a few minutes and it really heals dry skin. However, I rarely use it because of the sickly baby powder smell that is incredibly strong. If you adore strong scents, get this lotion.</li>
            <li> Most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever used. It completely dissolves into your skin leaving them very soft as if you just washed your hands with moisturizing hand soap. My hands have always gotten extremely dry and cracked in the winter but I would never use lotion because they always leave your hands all greasy, even the ones that claim they don&#x27;t. I just tried the O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Working Hands and it leaves your hands waxy for hours. Corn Huskers dissolves completely in maybe a minute. Only slight downside is that it smells kinda strongly of a lotion/cleaner type smell, but no big deal based on how well it works.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, wish i would have found it earlier. highly recommended</li>
            <li> I know about this lotion from growing up in Iowa and the tough winters.  I haven&#x27;t used it in 25 years, but my hands have hit the point where they need an intervention beyond my normal lotions.  The formula is quick to sink in, smells nice, and feels like there is a protective coat on your skin after it sets but it&#x27;s not sticky or weird.  I gave one bottle to a friend with severely dry hands and she is loving it as well.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me, but I was skeptical about it. So I found it at my local grocery store and bought a bottle. After a week, I bought 12 bottles here on Amazon so I can give it to my family and friends who also had dry hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product surprisingly works. A little bit of &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; goes a long way. I put lotion in quotes &#x27;cuz it&#x27;s called lotion, but does not feel like lotion. It&#x27;s not oily or greasy. After applying it on my dry skin it dries off and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily which I like a lot</li>
            <li> have used Corn Huskers lotion for 50 years.  The lotion is as good today as it was then.</li>
            <li> The men in my house really like this product....because IT WORKS!!!!  It certainly helps heal &amp;#34;farm hands&amp;#34; from working in the garage, working outside in the cold weather when you cannot wear gloves.  My brother-in-law is a 200-head-herd dairy farmer who also uses and loves this product.  We highly recommend this product.  Bought it from Amazon because my local store stopped carrying it....maybe it wasn&#x27;t fancy enough.</li>
            <li> This lotion is my favorite.  I use it for absolutely everything--my dry, cracked feet, my hands, even my face.  It is gentle and soothing and moisturizing and never greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this stuff pretty regularly and really like it.  Just a minute or two after putting it on hands or face etc. and rubbing it in, it is completely sticky/oil FREE which is nice.  I highly recommend it - also it works extremely well in this lotion pump which I also got 2 of from Amazon  http://www.amazon.com/simplehuman-15-Ounce-Square-Push-Chrome/dp/B007EAROSK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1408633303&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;lotion+pump+square</li>
            <li> Makes an excellent  personal lube.</li>
            <li> I have been using Corn Huskers for over 20 years now, and it has been the ONLY product that keeps my hands from becoming chapped and cracked. If you want a simple product that WORKS you need to try Corn Huskers lotion!</li>
            <li> This is basically what skin food is made out of. I mix a half a bottle of this with a half bottle of witch hazel and a tube of benzoyl peroxide for a perfect moisturizer/aftershave/acne cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also the best value for Cork Husker&#x27;s lotion you can find online at the moment.</li>
            <li> always effective for dry skin</li>
            <li> It actually dries up good and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards. I would recommend it. My hands tend to dry up a lot in the winter months.</li>
            <li> When I met my husband, he had a bottle of Corn Huskers that a previous roommate had left so I tried it and found that it cleared up my dry scaly hands with just a few uses. It seems when you put it on that it won&#x27;t sink in, but if you quit rubbing it will absorb quicker. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands with an oily feeling and has a cooling feeling when first applied. I apply it morning and night and my hands and feet no longer are cracked and bleeding.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is not very inviting, and I haven&#x27;t seen the results on yet. I will not be ordering this again, one of the bottles came open and it spilled in the envelope that this was sent in. Not the best packaging</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and intact!</li>
            <li> Best hand lotion made.</li>
            <li> Been using nothing but corn huskers lotion for years to maintain hands for kettlebell training. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!  I did notice that it smells a little bit different than the ones I had in the past.  But I hadn&#x27;t bought any in a year or so.  Also just make sure to shake before you use.  And a little bit goes a long way.  I love how I can put it on and wash my hands a hour later and they still feel moist and soft.</li>
