            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Buffing your nails is great, because there is no polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>However, it is still a great product because it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>

            <li>The cuticle oil is very rich and penetrates the skin wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I bought these because the item from the mall was so good.  </li>
            <li>I cannot give any good rating on a product that I have never received.  </li>
            <li>The cuticle oil is good too.</li>
            <li>You need to use the buffer fairly rigorously for it to do its job.    </li>
            <li>These are the best, my hands look as if they have been freshly manicured all the time.  </li>
            <li>but I am glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>love this place!</li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of upset.</li>
            <li>I used it on all of my family members and now they want me to buy them their own kit.  </li>
            <li>not as good as the original I purchased 5 years ago in Texas</li>
            <li>They are as shiny as a mirror and so very smooth.  </li>
            <li>so I was super happy to see the product available for sale on amazon....</li>
            <li>so I looked it up on amazon and bought a buffer and cuticle oil for 11.90 free shipping!  </li>
            <li>I was able to buff my nails once before it wore out, so</li>
            <li>As many others mentioned, I was approached by an executive of Seacret in a mall with a kit that had this buffer, cuticle oil, fil and a moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>I love what this nail buffer does to my nails as I can&#x27;t wear nail polish for my profession.</li>
            <li>I Love This Buffer.</li>
            <li>I really Love how these buffers take care of my nails.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have used these products before and love the results.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more asap</li>
            <li>They seem to work much better than others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived very quickly but when I opened the box</li>
            <li>My nails look fabulous even without nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the way it makes them feel and how shiny they are.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy these nail buffers, but they don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;seacret\\&quot; labeling or instructions</li>
            <li>If she&#x27;s happy, then this was a solid purchase.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited about getting it, but the lady said that the price was originally $60 something dollars.</li>
            <li>I had bought the seacret nail buffers several years ago at a mall and loved them, and I was so excited because I found them again.  </li>
            <li>The buffers do an amazing job on your nails and give you a professional shine.</li>
            <li>came quickly &amp; you should see my nails now.  </li>
            <li>The buffing block is an amazing product and no other product in the market matched this.  </li>
            <li>I came on amazon to see if this product was something not well known and couldn&#x27;t be bought anywhere, but to find out that you can buy it online and for a much cheaper price!!</li>
            <li>My nails have significant ridges and this product can do a good job of smoothing them down.  </li>
            <li>It is so quick an easy and your nails will have a new found strength with weekly application of the mineral oil.</li>
            <li>Found it here for very inexpensive and got free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Definately worth the money.    </li>
            <li>I did not have success in getting the Seacret product I ordered with Her Passion Company.</li>
            <li>Within minutes I get pretty nails, and my boyfriend isn&#x27;t wrinkling his nose at the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a different buffer in the past, but this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across!</li>
            <li>When this arrives in the mail it doesn&#x27;t look like much but !</li>
            <li>The oil is not a neccessary product but is nice if you have rough cuticules.</li>
            <li>The price was much higher than at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Also shouldn&#x27;t use blue more than once a month as it makes the nails thinner).  </li>
            <li>Which is ok, but next time I will return for the item I ordered.</li>
            <li>The nails really look shining after buffering, and it could last about one week or more.</li>
            <li>The buffer shines my nails like no other and the oil keeps my cuticles looking smooth.</li>
            <li>The buffer blocks I was sent seem like they must be generics, since they don&#x27;t say Seacret on them and the white side of them wears out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>stars, absolutely.</li>
            <li>Although I dont care a lot about the cuticle oil, but maybe its me who didn&#x27;t really need the oil.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product before and really like it.  </li>
            <li>really like these nail buffers.  </li>
            <li>Over time the original buffer wore out and her nails have gone back to ridges and bumps, but no longer.</li>
            <li>buy lots of extra buffers as the white part wears out quickly!!  </li>
            <li>I had to reference an older, worn-out seacret buffer for the instructions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I highly recommend buffed nails, and this nail buffer set in particular.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>The tape on the lid of the oil looks like normal packing tape, applied by hand and all wrinkled, crumpled up.  </li>
            <li>oh WoW!</li>
            <li>My wife loves these little blocks and wore out the last one and the extra replacement panels were a nice addition from the shipper.  </li>
            <li>The  nail buffer leaves your nails looking like you have a clear coat of polish on them.</li>
            <li>It just makes your natural nails look understated and classy, shiny and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I found that this was just the old version I still felt misled by the pic.</li>
            <li>This product makes your nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pissed, it&#x27;s only $20 for the whole set here.</li>
            <li>Attached them to the old block as a start.</li>
            <li>The white side actually peels off during the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always having to remove polish from my fingers because when I try to paint my own nails, I feel like a little kid who hasn&#x27;t learned how to stay within the lines (my hands shake a little).</li>
            <li>With just a simple buffing action, your nails will look like you put a clear coat of nail polish on them.  </li>
            <li>My nails were weak from having acrylic nails and no longer able to keep up w/getting them done.</li>
            <li>Use the blue side first, then the grey, then the white.</li>

            <li> Use the blue side first, then the grey, then the white.</li>
            <li> Someone at the mall was promoting this product, and the price was a little high, so I didn&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
            <li> Well I have 3yr warranty, so maybe it&#x27;s worth it, because I can replace them whenever it becomes no good.</li>
            <li> (A head&#x27;s up, these buffers don&#x27;t last long at all.)</li>
            <li> So it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not that different from the $1.99 buffer blocks you can buy at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> The nail oil is as expected, though I only purchased this pack for the buffer blocks.</li>
            <li> It is the same thing as in the mall, and it does the same trick, it really makes a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> Last week a lady at the Kiosk chased me down and buffed a nail on me.</li>
            <li> and so she brought the price down to $45 dollars for me, so I paid $48.94 total.</li>
            <li> She got some for Christmas a few years ago when a display was set up at the local mall.</li>
            <li> Amazon had to actually cancel the order because the seller never confirmed shipment of my order.  </li>
            <li> But they work well, so I&#x27;m not really complaining.</li>
            <li> Other Than That</li>
            <li> This buffer surpasses all other buffers.  </li>
            <li> I would like to know other companies that sell it.  </li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve had on other official seacret buffers.</li>
            <li> And I really can&#x27;t work with fake nails.</li>
            <li> *, oh well, at least I got what I paid for, but I won&#x27;t pay such a price ever again!</li>
            <li> But the oil seems less functional.</li>
            <li> These are tough and last longer than any other brand she&#x27;s owned.</li>
            <li> and the weak nail felt instantly stronger!</li>
            <li> It really give a crazy shine.</li>
            <li> Overall, poor presentation.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used them for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> But I really don&#x27;t like the look of boring bare nails.</li>
            <li> Not sure this product doesn&#x27;t weaken my nails, thank goodness</li>
            <li> Only Thing Wrong</li>
            <li> In less then a minute, you will transform your dull, boring nails into smooth, glossy nails.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to remove, and when i did, the paint on the lid came off, and the bottle is permanently sticky.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was still a little skeptical about trying this product</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the Seacret logo was absent, but the product seemed to be the same and is a lot less expensive than what you would need to buy in a Seacret box.</li>
            <li> Already have the lotion but to expensive for the nail kit at the mall.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical the day a woman came up to me in the mall trying to promote the product, but after a couple minutes I was entranced with the results!</li>
            <li> And with this, no more waving my hands around like an idiot because we don&#x27;t have TV and I&#x27;m very bad about sitting still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was no trying to choose a color that may or may not clash badly with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The price was outrageous</li>

            <li> Great product.  I have the shiniest nails in town!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use as 1, 2, 3 and SHINE.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.</li>
            <li> My wife had given up hope of ever seeing these again. She got some for Christmas a few years ago when a display was set up at the local mall. Over time the original buffer wore out and her nails have gone back to ridges and bumps, but no longer. These are tough and last longer than any other brand she&#x27;s owned.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear nail polish, because I work in a warehouse, and any time I do wear nail polish, it inevitably starts to chip off within hours of being at work. Plus I&#x27;m convinced polish makes me short fingers look stubby. And I really can&#x27;t work with fake nails. But I really don&#x27;t like the look of boring bare nails. Buffing your nails is great, because there is no polish. It just makes your natural nails look understated and classy, shiny and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no trying to choose a color that may or may not clash badly with my skin tone. I&#x27;m always having to remove polish from my fingers because when I try to paint my own nails, I feel like a little kid who hasn&#x27;t learned how to stay within the lines (my hands shake a little). And with this, no more waving my hands around like an idiot because we don&#x27;t have TV and I&#x27;m very bad about sitting still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I highly recommend buffed nails, and this nail buffer set in particular. It&#x27;s great. Within minutes I get pretty nails, and my boyfriend isn&#x27;t wrinkling his nose at the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars, absolutely.</li>
            <li> The item arrived very quickly but when I opened the box I was kind of upset. The nail buffers were not the same as the one in the picture. Although I found that this was just the old version I still felt misled by the pic. However, it is still a great product because it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> My nails were weak from having acrylic nails and no longer able to keep up w/getting them done. Last week a lady at the Kiosk chased me down and buffed a nail on me. and the weak nail felt instantly stronger! The price was outrageous so I looked it up on amazon and bought a buffer and cuticle oil for 11.90 free shipping!  I had a different buffer in the past, but this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across! You get salon looks w/o paying allot of money to get them done!</li>
            <li> I bought these because the item from the mall was so good.  The buffer blocks I was sent seem like they must be generics, since they don&#x27;t say Seacret on them and the white side of them wears out very quickly.  I was able to buff my nails once before it wore out, so it&#x27;s really not that different from the $1.99 buffer blocks you can buy at the drug store.  They do seem a bit shinier, however, which is why I gave them 2 stars instead of one.  The nail oil is as expected, though I only purchased this pack for the buffer blocks.</li>
            <li> Best product ever.  Already have the lotion but to expensive for the nail kit at the mall.  Found it here for very inexpensive and got free shipping.  Had product within a few days and am getting ready to place another order from them.</li>
            <li> The nails really look shining after buffering, and it could last about one week or more. But the oil seems less functional.</li>
            <li> When this arrives in the mail it doesn&#x27;t look like much but ! oh WoW! the results from using them will change your mind. If you are like me and don&#x27;t like or can&#x27;t wear fingernail polish but do like shiny nails then this is a must have product. The oil is not a neccessary product but is nice if you have rough cuticules.</li>
            <li> Someone at the mall was promoting this product, and the price was a little high, so I didn&#x27;t purchase it. And I found it on amazon. It is the same thing as in the mall, and it does the same trick, it really makes a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> Not sure this product doesn&#x27;t weaken my nails, thank goodness I didn&#x27;t buy it at the kiosk at the mall.  The price was much higher than at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I cannot give any good rating on a product that I have never received.  My girlfriend had been patiently waiting for almost 2 months.  Amazon had to actually cancel the order because the seller never confirmed shipment of my order.  The seller did not respond to my order status request.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was still a little skeptical about trying this product but I am glad that I did!  The product is absolutely wonderful!  My nails look fabulous even without nail polish.  They are as shiny as a mirror and so very smooth.  The cuticle oil is very rich and penetrates the skin wonderfully.  This is a must-have!</li>
            <li> I had bought the seacret nail buffers several years ago at a mall and loved them, and I was so excited because I found them again.  These are the best, my hands look as if they have been freshly manicured all the time.  I would buy them again anytime.</li>
            <li> This product makes your nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li> Looks different than the photo.  The 2 buffers come lose in the shipping carton among styrofoam peanuts.  There is also some lose buffer sides (unwrapped, lose amongst the peanuts) and a bottle of oil with plastic tape around the lid.  There is no Seacret logo anywhere except on the oil bottle.  There is no instructions whatsoever (you&#x27;re supposed to use the blue, gray and white sides in that order.  Also shouldn&#x27;t use blue more than once a month as it makes the nails thinner).  The tape on the lid of the oil looks like normal packing tape, applied by hand and all wrinkled, crumpled up.  It is hard to remove, and when i did, the paint on the lid came off, and the bottle is permanently sticky.  Overall, poor presentation. I wonder if this is from the Seacret brand, or generic.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail buffer I have seen. It really give a crazy shine. The cuticle oil is good too. As many others mentioned, I was approached by an executive of Seacret in a mall with a kit that had this buffer, cuticle oil, fil and a moisturizing cream. It was $69, but when he tried the buffer on one of my nails, it was like never before and I was so into buying it. But, I have this habit of checking everything back in Amazon, so I did not buy it there. When I checked in Amazon, I saw two buffers + a cuticle oil for just $10 which was awesome and I baught it there. I love them and have to say Amazon Rocks..!!!</li>
            <li> The buffers are what I was after. Everything was just as displayed. (A head&#x27;s up, these buffers don&#x27;t last long at all.)</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I was skeptical the day a woman came up to me in the mall trying to promote the product, but after a couple minutes I was entranced with the results! It is so quick an easy and your nails will have a new found strength with weekly application of the mineral oil.</li>
            <li> The buffing block is an amazing product and no other product in the market matched this.  Definately worth the money.    Although I dont care a lot about the cuticle oil, but maybe its me who didn&#x27;t really need the oil.</li>
            <li> I love what this nail buffer does to my nails as I can&#x27;t wear nail polish for my profession. Though, I only found out about this product in the mall and I was so excited about getting it, but the lady said that the price was originally $60 something dollars. I told her I only had $50 and so she brought the price down to $45 dollars for me, so I paid $48.94 total. I came on amazon to see if this product was something not well known and couldn&#x27;t be bought anywhere, but to find out that you can buy it online and for a much cheaper price!! I&#x27;m so pissed, it&#x27;s only $20 for the whole set here. I knew I should&#x27;ve just walked along and checked up on it when I got home. *Sighs*, oh well, at least I got what I paid for, but I won&#x27;t pay such a price ever again! Well I have 3yr warranty, so maybe it&#x27;s worth it, because I can replace them whenever it becomes no good.</li>
            <li> I Love This Buffer. Only Thing Wrong Was One Side Started To Peel Off. Other Than That It Works Great.</li>
            <li> Not the same buffer block from the Seacret vendor at the mall. The buffer has no label saying it is Seacret. The white side actually peels off during the first use. So it won&#x27;t last long. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This buffer surpasses all other buffers.  I was at a mall one day when a lady approached me and demonstrated the power of this buffer on one nail and I swear I could see my reflection in that nail! She was only selling it with a lotion gift set which I didn&#x27;t want so I was super happy to see the product available for sale on amazon....love this place!</li>
            <li> My wife loves these little blocks and wore out the last one and the extra replacement panels were a nice addition from the shipper.  Attached them to the old block as a start.</li>
            <li> I like this Seacret product and would recommend it to men and women. I would like to know other companies that sell it.  I did not have success in getting the Seacret product I ordered with Her Passion Company.</li>
            <li> I really Love how these buffers take care of my nails. I have used them for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> The buffer shines my nails like no other and the oil keeps my cuticles looking smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like writing reviews but I am so in awe of this product that I had to share my thoughts with others. This product is truly amazing.  In less then a minute, you will transform your dull, boring nails into smooth, glossy nails.  There are no toxic chemicals involved.  With just a simple buffing action, your nails will look like you put a clear coat of nail polish on them.  I used it on all of my family members and now they want me to buy them their own kit.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money at a nail salon or are just looking to have a polished look to your nails, run out and buy this product.  You are going to be so impressed you will order more for family and friends.</li>
            <li> Prima Produkt. Die Lieferung hat zwar zuerst nicht geklappt, aber nach Reklamation wurde es 10 Tage später mit UPS zugestellt. Ich bin sehr zufrieden. Die Wartezeit hat sich gelohnt. Produkt ist in Frankfurt 3x so teuer.</li>
            <li> The Seacret nail buffer is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used! it leaves your nails looking like glass! The cuticle oil works great too!</li>
            <li> not as good as the original I purchased 5 years ago in Texas</li>
            <li> My nails have significant ridges and this product can do a good job of smoothing them down.  I enjoy the way it makes them feel and how shiny they are.  It also seems to reduce the cracking along ridges.  You need to use the buffer fairly rigorously for it to do its job.    I was disappointed that the Seacret logo was absent, but the product seemed to be the same and is a lot less expensive than what you would need to buy in a Seacret box.</li>
            <li> I enjoy these nail buffers, but they don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;seacret\\&quot; labeling or instructions like I&#x27;ve had on other official seacret buffers. I believe they are imitations. But they work well, so I&#x27;m not really complaining. I had to reference an older, worn-out seacret buffer for the instructions. FYI: Use the blue side first, then the grey, then the white.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it! Works great and was delivered ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> These products work just as advertised. The buffers do an amazing job on your nails and give you a professional shine.</li>
            <li> This kit has 2 thingys and replacement thingys, it was a bargain and she loves it! If she&#x27;s happy, then this was a solid purchase.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before and really like it.  I have never used a buffer that leaves the nail as shiny as this one does.  I would definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! In the malls they have vendors who sell this for $40.00 and up. This was under $20 and it keeps your nails buffed to a great shine, so it looks like you&#x27;ve had your nails done!</li>
            <li> If you want your nails to look like they have polish on them, then this is the trick.  Takes the ridges out an buffs them up like diamonds!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used these products before and love the results.  Wonderful cuticle oil which you can apply and wipe off with a cotton ball.  The  nail buffer leaves your nails looking like you have a clear coat of polish on them.</li>
            <li> I received the buffer, but the oil that was sent was not the oil for the buffer itself. It was the nail cuticle oil. Which is ok, but next time I will return for the item I ordered.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  It works great.  It not only shines up my nails, it strengthens them as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful.  I use this system once a month and I have noticed a great difference in my nails.  My nails are stronger than they have ever been.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use this system.</li>
            <li> came quickly &amp; you should see my nails now.  buy lots of extra buffers as the white part wears out quickly!!  I will be ordering more asap</li>
            <li> really like these nail buffers.  Great price.  They seem to work much better than others I have tried.  Would recommend.</li>
