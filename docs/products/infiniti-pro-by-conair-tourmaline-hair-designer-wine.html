            <li>This is a great blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It was shaped with a wand style handle very easy to use on your hair with great results!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO MANY PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li>and I can do a very nice job with this.</li>

            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>and I was SO HAPPY! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The decision to purchase this item made it on my &#x27;Top 10 Best Decisions of My Life&#x27; list.</li>
            <li>Lovingly!</li>
            <li>Two words: this dryer plus the pro styler flattening iron and brush all in one equals: Own them!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, easy to use and gives a salon like look.</li>
            <li>After the discount from Amazon, it&#x27;s really a very good deal and sure we will go for Conair again.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see my hair look so healthy and beautiful again!</li>
            <li>I was was looking for a good blow out.</li>
            <li>I just got it today, and I really loved it.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks just as good as it does when I get it blown out at the salon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good hair dryer, hair come out shiny..  </li>
            <li>as good</li>
            <li>Does a good job or smoothing out curly hair</li>
            <li>It is fairly compact and helps her combat frizz.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer itself is good, I like it, but when I put the attachment on it, it doesn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li>Used it twice, put it away for good.</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer for my beloved wife.</li>
            <li>and it looks as good as it ever does after I do that.</li>
            <li>(Wine)]]I LOVED THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>so all in all it was really good</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair look almost as good as when my stylist does it.  </li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>The product built quality is good.  </li>
            <li>The concept is a good one.</li>
            <li>This product did not work at all at straightening my hair, its not even a good blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Your hair can get tangled if you don&#x27;t section it off or do a good comb through before drying</li>
            <li>Good for straightening, but the curling did not work.</li>
            <li>But if you decide to go ahead and buy it, I wish you good luck.</li>
            <li>All products I have loved and used for years.</li>
            <li>and I am good</li>
            <li>and it seems to be a good dryer.</li>
            <li>This is a good blow dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair looks just as good as if I had gone to the Dominicans.</li>
            <li>It still works as good as the day i bought it.</li>
            <li>I can agree with all of the good comments.</li>
            <li>While it does take practice to become adept at using the attachment, once I mastered it, I really love it!!  </li>
            <li>It also had a beautiful, healthy shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>even if the straightening attachment doesn&#x27;t work for you (which i can&#x27;t imagine why it wouldn&#x27;t) the blow dryer itself is very good and is strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine this dryer might not work great for you if you have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure this product is great for even the thickest and curliest locks.</li>
            <li>I have fairly curly hair, and this has been an amazing help.</li>
            <li>i was happy to be able to find it.</li>
            <li>My hair can be very challenging and this help eliminate a lot of the work.  </li>
            <li>so I made sure to purchase it...especially at this great price..</li>
            <li>I am happy and glad that I ordered this dryer.</li>
            <li>This dryer impressed me right away when I tried it without even reading instructions.</li>
            <li>Right now I have salon perfect hair without having to use a straightening iron.</li>
            <li>One more time I read great reviews and was expecting a nice product, and...not again.</li>
            <li>The first use will require some patience and care to figure out the technique that works best for you.</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I just love this thing!  </li>
            <li>This dryer got my hair smoother than my straightener ever has, and I have a lot more body too!  </li>
            <li>(and I am sure that a downpour would be another story!)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with it.  </li>

            <li>this hair dryer is amazing</li>
            <li>It is just simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>The best that can be said for this thing is that it won&#x27;t take up too much space when it goes into your drawer forgotten and unused.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it does a nice drop blow drying without making it too frizzy.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>I had to give it a good 3 months to become a better user of it.</li>
            <li>But after that, it worked really nice.</li>
            <li>I liked my results.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hair dryer for any type of curly hair that you want to get straight.  </li>
            <li>I have been SEARCHING for 20 years for an effective way to straighten that doesn&#x27;t take forever or prevent me from having my morning shower.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to just use this dryer and have my hair come out straight and perfect like it&#x27;s advertised</li>
            <li>I would reccomend it if you have the money to spend on a nice blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked using this conair product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product yesterday and am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I get nice results either way.  </li>
            <li>and I honestly saw a difference in the way her hair looked.  </li>
            <li>She can use it on her own hair and it works as promised.</li>
            <li>I think Every girl should own one.</li>
            <li>Nice product and the seller delivered as promised.</li>
            <li>Every person with medium-to-long hair should own one of these things.  </li>

            <li>The blow dryer made this task quick and easy great!</li>
            <li>I tried out the hair dryer this morning for the first time and found it to be one of the most wonderful purchases I&#x27;ve ever made for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this dryer, it does a great job, easy to use with my carpal tunnel.  </li>
            <li>I locked in my style with the cool shot button, and even when I got caught in a drizzle while doing my Christmas shopping, my style still looked great.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy, so i can&#x27;t tell you it&#x27;s great on super curly hair.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and does a really good job.</li>
            <li>Great item for my super curly hair....</li>
            <li>For some reason with out the blow out, it sheds and breaks very easily.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use</li>
            <li>Is very easy to use and does not make you tired.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The dryer is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have never been good at blow drying my fine hair, and would either look like a puff ball, or just a clumb of frizz.  </li>
            <li>I know right!!!</li>
            <li>This dryer is a miracle worker for my type of hair; drys quickly and straightens for a very nice look.</li>

            <li>I use it right before work since I shower the night before and my hair looks great.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind, my hair is very fine, which makes it easier to straighten.</li>
            <li>and it was really easy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooooooooooo easy!</li>
            <li>I have very fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the smooth transaction and excellent service we are used to..</li>
            <li>So far, this is the best and most efficient hair dryer I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is very easy to use, and makes a better result than hair straightener alone.  </li>
            <li>My hair is wavy/curly and within 5 minutes, my damp hair is transformed into straight and beautifully styled.  </li>
            <li>It sounds too good to be true, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>You get a very smooth look</li>

            <li>but this one is much better.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>The Conair people should find a more durable way to hold the attachment on.</li>
            <li>I have already recommended this to many friends.  </li>
            <li>I am really glad i bought and</li>
            <li>Well.. this was interesting.</li>
            <li>Just for that I love it.</li>

            <li>I think I will get more efficient.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome hair dryer for people who just cannot control their dryer and a brush at the same time.</li>
            <li>She has tried many others from time to time and swears by this model.</li>
            <li>so my hair would be more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>do a much, much better job.</li>
            <li>I have medium length somewhat curly hair, layered on the top and sides, and I bought this item after seeing it on TV and looking at it on this site.  </li>
            <li>i love this hair dryer, i got it for christmas,</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It is an ok dryer.  </li>
            <li>So I guess they could design that part better.</li>
            <li>But it does last well over a year and does a great job!</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Also gives me flips when I want them--- I love this thing.</li>
            <li>OK, here&#x27;s what you do....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten soooooo many compliments on my hair since I bought these two pieces of equipment and started straightening this way.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more from this product.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer -</li>
            <li>The attachments stay on safely once you click them in place.</li>
            <li>I got it for Christmas, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love love, LOVE the Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer.  </li>
            <li>I have a conair straightener that I abosolutely love</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m glad i got it.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love the attachment.</li>
            <li>ENJOY!</li>
            <li>This hair dryer delivers on it&#x27;s promise and more.  </li>
            <li>&quot; but it probably cuts off about 15 minutes :)</li>
            <li>you have frizzy or staticy hair, I&#x27;d recommend using your favorite anti frizz/static lotion, cream, or</li>
            <li>On good days, which rarely happen, my hair likes to spiral up and out otherwise</li>
            <li>While I love the dryer and if it broke today I would buy another</li>
            <li>Received as a gift for christmas after watching the infomercial at Bed, Bath and Beyond and absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and I have more frizz in my hair than ever.</li>
            <li>Coworkers have asked me what I&#x27;m doing to make my hair look so much better.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help touching my hair when I pass by a mirror.</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Conair 1875 Watt Styler Dryer for many, many years and have mastered the thing.  </li>
            <li>It will probably do a better job than what you are doing now.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad i pestered my husband to get it for me :)</li>
            <li>all I know for sure is that it did not work on my hair...</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair with this technique.</li>
            <li>It has been a lifesaver many times for me.  </li>
            <li>so it looks better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it and</li>
            <li>As for the heat, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>someone who has fought with their hair texture for most of their life, this hair dryer is a blessing.</li>
            <li>I.  Love.  </li>
            <li>after using this blow dryer for about 6 months, i have to say i still love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to straighten my hair with a blow drier alone.</li>
            <li>I thought this blow dryer would give me a better result than others I have tried.     </li>
            <li>I can see how it might work better on thicker and fuller hair than mine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure as I work with it</li>
            <li>Perhaps I had better learn a technique that would straighten without making my hair poofy.</li>
            <li>and we both love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too lovely to be able to do it all in one step, with one tool.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased this product, I thought I would get a lot more for my money.</li>
            <li>BONUS! : )</li>
            <li>love this hair dryer  </li>
            <li>I have never had so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this tool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Satisfied customer :)</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>Love the variety of attachments.</li>
            <li>This is great for the price and dory&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li>This worked much better and saved more time.</li>
            <li>it also dramatically reduced my drying time - i&#x27;m IN LOVE.</li>
            <li>So I rated it 3 stars because I hoping for better results from the straightener.</li>
            <li>Before I had this product, my hair looked frizzy most of the time and felt rather course.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have been straightening my hair for a couple of years, but since I have been using this dryer, I&#x27;ve received many compliments on how healthy my hair looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this dryer.</li>
            <li>OK this dryer cost more than I wanted to pay</li>
            <li>I was able to straighten my 15 year olds hair in 20 minutes give or take.</li>
            <li>Definitely a worthwhile purchase.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to maneuver it&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>Sure wish Conair would reconsider making the BC173 available again!  </li>
            <li>So glad I waited and got what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Now if they don&#x27;t stop making it before I need another one. :)</li>
            <li>This one is trying to be too many things, as you can see the brush part comes off an</li>
            <li>The more I keep talking I should rate this even lower...</li>
            <li>the attachment with the comb is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Everyone who uses it buys it :)</li>
            <li>but it makes it more manageble.</li>
            <li>If I could give it more stars, I would.</li>
            <li>i was never dexterous enough to handle a brush and a dryer, so this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love this dryer, it straightens just like I need it too,</li>
            <li>As most of you know.</li>
            <li>I totatlly love this blowdryer</li>
            <li>love this thing lost the attachement though ):</li>
            <li>I have used this product and I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>The one feature that I am extremely pleased with is that the attachment locks into place and does not come lose from the dryer in the drying process.  </li>
            <li>favorite blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Oh how I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>It works a bit better without it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>My hair is medium to fine which  should make it very easy to use with this gadget.</li>
            <li>I saw this and was very excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s WONDERFUL), buy the Remington T3 Tourmaline flat iron and buy some Chi Silk Fusion or Biosilk.</li>
            <li>so a flat iron &amp; hairdryer have been my best friends for years &amp;</li>
            <li>Light weight, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a great hairdryer, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to work a hairdryer with a round brush so this all in one hairdryer (which is also  a great travel size) with attachment is a great solution.   </li>
            <li>and thought it would be a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>, IT GOT A 4*s, now that&#x27;s pretty good).  </li>
            <li>hair salon blow-out, or home blow out with a good hot iron to finish it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 5 years now and it still works as good as the first day I bought it.</li>
            <li>It also get&#x27;s good heat although not too hot.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s safe to assume most people buying this product will have curly hair and would therefore need one, so I consider this to be a huge oversight.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to master for even the most inept of users.</li>
            <li>It takes about 20-30 minutes to dry and style my hair now, which is  wonderful, and I have tons of shine and volume; it looks like I just came from the salon.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer is perfect for me to dry my hair with before I straighten.</li>
            <li>so one can more easily work with it.</li>
            <li>I mostly like how its not bulky, easy to handle</li>
            <li>After moderate use the the comb straightener attachment sometimes rotates on its own during use which doesn&#x27;t make me happy</li>
            <li>I live in a place with 65% humidity, and for the first time, my hair held perfectly for 3 days in a row, with out needing to go over with an iron.  </li>
            <li>i highly suggest it to anyone who wants a good straighner, i talked my friend into buying one, YAY ME!!</li>
            <li>Once I actually read them, it impressed me more (and once I watch the video, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be floored, haha!)  </li>
            <li>Since I am by no means wealthy, you can imagine how fantastic it must work and how out of control my hair is.</li>
            <li>but a far cry from the frizzy nightmare that I have experienced up to now.  </li>
            <li>This is the best $55 I&#x27;ve ever spent on my hair.</li>
            <li>when I saw this I thought wow, this would be awesome if it really did work!  </li>
            <li>However,if you (like me) have already found a tried and true way to blow your hair straight with great results, stick to what you are doing and don&#x27;t bother with this.  </li>
            <li>Best $60 I ever spent on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li>the plus side, this is fairly light-weight and does eliminate a step if you have fairly straight hair and just need polishing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the idea is good, but I just don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve really perfected it here</li>
            <li>I used it with good results before watching the included DVD (really?</li>
            <li>it gives a great blow out with body and volume that lasts and is excellent as preparation for final styling with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>And after trying it for the first time, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Best 30 bucks I have ever spent!</li>
            <li>sweet revenge, because it works!</li>
            <li>I have nappy hair, Dominican hair that gets very curly and very frizzy once there&#x27;s humidity, but this product is actually very good for my hair.</li>
            <li>product is really easy to use and makes your looks</li>
            <li>As soon as I got the hang of it, it was so easy</li>
            <li>Took a bit to get used to how to hold it and move my hair with it, but once I did, its so easy.  </li>
            <li>so I could easily return it.  </li>
            <li>Attachments are easy to take off and put on.</li>
            <li>Was it relatively easy to use?  </li>
            <li>Once I did that, it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use, easy to manuver and durable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>I have lots of hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how easy it is.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my long, beautiful silky hair.  </li>
            <li>The video they send makes it look so easy to straighten your hair.  </li>
            <li>This is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This product is a good dryer, but the staightening function is not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Using this dryer, my hair has the bounce I get after getting a professional blowout, it&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li>The quality is really wonderful and the DVD was Ok but somehow pretty too short and not that much rich but does the job.</li>
            <li>I just bought this dryer, and so far i&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>So you might not be able to just pull it out of the box and go, but with just a tiny bit of trial and error, anyone should be able to use this and get good results.      </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best dryer I have EVER</li>
            <li>, it looks as good as new.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li>but I still had to follow it with a Chi flat-iron which was fine with me.</li>
            <li>I have curly shoulder length fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so impressive that I got one for my niece who is half African-American.  </li>
            <li>Does nothing for my fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>A personal recommendation for those who purchase this item and have pretty curly hair: The manual says to find the best tension (1,2,3, or 4) depending on your curl type.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and light  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I&#x27;m less than impressed.  </li>
            <li>Which was fine.  </li>
            <li>The blowdryer works fine, but the straightener did not work at all for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length fine hair</li>
            <li>I dont think this product well unless you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>This dryer works fine.  </li>
            <li>This one is more powerful and dries hair more quickly.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to, but, I am VERY HAPPY with it.</li>
            <li>This dryer gets a little getting used to in terms of how best to hold it</li>
            <li>It always looks so easy on tv, but is not user friendly at all-</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get stick straight, but it does get smooth with nice curled ends.</li>
            <li>Even the back of my hair feels great and smooth.</li>
            <li>Is indispensable for me.</li>
            <li>still enjoy the quality of Conair&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>so it is smooth and shiny.    </li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t get as straight as I would&#x27;ve liked it to be.  </li>
            <li>and it was so smooth.</li>
            <li>Even after I slept on it all night I woke the next day and still felt so great</li>
            <li>This dryer looks so funky but works nicely and is fairly gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>It helps smooth and straighten the hair.</li>
            <li>The tension dial on the comb allow me to adjust it if I&#x27;m using it on my hair (which is now lightly relaxed) or on my daughter&#x27;s hair (which is 100% unrelaxed).  </li>
            <li>Instead of twisting and contorting my arm all over, I just turned the nozzle so that my hand was always in a comfortable position.</li>
            <li>It looked much more powerful and well designed</li>
            <li>This product is all it claims to be...within 10 minutes I am transformed from a screaming banshee to a civilized business executive.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it regularly and is happy with it.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really light and compact.   </li>
            <li>I wish it was available in stores however.</li>
            <li>I was brokenhearted to see it wasn&#x27;t available in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>It was so great I already bought a second one.</li>
            <li>There is a diffuser available for the Infiniti, too.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair fast, and styles it nicely.</li>
            <li>and it finishes silky smooth</li>
            <li>Works great on coarse hair!</li>
            <li>I now can have straigt, shiny hair, almost as good as a professional blow-out.</li>
            <li>The different tension types really help you find the best setting for your hair, and the heat is not unbearable.</li>
            <li>It does really good for my hair considering I&#x27;m going natural...</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Maybe with time I will get more adept at drying it even fast, but right now I cannot complain about 20 minutes of drying time.  </li>
            <li>The dryer can get very hot, and if your fair is already brittle or damaged the high temperature may exacerbate it.</li>
            <li>But other than that, this product is very good.</li>
            <li>combine this with a flat iron (because my hair is very curly) and I end up with a great look!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!!  </li>
            <li>I had recently ordered this blow dryer and I love!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take some time so if you&#x27;re looking for something quick &amp; easy</li>
            <li>First of all, the dryer is lightweight and the straightening attachment rotates so that you can angle to whatever position&#x27;s most comfortable for you when drying.</li>
            <li>What a thrill, plus it&#x27;s quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The straightening attachment gets VERY VERY hot and falls off  too easily.</li>
            <li>It doesnt get hot at all, more like high warm at it&#x27;s highest setting.</li>
            <li>I lost lot of hair in the first use and am scared of using it any more.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time today and it took me 45 mins start to finish with better results, and I know it will be even faster once I get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I originally thought the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; and \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; thing was just a gimmick</li>
            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>I bought this originally for $59.00 but just got it here on Amazon for my (twin) sister for $39.99.</li>
            <li>I had the long comb style dryer infinity by Conair before and it did a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li>When I tried the conair infinity I was excited by a bit aprehensive.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>-Im pretty sure my life wont go that way</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>For me, that alone was worth the price!</li>
            <li>This dryer doesnt get real hot and your gets caught in the comb on the attachment.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer originally at a department store.  </li>
            <li>So worth the money!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li>It does straighten hair but the best part is that even long hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled in like the older styles with the intake on the side of the dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fast and easy to use!</li>
            <li>I saw this product and thought it was too good to be true - dry, straighten, bodify, de-tangle, and smooth all in one?!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it and such a great price.  </li>
            <li>It is really great because before i had to blow dry then straighten my hair because the blow dryer would always leave some waves.  </li>
            <li>The attachment is brilliant and has cut my style time in half.</li>
            <li>My sister raved about how much she loved it, me....not so much.</li>
            <li>I WILL NEVER USE A NORMAL DRYER AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li>and it honestly seemed a little too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>Other styler dryers are more effective with higher wattage (I&#x27;m currently using another Conair at 1875 watts with brush attachment) and high heat settings, which is much more effective for straightening hair, however, does cause a great deal of breakage.  </li>
            <li>This little \\&quot;Hair Designer\\&quot; was very surprising.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is pretty light and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, right out of the box but the instruction CD and printed booklet are helpful too.</li>
            <li>This new product falls very short of my expectations, however, is on the right track for the perfect styler-dryer.</li>
            <li>Forget trying to style in a wave under, or trying to reach the roots for more volume or shine or control, unless you have a giant head and very strong arms.</li>
            <li>really does make a huge difference in the texture and shininess of my hair!  </li>
            <li>The finish and effectiveness as my wife says, is really great and as expected from the Ads.</li>
            <li>I got the hang of flipping the ends and my hair is pretty straight with nice flipped ends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great blow dryer, it keeps my relaxed hair looking permed after it gets wet.</li>
            <li>Nothing has ever been able to get my hair this straight - not even a trip to the salon.</li>
            <li>use the cool button when done for smoothness.</li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer, my hair is curly and very frizzy this product reduces the frizz by atleast 50%.  </li>
            <li>I have not had success yet with getting my ends to curl under or to be smooth.</li>
            <li>Once finsihed, I passed the dryer through my hair on the cool setting.  </li>
            <li>I love how it makes my heair all shiny and heathy and straight</li>
            <li>Also, use the cool shot button on each section to finish it (closes the hair shaft and locks in style, i.e. helps eliminate frizz).  </li>
            <li>blowdrying my hair because it took so much time and, yes, if I wanted to straighten it, it would taken even MORE time (almost TWO HOURS).  </li>
            <li>soft and has a nice sheen to it...</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this device.  </li>
            <li>It looks cute and modern, but it does not straighten the hair as it \\&quot;promises\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Using the comb-like attachment didn&#x27;t really help get thru the tangles, so I just switched to the more focused dryer attachment.</li>
            <li>but I returned mine for a full refund.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it (though I wouldn&#x27;t pay $60 for ANY hairdryer period).</li>
            <li>Thank-you Conair for designing this and for Amazon for having fast and efficient delivery :)</li>
            <li>I love the attachment as it really smoothes out my hair.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 because it does not straighten as smooth as a traditional straightener, but its an excellent traditional hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Cool blow dryer, doesnt get my hair bone</li>
            <li>The dryer works quickly and really does leave my color treated hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to get the hang of the combs.</li>
            <li>360 degree rotating head is great but be careful!</li>
            <li>Very good dryer especially for my 3c natural hair</li>
            <li>However, I was getting tirred of spending over an hour every time, I needed something quick, so I ended up ordering it.  </li>
            <li>Three passes on each section and my hair was nice and straight - NOT BONE STRAIGHT</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;m lucky, so I&#x27;m returning this for a cheaper, simpler dryer.</li>
            <li>still haven&#x27;t viewed the DVD that came with this product, but a quick glance at these reviews told me just about everything I needed to know.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, it really isn&#x27;t any better and isn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li>decent blowdryer, but you could find cheaper ones for sure.  </li>
            <li>It does straighten hair, but isn&#x27;t as quick as the advertisements would have you believe.  </li>
            <li>Lucky to find it on amazon</li>
            <li>I have had this hair dryer before and loved it, unitl my husband by accident dropped it into the toilet</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, is within a decent price range, and my sister and I both love it.</li>
            <li>It is so quick and my hair looks like I have been to a salon.  </li>
            <li>When I recived this package I opened it up jumped in the shower and got out as quick as I got in.</li>
            <li>Dries my shoulder length hair quickly.</li>
            <li>:) Just make sure to get the proper heat protection before doing any of this so to protect your hair from the heat.</li>
            <li>My hair still has the volume, but it&#x27;s shiny and healthy looking, and the right amount of straight.</li>
            <li>The attachment gets very hot, so use a wash towel when removing it.</li>
            <li>---that&#x27;s very hot).  </li>
            <li>I set the tension to 4 (highest) and it grabs pretty well, but I still have to use my free hand to keep my hair from blowing out of the comb.  </li>
            <li>it gets very hot against my neck.</li>
            <li>Instead the rotating combs manage to tangle my hair more than normal.</li>
            <li>So, for a sleek, straight look, I find it incredibly easy and quick, and have recommended it to friends.  </li>
            <li>If you have the patience and you get more adept at using it, you can get your hair really straight and not have to use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love my new Conair Infinity designer.  </li>
            <li>I returned this item right away for a full refund.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that this works great for some--specifically those with wavy  or slightly curly hair</li>
            <li>Works fast and easy to straighten and defrizz.</li>
            <li>Plus it is fast and is easy to work.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and very durable.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t:  an easy way to achieve salon straight blown out hair style.</li>
            <li>takes a good 20 min for it to fully dry.  </li>
            <li>I have probably gone through 5 flat irons (settling on the Babybliss , best flat iron</li>
            <li>I was able to soak the straigtening attachment in warm water and the flocked discs were not worn at all, just matted down with hair products</li>
            <li>The product is pretty good, nevertheless I bought the product expecting to be a new product, came wrapped in bubble wrap, with scratch, was sold as a new item but was used!</li>
            <li>The hot air styler is smaller (better for travel) and may be ok if you have thinner or shorter hair.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed is that this is not a product for people with short/shorter hair at all!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried everything to get it to stay straight!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>It was fast, easy and well the worth it.</li>
            <li>It can be easily detached for cleaning or to replace with the traditional attachment that is also included with this dryer if you did want to use it with a rounded brush for more bounce.</li>
            <li>hair dryer is not only easy to use, but it saves time and is better for your hair.</li>
            <li>other than that its still going strong and i love it!</li>
            <li>But it makes my hair silky soft and very smooth,</li>
            <li>I have fine, very wavy hair, and a lot of it,  and didn&#x27;t know if this would work for me</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t a burnt smell to my hair and my hair really was smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hair was smooth, straight, &amp; still had body to it</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really get my hand comfortable yet.  </li>
            <li>The hair looks much silkier and Smooth than ever before.     </li>
            <li>Conair took the old stick-style Hair Designer and made it better.</li>
            <li>but WELL worth the investment.</li>
            <li>This was well worth the $50.</li>
            <li>The air gets REALLY hot &amp; since you&#x27;re using your free hand to guide your hair, it can burn your fingers or neck &amp; your hair gets really hot.</li>
            <li>I own a Babybliss straightening dryer (Babybliss is the French version of Conair)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost for anyone looking to straighten or just speed up their drying time.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The only nice quality of this product is its color.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>but it was worth it in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>much* better than it did with my old hairdryer</li>
            <li>This product was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain (especially when traveling!)</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve never been good at the whole styling thing using multiple hands</li>
            <li>My hair ends up being so soft, straight and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Since I own three already, the sixty-dollar one has to go back.</li>
            <li>It seemed that it worked best on people with thick, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most important feature and it doesn&#x27;t work properly.  </li>
            <li>well worth it.    </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>We both had fun trying it</li>
            <li>This is completely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to get my natural hair</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, that I ordered a second one just in case this one breaks.  </li>
            <li>It has made my naturally wavy hair much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I just kind of wish there were different settings for temperature air that comes out.</li>
            <li>but I decided that I was worth it.</li>
            <li>I have been fighting my curly, wavy, frizzy, thick hair since I was a teenager (many, many, many years ago).</li>
            <li>Honestly, if I had known this product was going to exist, I wouldn&#x27;t have cut my hair last year.</li>
            <li>I loved the older model, which was lighter and dried my hair so much more quickly.  </li>
            <li>I skip the instructions, click on the special nozzle and expect super straight hair........</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because no matter what they tell you, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair as straight and sleek as a good flat iron.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and dries my hair quickly leaving my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it does do a good job at drying my hair overall pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I even used it right after coloring and there was no frizz or damage.</li>
            <li>Right from the start it wouldn&#x27;t cooperate.</li>
            <li>The hair is just blown right out of the attatchment.</li>
            <li>and I was right not to think that.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, it makes your hair very soft and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It comes out pretty straight and frizz free</li>
            <li>Continue, letting more and more hair down while putting it through the drier.</li>
            <li>This is so great, my hair is dry in 20-30 minutes instead of the hour it used to take with my old drying</li>
            <li>I love that I can get pretty straight hair without having to apply the extra heat from a flatiron, and it gets the job done very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY wavy hair that would never stay completly straight no matter how many styling products I would use; I was ready to do a chemical relaxer when I saw the magazine ad for the Infinity.    </li>
            <li>OK, it didn&#x27;t give me the dreamy hair I get when I leave the hairdresser&#x27;s, yet, it was far better than a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li>so it is not for the usual hair drying techniques but does a great job for what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small sized so it will be a great travel blow dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft, fine, shoulder length, and just about the curliest hair you will find.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions of using the straight nozzle attachment first, and then the special ceramic one.</li>
            <li>It did not give me a just-from-the-salon super straight look, but it did allow me to very quickly and easily dry my hair whilst easily detangling it.    </li>
            <li>This was a great find for a person who doesn&#x27;t like to waste a lot of time getting ready.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how fast it drys my hair, in fact, in gets extremely hot, thankfully there is a cool shot button.</li>
            <li>Works great on my type 4 African American hair.  </li>
            <li>I let my hair dry on its own for awhile, then finish with this dryer.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using it for most of my hair then attach the concentrator attachment and finish the top and front with my round brush.  </li>
            <li>I have a nice glossy finish and it does not leave my hair looking damaged and dry.</li>
            <li>A nice blow dryer for straightening the hair when you&#x27;re short on time or don&#x27;t really feel like it.</li>
            <li>Nice concept, but does not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>this is a great blow dryer for someone like me, who wants to tame frizz at all costs.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say it got my hair as straight as with a flat iron, but honestly I didn&#x27;t think it would.</li>
            <li>(it took my fine naturally wave-prone hair and made it look Jennifer Aniston-esque in</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I took my time &amp; went slowly following the manuel the 1st time I did have great results, my mom couldn&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t flat iron my hair</li>
            <li>You may be wondering why then, if I loved my other dryer so much, did I decide to try the Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer?  </li>
            <li>THis dried it fast, I still have to use a straight iron, but this is a great start to a nice blow dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for new ways of straightening my hair and was excited when this product first came out.</li>
            <li>Those of us with natural hair know that when we are drying higher heat helps make the hair more manageable, even though your hair looses moisture with high heat</li>
            <li>I am a African-American woman with not so course or kinky hair but definitely unruly since I don&#x27;t use chemical relaxers any more.</li>
            <li>The plastic hooks are pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>The rear airflow is a much better solution to avoid breakage, but needs to have hotter temperatures to actually straighten the hair.  </li>
            <li>So what do I do with this hairdryer at first?</li>
            <li>but it really isn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer took 20 minutes off of my getting ready time!  </li>
            <li>So Much Faster!</li>
            <li>Your better off buying a cheaper hair dryer that does the same job.</li>
            <li>the first two times I have used this.</li>
            <li>then you need, go over a hair section, and then switch to one higher, go over that section again, and do that until you reach tension 4.</li>
            <li>(I used it on setting 1 the first time and it DID rip some of my hair out, but that WAS my fault).  </li>
            <li>It took about an hour; remember, this was my first time</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a first.</li>
            <li>used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>I threw the box out the first time I used this dryer.  </li>
            <li>but this was my first time using the dryer</li>
            <li>so I might not have given it enough time to work its magic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cumbersome</li>
            <li>but I mastered it with the first use.    </li>
            <li>I read the other reviews before I bought this hairdryer, and I am so glad I bought it!  </li>
            <li>The combination of straightening and softening my hair was what I was interested in for this product.  </li>
            <li>I watched the instructional DVD and read the instructions to make sure I was using it properly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different blow dryers and I stink at it.  </li>
            <li>She used to have Braun dryers before and this was our first experience with Conair.</li>
            <li>This product takes no time at all and works very well!  </li>
            <li>I really looked like I had just been to a salon!  </li>
            <li>I put in my favorite straightening product and then brushed it through.</li>
            <li>I pulled the top section back out of the way and put the bottom sections in the dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It found it easier to do sections @ a time by clipping most of my hair back when doing a section</li>
            <li>She often straightens her curly hair but the hot iron was drying her hair out.  </li>
            <li>I love Conair and is the only product I buy when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li>However, it does make my hair get pretty darn hot.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time tonight</li>
            <li>;-)  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>;-) &lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how exactly it works</li>
            <li>i bought this hairdryer because although my hair is straight already, it needs some shape on a night out!</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>My first Infiniti hair dryer lasted almost 7 years.</li>
            <li>Ill find out its a wonderful product when I can allot 3 hours to do my hair</li>
            <li>, hot feels really hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty hot, just wish it was a bit hotter.</li>
            <li>I used the Infiniti for the first time this morning without looking at the instuctions</li>
            <li>You have to use the dryer with out the straighten attachment first, but it takes just a couple minutes.  </li>
            <li>I came back to work looking fabulous!</li>
            <li>I have had this for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Then I would add a curl under w/my hot air brush.</li>
            <li>The first one I owned lasted about four years.  </li>
            <li>NOW, since the Infiniti, my hair is smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Many years later, I still use it.</li>
            <li>I would pay the same or more now since this is a hair dryer that somehow has flown under the radar, straightens my hair in a flash.</li>
            <li>Overall, this dryer performs better than any salon blow out</li>
            <li>This dryer is much better than using a regular dryer and hairbrush to straighten the hair.  </li>
            <li>Silly me, this blow dryer is great for all hair lengths and types!</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and have not been able to insert my hair properly in the tooth brush attachment.  </li>
            <li>It does not get extremely hot</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer, especially the comb attachment.</li>
            <li>Be sure to have the comb enter your hair first, as I put my hair through the middle plates first and had a lot of hair fall stuck in the ceramic plates.</li>
            <li>This i my second blow dryer after revlon, and i love it.</li>
            <li>This product pays for itself after the first time you do your hair.</li>
            <li>FIRST</li>
            <li>I had this dryer for a few months and absolutely loved it until it broke</li>
            <li>My family is a great mixer and our hair comes in every beautifully full type, to thinnnn thin baby type.</li>
            <li>this probably isn&#x27;t for you &amp; I&#x27;m 1 of those people who is always looking for the fastest &amp; best way to dry &amp; straighten my hair so while it worked, it took a little longer than I hoped</li>
            <li>And quite frankly I always envied those women who could get themselves together quickly compared to my \\&quot;high maintenance\\&quot; (and often not satifying) hair routine.</li>
            <li>This is a beauty must have for long curly hair, I blow dry in sections bottom to top &amp; this is an amazing invention.</li>
            <li>To make a very long story short, I read the directions, put it to use and within 10 minutes I had a great style.</li>
            <li>Another good thing about this dryer is, it really did reduce my styling time in half.</li>
            <li>With this product, I get a smooth and soft look, with more volume than the flat iron would leave me.</li>
            <li>Because I get SO much volume, I&#x27;ve been able to go several more days without washing my hair (total added bonus!).  </li>
            <li>It works so much better than my flat iron straightener.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the Instyler and flat irons and have not been pleased with the results, ease of use, and felt they were frying my hair and giving me breakage.</li>
            <li>and if I want even more straightening, I will use my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I get SO many more compliments and saving at least 20 minutes a day really adds up!</li>
            <li>I purchased this item as a replacement to 3 other blow dryers I own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m on my second one of these, and I&#x27;ll be using them my whole life I&#x27;m pretty sure.</li>
            <li>so I did have to use a flat iron to finish my sleek look :)  </li>
            <li>shot button doesn&#x27;t work well, it keeps blowing warm, although not hot, air&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>However, for a more sleek look after drying, I need to spray on some shine and then use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I am so amazed on how straight, smooth, and soft it got my hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you separate your hair into sections using clips (which the instructions suggest doing!) and dry section by section, then it&#x27;s really quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>I have a very stubborn wave in my hair that nothing in my entire life has been able to correct except for this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>20 minutes later my arms are sore but at least my hair looks great!  </li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair, and bought this for my sister who has shorter hair now, thinking it was better for her.</li>
            <li>:) Just like when my stylist does it, my hair came straight with ease and looked like a salon style blow out only without the salon price tag</li>
            <li>and I pretty much have to rip it out, there is no other way to free myself.</li>
            <li>With this dryer, you MUST mostly dry your hair first before the straightening attachment will be able to grab your hair</li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying that I asked for this product for Christmas after reading a couple of positive articles on it.</li>
            <li>I think it might work better if you have long hair, or hair</li>
            <li>It saves me so much time and, after two years, the comb has not broken!  </li>
            <li>but when I want it straight, it was the blow dryer first with a brush followed by a straightening iron.</li>
            <li>I think it is better meant for long layers or one length hair</li>
            <li>of this dryer is EXTREMELY hot and it is very cumbersome to use.  </li>
            <li>it remained in good condition when I moved it out this past March.  </li>
            <li>Others have complained that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, but I found it to be perfect - hot enough to do the job well and quickly, but not so hot that it fried my hair.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it til today because I was intimidated by the directions, but it was a snap once I realized you can kind of push it down on the hair</li>
            <li>I wanted to go with straight hair, it meant dragging out the ceramic straightener, the hot rollers, or the large barrel curling iron.</li>
            <li>and I used the device on setting # 3 but with low heat as the high heat was drying my hair faster than I was able to use the device.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I purchased this one is because I had their other model which was FABULOUS!!!</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the photos showing someone with very long hair using this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver even in the back of my head, and I don&#x27;t even have to section my hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use the hairdryer for touch ups the next morning.</li>
            <li>The instructions, reading them helped a lot!, were easy enough</li>
            <li>The commercial makes this product look easy to use, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It definitely dries my hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Blow dryer is simple &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>So you will still need your flat iron, but other than that, it is great for a conair product.</li>
            <li>It looks easy on TV commercial, but is not in reality.  </li>
            <li>I dry and straighten my hair at once with more volume than a straightener.</li>
            <li>My hair looked as well or better as when I dry it in sections with the $235.00 hairdryer and a large brush.  </li>
            <li>As far as straightening, although I missed a couple of spots I simply touched up on, it&#x27;s probably one of the most effective ways to straighten, and my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel as dry/damaged as it does when I use other methods.</li>
            <li>I use a large barrel curling iron on ends to finish styling.</li>
            <li>but it is certainly sleek and manageable</li>
            <li>The infiniti did SUCH a good job, though it took a few minutes to figure out how to work with the special head</li>
            <li>My shorter hair is styled with layers, and the styling head for this dryer is too large to use on them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After shampooing, conditioning, applying various products including Lotta Body Coconut and Shea Style Milk (that I have recently started using and have had very good results) and untangling my hair, I use the Infiniti to dry and straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was able to dry my hair in 15 minutes!  </li>
            <li>This dryer certainly dries fast, and straightens, but my hair comes out frizzy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how well it works, but it does take a little effort to learn how to use effectively.</li>
            <li>I use a ceramic iron and then a spiral curling iron (also ceramic)...which still makes for a pretty high maintenance style, but this hair dryer defintely makes it a lot easier.   </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s only $3) and that also makes a huge difference in the smoothness/silkiness of my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend this!</li>
            <li>you will get straight strands.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer straightens and smoothes hair very well.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to take the frizz out of their hair without drying out your hair.</li>
            <li>and it is really shiney which is something I strive for.  </li>
            <li>I still had too much wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I now have hair almost as straight as Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>If you are wanting a completely straight look then you might want to use a hair straightner like a chi.</li>
            <li>The diffuser dries my hair really fast.</li>
            <li>The straightening attachment gets my hair straighter than it is (it is naturally very wavy)</li>
            <li>but I still definately need to use a straight iron.</li>
            <li>However, the issue of heat is real.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very reliable Conair styler.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This is basically a dryer with an unusual ceramic comb attached to the end.  </li>
            <li>And it is under $40 which is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this hairdryer a few times since I bought it last week, but I must say, I&#x27;m impressed with the results!  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer was what I expected and more.</li>
            <li>The DVD wasn&#x27;t really helpful to me</li>
            <li>and it was not as straight as I wanted.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer makes straightening hair SO much easier...</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Really, dont buy it.</li>
            <li>I prefer to wear it straight, and this dryer does the trick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, too.</li>
            <li>The roots are totally straight.    </li>
            <li>but if you have very curly hair like me (sprial curls) DON&#x27;T BOTHER.</li>
            <li>straight since I was about 15</li>
            <li>, I really don&#x27;t find it that time-consuming (it takes me about 30 minutes--my hair is very curly</li>
            <li>The one thing about very curly hair and straghtening though, is that you need to spend a lot of time on the ends or you&#x27;ll end up with frizzy ends that look damaged even when they&#x27;re not.</li>
            <li>If you have very curly hair and can relate to what i&#x27;m talking about, then just step away from the \\&quot;order now\\&quot; button.</li>
            <li>So instead of spending 2-3 hrs washing and straightening her hair, it&#x27;ll now probably take me 2 - 2 1/2 hrs for the whole process.      </li>
            <li>The product does not make the hair straight as advertised.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I have ringlets, frizz, waves, and straight portions, which makes styling a challenge.</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend them together!</li>
            <li>It really takes about a week to get used to this dryer.</li>
            <li>This is much easier.</li>
            <li>Depending on where you place the dial is how straight it will make your hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of products on my hair to keep it straight.  </li>
            <li>I got this hair \\&quot;designer\\&quot; as a gift after talking about it &amp; how much I wanted it for 2 or 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you may want to get a cheap mirror you can hang across from the mirror you&#x27;ll be looking in b/c if you can see the back of your head</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier&lt;</li>
            <li>It performs much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Her hair looks so much healthier now.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t blowdry my hair at night, because i think that would be too much damage with blowdrying and then using a straightening iron.  </li>
            <li>but then I found this feature to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Just coming to this page to buy another for a friend who tried it and wants one too.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it dries your hair up really fast which will save you some time.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t straighten very well at all.  </li>
            <li>I still used a hair straightener when I was done using the dryer but that is because I wanted to get my hair really straight.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I have very curly/ frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as a straightener, but that&#x27;s what I like about this.</li>
            <li>It really works very well.  </li>
            <li>Id need a whole day to watch video and learn the correct way to use this on my short,curly hair but perhaps if and when that day comes</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make the hair completely straight though.  </li>
            <li>or you could really burn yourself and/or damage your hair.</li>
            <li>and once I&#x27;m done my hair has volume, is straight, and has not knots.  </li>
            <li>Now if only Conair made a diffuser attachment to fit this dryer....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gets really fuzzy and puffy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll do anything to minimize the time it takes for my wife to get ready.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>this straight without going to the salon.</li>
            <li>This really helps to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>IT doesn&#x27;t really work with the power you look for your hair..</li>
            <li>It dries my hair really fast</li>
            <li>, my roots are straight 2 months from a relaxer.</li>
            <li>save as much time as I&#x27;d hoped&lt;br /&gt;Cold</li>
            <li>I really like this blow dryer</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I was ready for a change and decided to try this.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look like curly hair that has this straight but bushy look.  </li>
            <li>It drys the hair fast.  </li>
            <li>I tryed this hair dryer and could not even finish because it just broke soooooo much of my hair</li>
            <li>but I never found a way to achieve silky straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I never even bothered with the instructional DVD, and I got the hang of it really fast.  </li>
            <li>The attachements stay in place and it gets my hair really straight.</li>
            <li>And the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>thats because it has to brush through the hair and get very close.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>I dont use that one much</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really gotten the hang of that.</li>
            <li>It made my hair shiny and straight, but without the super-limp look I get with the straightening iron.</li>
            <li>This really does straighten wavy hair.</li>
            <li>very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>I found it very cumbersome to work with.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>My hair was straight but very frizzy.</li>
            <li>Her hair is much thicker, though also straight, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to give her the frizzy like it did me.</li>
            <li>fast drying ones  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I STRAIGHT MY HAIR EVERY WEEK USING THIS HAIR DRYER</li>
            <li>Much hotter.</li>
            <li>Really smooths hair well</li>
            <li>It dries it straight.</li>
            <li>It dries the hair really fast, too.</li>
            <li>It straightens my kinky hair bone straight.</li>
            <li>product is super easy to use, dries the hair quickly, NO FRIZZ,</li>
            <li>If I wanted my hair to be presentable, I would need to set aside at least 45 minutes, sometimes up to an hour if I wanted to look really good.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I love the way my hair looks straight, but as it dries naturally, all the kinks and body come back.    </li>
            <li>:) Oh, also it left my hair with volume, soft, and shiney.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair, and it wasn&#x27;t a good straigtener.</li>
            <li>Use this dryer exactly as intended (it&#x27;s not hard at all-</li>
            <li>Sure it is slightly akward to use at first, but it works well.  </li>
            <li>normally let my hair air dry, but after discovering this hair dryer I&#x27;ll look forward to using it again. :)</li>
            <li>nothing I loved - even after a long blow dry session.</li>
            <li>My hair is EXTREMELY curly and I have tried most every hair dryer out there to blow it straight.  </li>
            <li>Also spray your wet hair with a heat protecting flat iron spray for good measure.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in hopes of being able to straighten my daughter&#x27;s naturally wavy hair without burning it out with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t expect a miracle out of a hair dryer (let&#x27;s be realistic)</li>
            <li>After using this dryer my hair is straight usually a bit fluffy  (not so much frizzy :D)</li>
            <li>The manual and the instructional dvd show the product being used on top of your hair, but if you dry it from the underneath, you still get that straight style, but with a little lift at the roots (where I needed it most).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than holding a dryer in one hand and a brush in the other.</li>
            <li>warm setting, only high and low fan on high heat</li>
            <li>You can easily use it on dry hair to fix ponytail bumps too.    </li>
            <li>I must admit, that at first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t, but it really does straighten hair and makes it so soft.  </li>
            <li>While the Conair blow dry was not quite as smooth as those that I&#x27;ve had at a high-end NYC salon, it definitely was as smooth as a \\&quot;no appointment, FIFO\\</li>
            <li>Did not straighten as well as I thought it would and did not dry that quickly either.</li>
            <li>would be so much better as a wand design either completely rounded or even a long rectangle</li>
            <li>Using this dryer, my \\&quot;ironing\\&quot; time was cut down to 40 minutes and my hair seemed to fight the humidity better and stay straight longer.   </li>
            <li>but the first time i used this, my hair came out smooth, soft, and shiny w/out using any of the extra hair products i normally have to use.  </li>
            <li>and I have straight, highly polished hair.  </li>
            <li>However, if I had not already needed a new hairdryer, I would not have thought it worth replacing my old hairdryer.</li>
            <li>It cut my drying time more than in half and gets my hair as straight as the salon.</li>
            <li>You can see the waves smooth right out as you move the dryer down the length of the hair.</li>
            <li>I too own several expensive hair gadgets and products that promise to make your hair straight and silky, and this dryer does a fantastic job for my hair by delivering a quick, straight, silky style in record time.  </li>
            <li>I thought that it would tame my flyaways, even though I have very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re African-American with natural hair, this dryer will work IF you de-tangle your hair first.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it&#x27;s small, travels well, and fits nicely in my bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this hairdryer, I had shoulder-length, kinky/coarse natural African-American hair (4B).  </li>
            <li>It looks like I normally have straight hair.</li>
            <li>I purchase this product thinking that it would work for me since I have normal hair, not curly, or straight, but somewhat wavy</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair that often is tangled when wet.  </li>
            <li>I use it all the time now, and I let my hair down a lot more too.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new dryer and bought this based on reviews and the price!  </li>
            <li>reallyyyy helped me get my hair super straight for flat ironing.</li>
            <li>I often use jumbo curlers afterwards to make my hair appear even more silky with a slight curl to the ends.  </li>
            <li>This dryer took my drying time from 45 minutes to less than 20 and with much better results.</li>
            <li>The good news is my somewhat thin, cotton-candy, wavy, frizzy hair is shiny and STRAIGHT (with body.)</li>
            <li>have never figured out how to even do a halfway decent job blowing out my hair myself.  </li>
            <li>It definitely dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you are good with a blowdryer and a round brush, it&#x27;s not really necessary for you to buy this.</li>
            <li>I really hope to get a few more years out of it before I get another one.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these a few years back &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li>I have thick, naturally wavy hair (which is mostly FRIZZ at all times)and after using this dryer it was incredibly smooth, soft, shiny and full of bounce (not flat like after I use a straitening iron).</li>
            <li>am African American with natural hair that presses very easily.</li>
            <li>It looks very easy on the commercial when in fact it just frizzed up my hair and left it wild.  </li>
            <li>I am seriously heartbroken right now, because I REALLY wanted to love this thing.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty much all the same length, but it doesn&#x27;t really work for me the way it&#x27;s intended.  </li>
            <li>It was also a hassle to keep switching the position of the attachment for different areas of your head, and it gets very hot to touch when you need to turn it.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels very healthy and shiny, and the drying time was a lot less than a regular dryer.  </li>
            <li>As for straightener I highly recommend the maxiglide straightener by maxius.</li>
            <li>I did have to use a ceramic iron to get a high gloss</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer (and the life-saving comb attachment) to anyone who has hard-to-manage, difficult-to-dry hair.  </li>
            <li>recommend it, highly.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Straightening has always been a challenge even when armed with good sprays serums and and lotions my hair hardly responded positively to heat especially with blow dryers.</li>
            <li>The straightener actually straightens my hair, almost better than my flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My hair was healthy feeling and with little breakage and shedding, unlike when I had tried to do it before with a brush and blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to learn how to hold and maneuver it, but the results on my hair is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I need a little practice to get the ends to flip out, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get there.</li>
            <li>What I like about it is that it gives GREAT volume, with way less work than I would typically need (</li>
            <li>My hair was not dry or brittle but super soft.  </li>
            <li>Gets my hair dry super fast.</li>
            <li>It turns out soft and mostly straight.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical of whether or not it work on African-American hair; it works great.</li>
            <li>I still need to use the iron as well but not as much as with my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find this product worked really well.  </li>
            <li>This product takes out all the frizz and leaves a gentle, natural wave.</li>
            <li>It does slightly smooth the hair that I can grasp toward the ends but does not allow styling - not wavy, not straight, not even a Farrah whip.</li>
            <li>Its so much easier than the old brush and blow routine.</li>
            <li>My hair has to be blow dried to feel healthy.</li>
            <li>I literally really did get salon results, and in only 45 minutes on my first try.</li>
            <li>I get MUCH better results with a round brush.</li>
            <li>, i straighnet my hair everyday with it, and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and makes in more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Given enough time to dry my hair (40+ minutes), I was able to get a decent shape, but</li>
            <li>I get better results with a round brush and</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is great for natural hair girls and woman with kinky or thick hair.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to go for a normal dryer.  </li>
            <li>I still flat iron my hair with my Wigo flat iron which I love but</li>
            <li>I use it just about everyday and have dropped it more times than I can count.</li>
            <li>This works fairly well to \\&quot;pre-straighten\\&quot; and cuts down on the time spent with the straightning iron.  </li>
            <li>There are just certain things I prefer as new and a hair dryer; that requires direct contact with my hair, is something that I would want as new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to use at all.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out shiny and straight, super soft, and keeps it from getting oily all day long.</li>
            <li>What was worrying me the most was that there was an extreme of very low and and very high reviews, and that no description seemed ot match my hair type.</li>
            <li>However, after about two months the roots start to grow in and since I am now spoiled, I wanted to use something that would easily straighten the roots (the most difficult part) and that I could use on the treated hair as well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like the old days when I used to dry my hair smooth with a brush and then set it on electric rollers...</li>
            <li>I just stared in the mirror for 5 minutes admiring that I was able to dry and straighten my hair at the same time.</li>
            <li>the hair dryer is not as easy as you think to use especially when you have different layers</li>
            <li>My hair was dry in ten minutes, silky, and smooth!  </li>
            <li>My old conair 1874 dryer with attached brush worked much better than this and is half the price.</li>
            <li>For those with more tame hair</li>
            <li>But now, I can easily wear my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I only wish that those of us with fine hair could get a discount by buying the same one without a comb!!</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and straight with a little lift at the roots</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot enough and powerful enough to give you the results you are looking for.</li>
            <li>it would help me get my daughters natural hair a little straighter and more manageable.</li>
            <li>As a person who has used this \\&quot;type\\&quot; of hairdryer for over 30 years, I have to rate this new product as so-so.  </li>
            <li>and I immediately bought a new one.</li>
            <li>I have asked every new hair stylist I can for tips.</li>
            <li>My [...] had to get everyone in the house to come see mommy&#x27;s new hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair a bit staticky, but it&#x27;s also because I live in the desert.  </li>
            <li>I now live by my ceramic iron.  </li>
            <li>I contacted their support and asked if there is anything that could be done (change to a new product or anything).</li>
            <li>I also have a new dryer that I have purchased since then that has a brush too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I had one before and needed a new one</li>
            <li>so we needed a new one.</li>
            <li>In my order I requested a new dryer.</li>
            <li>if I let my hair dry in a pony tail or braid before using the flat iron instead the end result is much better.</li>
            <li>My Wet 2 Straight flat iron by Remington does a much better job and leaves my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>straightener.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it dry super fast, but my hair is bone straight when I&#x27;m through.  </li>
            <li>I use this dryer with the concentrator end, not the straightner, to dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that has gotten curlier as I have gotten older.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and actually works to straighten and smooth my thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that it leaves my hair straightened, but not 100% straight (like Asian-hair straight).</li>
            <li>it dry quick, its truly portable, &amp;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this blow dryer to anyone who wishes to have soft straight hair and wants to save time on their daily beauty routine!</li>
            <li>and now my hair feels very very soft</li>
            <li>And so very soft.  </li>
            <li>With the previous smaller model I could tug at the roots and smooth them, also getting volume with the right technique, achieving a wavy style all over, or straighten it if I wanted to that day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to obtain the results in very little time.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I highly reccommend this product, much easier and quicker than blowing dry and then flat ironing my hair and better results.</li>
            <li>Now i can skip the straightening part and go straight to dry and straight with one thing!</li>
            <li>It basically does the same thing as this dryer, but I prefer this model because it dries quicker than the hot air styler.   </li>
            <li>While it definitely doesn&#x27;t produce the same results as using a flat iron, it does a pretty fantastic job considering you&#x27;re just using a blowdryer attachment.  </li>
            <li>Wow, is it ever!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this dryer to anyone with naturally curly hair who wants to wear it straight.</li>
            <li>any hot hair product will burn if not used properly.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and silky to the touch!  </li>
            <li>The first day I used it I had such bounce</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my soft hair now!  </li>
            <li>I did plug in my hot rollers once, just in case I needed extra volume, but I never had to use them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not good at all using a blower and brush, and this dryer is kind of a &#x27;two in one&#x27; deal.</li>
            <li>At first I thought - big deal, just packaging mumbo jumbo....</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I used it the first time out of the box without ever looking at any directions or watching the dvd or commercial!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure ya&#x27;ll are familiar with trying to use a curling brush with a hair dryer and how difficult it could be?  </li>
            <li>No big deal, but you may have to turn off the hair dryer first before doing it b/c</li>
            <li>Makes hair extremely soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I tried this product and it left my hair pretty frizzy.  </li>
            <li>But it makes blow drying a breeeeze for us all, with the built in brush, which i also initially under estimated, it makes the process so much quicker and easier!</li>
            <li>I was dying for this blowdryer when it first came out when I was in middle school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact blow dryer for the pass 9 years and this is my second one.</li>
            <li>you are already looking for a new hairdryer, and want to straighten and dry your hair in one step, this is worth it.</li>
            <li>Unlike the smaller Conair Infiniti BC173W model that I could actually grasp and style my fine but full long hair with, this model only allows for hot blow dry and then very hot pull through even on the low setting.</li>
            <li>Note, I don&#x27;t dry my hair from underneath, I dry my hair from the top of each section.</li>
            <li>I can truly create some serious straight hair magic in about 13 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Both processes aren&#x27;t only laborious, they always leave my hair EXTREMELY dry with frizzy ends, which I \\&quot;band-aid\\&quot; with a strong moisture creme.</li>
            <li>Was excited to see this dryer, as I had previously had the Conair BC173 (no longer available) and thought that this appeared to be very similar and was described as having similar abilities.  </li>
            <li>have very curly fine hair and have been straightening it myself for years and have a hard time finding salons that can get it as straight and smooth as I can at home using a round brush and then a straightener.</li>
            <li>hair is thick, but very fine.</li>
            <li>I have kind of problem hair: thick but fine, wavy in the back but stick straight in front, limp, cowlickie, and slippery.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in hopes of it controlling my hair which is dry curly frizzy fine and somewhat fragile.  </li>
            <li>(you have to push or pull your hair into it, easy after a few strokes).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very intuitive, so I read the manual quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats to raging hot in just a few seconds, with a decently powerful blow.</li>
            <li>Of course, I have to use my Chi to get it super straight, but if you are looking for a little bit of straightening with some volume, just the dryer is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I have natural African American hair and this hair dryer makes my hair much more manageable when I use it before flat ironing.</li>
            <li>Then I put most of my hair up so only some of my hair was down.  </li>
            <li>and it goes more than midway down my back.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re an African american woman with hard to manage hair like mine, you have to own this and the prostyler straightener and your hair troubles are over!</li>
            <li>You need to hold the hair tight in sections when the hair is still fairly damp/wet and pull the brush section through slowly, numerous times until the hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve got typical asian hair- fine and straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews, and i think people aren&#x27;t using the options on the attachment to their full advantage.  </li>
            <li>When my wife&#x27;s previous 208S hair dryer broke after many years of daily use, she had to replace it with an identical one.  </li>
            <li>what I love is that instead of doing hair rollers and getting under that big hair dryer in order to dry my hair and for it to come out straight, I just wash my hair, let it dry naturally, and then use this product to straighten it</li>
            <li>My hair was a little fly away, but a little hairspray was all it took to settle it right down.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine, inconsistently wavy hair that I always have trouble straightening.  </li>
            <li>I was using it incorrectly, I was able to dry my curly/fine 3b/3c hair bone straight in less than 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li>I generally let my hair air dry for about 20 minutes after I&#x27;m out of the shower before giving it a quick rough-dry with the air concentrator.  </li>
            <li>After drying (which dried my hair a lot faster than with a plain dryer) and then a quick few passes with an iron to get any leftover flips out, my hair looks great.  </li>
            <li>I get my hair chemically relaxed, and it has been nearly 2 months since my last relaxer, and my hair is nearly as straight as it was the day I stepped from my Beverly Hills</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I found out Conair makes the American version, but I was skeptical of course.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not only straight, but also soft after using the dryer.</li>
            <li>like it because it does make your hair soft and does add a lot of volume, and I&#x27;m absolutely hopeless with a regular blowdryer.</li>
            <li>Humidity and wind recks my hair but at the end of the day this tool restores it to its somewhat natural beauty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African-American with natural hair (no perm or texturizer).</li>
            <li>The result - my hair feels silky and soft.</li>
            <li>This product has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Doing the old fashion roller brush blow out..</li>
            <li>Really drys my hair and straightens it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Stick straight, and no frizz, even though it&#x27;s pouring rain outside.   </li>
            <li>My hair is medium to coarse and very curly.  </li>
            <li>The attachment doesn&#x27;t hold hair taut enough to get it really straight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m AMAZED at how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so simple to use and saves me so much time in the mornings now.</li>
            <li>after a while i finally figured out how much hair i can do at once</li>
            <li>When I found this one, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I even bought one for my 11-year-old stepdaughter, who has mid-back-length natural hair.  </li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair, soft texture, spiral curls.</li>
            <li>I must say the product does as advertised, it straightened my very curly hair and it left it looking shiner.  </li>
            <li>one left them way too straight.  </li>
            <li>This worked but took so long and by the time I was done I was hot, sweaty and my arms hurt.    </li>
            <li>It leaves the the hair soft and straight (not necessarily bone straight) when used with the Lotta Body Styling Milk ($4.49 at my local beauty supply shop).</li>
            <li>I really do like the dryer overall</li>
            <li>I bought this item 2 nights ago and have used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li>I prefer it to be straight and sleek because, frankly, it&#x27;s a lot easier to deal with, especially on humid days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the end of the day and my hair is as smooth and shiny as after I dried it this morning.   </li>
            <li>I have some natural wave that turns to frizz.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a professional salon-quality hair dryer and was apprehensive about shelling out hundreds of dollars for one.  </li>
            <li>Plus, its kinda loud and</li>
            <li>Using my old products took about 25 min to do what this does in about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>It soft and no frizz whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased this hair dryer years ago (at a retail store) its cost was near $150.</li>
            <li>Feels comfortable and not overly heavy either.</li>
            <li>i have very curly, coarse hair, and it used to take me almost an hour to straighten it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and you have to spend time drying your hair with a blowdryer then flat-ironing it to get it straight, then I would definitely recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>The drying/straightening process may work very well, but I found it so difficut to manipulate while \\&quot;test driving\\&quot; it with the manual that I never actually tried in on my hair.</li>
            <li>My old dryer couldn&#x27;t come close.    </li>
            <li>I bought this when i was 15-17 years old</li>
            <li>It straightens so you can manage your natural hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you&#x27;re in the market to get straight hair, get this blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and the use of this dryer is the only way to ensure my hair will stay straight all day even in the most humid weather.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the flocked shinifying thing on the comb attachement seems to bea waste of space unless its secret purpose was to collect excess hair product, which in that case it does a great job!</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and mostly straight, but there is a huge wave or \\&quot;hump\\&quot; that goes right through the back</li>
            <li>my hair is somewhere between curly and very very wavy, and super duper thick.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it took only 15 minutes to dry my hair perfectly straight</li>
            <li>When I got this I was a little nervous about spending that amount of money on a dryer - it was WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>Not flat-iron straight, but straight enough to be prepped for the flat iron.</li>
            <li>All I can say, is that I knew it was going to work after I started to dry the first section of hair.  </li>
            <li>You do have to use the dryer by itself first to dry your hair, then you use the attachment to straighten (the promo I saw made it look like just one step).  </li>
            <li>I first take off the attachment and just dry my hair until just damp.  </li>
            <li>I have worn my hair curly for many years because I am inept with a blowdryer and round brush and didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have curls, strong ones, but they are closer to small &#x27;Victorian&#x27; salon curls.</li>
            <li>I think it should be good for thicker and wavier hair, mine is very thin.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t stick straight like I used a flat iron</li>
            <li>Unlike a flat iron this product enables you to have volume in your straight hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t straighten my hair with a blow dryer and using a flat iron damages my hair too much.</li>
            <li>It does not save as much time as I&#x27;d hoped, but it is easier than using a hairdryer, brush and flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Dont have to use the flat iron as much.</li>
            <li>Its not really that fantastic, actually its faster and easy to dry your hair with a conventional driyer.</li>
            <li>but never less then 30 dollars.</li>
            <li>it gets hot FAST so watch your fingers when going to adjust it &amp; make it horizontal or whichever direction or turn it off for a few seconds 1st!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and damages my hair less than flat iron.</li>
            <li>I use it on the low setting and it&#x27;s still powerful enough to dry a small section of my hair in 20 seconds at the most.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, wavy hair that becomes extremely frizzy in the summer.  </li>
            <li>I have one note of caution:  if your hair is damaged or extremely fragile, then probably don&#x27;t want to use this on high.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s only high and low heat and the high will burn your fingers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it does save some time and is easier than using a regular dryer and a brush once you find the most comfortable way to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by following the instructions that came with the dryer.</li>
            <li>Many complained that it was hard to handle, but if you can handle a hairdryer with a round brush, then this will be super easy to handle in comparison.</li>
            <li>No regrets with this one!!</li>
            <li>One pass through the hair and it is dry and straight, but not limp.</li>
            <li>Read good reviews, but I have thick curly hair that I blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li>I purchased it, willing to try anything new to help cut down my drying/straightening time.</li>
            <li>It has been very hot, and quite humid lately, but my  hair stays straight and shiny all day.</li>
            <li>say much about its functioning after long periods of use (I just bought it) but</li>
            <li>the only negatives is it doesn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as other blow dryers, which is fine because i flat iron my hair after i blow dry it anyway, and it&#x27;s really loud, i really wish it was quieter.</li>
            <li>After using the Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer, her long layered hair was straight, but with body and movement.</li>
            <li>long cord (I didn&#x27;t think it would matter, but it makes it much easier for me to use)&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold and use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>de-tangle my hair first with a wide tooth comb and section it</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I literally had to drag myself away from the mirror, I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at myself and running my hands through my hair -- I just couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>exactly what my daughter expected</li>
            <li>No big deal, it&#x27;s not hard to do.  </li>
            <li>dry your hair pretty well, while you want it wet, you don&#x27;t want it dripping or have TOO much water in it</li>
            <li>This is a great product I have really thick, curly, long hair and this cut my drying time in half.  </li>
            <li>I had long hair for a while, and the Infiniti dried it super fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of annoying that I have to keep holding down the cool button to get cool air.</li>
            <li>In my search for a new blow dryer my current one pooped up.</li>
            <li>Then I use this dryer to blow dry my hair straight</li>
            <li>My hair is dry much faster with this model.  </li>
            <li>and I can dry my hair straight in about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight and dry in record time.  </li>
            <li>I will admit that the dryer did dry her hair much quicker than using a blowdryer and brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to dry your hair while straighten it too.</li>
            <li>I dry my hair in sections, and then use my Chi to get my hair sleek and straight.</li>
            <li>Using this product is so easy, and what used to take at least an hour now takes about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>it took much longer to dry her thick natural hair and her hair did not flow smoothly through the attachments.</li>
            <li>I use it to dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li>it enables me to blow dry my hair straight without causing damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, and am not coordinated enough to blow it out with a brush and regular blow dryer like they do at the salons.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and this dryer is great for either drying with a round brush to keep it wavy or using the attachment to make it straight, all without losing volume (which is my biggest complaint with straight irons).  </li>
            <li>Some folks (especially those with really curly hair) who might think this will be the only hair straightening product they&#x27;ll need will be in for a surprise.  </li>
            <li>There are a few important steps, such as figuring out where to set the tension control.</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair that, while not extremely curly, has a wave pattern at the crown that is so strong even my $100 straightener doesn&#x27;t always do the job.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick, and usually requires almost 2 hours with the straightning iron to get it good and straight.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for an easy way to dry my hair without it getting really tight.</li>
            <li>Your hair gets very hot after it goes through the dryer attachement a few times</li>
            <li>The major cons for me is the packaging, the heaviness, and it doesn&#x27;t quite straighten my cow-lick out front.    </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy at first due to the cost, but when I factored in I go through a blow dryer about one a year for $25</li>
            <li>This is something no other dryer could do.</li>
            <li>but there is no other dryer like this</li>
            <li>It pretty much does the same job, so why waste $60?  &lt;</li>
            <li>If I tried to go with my waves, the diffuser would take about two hours to dry, and then I needed to style it on top of that- lots of product and scrunching, as well as the small barrel curling iron.</li>
            <li>It also did help straightening my hair - not as straight as with my straightening iron - but really cut WAY down on the amount of time I actually had to use my iron afterwards!  </li>
            <li>For anyone who gets frustrated with a straightener and just wants to dry and go, this is great.  </li>
            <li>Later I had to go over the whole thing with my conair flat iron and finish the job</li>
            <li>It dried my hair quickly and it straightened and smoothed my natural African American hair completely.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, especially for African-American or Mixed Race women.</li>
            <li>After you dry the section with the Infiniti, go over it with a flat iron while it&#x27;s still hot.</li>
            <li>It may not seem like such a huge deal, but when my usual straightening process can take up to 5 hours, it is.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s why it works so fast, but it hurts so be careful.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still not firm enough.  </li>
            <li>I just wrap my hair in a towel for about 10 minutes so my hair isn&#x27;t soaking wet, put some smoothing products in, comb through, and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li>Day 6 and on, I&#x27;m not going back to my old dryer and brush.    </li>
            <li>, pretty average length.  </li>
            <li>women of color, or women with natural hair, if you struggle with using a rounded hair brush and a traditional hair dryer, this is a life-saver!</li>
            <li>I can go from soaking wet hair, to straight and shiny in about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My first one was the wine, then grey and last one blue.  </li>
            <li>I only gave it three stars because this really performs the same as my yellow bird hairdryer, and my Sedu hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I guess if people who do not have naturally straight hair (like me -- thick and wavy/frizzy) want straight hair, we will have to get it the old fashioned way...</li>
            <li>It might be however that this drier works better on thin, course hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also important to draw the appliance slowly through your hair.</li>
            <li>However, the heat produced by the dryer is phenomenal, so much so, that it makes it difficult to hold the hair in place so that it can be straightened properly.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical of this hair dryer -- it seemed to good to be true, and I didn&#x27;t want to waste $55 on a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little longer to dry my hair this way, but the result is absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I had one that broke last week after years of use and ordered a new one the same night!</li>
            <li>With this I can actually blow dry my curly hair straight...</li>
            <li>Black people have to moisturize our hair so vigorously either way that it&#x27;s worth it since the moisture get replaced daily through cremes and treatments.</li>
            <li>have thick shoulder length hair, with lots of natural curl and a tendency to get super oily halfway through the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many dryers, curling irons, and flat irons, and was doubtful that this dryer would be any better.  </li>
            <li>Now I have a new challenge, and have to tackle my daughter&#x27;s extremely long frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>, my only problem is I don&#x27;t really have the time to do this all the time being a single mom of a 4 yr.</li>
            <li>The first one has lasted so long and still works like new, I haven&#x27;t needed to open the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry without brushing or fussing with it, and I was surprised to see it dry straight, shiny, and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li>Normally my hair can take up to 30 minutes to blow dry, but I was done in under 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It takes less than 20 minutes to go from wet to straight, smooth, bodified hair with minimal split ends!</li>
            <li>Now, I cut my time in half and my hair is totally straight!    </li>
            <li>The air is not as hot as other dryers on the same price range.</li>
            <li>with how quickly I can transform my spirals into to straights without excessive damage or breakage.  </li>
            <li>I could only hold onto the ends for about half the length of the strand, and as soon as I let go, the air coming from the dryer would just blow the hair right off the attachment.  </li>
            <li>And it was really hard to clean out.</li>
            <li>As advertised I thought I did not need to use any other dryer to finish the hair and make it straight.</li>
            <li>other plus to this, is that it works really well with straightening synthetic kanekelon or Marley hair (get a brand that is heat resistent like Vanessa).  </li>
            <li>Flat ironing it after helps considerably, but</li>
            <li>straight as the other AA posters proclaimed</li>
            <li>It doesnt make as much noise at other blow-dryer.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to shape my hair with this than it has ever been with any other dryer.</li>
            <li>I usually do not blow out my hair, but every once in a while, I like to see how long my hair has gotten.  </li>
            <li>The straightening device does lock in place, so I&#x27;m thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to hold it on while I work through small sections of my thick natural hair.</li>
            <li>I use a flat iron after it&#x27;s dry to make it straight and silky.  </li>
            <li>However, that ended up taking longer than it used to take me to dry it while pulling straight with a brush and using a flat iron afterwards.</li>
            <li>Now it only takes 10 mins that includes the hair being wet and then fully styled and ready to leave the house.</li>
            <li>Wet to silky straight takes about 25 minutes total if you follow this advice.</li>
            <li>so my hair is manageable and not dry or damaged at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it&#x27;s worth five stars because I have used this dryer every day for over ten years without any trouble.</li>
            <li>This is my first review ever, I want to thank the other reviewers for telling us how they felt good and bad</li>
            <li>in my opinion my flat iron took out the same amount of hair because of how much and long I had to use it.    </li>
            <li>the dryer can get a little hot while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>I had a little trouble with flyaways on the ends and also had trouble getting the hair near the roots underneath perfectly straight - but the rest of it looks really good, especially considering the odd texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li>If I use the high heat, it is a wild mess.</li>
            <li>using the blowdryer with a round brush works faster and with better results (especially if you like a little volume and flip/curl to the ends) being that it&#x27;s a blowdryer</li>
            <li>It usually takes me 2 hours, more or less, to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>- usually I have to pull my hair very taut to straiten it with a round brush, and I can&#x27;t do it everyday because the heat and stress really damage my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Instead of drying all your hair at once, use a clip to hold half of it up while you dry the bottom half, then release the clip and do the rest :-)    </li>
            <li>where i normally have frizz and static, even with a round brush or straightening iron (i&#x27;m just not good with them i guess).      </li>
            <li>While the design is innovative, allowing airflow through the rear of the device rather than the side (which sucks up hair and breaks it off), it does not have the heat nor the wattage to straighten curly hair as effectively as other conair &#x27;hairbrush stylers&#x27; - i.e. a hairdryer that brushes through the hair.  </li>
            <li>In the end, after trying to futz with it for over an hour, I ended up having to still use my older hair dryer to blow dry my hair and flat iron.</li>
            <li>Trust me, at one point my hair actually broke off due to too much heat styling.  </li>
            <li>The only thing though is that it&#x27;s hard to clean...</li>
            <li>I am African-American with natural (4a/b-typed) hair; and my hair is LONG (about 2 and 1/2 inches from my elbows).  </li>
            <li>But I never really expected it would turn out like that using only the dryer.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised how well this hairdryer worked in my long, overstressed, curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is a bit wirey, has no real shap, and normally I end up just wearing it in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I already have several hair dryers and rarely use heat on my hair so this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li>, I guess the bottom line is if you are a person who has not mastered another alternative of blowing your hair straight (other than paying someone to do it for you) and can only straighten your hair with a regular blow dryer and then a straightening iron and/or curling iron, this might be the product for you.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new dryer and carefully did research this time.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer makes my hair feel cold and smooth, instead of hot and fried.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; attachment can be used directly on the hair to comb through to dry.</li>
            <li>and I have to dry it completely in the morning</li>
            <li>I have very course and slightly color damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I use my &amp;#34;Just Natural Organic dry hair shampoo &amp; conditioner.&amp;#34; I also give myself coconut milk treatments.</li>
            <li>My hair is longer than shoulder length, in layers, average thickness and fairly straight (it has a tiny bit of body).  </li>
            <li>ceramic wet dry straightening hot air styler at the same time thinking it was an entirely different product.  </li>
            <li>I gather from some of the other reviews that the product advertised a straight, flat ironed look.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure it is any better than just using a round, alumnimum-based brush.  </li>
            <li>But blowdrying with a round brush took so long that I would rarely do it, resulting in a hair &#x27;do that resembled a rat&#x27;s nest.  </li>
            <li>I like this dryer, but the comb is not long enough.</li>
            <li>Have not had this long but think it might actually last longer because the intake is far enough out of the way.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair that is partially curly, mostly frizzy - just depends on the weather.</li>
            <li>A closer inspection of the hair dryer indicated that either the dryer was previously used or the item was previously sold, returned, and resold again without any attempt to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; the packaging.</li>
            <li>If you have slightly wavy or straight hair, the cost and complexity of this hair dryer are not necessary.</li>
            <li>However the only flaw is that as it oz advertised to straighten hair, it will not fully even on someone like me with half straight nd wavey hairs on the bottom.</li>
            <li>my hair is super process blonde hair and its wavy thick hair</li>
            <li>- I have long thick hair and this cuts dry time in half - love it!</li>
            <li>My hair is long, color treated, &amp; it takes me an hour and a half to dry and straighten it just so it looks decent normally.</li>
            <li>Just a little trouble getting the hang of it, but still ended with fabulous results.</li>
            <li>So, for now I am back to using my regular hair dryer and my large barrel round brush.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick, very curly hair and nothing has really helped straighten it except for a permanent straightener.</li>
            <li>My goal when I dry my hair is to dry it the fastest way possible and to blow dry it straight.</li>

            <li> , this product is great.</li>
            <li> I suspect this would work great on longer hair, but for me it ended up being just another blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> It looked great on tv.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job at straigtening</li>
            <li> and its compact size is great for travel.    </li>

            <li> My hair is the healthiest it has been in years - no split ends, it&#x27;s shiny and has great body and movement.</li>
            <li> So happy with it</li>

            <li> The Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer is Absolutely Amazing!  </li>
            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> and I was SO HAPPY! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The decision to purchase this item made it on my &#x27;Top 10 Best Decisions of My Life&#x27; list.</li>
            <li> Lovingly!</li>
            <li> Two words: this dryer plus the pro styler flattening iron and brush all in one equals: Own them!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, easy to use and gives a salon like look.</li>
            <li> After the discount from Amazon, it&#x27;s really a very good deal and sure we will go for Conair again.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see my hair look so healthy and beautiful again!</li>
            <li> I was was looking for a good blow out.</li>
            <li> I just got it today, and I really loved it.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks just as good as it does when I get it blown out at the salon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good hair dryer, hair come out shiny..  </li>
            <li> as good</li>
            <li> Does a good job or smoothing out curly hair</li>
            <li> It is fairly compact and helps her combat frizz.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer itself is good, I like it, but when I put the attachment on it, it doesn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li> Used it twice, put it away for good.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for my beloved wife.</li>
            <li> and it looks as good as it ever does after I do that.</li>
            <li> (Wine)]]I LOVED THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> so all in all it was really good</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair look almost as good as when my stylist does it.  </li>
            <li> GOOD</li>
            <li> The product built quality is good.  </li>
            <li> The concept is a good one.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all at straightening my hair, its not even a good blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Your hair can get tangled if you don&#x27;t section it off or do a good comb through before drying</li>
            <li> Good for straightening, but the curling did not work.</li>
            <li> But if you decide to go ahead and buy it, I wish you good luck.</li>
            <li> All products I have loved and used for years.</li>
            <li> and I am good</li>
            <li> and it seems to be a good dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a good blow dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair looks just as good as if I had gone to the Dominicans.</li>
            <li> It still works as good as the day i bought it.</li>
            <li> I can agree with all of the good comments.</li>
            <li> While it does take practice to become adept at using the attachment, once I mastered it, I really love it!!  </li>
            <li> It also had a beautiful, healthy shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even if the straightening attachment doesn&#x27;t work for you (which i can&#x27;t imagine why it wouldn&#x27;t) the blow dryer itself is very good and is strong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine this dryer might not work great for you if you have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure this product is great for even the thickest and curliest locks.</li>
            <li> I have fairly curly hair, and this has been an amazing help.</li>
            <li> i was happy to be able to find it.</li>
            <li> My hair can be very challenging and this help eliminate a lot of the work.  </li>
            <li> so I made sure to purchase it...especially at this great price..</li>
            <li> I am happy and glad that I ordered this dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer impressed me right away when I tried it without even reading instructions.</li>
            <li> Right now I have salon perfect hair without having to use a straightening iron.</li>
            <li> One more time I read great reviews and was expecting a nice product, and...not again.</li>
            <li> The first use will require some patience and care to figure out the technique that works best for you.</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I just love this thing!  </li>
            <li> This dryer got my hair smoother than my straightener ever has, and I have a lot more body too!  </li>
            <li> (and I am sure that a downpour would be another story!)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> I still love this hairdryer!  </li>
            <li> My favorite blow dryer in the world!</li>

            <li> this hair dryer is amazing</li>
            <li> It is just simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> The best that can be said for this thing is that it won&#x27;t take up too much space when it goes into your drawer forgotten and unused.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it does a nice drop blow drying without making it too frizzy.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> I had to give it a good 3 months to become a better user of it.</li>
            <li> But after that, it worked really nice.</li>
            <li> I liked my results.  </li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer for any type of curly hair that you want to get straight.  </li>
            <li> I have been SEARCHING for 20 years for an effective way to straighten that doesn&#x27;t take forever or prevent me from having my morning shower.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to just use this dryer and have my hair come out straight and perfect like it&#x27;s advertised</li>
            <li> I would reccomend it if you have the money to spend on a nice blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked using this conair product.  </li>

            <li> and I honestly saw a difference in the way her hair looked.  </li>
            <li> She can use it on her own hair and it works as promised.</li>

            <li> Nice product and the seller delivered as promised.</li>

            <li> The blow dryer made this task quick and easy great!</li>
            <li> I tried out the hair dryer this morning for the first time and found it to be one of the most wonderful purchases I&#x27;ve ever made for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this dryer, it does a great job, easy to use with my carpal tunnel.  </li>
            <li> I locked in my style with the cool shot button, and even when I got caught in a drizzle while doing my Christmas shopping, my style still looked great.</li>

            <li> It is so easy to use and does a really good job.</li>
            <li> Great item for my super curly hair....</li>

            <li> So far, this is the best and most efficient hair dryer I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very easy to use, and makes a better result than hair straightener alone.  </li>
            <li> My hair is wavy/curly and within 5 minutes, my damp hair is transformed into straight and beautifully styled.  </li>
            <li> It sounds too good to be true, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>

            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> but this one is much better.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> The Conair people should find a more durable way to hold the attachment on.</li>
            <li> I have already recommended this to many friends.  </li>
            <li> I am really glad i bought and</li>
            <li> Well.. this was interesting.</li>
            <li> Just for that I love it.</li>

            <li> She has tried many others from time to time and swears by this model.</li>
            <li> so my hair would be more manageable.  </li>

            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It is an ok dryer.  </li>
            <li> So I guess they could design that part better.</li>
            <li> But it does last well over a year and does a great job!</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Also gives me flips when I want them--- I love this thing.</li>
            <li> OK, here&#x27;s what you do....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten soooooo many compliments on my hair since I bought these two pieces of equipment and started straightening this way.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from this product.</li>

            <li> I got it for Christmas, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I love love, LOVE the Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer.  </li>

            <li> I love the attachment.</li>
            <li> ENJOY!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer delivers on it&#x27;s promise and more.  </li>
            <li> &quot; but it probably cuts off about 15 minutes :)</li>
            <li> you have frizzy or staticy hair, I&#x27;d recommend using your favorite anti frizz/static lotion, cream, or</li>
            <li> On good days, which rarely happen, my hair likes to spiral up and out otherwise</li>
            <li> While I love the dryer and if it broke today I would buy another</li>
            <li> Received as a gift for christmas after watching the infomercial at Bed, Bath and Beyond and absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> and I have more frizz in my hair than ever.</li>
            <li> Coworkers have asked me what I&#x27;m doing to make my hair look so much better.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help touching my hair when I pass by a mirror.</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Conair 1875 Watt Styler Dryer for many, many years and have mastered the thing.  </li>
            <li> It will probably do a better job than what you are doing now.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad i pestered my husband to get it for me :)</li>
            <li> all I know for sure is that it did not work on my hair...</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair with this technique.</li>
            <li> It has been a lifesaver many times for me.  </li>
            <li> so it looks better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it and</li>
            <li> As for the heat, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> someone who has fought with their hair texture for most of their life, this hair dryer is a blessing.</li>
            <li> I.  Love.  </li>
            <li> after using this blow dryer for about 6 months, i have to say i still love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to straighten my hair with a blow drier alone.</li>
            <li> I thought this blow dryer would give me a better result than others I have tried.     </li>
            <li> I can see how it might work better on thicker and fuller hair than mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure as I work with it</li>
            <li> Perhaps I had better learn a technique that would straighten without making my hair poofy.</li>
            <li> and we both love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too lovely to be able to do it all in one step, with one tool.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I thought I would get a lot more for my money.</li>
            <li> BONUS! : )</li>
            <li> love this hair dryer  </li>
            <li> I have never had so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Satisfied customer :)</li>
            <li> and I love it...</li>
            <li> Love the variety of attachments.</li>
            <li> This is great for the price and dory&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li> This worked much better and saved more time.</li>
            <li> it also dramatically reduced my drying time - i&#x27;m IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> So I rated it 3 stars because I hoping for better results from the straightener.</li>
            <li> Before I had this product, my hair looked frizzy most of the time and felt rather course.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for a couple of years, but since I have been using this dryer, I&#x27;ve received many compliments on how healthy my hair looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this dryer.</li>
            <li> OK this dryer cost more than I wanted to pay</li>
            <li> I was able to straighten my 15 year olds hair in 20 minutes give or take.</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthwhile purchase.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t able to maneuver it&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> Sure wish Conair would reconsider making the BC173 available again!  </li>
            <li> So glad I waited and got what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Now if they don&#x27;t stop making it before I need another one. :)</li>
            <li> This one is trying to be too many things, as you can see the brush part comes off an</li>
            <li> The more I keep talking I should rate this even lower...</li>
            <li> the attachment with the comb is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Everyone who uses it buys it :)</li>
            <li> but it makes it more manageble.</li>
            <li> If I could give it more stars, I would.</li>
            <li> i was never dexterous enough to handle a brush and a dryer, so this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I love this dryer, it straightens just like I need it too,</li>
            <li> As most of you know.</li>
            <li> I totatlly love this blowdryer</li>
            <li> love this thing lost the attachement though ):</li>
            <li> I have used this product and I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> The one feature that I am extremely pleased with is that the attachment locks into place and does not come lose from the dryer in the drying process.  </li>
            <li> favorite blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Oh how I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> It works a bit better without it.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium to fine which  should make it very easy to use with this gadget.</li>
            <li> I saw this and was very excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s WONDERFUL), buy the Remington T3 Tourmaline flat iron and buy some Chi Silk Fusion or Biosilk.</li>
            <li> so a flat iron &amp; hairdryer have been my best friends for years &amp;</li>
            <li> Light weight, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to work a hairdryer with a round brush so this all in one hairdryer (which is also  a great travel size) with attachment is a great solution.   </li>
            <li> and thought it would be a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> , IT GOT A 4*s, now that&#x27;s pretty good).  </li>
            <li> hair salon blow-out, or home blow out with a good hot iron to finish it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 5 years now and it still works as good as the first day I bought it.</li>
            <li> It also get&#x27;s good heat although not too hot.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s safe to assume most people buying this product will have curly hair and would therefore need one, so I consider this to be a huge oversight.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to master for even the most inept of users.</li>
            <li> It takes about 20-30 minutes to dry and style my hair now, which is  wonderful, and I have tons of shine and volume; it looks like I just came from the salon.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer is perfect for me to dry my hair with before I straighten.</li>
            <li> so one can more easily work with it.</li>
            <li> I mostly like how its not bulky, easy to handle</li>
            <li> After moderate use the the comb straightener attachment sometimes rotates on its own during use which doesn&#x27;t make me happy</li>
            <li> I live in a place with 65% humidity, and for the first time, my hair held perfectly for 3 days in a row, with out needing to go over with an iron.  </li>
            <li> i highly suggest it to anyone who wants a good straighner, i talked my friend into buying one, YAY ME!!</li>
            <li> Once I actually read them, it impressed me more (and once I watch the video, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be floored, haha!)  </li>
            <li> Since I am by no means wealthy, you can imagine how fantastic it must work and how out of control my hair is.</li>
            <li> but a far cry from the frizzy nightmare that I have experienced up to now.  </li>
            <li> This is the best $55 I&#x27;ve ever spent on my hair.</li>
            <li> when I saw this I thought wow, this would be awesome if it really did work!  </li>
            <li> However,if you (like me) have already found a tried and true way to blow your hair straight with great results, stick to what you are doing and don&#x27;t bother with this.  </li>
            <li> Best $60 I ever spent on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li> the plus side, this is fairly light-weight and does eliminate a step if you have fairly straight hair and just need polishing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the idea is good, but I just don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve really perfected it here</li>
            <li> I used it with good results before watching the included DVD (really?</li>
            <li> it gives a great blow out with body and volume that lasts and is excellent as preparation for final styling with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> And after trying it for the first time, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Best 30 bucks I have ever spent!</li>
            <li> sweet revenge, because it works!</li>
            <li> I have nappy hair, Dominican hair that gets very curly and very frizzy once there&#x27;s humidity, but this product is actually very good for my hair.</li>
            <li> product is really easy to use and makes your looks</li>
            <li> As soon as I got the hang of it, it was so easy</li>
            <li> Took a bit to get used to how to hold it and move my hair with it, but once I did, its so easy.  </li>
            <li> so I could easily return it.  </li>
            <li> Attachments are easy to take off and put on.</li>
            <li> Was it relatively easy to use?  </li>
            <li> Once I did that, it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to use, easy to manuver and durable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> I have lots of hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how easy it is.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my long, beautiful silky hair.  </li>
            <li> The video they send makes it look so easy to straighten your hair.  </li>
            <li> This is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This product is a good dryer, but the staightening function is not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Using this dryer, my hair has the bounce I get after getting a professional blowout, it&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li> The quality is really wonderful and the DVD was Ok but somehow pretty too short and not that much rich but does the job.</li>
            <li> I just bought this dryer, and so far i&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> So you might not be able to just pull it out of the box and go, but with just a tiny bit of trial and error, anyone should be able to use this and get good results.      </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best dryer I have EVER</li>
            <li> , it looks as good as new.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li> but I still had to follow it with a Chi flat-iron which was fine with me.</li>
            <li> I have curly shoulder length fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so impressive that I got one for my niece who is half African-American.  </li>
            <li> Does nothing for my fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li> A personal recommendation for those who purchase this item and have pretty curly hair: The manual says to find the best tension (1,2,3, or 4) depending on your curl type.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and light  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m less than impressed.  </li>
            <li> Which was fine.  </li>
            <li> The blowdryer works fine, but the straightener did not work at all for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length fine hair</li>
            <li> I dont think this product well unless you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer works fine.  </li>
            <li> This one is more powerful and dries hair more quickly.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, but, I am VERY HAPPY with it.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets a little getting used to in terms of how best to hold it</li>
            <li> It always looks so easy on tv, but is not user friendly at all-</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get stick straight, but it does get smooth with nice curled ends.</li>
            <li> Even the back of my hair feels great and smooth.</li>
            <li> Is indispensable for me.</li>
            <li> still enjoy the quality of Conair&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> so it is smooth and shiny.    </li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t get as straight as I would&#x27;ve liked it to be.  </li>
            <li> and it was so smooth.</li>
            <li> Even after I slept on it all night I woke the next day and still felt so great</li>
            <li> This dryer looks so funky but works nicely and is fairly gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> It helps smooth and straighten the hair.</li>
            <li> The tension dial on the comb allow me to adjust it if I&#x27;m using it on my hair (which is now lightly relaxed) or on my daughter&#x27;s hair (which is 100% unrelaxed).  </li>
            <li> Instead of twisting and contorting my arm all over, I just turned the nozzle so that my hand was always in a comfortable position.</li>
            <li> It looked much more powerful and well designed</li>
            <li> This product is all it claims to be...within 10 minutes I am transformed from a screaming banshee to a civilized business executive.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it regularly and is happy with it.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really light and compact.   </li>
            <li> I wish it was available in stores however.</li>
            <li> I was brokenhearted to see it wasn&#x27;t available in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> It was so great I already bought a second one.</li>
            <li> There is a diffuser available for the Infiniti, too.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast, and styles it nicely.</li>
            <li> and it finishes silky smooth</li>
            <li> Works great on coarse hair!</li>
            <li> I now can have straigt, shiny hair, almost as good as a professional blow-out.</li>
            <li> The different tension types really help you find the best setting for your hair, and the heat is not unbearable.</li>
            <li> It does really good for my hair considering I&#x27;m going natural...</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Maybe with time I will get more adept at drying it even fast, but right now I cannot complain about 20 minutes of drying time.  </li>
            <li> The dryer can get very hot, and if your fair is already brittle or damaged the high temperature may exacerbate it.</li>
            <li> But other than that, this product is very good.</li>
            <li> combine this with a flat iron (because my hair is very curly) and I end up with a great look!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!!  </li>
            <li> I had recently ordered this blow dryer and I love!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take some time so if you&#x27;re looking for something quick &amp; easy</li>
            <li> First of all, the dryer is lightweight and the straightening attachment rotates so that you can angle to whatever position&#x27;s most comfortable for you when drying.</li>
            <li> What a thrill, plus it&#x27;s quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The straightening attachment gets VERY VERY hot and falls off  too easily.</li>
            <li> It doesnt get hot at all, more like high warm at it&#x27;s highest setting.</li>
            <li> I lost lot of hair in the first use and am scared of using it any more.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today and it took me 45 mins start to finish with better results, and I know it will be even faster once I get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I originally thought the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; and \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; thing was just a gimmick</li>
            <li> but well worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for $59.00 but just got it here on Amazon for my (twin) sister for $39.99.</li>
            <li> I had the long comb style dryer infinity by Conair before and it did a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li> When I tried the conair infinity I was excited by a bit aprehensive.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> -Im pretty sure my life wont go that way</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> For me, that alone was worth the price!</li>
            <li> This dryer doesnt get real hot and your gets caught in the comb on the attachment.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer originally at a department store.  </li>
            <li> So worth the money!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> It does straighten hair but the best part is that even long hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled in like the older styles with the intake on the side of the dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fast and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I saw this product and thought it was too good to be true - dry, straighten, bodify, de-tangle, and smooth all in one?!</li>
            <li> Totally worth it and such a great price.  </li>
            <li> It is really great because before i had to blow dry then straighten my hair because the blow dryer would always leave some waves.  </li>
            <li> The attachment is brilliant and has cut my style time in half.</li>
            <li> My sister raved about how much she loved it, me....not so much.</li>
            <li> I WILL NEVER USE A NORMAL DRYER AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li> and it honestly seemed a little too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> Other styler dryers are more effective with higher wattage (I&#x27;m currently using another Conair at 1875 watts with brush attachment) and high heat settings, which is much more effective for straightening hair, however, does cause a great deal of breakage.  </li>
            <li> This little \\&quot;Hair Designer\\&quot; was very surprising.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is pretty light and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, right out of the box but the instruction CD and printed booklet are helpful too.</li>
            <li> This new product falls very short of my expectations, however, is on the right track for the perfect styler-dryer.</li>
            <li> Forget trying to style in a wave under, or trying to reach the roots for more volume or shine or control, unless you have a giant head and very strong arms.</li>
            <li> really does make a huge difference in the texture and shininess of my hair!  </li>
            <li> The finish and effectiveness as my wife says, is really great and as expected from the Ads.</li>
            <li> I got the hang of flipping the ends and my hair is pretty straight with nice flipped ends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great blow dryer, it keeps my relaxed hair looking permed after it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever been able to get my hair this straight - not even a trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> use the cool button when done for smoothness.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer, my hair is curly and very frizzy this product reduces the frizz by atleast 50%.  </li>
            <li> I have not had success yet with getting my ends to curl under or to be smooth.</li>
            <li> Once finsihed, I passed the dryer through my hair on the cool setting.  </li>
            <li> I love how it makes my heair all shiny and heathy and straight</li>
            <li> Also, use the cool shot button on each section to finish it (closes the hair shaft and locks in style, i.e. helps eliminate frizz).  </li>
            <li> blowdrying my hair because it took so much time and, yes, if I wanted to straighten it, it would taken even MORE time (almost TWO HOURS).  </li>
            <li> soft and has a nice sheen to it...</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this device.  </li>
            <li> It looks cute and modern, but it does not straighten the hair as it \\&quot;promises\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Using the comb-like attachment didn&#x27;t really help get thru the tangles, so I just switched to the more focused dryer attachment.</li>
            <li> but I returned mine for a full refund.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it (though I wouldn&#x27;t pay $60 for ANY hairdryer period).</li>
            <li> Thank-you Conair for designing this and for Amazon for having fast and efficient delivery :)</li>
            <li> I love the attachment as it really smoothes out my hair.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because it does not straighten as smooth as a traditional straightener, but its an excellent traditional hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Cool blow dryer, doesnt get my hair bone</li>
            <li> The dryer works quickly and really does leave my color treated hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to get the hang of the combs.</li>
            <li> 360 degree rotating head is great but be careful!</li>
            <li> Very good dryer especially for my 3c natural hair</li>
            <li> However, I was getting tirred of spending over an hour every time, I needed something quick, so I ended up ordering it.  </li>
            <li> Three passes on each section and my hair was nice and straight - NOT BONE STRAIGHT</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m lucky, so I&#x27;m returning this for a cheaper, simpler dryer.</li>
            <li> still haven&#x27;t viewed the DVD that came with this product, but a quick glance at these reviews told me just about everything I needed to know.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, it really isn&#x27;t any better and isn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li> decent blowdryer, but you could find cheaper ones for sure.  </li>
            <li> It does straighten hair, but isn&#x27;t as quick as the advertisements would have you believe.  </li>
            <li> Lucky to find it on amazon</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer before and loved it, unitl my husband by accident dropped it into the toilet</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, is within a decent price range, and my sister and I both love it.</li>
            <li> It is so quick and my hair looks like I have been to a salon.  </li>
            <li> When I recived this package I opened it up jumped in the shower and got out as quick as I got in.</li>
            <li> Dries my shoulder length hair quickly.</li>
            <li> :) Just make sure to get the proper heat protection before doing any of this so to protect your hair from the heat.</li>
            <li> My hair still has the volume, but it&#x27;s shiny and healthy looking, and the right amount of straight.</li>
            <li> The attachment gets very hot, so use a wash towel when removing it.</li>
            <li> ---that&#x27;s very hot).  </li>
            <li> I set the tension to 4 (highest) and it grabs pretty well, but I still have to use my free hand to keep my hair from blowing out of the comb.  </li>
            <li> it gets very hot against my neck.</li>
            <li> Instead the rotating combs manage to tangle my hair more than normal.</li>
            <li> So, for a sleek, straight look, I find it incredibly easy and quick, and have recommended it to friends.  </li>
            <li> If you have the patience and you get more adept at using it, you can get your hair really straight and not have to use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love my new Conair Infinity designer.  </li>
            <li> I returned this item right away for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this works great for some--specifically those with wavy  or slightly curly hair</li>
            <li> Works fast and easy to straighten and defrizz.</li>
            <li> Plus it is fast and is easy to work.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and very durable.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t:  an easy way to achieve salon straight blown out hair style.</li>
            <li> takes a good 20 min for it to fully dry.  </li>
            <li> I have probably gone through 5 flat irons (settling on the Babybliss , best flat iron</li>
            <li> I was able to soak the straigtening attachment in warm water and the flocked discs were not worn at all, just matted down with hair products</li>
            <li> The product is pretty good, nevertheless I bought the product expecting to be a new product, came wrapped in bubble wrap, with scratch, was sold as a new item but was used!</li>
            <li> The hot air styler is smaller (better for travel) and may be ok if you have thinner or shorter hair.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed is that this is not a product for people with short/shorter hair at all!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried everything to get it to stay straight!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> It was fast, easy and well the worth it.</li>
            <li> It can be easily detached for cleaning or to replace with the traditional attachment that is also included with this dryer if you did want to use it with a rounded brush for more bounce.</li>
            <li> hair dryer is not only easy to use, but it saves time and is better for your hair.</li>
            <li> other than that its still going strong and i love it!</li>
            <li> But it makes my hair silky soft and very smooth,</li>
            <li> I have fine, very wavy hair, and a lot of it,  and didn&#x27;t know if this would work for me</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a burnt smell to my hair and my hair really was smooth.  </li>
            <li> My hair was smooth, straight, &amp; still had body to it</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really get my hand comfortable yet.  </li>
            <li> The hair looks much silkier and Smooth than ever before.     </li>
            <li> Conair took the old stick-style Hair Designer and made it better.</li>
            <li> but WELL worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This was well worth the $50.</li>
            <li> The air gets REALLY hot &amp; since you&#x27;re using your free hand to guide your hair, it can burn your fingers or neck &amp; your hair gets really hot.</li>
            <li> I own a Babybliss straightening dryer (Babybliss is the French version of Conair)</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost for anyone looking to straighten or just speed up their drying time.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only nice quality of this product is its color.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but it was worth it in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> much* better than it did with my old hairdryer</li>
            <li> This product was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain (especially when traveling!)</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never been good at the whole styling thing using multiple hands</li>
            <li> My hair ends up being so soft, straight and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Since I own three already, the sixty-dollar one has to go back.</li>
            <li> It seemed that it worked best on people with thick, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most important feature and it doesn&#x27;t work properly.  </li>
            <li> well worth it.    </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> We both had fun trying it</li>
            <li> This is completely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get my natural hair</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, that I ordered a second one just in case this one breaks.  </li>
            <li> It has made my naturally wavy hair much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I just kind of wish there were different settings for temperature air that comes out.</li>
            <li> but I decided that I was worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting my curly, wavy, frizzy, thick hair since I was a teenager (many, many, many years ago).</li>
            <li> Honestly, if I had known this product was going to exist, I wouldn&#x27;t have cut my hair last year.</li>
            <li> I loved the older model, which was lighter and dried my hair so much more quickly.  </li>
            <li> I skip the instructions, click on the special nozzle and expect super straight hair........</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because no matter what they tell you, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair as straight and sleek as a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and dries my hair quickly leaving my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it does do a good job at drying my hair overall pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I even used it right after coloring and there was no frizz or damage.</li>
            <li> Right from the start it wouldn&#x27;t cooperate.</li>
            <li> The hair is just blown right out of the attatchment.</li>
            <li> and I was right not to think that.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, it makes your hair very soft and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It comes out pretty straight and frizz free</li>
            <li> Continue, letting more and more hair down while putting it through the drier.</li>
            <li> This is so great, my hair is dry in 20-30 minutes instead of the hour it used to take with my old drying</li>
            <li> I love that I can get pretty straight hair without having to apply the extra heat from a flatiron, and it gets the job done very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY wavy hair that would never stay completly straight no matter how many styling products I would use; I was ready to do a chemical relaxer when I saw the magazine ad for the Infinity.    </li>
            <li> OK, it didn&#x27;t give me the dreamy hair I get when I leave the hairdresser&#x27;s, yet, it was far better than a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li> so it is not for the usual hair drying techniques but does a great job for what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small sized so it will be a great travel blow dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft, fine, shoulder length, and just about the curliest hair you will find.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions of using the straight nozzle attachment first, and then the special ceramic one.</li>
            <li> It did not give me a just-from-the-salon super straight look, but it did allow me to very quickly and easily dry my hair whilst easily detangling it.    </li>
            <li> This was a great find for a person who doesn&#x27;t like to waste a lot of time getting ready.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how fast it drys my hair, in fact, in gets extremely hot, thankfully there is a cool shot button.</li>
            <li> Works great on my type 4 African American hair.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair dry on its own for awhile, then finish with this dryer.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using it for most of my hair then attach the concentrator attachment and finish the top and front with my round brush.  </li>
            <li> I have a nice glossy finish and it does not leave my hair looking damaged and dry.</li>
            <li> A nice blow dryer for straightening the hair when you&#x27;re short on time or don&#x27;t really feel like it.</li>
            <li> Nice concept, but does not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> this is a great blow dryer for someone like me, who wants to tame frizz at all costs.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say it got my hair as straight as with a flat iron, but honestly I didn&#x27;t think it would.</li>
            <li> (it took my fine naturally wave-prone hair and made it look Jennifer Aniston-esque in</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I took my time &amp; went slowly following the manuel the 1st time I did have great results, my mom couldn&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> You may be wondering why then, if I loved my other dryer so much, did I decide to try the Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer?  </li>
            <li> THis dried it fast, I still have to use a straight iron, but this is a great start to a nice blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new ways of straightening my hair and was excited when this product first came out.</li>
            <li> Those of us with natural hair know that when we are drying higher heat helps make the hair more manageable, even though your hair looses moisture with high heat</li>
            <li> I am a African-American woman with not so course or kinky hair but definitely unruly since I don&#x27;t use chemical relaxers any more.</li>
            <li> The plastic hooks are pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> The rear airflow is a much better solution to avoid breakage, but needs to have hotter temperatures to actually straighten the hair.  </li>
            <li> So what do I do with this hairdryer at first?</li>
            <li> but it really isn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer took 20 minutes off of my getting ready time!  </li>
            <li> So Much Faster!</li>
            <li> Your better off buying a cheaper hair dryer that does the same job.</li>
            <li> the first two times I have used this.</li>
            <li> then you need, go over a hair section, and then switch to one higher, go over that section again, and do that until you reach tension 4.</li>
            <li> (I used it on setting 1 the first time and it DID rip some of my hair out, but that WAS my fault).  </li>
            <li> It took about an hour; remember, this was my first time</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a first.</li>
            <li> used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> I threw the box out the first time I used this dryer.  </li>
            <li> but this was my first time using the dryer</li>
            <li> so I might not have given it enough time to work its magic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cumbersome</li>
            <li> but I mastered it with the first use.    </li>
            <li> I read the other reviews before I bought this hairdryer, and I am so glad I bought it!  </li>
            <li> The combination of straightening and softening my hair was what I was interested in for this product.  </li>
            <li> I watched the instructional DVD and read the instructions to make sure I was using it properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different blow dryers and I stink at it.  </li>
            <li> She used to have Braun dryers before and this was our first experience with Conair.</li>
            <li> This product takes no time at all and works very well!  </li>
            <li> I really looked like I had just been to a salon!  </li>
            <li> I put in my favorite straightening product and then brushed it through.</li>
            <li> I pulled the top section back out of the way and put the bottom sections in the dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It found it easier to do sections @ a time by clipping most of my hair back when doing a section</li>
            <li> She often straightens her curly hair but the hot iron was drying her hair out.  </li>
            <li> I love Conair and is the only product I buy when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li> However, it does make my hair get pretty darn hot.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time tonight</li>
            <li> ;-)  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> ;-) &lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how exactly it works</li>
            <li> i bought this hairdryer because although my hair is straight already, it needs some shape on a night out!</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My first Infiniti hair dryer lasted almost 7 years.</li>
            <li> Ill find out its a wonderful product when I can allot 3 hours to do my hair</li>
            <li> , hot feels really hot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty hot, just wish it was a bit hotter.</li>
            <li> I used the Infiniti for the first time this morning without looking at the instuctions</li>
            <li> You have to use the dryer with out the straighten attachment first, but it takes just a couple minutes.  </li>
            <li> I came back to work looking fabulous!</li>
            <li> I have had this for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Then I would add a curl under w/my hot air brush.</li>
            <li> The first one I owned lasted about four years.  </li>
            <li> NOW, since the Infiniti, my hair is smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Many years later, I still use it.</li>
            <li> I would pay the same or more now since this is a hair dryer that somehow has flown under the radar, straightens my hair in a flash.</li>
            <li> Overall, this dryer performs better than any salon blow out</li>
            <li> This dryer is much better than using a regular dryer and hairbrush to straighten the hair.  </li>
            <li> Silly me, this blow dryer is great for all hair lengths and types!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and have not been able to insert my hair properly in the tooth brush attachment.  </li>
            <li> It does not get extremely hot</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer, especially the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> Be sure to have the comb enter your hair first, as I put my hair through the middle plates first and had a lot of hair fall stuck in the ceramic plates.</li>
            <li> This i my second blow dryer after revlon, and i love it.</li>
            <li> This product pays for itself after the first time you do your hair.</li>
            <li> FIRST</li>
            <li> I had this dryer for a few months and absolutely loved it until it broke</li>
            <li> My family is a great mixer and our hair comes in every beautifully full type, to thinnnn thin baby type.</li>
            <li> this probably isn&#x27;t for you &amp; I&#x27;m 1 of those people who is always looking for the fastest &amp; best way to dry &amp; straighten my hair so while it worked, it took a little longer than I hoped</li>
            <li> And quite frankly I always envied those women who could get themselves together quickly compared to my \\&quot;high maintenance\\&quot; (and often not satifying) hair routine.</li>
            <li> This is a beauty must have for long curly hair, I blow dry in sections bottom to top &amp; this is an amazing invention.</li>
            <li> To make a very long story short, I read the directions, put it to use and within 10 minutes I had a great style.</li>
            <li> Another good thing about this dryer is, it really did reduce my styling time in half.</li>
            <li> With this product, I get a smooth and soft look, with more volume than the flat iron would leave me.</li>
            <li> Because I get SO much volume, I&#x27;ve been able to go several more days without washing my hair (total added bonus!).  </li>
            <li> It works so much better than my flat iron straightener.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the Instyler and flat irons and have not been pleased with the results, ease of use, and felt they were frying my hair and giving me breakage.</li>
            <li> and if I want even more straightening, I will use my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I get SO many more compliments and saving at least 20 minutes a day really adds up!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a replacement to 3 other blow dryers I own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second one of these, and I&#x27;ll be using them my whole life I&#x27;m pretty sure.</li>
            <li> so I did have to use a flat iron to finish my sleek look :)  </li>
            <li> shot button doesn&#x27;t work well, it keeps blowing warm, although not hot, air&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> However, for a more sleek look after drying, I need to spray on some shine and then use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I am so amazed on how straight, smooth, and soft it got my hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you separate your hair into sections using clips (which the instructions suggest doing!) and dry section by section, then it&#x27;s really quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> I have a very stubborn wave in my hair that nothing in my entire life has been able to correct except for this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 20 minutes later my arms are sore but at least my hair looks great!  </li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair, and bought this for my sister who has shorter hair now, thinking it was better for her.</li>
            <li> :) Just like when my stylist does it, my hair came straight with ease and looked like a salon style blow out only without the salon price tag</li>
            <li> and I pretty much have to rip it out, there is no other way to free myself.</li>
            <li> With this dryer, you MUST mostly dry your hair first before the straightening attachment will be able to grab your hair</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I asked for this product for Christmas after reading a couple of positive articles on it.</li>
            <li> I think it might work better if you have long hair, or hair</li>
            <li> It saves me so much time and, after two years, the comb has not broken!  </li>
            <li> but when I want it straight, it was the blow dryer first with a brush followed by a straightening iron.</li>
            <li> I think it is better meant for long layers or one length hair</li>
            <li> of this dryer is EXTREMELY hot and it is very cumbersome to use.  </li>
            <li> it remained in good condition when I moved it out this past March.  </li>
            <li> Others have complained that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, but I found it to be perfect - hot enough to do the job well and quickly, but not so hot that it fried my hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it til today because I was intimidated by the directions, but it was a snap once I realized you can kind of push it down on the hair</li>
            <li> I wanted to go with straight hair, it meant dragging out the ceramic straightener, the hot rollers, or the large barrel curling iron.</li>
            <li> and I used the device on setting # 3 but with low heat as the high heat was drying my hair faster than I was able to use the device.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I purchased this one is because I had their other model which was FABULOUS!!!</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the photos showing someone with very long hair using this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver even in the back of my head, and I don&#x27;t even have to section my hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use the hairdryer for touch ups the next morning.</li>
            <li> The instructions, reading them helped a lot!, were easy enough</li>
            <li> The commercial makes this product look easy to use, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It definitely dries my hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Blow dryer is simple &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> So you will still need your flat iron, but other than that, it is great for a conair product.</li>
            <li> It looks easy on TV commercial, but is not in reality.  </li>
            <li> I dry and straighten my hair at once with more volume than a straightener.</li>
            <li> My hair looked as well or better as when I dry it in sections with the $235.00 hairdryer and a large brush.  </li>
            <li> As far as straightening, although I missed a couple of spots I simply touched up on, it&#x27;s probably one of the most effective ways to straighten, and my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel as dry/damaged as it does when I use other methods.</li>
            <li> I use a large barrel curling iron on ends to finish styling.</li>
            <li> but it is certainly sleek and manageable</li>
            <li> The infiniti did SUCH a good job, though it took a few minutes to figure out how to work with the special head</li>
            <li> My shorter hair is styled with layers, and the styling head for this dryer is too large to use on them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After shampooing, conditioning, applying various products including Lotta Body Coconut and Shea Style Milk (that I have recently started using and have had very good results) and untangling my hair, I use the Infiniti to dry and straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was able to dry my hair in 15 minutes!  </li>
            <li> This dryer certainly dries fast, and straightens, but my hair comes out frizzy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how well it works, but it does take a little effort to learn how to use effectively.</li>
            <li> I use a ceramic iron and then a spiral curling iron (also ceramic)...which still makes for a pretty high maintenance style, but this hair dryer defintely makes it a lot easier.   </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s only $3) and that also makes a huge difference in the smoothness/silkiness of my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend this!</li>
            <li> you will get straight strands.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer straightens and smoothes hair very well.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to take the frizz out of their hair without drying out your hair.</li>
            <li> and it is really shiney which is something I strive for.  </li>
            <li> I still had too much wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I now have hair almost as straight as Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If you are wanting a completely straight look then you might want to use a hair straightner like a chi.</li>
            <li> The diffuser dries my hair really fast.</li>
            <li> The straightening attachment gets my hair straighter than it is (it is naturally very wavy)</li>
            <li> but I still definately need to use a straight iron.</li>
            <li> However, the issue of heat is real.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very reliable Conair styler.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is basically a dryer with an unusual ceramic comb attached to the end.  </li>
            <li> And it is under $40 which is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this hairdryer a few times since I bought it last week, but I must say, I&#x27;m impressed with the results!  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer was what I expected and more.</li>
            <li> The DVD wasn&#x27;t really helpful to me</li>
            <li> and it was not as straight as I wanted.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer makes straightening hair SO much easier...</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Really, dont buy it.</li>
            <li> I prefer to wear it straight, and this dryer does the trick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, too.</li>
            <li> The roots are totally straight.    </li>
            <li> but if you have very curly hair like me (sprial curls) DON&#x27;T BOTHER.</li>
            <li> straight since I was about 15</li>
            <li> , I really don&#x27;t find it that time-consuming (it takes me about 30 minutes--my hair is very curly</li>
            <li> The one thing about very curly hair and straghtening though, is that you need to spend a lot of time on the ends or you&#x27;ll end up with frizzy ends that look damaged even when they&#x27;re not.</li>
            <li> If you have very curly hair and can relate to what i&#x27;m talking about, then just step away from the \\&quot;order now\\&quot; button.</li>
            <li> So instead of spending 2-3 hrs washing and straightening her hair, it&#x27;ll now probably take me 2 - 2 1/2 hrs for the whole process.      </li>
            <li> The product does not make the hair straight as advertised.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I have ringlets, frizz, waves, and straight portions, which makes styling a challenge.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend them together!</li>
            <li> It really takes about a week to get used to this dryer.</li>
            <li> This is much easier.</li>
            <li> Depending on where you place the dial is how straight it will make your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of products on my hair to keep it straight.  </li>
            <li> I got this hair \\&quot;designer\\&quot; as a gift after talking about it &amp; how much I wanted it for 2 or 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you may want to get a cheap mirror you can hang across from the mirror you&#x27;ll be looking in b/c if you can see the back of your head</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier&lt;</li>
            <li> It performs much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Her hair looks so much healthier now.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t blowdry my hair at night, because i think that would be too much damage with blowdrying and then using a straightening iron.  </li>
            <li> but then I found this feature to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Just coming to this page to buy another for a friend who tried it and wants one too.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it dries your hair up really fast which will save you some time.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t straighten very well at all.  </li>
            <li> I still used a hair straightener when I was done using the dryer but that is because I wanted to get my hair really straight.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I have very curly/ frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as a straightener, but that&#x27;s what I like about this.</li>
            <li> It really works very well.  </li>
            <li> Id need a whole day to watch video and learn the correct way to use this on my short,curly hair but perhaps if and when that day comes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the hair completely straight though.  </li>
            <li> or you could really burn yourself and/or damage your hair.</li>
            <li> and once I&#x27;m done my hair has volume, is straight, and has not knots.  </li>
            <li> Now if only Conair made a diffuser attachment to fit this dryer....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gets really fuzzy and puffy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do anything to minimize the time it takes for my wife to get ready.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> this straight without going to the salon.</li>
            <li> This really helps to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> IT doesn&#x27;t really work with the power you look for your hair..</li>
            <li> It dries my hair really fast</li>
            <li> , my roots are straight 2 months from a relaxer.</li>
            <li> save as much time as I&#x27;d hoped&lt;br /&gt;Cold</li>
            <li> I really like this blow dryer</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I was ready for a change and decided to try this.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look like curly hair that has this straight but bushy look.  </li>
            <li> It drys the hair fast.  </li>
            <li> I tryed this hair dryer and could not even finish because it just broke soooooo much of my hair</li>
            <li> but I never found a way to achieve silky straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I never even bothered with the instructional DVD, and I got the hang of it really fast.  </li>
            <li> The attachements stay in place and it gets my hair really straight.</li>
            <li> And the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> thats because it has to brush through the hair and get very close.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> I dont use that one much</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really gotten the hang of that.</li>
            <li> It made my hair shiny and straight, but without the super-limp look I get with the straightening iron.</li>
            <li> This really does straighten wavy hair.</li>
            <li> very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> I found it very cumbersome to work with.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> My hair was straight but very frizzy.</li>
            <li> Her hair is much thicker, though also straight, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to give her the frizzy like it did me.</li>
            <li> fast drying ones  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I STRAIGHT MY HAIR EVERY WEEK USING THIS HAIR DRYER</li>
            <li> Much hotter.</li>
            <li> Really smooths hair well</li>
            <li> It dries it straight.</li>
            <li> It dries the hair really fast, too.</li>
            <li> It straightens my kinky hair bone straight.</li>
            <li> product is super easy to use, dries the hair quickly, NO FRIZZ,</li>
            <li> If I wanted my hair to be presentable, I would need to set aside at least 45 minutes, sometimes up to an hour if I wanted to look really good.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love the way my hair looks straight, but as it dries naturally, all the kinks and body come back.    </li>
            <li> :) Oh, also it left my hair with volume, soft, and shiney.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, and it wasn&#x27;t a good straigtener.</li>
            <li> Use this dryer exactly as intended (it&#x27;s not hard at all-</li>
            <li> Sure it is slightly akward to use at first, but it works well.  </li>
            <li> normally let my hair air dry, but after discovering this hair dryer I&#x27;ll look forward to using it again. :)</li>
            <li> nothing I loved - even after a long blow dry session.</li>
            <li> My hair is EXTREMELY curly and I have tried most every hair dryer out there to blow it straight.  </li>
            <li> Also spray your wet hair with a heat protecting flat iron spray for good measure.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes of being able to straighten my daughter&#x27;s naturally wavy hair without burning it out with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t expect a miracle out of a hair dryer (let&#x27;s be realistic)</li>
            <li> After using this dryer my hair is straight usually a bit fluffy  (not so much frizzy :D)</li>
            <li> The manual and the instructional dvd show the product being used on top of your hair, but if you dry it from the underneath, you still get that straight style, but with a little lift at the roots (where I needed it most).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than holding a dryer in one hand and a brush in the other.</li>
            <li> warm setting, only high and low fan on high heat</li>
            <li> You can easily use it on dry hair to fix ponytail bumps too.    </li>
            <li> I must admit, that at first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t, but it really does straighten hair and makes it so soft.  </li>
            <li> While the Conair blow dry was not quite as smooth as those that I&#x27;ve had at a high-end NYC salon, it definitely was as smooth as a \\&quot;no appointment, FIFO\\</li>
            <li> Did not straighten as well as I thought it would and did not dry that quickly either.</li>
            <li> would be so much better as a wand design either completely rounded or even a long rectangle</li>
            <li> Using this dryer, my \\&quot;ironing\\&quot; time was cut down to 40 minutes and my hair seemed to fight the humidity better and stay straight longer.   </li>
            <li> but the first time i used this, my hair came out smooth, soft, and shiny w/out using any of the extra hair products i normally have to use.  </li>
            <li> and I have straight, highly polished hair.  </li>
            <li> However, if I had not already needed a new hairdryer, I would not have thought it worth replacing my old hairdryer.</li>
            <li> It cut my drying time more than in half and gets my hair as straight as the salon.</li>
            <li> You can see the waves smooth right out as you move the dryer down the length of the hair.</li>
            <li> I too own several expensive hair gadgets and products that promise to make your hair straight and silky, and this dryer does a fantastic job for my hair by delivering a quick, straight, silky style in record time.  </li>
            <li> I thought that it would tame my flyaways, even though I have very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re African-American with natural hair, this dryer will work IF you de-tangle your hair first.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it&#x27;s small, travels well, and fits nicely in my bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this hairdryer, I had shoulder-length, kinky/coarse natural African-American hair (4B).  </li>
            <li> It looks like I normally have straight hair.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product thinking that it would work for me since I have normal hair, not curly, or straight, but somewhat wavy</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair that often is tangled when wet.  </li>
            <li> I use it all the time now, and I let my hair down a lot more too.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new dryer and bought this based on reviews and the price!  </li>
            <li> reallyyyy helped me get my hair super straight for flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I often use jumbo curlers afterwards to make my hair appear even more silky with a slight curl to the ends.  </li>
            <li> This dryer took my drying time from 45 minutes to less than 20 and with much better results.</li>
            <li> The good news is my somewhat thin, cotton-candy, wavy, frizzy hair is shiny and STRAIGHT (with body.)</li>
            <li> have never figured out how to even do a halfway decent job blowing out my hair myself.  </li>
            <li> It definitely dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you are good with a blowdryer and a round brush, it&#x27;s not really necessary for you to buy this.</li>
            <li> I really hope to get a few more years out of it before I get another one.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few years back &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair (which is mostly FRIZZ at all times)and after using this dryer it was incredibly smooth, soft, shiny and full of bounce (not flat like after I use a straitening iron).</li>
            <li> am African American with natural hair that presses very easily.</li>
            <li> It looks very easy on the commercial when in fact it just frizzed up my hair and left it wild.  </li>
            <li> I am seriously heartbroken right now, because I REALLY wanted to love this thing.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty much all the same length, but it doesn&#x27;t really work for me the way it&#x27;s intended.  </li>
            <li> It was also a hassle to keep switching the position of the attachment for different areas of your head, and it gets very hot to touch when you need to turn it.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels very healthy and shiny, and the drying time was a lot less than a regular dryer.  </li>
            <li> As for straightener I highly recommend the maxiglide straightener by maxius.</li>
            <li> I did have to use a ceramic iron to get a high gloss</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer (and the life-saving comb attachment) to anyone who has hard-to-manage, difficult-to-dry hair.  </li>
            <li> recommend it, highly.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Straightening has always been a challenge even when armed with good sprays serums and and lotions my hair hardly responded positively to heat especially with blow dryers.</li>
            <li> The straightener actually straightens my hair, almost better than my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair was healthy feeling and with little breakage and shedding, unlike when I had tried to do it before with a brush and blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to learn how to hold and maneuver it, but the results on my hair is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I need a little practice to get the ends to flip out, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get there.</li>
            <li> What I like about it is that it gives GREAT volume, with way less work than I would typically need (</li>
            <li> My hair was not dry or brittle but super soft.  </li>
            <li> Gets my hair dry super fast.</li>
            <li> It turns out soft and mostly straight.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of whether or not it work on African-American hair; it works great.</li>
            <li> I still need to use the iron as well but not as much as with my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this product worked really well.  </li>
            <li> This product takes out all the frizz and leaves a gentle, natural wave.</li>
            <li> It does slightly smooth the hair that I can grasp toward the ends but does not allow styling - not wavy, not straight, not even a Farrah whip.</li>
            <li> Its so much easier than the old brush and blow routine.</li>
            <li> My hair has to be blow dried to feel healthy.</li>
            <li> I literally really did get salon results, and in only 45 minutes on my first try.</li>
            <li> I get MUCH better results with a round brush.</li>
            <li> , i straighnet my hair everyday with it, and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and makes in more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Given enough time to dry my hair (40+ minutes), I was able to get a decent shape, but</li>
            <li> I get better results with a round brush and</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is great for natural hair girls and woman with kinky or thick hair.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to go for a normal dryer.  </li>
            <li> I still flat iron my hair with my Wigo flat iron which I love but</li>
            <li> I use it just about everyday and have dropped it more times than I can count.</li>
            <li> This works fairly well to \\&quot;pre-straighten\\&quot; and cuts down on the time spent with the straightning iron.  </li>
            <li> There are just certain things I prefer as new and a hair dryer; that requires direct contact with my hair, is something that I would want as new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to use at all.  </li>
            <li> My hair comes out shiny and straight, super soft, and keeps it from getting oily all day long.</li>
            <li> What was worrying me the most was that there was an extreme of very low and and very high reviews, and that no description seemed ot match my hair type.</li>
            <li> However, after about two months the roots start to grow in and since I am now spoiled, I wanted to use something that would easily straighten the roots (the most difficult part) and that I could use on the treated hair as well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like the old days when I used to dry my hair smooth with a brush and then set it on electric rollers...</li>
            <li> I just stared in the mirror for 5 minutes admiring that I was able to dry and straighten my hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> the hair dryer is not as easy as you think to use especially when you have different layers</li>
            <li> My hair was dry in ten minutes, silky, and smooth!  </li>
            <li> My old conair 1874 dryer with attached brush worked much better than this and is half the price.</li>
            <li> For those with more tame hair</li>
            <li> But now, I can easily wear my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I only wish that those of us with fine hair could get a discount by buying the same one without a comb!!</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and straight with a little lift at the roots</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot enough and powerful enough to give you the results you are looking for.</li>
            <li> it would help me get my daughters natural hair a little straighter and more manageable.</li>
            <li> As a person who has used this \\&quot;type\\&quot; of hairdryer for over 30 years, I have to rate this new product as so-so.  </li>
            <li> and I immediately bought a new one.</li>
            <li> I have asked every new hair stylist I can for tips.</li>
            <li> My [...] had to get everyone in the house to come see mommy&#x27;s new hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair a bit staticky, but it&#x27;s also because I live in the desert.  </li>
            <li> I now live by my ceramic iron.  </li>
            <li> I contacted their support and asked if there is anything that could be done (change to a new product or anything).</li>
            <li> I also have a new dryer that I have purchased since then that has a brush too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I had one before and needed a new one</li>
            <li> so we needed a new one.</li>
            <li> In my order I requested a new dryer.</li>
            <li> if I let my hair dry in a pony tail or braid before using the flat iron instead the end result is much better.</li>
            <li> My Wet 2 Straight flat iron by Remington does a much better job and leaves my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> straightener.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it dry super fast, but my hair is bone straight when I&#x27;m through.  </li>
            <li> I use this dryer with the concentrator end, not the straightner, to dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that has gotten curlier as I have gotten older.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and actually works to straighten and smooth my thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that it leaves my hair straightened, but not 100% straight (like Asian-hair straight).</li>
            <li> it dry quick, its truly portable, &amp;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this blow dryer to anyone who wishes to have soft straight hair and wants to save time on their daily beauty routine!</li>
            <li> and now my hair feels very very soft</li>
            <li> And so very soft.  </li>
            <li> With the previous smaller model I could tug at the roots and smooth them, also getting volume with the right technique, achieving a wavy style all over, or straighten it if I wanted to that day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to obtain the results in very little time.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I highly reccommend this product, much easier and quicker than blowing dry and then flat ironing my hair and better results.</li>
            <li> Now i can skip the straightening part and go straight to dry and straight with one thing!</li>
            <li> It basically does the same thing as this dryer, but I prefer this model because it dries quicker than the hot air styler.   </li>
            <li> While it definitely doesn&#x27;t produce the same results as using a flat iron, it does a pretty fantastic job considering you&#x27;re just using a blowdryer attachment.  </li>
            <li> Wow, is it ever!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this dryer to anyone with naturally curly hair who wants to wear it straight.</li>
            <li> any hot hair product will burn if not used properly.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and silky to the touch!  </li>
            <li> The first day I used it I had such bounce</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my soft hair now!  </li>
            <li> I did plug in my hot rollers once, just in case I needed extra volume, but I never had to use them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at all using a blower and brush, and this dryer is kind of a &#x27;two in one&#x27; deal.</li>
            <li> At first I thought - big deal, just packaging mumbo jumbo....</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I used it the first time out of the box without ever looking at any directions or watching the dvd or commercial!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure ya&#x27;ll are familiar with trying to use a curling brush with a hair dryer and how difficult it could be?  </li>
            <li> No big deal, but you may have to turn off the hair dryer first before doing it b/c</li>
            <li> Makes hair extremely soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it left my hair pretty frizzy.  </li>
            <li> But it makes blow drying a breeeeze for us all, with the built in brush, which i also initially under estimated, it makes the process so much quicker and easier!</li>
            <li> I was dying for this blowdryer when it first came out when I was in middle school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact blow dryer for the pass 9 years and this is my second one.</li>
            <li> you are already looking for a new hairdryer, and want to straighten and dry your hair in one step, this is worth it.</li>
            <li> Unlike the smaller Conair Infiniti BC173W model that I could actually grasp and style my fine but full long hair with, this model only allows for hot blow dry and then very hot pull through even on the low setting.</li>
            <li> Note, I don&#x27;t dry my hair from underneath, I dry my hair from the top of each section.</li>
            <li> I can truly create some serious straight hair magic in about 13 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Both processes aren&#x27;t only laborious, they always leave my hair EXTREMELY dry with frizzy ends, which I \\&quot;band-aid\\&quot; with a strong moisture creme.</li>
            <li> Was excited to see this dryer, as I had previously had the Conair BC173 (no longer available) and thought that this appeared to be very similar and was described as having similar abilities.  </li>
            <li> have very curly fine hair and have been straightening it myself for years and have a hard time finding salons that can get it as straight and smooth as I can at home using a round brush and then a straightener.</li>
            <li> hair is thick, but very fine.</li>
            <li> I have kind of problem hair: thick but fine, wavy in the back but stick straight in front, limp, cowlickie, and slippery.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes of it controlling my hair which is dry curly frizzy fine and somewhat fragile.  </li>
            <li> (you have to push or pull your hair into it, easy after a few strokes).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very intuitive, so I read the manual quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats to raging hot in just a few seconds, with a decently powerful blow.</li>
            <li> Of course, I have to use my Chi to get it super straight, but if you are looking for a little bit of straightening with some volume, just the dryer is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have natural African American hair and this hair dryer makes my hair much more manageable when I use it before flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Then I put most of my hair up so only some of my hair was down.  </li>
            <li> and it goes more than midway down my back.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re an African american woman with hard to manage hair like mine, you have to own this and the prostyler straightener and your hair troubles are over!</li>
            <li> You need to hold the hair tight in sections when the hair is still fairly damp/wet and pull the brush section through slowly, numerous times until the hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve got typical asian hair- fine and straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews, and i think people aren&#x27;t using the options on the attachment to their full advantage.  </li>
            <li> When my wife&#x27;s previous 208S hair dryer broke after many years of daily use, she had to replace it with an identical one.  </li>
            <li> what I love is that instead of doing hair rollers and getting under that big hair dryer in order to dry my hair and for it to come out straight, I just wash my hair, let it dry naturally, and then use this product to straighten it</li>
            <li> My hair was a little fly away, but a little hairspray was all it took to settle it right down.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, inconsistently wavy hair that I always have trouble straightening.  </li>
            <li> I was using it incorrectly, I was able to dry my curly/fine 3b/3c hair bone straight in less than 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> I generally let my hair air dry for about 20 minutes after I&#x27;m out of the shower before giving it a quick rough-dry with the air concentrator.  </li>
            <li> After drying (which dried my hair a lot faster than with a plain dryer) and then a quick few passes with an iron to get any leftover flips out, my hair looks great.  </li>
            <li> I get my hair chemically relaxed, and it has been nearly 2 months since my last relaxer, and my hair is nearly as straight as it was the day I stepped from my Beverly Hills</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I found out Conair makes the American version, but I was skeptical of course.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not only straight, but also soft after using the dryer.</li>
            <li> like it because it does make your hair soft and does add a lot of volume, and I&#x27;m absolutely hopeless with a regular blowdryer.</li>
            <li> Humidity and wind recks my hair but at the end of the day this tool restores it to its somewhat natural beauty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American with natural hair (no perm or texturizer).</li>
            <li> The result - my hair feels silky and soft.</li>
            <li> This product has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Doing the old fashion roller brush blow out..</li>
            <li> Really drys my hair and straightens it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Stick straight, and no frizz, even though it&#x27;s pouring rain outside.   </li>
            <li> My hair is medium to coarse and very curly.  </li>
            <li> The attachment doesn&#x27;t hold hair taut enough to get it really straight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AMAZED at how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so simple to use and saves me so much time in the mornings now.</li>
            <li> after a while i finally figured out how much hair i can do at once</li>
            <li> When I found this one, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I even bought one for my 11-year-old stepdaughter, who has mid-back-length natural hair.  </li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, soft texture, spiral curls.</li>
            <li> I must say the product does as advertised, it straightened my very curly hair and it left it looking shiner.  </li>
            <li> one left them way too straight.  </li>
            <li> This worked but took so long and by the time I was done I was hot, sweaty and my arms hurt.    </li>
            <li> It leaves the the hair soft and straight (not necessarily bone straight) when used with the Lotta Body Styling Milk ($4.49 at my local beauty supply shop).</li>
            <li> I really do like the dryer overall</li>
            <li> I bought this item 2 nights ago and have used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li> I prefer it to be straight and sleek because, frankly, it&#x27;s a lot easier to deal with, especially on humid days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the end of the day and my hair is as smooth and shiny as after I dried it this morning.   </li>
            <li> I have some natural wave that turns to frizz.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a professional salon-quality hair dryer and was apprehensive about shelling out hundreds of dollars for one.  </li>
            <li> Plus, its kinda loud and</li>
            <li> Using my old products took about 25 min to do what this does in about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> It soft and no frizz whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased this hair dryer years ago (at a retail store) its cost was near $150.</li>
            <li> Feels comfortable and not overly heavy either.</li>
            <li> i have very curly, coarse hair, and it used to take me almost an hour to straighten it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you have to spend time drying your hair with a blowdryer then flat-ironing it to get it straight, then I would definitely recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> The drying/straightening process may work very well, but I found it so difficut to manipulate while \\&quot;test driving\\&quot; it with the manual that I never actually tried in on my hair.</li>
            <li> My old dryer couldn&#x27;t come close.    </li>
            <li> I bought this when i was 15-17 years old</li>
            <li> It straightens so you can manage your natural hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you&#x27;re in the market to get straight hair, get this blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and the use of this dryer is the only way to ensure my hair will stay straight all day even in the most humid weather.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the flocked shinifying thing on the comb attachement seems to bea waste of space unless its secret purpose was to collect excess hair product, which in that case it does a great job!</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and mostly straight, but there is a huge wave or \\&quot;hump\\&quot; that goes right through the back</li>
            <li> my hair is somewhere between curly and very very wavy, and super duper thick.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it took only 15 minutes to dry my hair perfectly straight</li>
            <li> When I got this I was a little nervous about spending that amount of money on a dryer - it was WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> Not flat-iron straight, but straight enough to be prepped for the flat iron.</li>
            <li> All I can say, is that I knew it was going to work after I started to dry the first section of hair.  </li>
            <li> You do have to use the dryer by itself first to dry your hair, then you use the attachment to straighten (the promo I saw made it look like just one step).  </li>
            <li> I first take off the attachment and just dry my hair until just damp.  </li>
            <li> I have worn my hair curly for many years because I am inept with a blowdryer and round brush and didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have curls, strong ones, but they are closer to small &#x27;Victorian&#x27; salon curls.</li>
            <li> I think it should be good for thicker and wavier hair, mine is very thin.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t stick straight like I used a flat iron</li>
            <li> Unlike a flat iron this product enables you to have volume in your straight hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t straighten my hair with a blow dryer and using a flat iron damages my hair too much.</li>
            <li> It does not save as much time as I&#x27;d hoped, but it is easier than using a hairdryer, brush and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Dont have to use the flat iron as much.</li>
            <li> Its not really that fantastic, actually its faster and easy to dry your hair with a conventional driyer.</li>
            <li> but never less then 30 dollars.</li>
            <li> it gets hot FAST so watch your fingers when going to adjust it &amp; make it horizontal or whichever direction or turn it off for a few seconds 1st!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and damages my hair less than flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use it on the low setting and it&#x27;s still powerful enough to dry a small section of my hair in 20 seconds at the most.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, wavy hair that becomes extremely frizzy in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I have one note of caution:  if your hair is damaged or extremely fragile, then probably don&#x27;t want to use this on high.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s only high and low heat and the high will burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it does save some time and is easier than using a regular dryer and a brush once you find the most comfortable way to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by following the instructions that came with the dryer.</li>
            <li> Many complained that it was hard to handle, but if you can handle a hairdryer with a round brush, then this will be super easy to handle in comparison.</li>
            <li> No regrets with this one!!</li>
            <li> One pass through the hair and it is dry and straight, but not limp.</li>
            <li> Read good reviews, but I have thick curly hair that I blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased it, willing to try anything new to help cut down my drying/straightening time.</li>
            <li> It has been very hot, and quite humid lately, but my  hair stays straight and shiny all day.</li>
            <li> say much about its functioning after long periods of use (I just bought it) but</li>
            <li> the only negatives is it doesn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as other blow dryers, which is fine because i flat iron my hair after i blow dry it anyway, and it&#x27;s really loud, i really wish it was quieter.</li>
            <li> After using the Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer, her long layered hair was straight, but with body and movement.</li>
            <li> long cord (I didn&#x27;t think it would matter, but it makes it much easier for me to use)&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold and use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> de-tangle my hair first with a wide tooth comb and section it</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I literally had to drag myself away from the mirror, I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at myself and running my hands through my hair -- I just couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> exactly what my daughter expected</li>
            <li> No big deal, it&#x27;s not hard to do.  </li>
            <li> dry your hair pretty well, while you want it wet, you don&#x27;t want it dripping or have TOO much water in it</li>
            <li> This is a great product I have really thick, curly, long hair and this cut my drying time in half.  </li>
            <li> I had long hair for a while, and the Infiniti dried it super fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of annoying that I have to keep holding down the cool button to get cool air.</li>
            <li> In my search for a new blow dryer my current one pooped up.</li>
            <li> Then I use this dryer to blow dry my hair straight</li>
            <li> My hair is dry much faster with this model.  </li>
            <li> and I can dry my hair straight in about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight and dry in record time.  </li>
            <li> I will admit that the dryer did dry her hair much quicker than using a blowdryer and brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient to dry your hair while straighten it too.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair in sections, and then use my Chi to get my hair sleek and straight.</li>
            <li> Using this product is so easy, and what used to take at least an hour now takes about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> it took much longer to dry her thick natural hair and her hair did not flow smoothly through the attachments.</li>
            <li> I use it to dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li> it enables me to blow dry my hair straight without causing damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, and am not coordinated enough to blow it out with a brush and regular blow dryer like they do at the salons.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and this dryer is great for either drying with a round brush to keep it wavy or using the attachment to make it straight, all without losing volume (which is my biggest complaint with straight irons).  </li>
            <li> Some folks (especially those with really curly hair) who might think this will be the only hair straightening product they&#x27;ll need will be in for a surprise.  </li>
            <li> There are a few important steps, such as figuring out where to set the tension control.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair that, while not extremely curly, has a wave pattern at the crown that is so strong even my $100 straightener doesn&#x27;t always do the job.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, and usually requires almost 2 hours with the straightning iron to get it good and straight.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an easy way to dry my hair without it getting really tight.</li>
            <li> Your hair gets very hot after it goes through the dryer attachement a few times</li>
            <li> The major cons for me is the packaging, the heaviness, and it doesn&#x27;t quite straighten my cow-lick out front.    </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy at first due to the cost, but when I factored in I go through a blow dryer about one a year for $25</li>
            <li> This is something no other dryer could do.</li>
            <li> but there is no other dryer like this</li>
            <li> It pretty much does the same job, so why waste $60?  &lt;</li>
            <li> If I tried to go with my waves, the diffuser would take about two hours to dry, and then I needed to style it on top of that- lots of product and scrunching, as well as the small barrel curling iron.</li>
            <li> It also did help straightening my hair - not as straight as with my straightening iron - but really cut WAY down on the amount of time I actually had to use my iron afterwards!  </li>
            <li> For anyone who gets frustrated with a straightener and just wants to dry and go, this is great.  </li>
            <li> Later I had to go over the whole thing with my conair flat iron and finish the job</li>
            <li> It dried my hair quickly and it straightened and smoothed my natural African American hair completely.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, especially for African-American or Mixed Race women.</li>
            <li> After you dry the section with the Infiniti, go over it with a flat iron while it&#x27;s still hot.</li>
            <li> It may not seem like such a huge deal, but when my usual straightening process can take up to 5 hours, it is.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s why it works so fast, but it hurts so be careful.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still not firm enough.  </li>
            <li> I just wrap my hair in a towel for about 10 minutes so my hair isn&#x27;t soaking wet, put some smoothing products in, comb through, and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li> Day 6 and on, I&#x27;m not going back to my old dryer and brush.    </li>
            <li> , pretty average length.  </li>
            <li> women of color, or women with natural hair, if you struggle with using a rounded hair brush and a traditional hair dryer, this is a life-saver!</li>
            <li> I can go from soaking wet hair, to straight and shiny in about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My first one was the wine, then grey and last one blue.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it three stars because this really performs the same as my yellow bird hairdryer, and my Sedu hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I guess if people who do not have naturally straight hair (like me -- thick and wavy/frizzy) want straight hair, we will have to get it the old fashioned way...</li>
            <li> It might be however that this drier works better on thin, course hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also important to draw the appliance slowly through your hair.</li>
            <li> However, the heat produced by the dryer is phenomenal, so much so, that it makes it difficult to hold the hair in place so that it can be straightened properly.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this hair dryer -- it seemed to good to be true, and I didn&#x27;t want to waste $55 on a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to dry my hair this way, but the result is absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I had one that broke last week after years of use and ordered a new one the same night!</li>
            <li> With this I can actually blow dry my curly hair straight...</li>
            <li> Black people have to moisturize our hair so vigorously either way that it&#x27;s worth it since the moisture get replaced daily through cremes and treatments.</li>
            <li> have thick shoulder length hair, with lots of natural curl and a tendency to get super oily halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many dryers, curling irons, and flat irons, and was doubtful that this dryer would be any better.  </li>
            <li> Now I have a new challenge, and have to tackle my daughter&#x27;s extremely long frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> , my only problem is I don&#x27;t really have the time to do this all the time being a single mom of a 4 yr.</li>
            <li> The first one has lasted so long and still works like new, I haven&#x27;t needed to open the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry without brushing or fussing with it, and I was surprised to see it dry straight, shiny, and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li> Normally my hair can take up to 30 minutes to blow dry, but I was done in under 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It takes less than 20 minutes to go from wet to straight, smooth, bodified hair with minimal split ends!</li>
            <li> Now, I cut my time in half and my hair is totally straight!    </li>
            <li> The air is not as hot as other dryers on the same price range.</li>
            <li> with how quickly I can transform my spirals into to straights without excessive damage or breakage.  </li>
            <li> I could only hold onto the ends for about half the length of the strand, and as soon as I let go, the air coming from the dryer would just blow the hair right off the attachment.  </li>
            <li> And it was really hard to clean out.</li>
            <li> As advertised I thought I did not need to use any other dryer to finish the hair and make it straight.</li>
            <li> other plus to this, is that it works really well with straightening synthetic kanekelon or Marley hair (get a brand that is heat resistent like Vanessa).  </li>
            <li> Flat ironing it after helps considerably, but</li>
            <li> straight as the other AA posters proclaimed</li>
            <li> It doesnt make as much noise at other blow-dryer.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to shape my hair with this than it has ever been with any other dryer.</li>
            <li> I usually do not blow out my hair, but every once in a while, I like to see how long my hair has gotten.  </li>
            <li> The straightening device does lock in place, so I&#x27;m thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to hold it on while I work through small sections of my thick natural hair.</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron after it&#x27;s dry to make it straight and silky.  </li>
            <li> However, that ended up taking longer than it used to take me to dry it while pulling straight with a brush and using a flat iron afterwards.</li>
            <li> Now it only takes 10 mins that includes the hair being wet and then fully styled and ready to leave the house.</li>
            <li> Wet to silky straight takes about 25 minutes total if you follow this advice.</li>
            <li> so my hair is manageable and not dry or damaged at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it&#x27;s worth five stars because I have used this dryer every day for over ten years without any trouble.</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever, I want to thank the other reviewers for telling us how they felt good and bad</li>
            <li> in my opinion my flat iron took out the same amount of hair because of how much and long I had to use it.    </li>
            <li> the dryer can get a little hot while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble with flyaways on the ends and also had trouble getting the hair near the roots underneath perfectly straight - but the rest of it looks really good, especially considering the odd texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li> If I use the high heat, it is a wild mess.</li>
            <li> using the blowdryer with a round brush works faster and with better results (especially if you like a little volume and flip/curl to the ends) being that it&#x27;s a blowdryer</li>
            <li> It usually takes me 2 hours, more or less, to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> - usually I have to pull my hair very taut to straiten it with a round brush, and I can&#x27;t do it everyday because the heat and stress really damage my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Instead of drying all your hair at once, use a clip to hold half of it up while you dry the bottom half, then release the clip and do the rest :-)    </li>
            <li> where i normally have frizz and static, even with a round brush or straightening iron (i&#x27;m just not good with them i guess).      </li>
            <li> While the design is innovative, allowing airflow through the rear of the device rather than the side (which sucks up hair and breaks it off), it does not have the heat nor the wattage to straighten curly hair as effectively as other conair &#x27;hairbrush stylers&#x27; - i.e. a hairdryer that brushes through the hair.  </li>
            <li> In the end, after trying to futz with it for over an hour, I ended up having to still use my older hair dryer to blow dry my hair and flat iron.</li>
            <li> Trust me, at one point my hair actually broke off due to too much heat styling.  </li>
            <li> The only thing though is that it&#x27;s hard to clean...</li>
            <li> I am African-American with natural (4a/b-typed) hair; and my hair is LONG (about 2 and 1/2 inches from my elbows).  </li>
            <li> But I never really expected it would turn out like that using only the dryer.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised how well this hairdryer worked in my long, overstressed, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is a bit wirey, has no real shap, and normally I end up just wearing it in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I already have several hair dryers and rarely use heat on my hair so this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> , I guess the bottom line is if you are a person who has not mastered another alternative of blowing your hair straight (other than paying someone to do it for you) and can only straighten your hair with a regular blow dryer and then a straightening iron and/or curling iron, this might be the product for you.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new dryer and carefully did research this time.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer makes my hair feel cold and smooth, instead of hot and fried.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; attachment can be used directly on the hair to comb through to dry.</li>
            <li> and I have to dry it completely in the morning</li>
            <li> I have very course and slightly color damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I use my &amp;#34;Just Natural Organic dry hair shampoo &amp; conditioner.&amp;#34; I also give myself coconut milk treatments.</li>
            <li> My hair is longer than shoulder length, in layers, average thickness and fairly straight (it has a tiny bit of body).  </li>
            <li> ceramic wet dry straightening hot air styler at the same time thinking it was an entirely different product.  </li>
            <li> I gather from some of the other reviews that the product advertised a straight, flat ironed look.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure it is any better than just using a round, alumnimum-based brush.  </li>
            <li> But blowdrying with a round brush took so long that I would rarely do it, resulting in a hair &#x27;do that resembled a rat&#x27;s nest.  </li>
            <li> I like this dryer, but the comb is not long enough.</li>
            <li> Have not had this long but think it might actually last longer because the intake is far enough out of the way.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that is partially curly, mostly frizzy - just depends on the weather.</li>
            <li> A closer inspection of the hair dryer indicated that either the dryer was previously used or the item was previously sold, returned, and resold again without any attempt to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; the packaging.</li>
            <li> If you have slightly wavy or straight hair, the cost and complexity of this hair dryer are not necessary.</li>
            <li> However the only flaw is that as it oz advertised to straighten hair, it will not fully even on someone like me with half straight nd wavey hairs on the bottom.</li>
            <li> my hair is super process blonde hair and its wavy thick hair</li>
            <li> - I have long thick hair and this cuts dry time in half - love it!</li>
            <li> My hair is long, color treated, &amp; it takes me an hour and a half to dry and straighten it just so it looks decent normally.</li>
            <li> Just a little trouble getting the hang of it, but still ended with fabulous results.</li>
            <li> So, for now I am back to using my regular hair dryer and my large barrel round brush.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly hair and nothing has really helped straighten it except for a permanent straightener.</li>
            <li> My goal when I dry my hair is to dry it the fastest way possible and to blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get it right</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy and awkward if you are using it for more than 30 minutes, but I believe that&#x27;s not a major problem-totally worth it.    </li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for about a week now, and I have to say, aside from being a little weird to use the first few times, it does nice work.</li>
            <li> and it took less than 1/2 the time it normally does...</li>
            <li> am an African-American female with shoulder length, super thick hair that takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> The unit is not heavy as other reviews state AT ALL.</li>
            <li> looks the same as if i had used a flat iron.</li>
            <li> (Total time for me is approx 25 mins w/ hair dryer if I&#x27;m using a comb/brush + 35-45 mins w/ flat iron)</li>
            <li> Before this, no matter how I tried, I would still have to flat iron my hair before I left the house.</li>
            <li> She still uses the hot iron after using the dryer, but it is a lot less time of the extreme heat on her hair.</li>
            <li> I probably am not going slow enough or doing enough sections, but I did have to do a tiny touch up in a few areas to get it absolutely 100% perfectly straight...  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions and dry your hair a bit before you start straightening it, and work in logical small sections is key.</li>
            <li> The ends were frizzy looking, it took way too much time to do such small sections at a time</li>
            <li> I only have to touch up my hair a bit with a flat iron when I&#x27;m done, as opposed to spending 30 minutes flat</li>
            <li> It only curls short hair, and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I have pretty curly hair when it is wet, and it literally takes me 5-7 minutes to get my hair dried and straightened.</li>
            <li> all its good for is using it as a regular dryer, but for $50 I would have bought a chi hairdryer.. :(</li>
            <li> I have had one for 10 years until the little plastic piece came off that prevented the attachment from seating properly, so I bought a new one a couple years ago and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have the patience to wait for 5 minutes while it cools down, so when the first one dies half way through drying, I just use the 2nd one.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is thick and wavy and you want something to smooth it down, don&#x27;t bother with this product.</li>
            <li> At first, it takes a little longer to dry your hair, but after a couple of tries and experiments, my drying time is the same as before and don&#x27;t have the added time of using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> just a little heavy but worth it overall.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product to everyone with longer wavy hair to dry and straighte at the same time which is a time saver.</li>
            <li> I usually blow dry it first, then flat iron it.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer has saved me so much time over the past five years.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used a straightening iron to try to get straight hair like Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s, but found it to be torture on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am African-American with a mix of coarse and curly long hair.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s taken this long for a company to come up with this relatively simple attachment.   </li>
            <li> , the drying is still just a prelude to using the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown up with frizzy hair, and wished the ceramic flat iron was out in the 80/90&#x27;s, b/c</li>
            <li> I still had to pull out my ceramic flat iron to straighten it out.  </li>
            <li> like I do my ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> w/ a flat iron when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> w/ a flat iron when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I no longer need my flat iron</li>
            <li> However, you might still need to use a flat iron to touch up some spots.</li>
            <li> I still have to use my flat iron after I use the dryer.</li>
            <li> but then I still have to style using my ceramic plated flat iron.</li>
            <li> but it dries your hair sleek and flat.</li>
            <li> I have used the flat iron just for touch ups.</li>
            <li> my co-worker overheard me and told me it made her hair flat.  </li>
            <li> and I am worrying about how long the straightening attachment will last.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use a flat iron if I don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> If I use a straightening iron, it&#x27;s TOO flat, looks unnatural.</li>
            <li> I still had to flat iron my hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, wavy/curly in back</li>
            <li> shine my hair the way a flat iron does</li>
            <li> Besides that, you still do not get that sleek look with out running a flat iron through your hair.</li>
            <li> So, although it doesn&#x27;t replace the sleekness of a flat iron, I no longer &#x27;have&#x27; to use it.    </li>
            <li> I did a test and my hair looked the exact same when I turned my head upside down and blew it dry in less than five minutes</li>
            <li> The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is that I still have a hard time getting my root perfectly straight with it...</li>
            <li> When I try to use my other dryer with various attachments, and it is such a hassel, since my hair is short now.    </li>
            <li> I tried all the new hair straightening / smoothing gadgets : straightening irons, ionic hairdryers, hairbrush dryers (shaped like a round brush).  </li>
            <li> I have very long coarse wavy hair</li>
            <li> But overall, it is a must have if you blow dry your hair using a brush.</li>
            <li> When I tried the traditional method, my hair often looked frizzy and damaged compared to letting it air dry.  </li>
            <li> It allows you to straighten and dry your hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> only thing that this drier does well is dry your hair.</li>
            <li> i had no problem with the dryer exept i got over exited and was trying to dry pieces of hair that were too big.</li>
            <li> It cuts drying time in half and leaves your hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Make sure, if you get it, that you do the cold shot with the diffuser on low to set the style and control the frizz.  </li>
            <li> &quot;  moderately priced salon blow dry.  </li>
            <li> She can style and blow dry her hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li> If I blow dry with a regular dryer, I still have a lot of volume and frizzy</li>
            <li> Gets my hair a lot straighter and less frizzier than my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My earlier Conair hair dryer made my hair so dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy, thick hair that tends to frizz and get big by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> only complaint with this dryer is that it only has two settings, high and low, and once your hair starts to get closer to dry</li>
            <li> I dislike the fact that I have to keep stopping to readjust the comb attachment as I move to different sections of my head, but at least the comb stays on a lot better than past hair dryer attachments I have used on other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> The attachment can be placed at any angle around the dryer, so it&#x27;s not really that hard to figure out which way to place it to get it at the right angle for whichever part of your hair your working on.  </li>
            <li> If you are African American or multiracial, it will straighten your hair if used correctly, but certainly not on par with getting it flat-ironed or pressed at a salon.  </li>
            <li> never had a single problem with it for five years, and now the attachment has finally fallen off and is unfixable.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use so much product and then blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> i have verrry thick/curly hair that takes me about 40 mins to dry with a normal hair dryer and round brush.</li>
            <li> i still have to use a flat iron, but the hair dryer does a lot of the work for me!!  </li>
            <li> it would be a quick and easy way to straighten my hair, but was a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little surprised quite frankly.  </li>
            <li> -- i.e., let go -- but you can curl your hand around the brush-end of the dryer to hold the ends flat as they dry.</li>
            <li> Even though the head pivots, the L shape makes it hard to do flips or pull it out straight.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair and am always looking for ways to tame it as quickly and effectively as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy/curly hair, it took me about 45 min the first time i used it, but i think that now i have the hang of it, so i&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t take as long the next time.</li>
            <li> I am African-Canadian, my hair can be a little tough at times;  it doesn&#x27;t comb through my hair as easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect - I&#x27;m keeping my flat iron, but will sure use it a lot less.  </li>
            <li> Trust a flat iron instead!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have no idea how anyone could give this dryer a bad review.  </li>
            <li> It is awkward to use, although I hope to become more proficient at it.</li>
            <li> My usual routine consist of shower, then Tresemme Heat Tamer Spray, Blow drying with this dryer, then straightening with my Remington Wet 2 Straight.</li>
            <li> so I can get long two-strand twists.</li>
            <li> My hair is really long</li>
            <li> and I used only minimal product.</li>
            <li> , however I felt that it took too long</li>
            <li> and you know you&#x27;ll never use anything else again as long as you have a choice?</li>
            <li> So you must be careful and switch to low</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using an old Conair air brush which they don&#x27;t make anymore, so this seems heavy and bulky in comparison.</li>
            <li> Definately must have long hair to get any benefit from it.</li>
            <li> Without something like that, your hair will not stay unfrizzed for long.</li>
            <li> I have long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair (very curly in some parts)</li>
            <li> I have long, thick curly hair and have real problems straightening it.  </li>
            <li> For anyone who said it was crap...they just did not know how to use it or expected it not to burn their hair if they left it on one spot for too long...</li>
            <li> The directions are not clear or helpful.  </li>
            <li> Works really well on my hair, which is wavy and thick.</li>
            <li> have medium-long, thick, course, frizzy, kinda curly hair that turns into a large puffball of frizz, curls, &amp; waves if I just let it air dry</li>
            <li> I simply could not live without this product!!</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair at night so it can dry naturally because I have no coordination when it comes to a hairdryer and a hair brush at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The tension allows for my hair to be straightened prior to using a flat iron which in turn cuts my flat ironing time in half.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all for me, but I think if a person only had wavy hair, or only slight curls</li>
            <li> I mean how could it really make a difference?)</li>
            <li> Problem with those are they just don&#x27;t last long before it has pulled in enough hair to mess up something.</li>
            <li> My one concern is if it would dry my hair, on a long term use.</li>
            <li> ... it doesn&#x27;t take as long to dry.  </li>
            <li> When the instructions are followed (wash, condition, detangle, section, heat protection product, low dry, high dry, cold shot) yes it does cut down on A LOT of time and each step is worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This was definitely money well spent!</li>
            <li> My hair was also relatively shiny compared to other methods/appliances I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, extremely curly, frizzy, coarse, out of control hair.</li>
            <li> The only other place I have seen it</li>
            <li> I was in disbelief at how quickly it dried my hair and how straight my hair was in so little time.  </li>
            <li> The attachments can also be rotated with the press of handy little push buttons on the side so that you can rotate the attachment and not your hand in some awkward position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would give this a 5 if there was a medium setting, but other than that, I could not imagine using a different hair dryer when I have to do my hair on my on</li>
            <li> i was skeptical of buying this product because i have bought sooo many hair products in the past that have not done what they claim to do, but this one definitely works!</li>
            <li> Since the comb on the combo head is only on one side you&#x27;ll have to rotate the head on the dryer when you dry the other side of your head.  </li>
            <li> My hair is VERY long and curly.</li>
            <li> I blow dry, straighten, then curl under the ends.</li>
            <li> The frizz really is reduced, and the cold air shot technique really does help your hair keep its style.</li>
            <li> When my hair is about 90% dry</li>
            <li> I also use SunSilk Hydra TLC before I blow dry</li>
            <li> and when I painstakingly used the comb attachment and blew it dry in sections for an hour.</li>
            <li> Then take them out and dry the rest of your hair with this dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair always felt sticky, and dry on the ends.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for an easier way to blow dry try this, but if you&#x27;re expecting to skip the straightening step</li>
            <li> to dry it.  </li>
            <li> I even used this to dry me hair weave</li>
            <li> Maybe it would actually dry my hair in waves rather than frizz.</li>
            <li> and it takes all day to get your hair dry.  </li>
            <li> my hand to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am the dry, straighten &amp; curl girl.....</li>
            <li> You also will need to blow dry your roots with the concentrator as with the straightening detachment, your roots will not be dry at all.</li>
            <li> This dryer speeds my dry time and straightens without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I DRY MY HAIR BY SECTIONS</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with just enough natural wave to make me look like a lion if I just dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy/curly (it&#x27;s getting curlier as I get older, too).  </li>
            <li> once on the high setting SLOWLY.  </li>
            <li> And since hair dryers usually leave my hair dry, and brittle, I had stopped using them all together, and letting my hair air dry, naturally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a working single mother with no time to wash her hair, nor the money pay someone else to do it.  </li>
            <li> If you have shoulder-length or longer hair, it&#x27;s easiest to put your hair in two ponytails (one behind each ear) and dry the ponytails first using this dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair does not easily straighten, but is not the most difficult.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick African American, natural hair.  </li>
            <li> It cut my drying time in half, and my hair looks 10 times better than it ever did with my feeble attempts with a round brush and regular dryer.  </li>
            <li> and in print ads must have thin, thin, naturally straight hair to go from wet to super</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other blow dryer/comb attachments, and in every case the attachment has snagged my hair and caused split ends, or it frequent separated from the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and could never get my hair straight and sleek with a regular dryer and round brush.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I find it difficult with bangs;  otherwise, I am extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I went cruising down a Big Lots aisle and saw it for 18 dollars and said what the heck.</li>
            <li> It cuts down my overall time for doing my hair, but not the amount of gadgets needed.</li>
            <li> to straighten it and then use a flat iron essentially all over and on several layers as it is so thick.</li>
            <li> I would want to dry my hair with anything else!  </li>
            <li> But with this tool, I can section my hair in pieces and blow dry, straighten and shine all in 15 minutes!</li>
            <li> Not only did this product cut my drying time in half, but it does straighten it.</li>
            <li> I recommend starting at one tension less</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly (frizzy, mediterranean) hair which I straighten, but which nonetheless frizzes if not properly dried.  </li>
            <li> I am a black female with natural&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I pull my hair back a lot, so I get these perminant kinks in my hair from the elastic fold in the \\&quot;half pulled out pony</li>
            <li> Hair was frizzy &amp; tangled,took FOREVER to dry &amp; was NOT STRAIGHT.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, curly, black &amp; Asian Hair!!!</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s really no way to open this without doing even a little minor damage to the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I dry my hair just a little with the regular attachment and then finish up with the straightener attachment.</li>
            <li> Bought the dryer because it was on sale for $34...had read a bunch of positive reviews-it&#x27;s unbelievable how a little hair tool can change your life!</li>
            <li> You really should have about shoulder-length hair at least!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, other than that minor inconvenience (having to use two dryers), the 1875 Watt Styler Dryer has been a godsend for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with a big poufy mess.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because if you&#x27;re not super careful, hair can get caught/break around some of the dials.  </li>
            <li> I usually flip my head upside down, use the regular attachment (just like a regular hair dryer) and dry it till its almost dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever use my flat iron or other hair dryers again!</li>
            <li> I still have to use either a flat iron or a curling iron to style with, where the other on did it all in one step!  </li>
            <li> my regular 1875 watt dryer - flat ironing is usually optional when I use these.</li>
            <li> It did straighten it a little, but not enough to where I was wowed.</li>
            <li> I have very curly,frizzy very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have other hand held dryers that have comb attachments that always break or pop off while I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have the hair that frizzes in the damp weather, and the previously used products, flat irons, curling irons, etc</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it any heavier than my regular dryer and it cut my drying time down by 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> I can straighten my long hair within 15 mins!!!</li>
            <li> It was awkward to hold and use and did not make my hair smooth at all.</li>
            <li> The result is not perfect straight hair, but at least the frizz is gone and it my hair is almost straight.</li>
            <li> I can say to anyone who wants to try it, is don&#x27;t look at the few negative comments (OUT OF 36 COMMENTS</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend it for anyone who has even the least bit curly hair because it is such a time saver!</li>
            <li> The head is built at a difficult angle to use, no matter what position I tried it in, and it&#x27;s a real pain to have to press in buttons and turn the head every time you come into the hair from a different angle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold thick hair at all well as the teeth are simply too far apart and too few for this hair type.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is I wish it had a round brush attachment to do the ends and put some big curls/body back in.</li>
            <li> I spent two weeks debating on whether or not I should get this item.</li>
            <li> only con, is that the dryer is really heavy</li>
            <li> I suffered with this all my life and finally, a few years ago, started to get the Japanese Straightening done every four months.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> You have to hold the ends of your hair as you run the dryer through it, which means that once the dryer gets to the ends and you have to let go, no time has been spent straightening the ends.</li>
            <li> I did follow every step described in the instructions, but even did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t too heavy that you need to rest in between, and it&#x27;s quite maneuverable since your hair will never get sucked into the back of the dryer.</li>
            <li> not really what I am going for.</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair similar shine and silkiness, but without the limp and lifeless feel of the straightening iron.  </li>
            <li> I guarantee I am not capable of doing everything this styler can do</li>
            <li> I tried again over the next few days</li>
            <li> I never got the hang of using a round brush because I&#x27;m just not coordinated enough.    </li>
            <li> Not much luck with that.</li>
            <li> The secret is really the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> The shrink wrap; that covered the hair dryer box, was torn and the flap closures on the box were partially opened.</li>
            <li> My daughter lost the attachment while I was away doing military training.</li>
            <li> I have bra length thick, course, wavy hair which is now graying (wirey) making it even more difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair with some natural curl.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/unruly, naturally curly,  thick hair.</li>
            <li> The only flaw is y hair is little fuzzy after using it,I guess I have to use some leave-on conditioner or some other hair product with it.</li>
            <li> Usually it would take me an hour or so to blow dry my entire head</li>
            <li> you have little control over each section as opposed to a flat iron (picture stray hairs flying everywhere from the wind tunnel effect).  </li>
            <li> Looked for something different at every single store I knew carried hair dryers but couldn&#x27;t find one with a brush attachment and that is what usually works for me.</li>
            <li> On average it would take me about 45-55 minutes to blow dry my hair than about an hour- an hour-15 to straighten it.</li>
            <li> It dries my medium long hair in less that 5 minutes &amp; the brush helps to straighten.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to use the first couple of times and it pulled out a few hairs.  </li>
            <li> Then when finished, spray a glossing spray on your dry hair and rub it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost down to my waist, and it used to take forever to dry and style it.   </li>
            <li> I just flip my hair upside down and dry section by section.</li>
            <li> It reduces my time to blow dry my hair into half.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people that doesn&#x27;t like to blow dry with a brush in sections, so I wanted to find something that would allow me to use my straightening iron less.  </li>
            <li> It took me less than 10 minutes to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair that comes down to the bottom of my shoulder blades with some natural body to it.  </li>
            <li> After showering, towel dry hair, and put the silk drops on your ends (don&#x27;t use too much---this will take a few tries).</li>
            <li> Not good for natural hair.</li>
            <li> It also does not trip my circuit breaker like my other one.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of the other attachment.</li>
            <li> My hair was softer though than using my other dryer.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that its not as noisy as other blow dryers, I can use it in my bedroom when my baby is sleeping and</li>
            <li> It was weird to use at first, but once you finish a section, you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> I watched the DVD several times, but I&#x27;m still not able to get it to do what it shows in the DVD.  </li>
            <li> Drys your hair alot quicker than other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> (I agree  with the other reviewers, the attachment doesnt seem to \\&quot;grip\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I would like know if this product is bivolt, like 110V - 240V. Because i need use in Brazil where the voltage is 110V in some states and 220V in other states?</li>
            <li> I saved time in my morning routine, I&#x27;ll save space when I get rid of all the other products that I no longer need, and I am also saving my hair...</li>
            <li> BUT my hair is extremely wavy/curly/frizzy/damaged.  </li>
            <li> Blowdryers, brushes etc, but the Conair 208 Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer is a true disappointment .</li>
            <li> The Conair Infiniti 208 does straighten out your hair, but you&#x27;ll probably need some other tool to finish it off (IE: a straightening iron, etc).</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Hair must be held in one hand while the other works the dryer.  </li>
            <li> The cord is long but somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that this product would not have the support for 220V/240V sockets (like their other products do).</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and they all claimed what I claim now . .</li>
            <li> have not used it to curl or do other manipulations with my hair, so I cannot comment on the ease of use for those purposes.  </li>
            <li> It blow dryers at a lower heat/strength than other blow dryers ive tried but</li>
            <li> I have already used it on 3 other types of hair &amp; everyone</li>
            <li> I was due for a hair wash when this dryer arrived to my house yesterday.</li>
            <li> After I bought it, I went home, took a shower, and let my hair dry a little.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little bit longer to dry my hair with this.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, but once I got used to it, I can use nothing else to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I should not trust the reviews or if I am just not very lucky.</li>
            <li> This model is extremely difficult to use and for those who live in humid areas, prepare to get your flat iron heated up.  </li>
            <li> So if you are thinking about trying it but maybe returning it if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, be very careful.  </li>
            <li> I do NOT have the coordination to blow dry my hair with a round brush.</li>
            <li> The time spent on my hair is much less because this dries and straightens your hair all in one step.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it is a little awkward at first.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works fast, and I can usually have my hair dried in about 15 mins if I am not doing complex styling.</li>
            <li> when usually it takes us 1.5 to 2 hours with the flat iron and without any breakage.</li>
            <li> (I even did it wrong the first half of the drying process).  </li>
            <li> If you tried other dryers in that class they are at least double the weight.</li>
            <li> Heavy, awkward, not user friendly by any means.  </li>
            <li> and I can never get it out with conventional dryers using the brush method.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to use, but practice time is well spent.</li>
            <li> A little heavier than expected.   </li>
            <li> I am using less product and haven&#x27;t used any of my other hair equipment since I got this, because I haven&#x27;t needed it.</li>
            <li> Also makes my hair much less frizzy than other blow dryers.</li>
            <li> The straightening attachment at the end rotates which enables to change the angle/position of the dryer while still getting the maximum effect when you have to do the hard to reach areas like the back of your head.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because of my concern with the close hair-to-dryer contact and over-drying.  </li>
            <li> Not strong enough to dry thick hair well.</li>
            <li> I can see if you had short hair it would be hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint:</li>
            <li> Last year my blowdryer broke around december (after heavily using it for the past 2 years)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s takes me an average 2-3 hrs to do her hair.  </li>
            <li> If you do all of that, I really don&#x27;t see how you can go wrong.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t kept the product past the 30 day return period it would be LONG GONE from my home.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair that is not curly and not straight.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair which gets dyed and sunbleached throughout the year.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s coarse, coily and thick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I sat down and watched the DVD and realized my mistake.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use a brush with the dryer and hold the hair down over the ionic rollers.  </li>
            <li> there are some down sides, I&#x27;ve used it quite a bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been let down by every styling device before.  </li>
            <li> but this thing cuts it down to 30-40 minutes of drying.</li>
            <li> Her hair is past her shoulders and it takes 1.5 hours to dry and straighten it after she washes it.  </li>
            <li> The drying time, from towel dry, took me about 7 or 8 minutes when it usually takes me about 15 to 20.      </li>
            <li> It called for dividing the hair into small sections to dry.</li>
            <li> (My hair is extremely curley, frizzy, long, and thick)</li>
            <li> Trying to blow dry my very thick, long, wavy hair was time consuming and hard on my wrists as I managed a regular brush or a curling brush along with my dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit awkward to use at first, but no more so than trying to use a round brush on the back of my head!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut down my drying time in half since I got this dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to be portable, it&#x27;s durable, and it works crazy fast.</li>
            <li> I did find it a bit awkward at first to use, so it takes a few tries to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> ( I HAVE THICK HAIR) AND THEN USE A FLAT IRON TO FINISH.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy, wiry hair that takes a long time to dry and usually frizzes out when I dry it.  </li>
            <li> Cons - it&#x27;s a little heavier than other dryers, and the straightening attachment is awkward at first.  </li>
            <li> it cuts my drying time in half.  </li>
            <li> Used to take an hour, this dryer did it in half an hour.</li>
            <li> It also comes out straighter with less work than using a brush.  </li>
            <li> When using this product, I was done in less than 45 mins.  </li>
            <li> less heat styling&#x3D; less damage.</li>
            <li> IT HELPED ME STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR IN LESS TIME THAN A CERAMIC STICK.</li>
            <li> and it took a lot less time and aggravation.  </li>
            <li> it took me less than 20 mins when i used this.</li>
            <li> It has cut my styling time in less than half</li>
            <li> I am a Black woman and I bought this thinking</li>
            <li> The ends are not a problem (see previous review).  </li>
            <li> I love the silkiness that my straightening iron gives my hair, but i hate the way it makes it feel limp and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> Let tell you it cut the \\&quot;process\\&quot; time in half.  </li>
            <li> heavier than my previous hairdryer</li>
            <li> Salon results at home in less time  </li>
            <li> AND IT TAKES HALF OF THE TIME TO DO IT THAT WAY.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, &amp;#34;WoW!&amp;#34;  Usually, it takes forever to dry my long, thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> She has thick, thick, auburn hair that has a lot of natural curl and body.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated struggling with round brush and blow dryer only to end up with moderatly straight but still poufy hair, and I&#x27;m just too lazy and don&#x27;t care enough to bother with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different hair dryers (I have thin, curly hair) and some work well, but this one was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The unit is awkward to use at first, but i&#x27;m getting the hand of it.</li>
            <li> While I enjoy the benefits of having a diffuser-type of blow dryer, I was disappointed in the ease of operation of the straightening/anti-frizz attachment.  </li>
            <li> It works just as well as a hairdryer and round brush so its not worth getting.  </li>
            <li> it can be a matted mess.</li>
            <li> It is expensive since it will only last a few years</li>
            <li> It is a bit awkward at first but all you need is this, no brush.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly/wavey</li>
            <li> I have medium length wirey gray hair that is prone to frizz with moisture;  If I  section my hair as per the instruction guide and use long, slow strokes while holding the ends of my hair, it performs as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It used to take my wife 1.5 hours to do her hair (thick, dense and long).</li>
            <li> You hold out a section of hair with one hand, and run the dryer down it from root to tip (repeat a few times).</li>
            <li> The straightening attachment has four settings for how tight it grabs your hair.  </li>
            <li> While a bit awkward to use at first, this dryer literally cut my drying time in half, and allowed me to leave the house without curling my choppy layers.</li>
            <li> I admit that it is a little awkward at first; it does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Hold the section of hair you want to dry, and slowly comb through the section with the dryer.</li>
            <li> and if you go slow enough (I&#x27;m impatient!)</li>
            <li> unit itself can feel a little awkward and a little bulky at first, but you&#x27;ll get used to it after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> If you have tried other multi-step hair systems in the past or have thought of it, I encourage you to give this product a chance.</li>
            <li> Cut my styling time in half-takes a little coordination to use</li>
            <li> It still takes a little while with this \\&quot;Conair Infiniti Hair</li>
            <li> I have owned several blow dryers in the past and the comb attachments would always break after a few uses because my hair is so thick.  </li>
            <li> Well, I bought the blow dryer at sears a couple days ago even though I was still a little skeptic after reading the reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li> My hair type is 4c with a little 4d, so those of you 4c/4d ladies know what I am talking</li>
            <li> recommend taking the time to watch the DVD and read the little manual before you start.  </li>
            <li> The little plastic clips that holds the straightener to the dryer keeps breaking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve to admit that it took a little while to get used to the straightner positions and tension settings.</li>
            <li> I still had to go over it with the straightener for 1 minute to get a little friz out</li>
            <li> I mean just look at the strange design!  </li>
            <li> Was not even inside the original box, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Holding it is a little award because of its design.</li>
            <li> (only a flat-iron will do that for my thick hair!).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but found it very hard to use to straighten my hair which is what I wanted it for.  </li>
            <li> the dryer was hard to use and I still needed to use flat iron, but my hair dried a lot faster than usual.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, mostly straight, *very* limp hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little heavy &amp; akward</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy &amp; akward (esp.</li>
            <li> It looked a little hokey or gimmicky, but I was out of options.</li>
            <li> All hair types are different but for my hair which is very thick it</li>
            <li> My hair is also VERY THICK AND COARSE.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> Only takes about 10-15 minutes this way (and I have VERY thick curly hair).     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, but it only takes me about 10 mins from towel drying to done.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on straightening aids and products that just don&#x27;t work, so I decided I would wait a little while to buy this dryer to see what others thought of it.  </li>
            <li> For reference, I am African-American/Multiracial and have 4b hair, which is very fragile, thick, frizzy hair with a hard to define spiral curl pattern (think Erykah Badu).    </li>
            <li> but I am sorry I spent the extra bucks for this one.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve got so much fewer flyaways and crazy hairs sticking up over my head.</li>
            <li> I also found it to be very cumbersome and awkward to use.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that would help you finish your style faster, this is the product for you, but bury in mind that the results would be disappointing unless you have naturally straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Got this a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> The comb attachment stayed firmly in place, and I did not feel as if my hair were being snagged.  </li>
            <li> This will even further reduce unnecessary poof while keeping the volume intact.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that does not behave unless it is blow dried.</li>
            <li> bought this dryer because I am swimming everyday at my gym, and didn&#x27;t want to have to get braids or extensions</li>
            <li> In fact, if you are already using a round brush to take the frizz out of your hair I would recommend that you stick to that method.  </li>
            <li> It took a few times to get used to how to hold the dryer and where to position the head.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it is really, really heavy.   </li>
            <li> The attachement piece is supposed to grip hair firmly</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and carpal tunnel in both hands and used to stop drying my hair  after just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I got out of shower and towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t find it to be heavy, nor has the attachment ever fallen off, as others have said.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical, and had plans on returning it if it didn&#x27;t work (why waste $60 if it doesn&#x27;t work).  </li>
            <li> waste your money or get your hopes up with this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do my hair everyday because it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> If i had the time i would use the conair everyday.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it wasn&#x27;t so heavy.  </li>
            <li> I could never do that round brush thing they do at the salon.</li>
            <li> The few times Ive tried to use it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I used to blow out my hair with a round brush and dryer every morning</li>
            <li> My mom had a similar hair dryer that had broken, so I purchased this for her as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I have had one for a few years  and have been looking to find another,  </li>
            <li> My wife was not happy when she received it open.</li>
            <li> A hair dryer with a round comb will do the work safer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, just buy a $20 blow dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Finding something that keeps working longer than a few years is a miracle.</li>
            <li> I did find that the hair dryer is on the heavy side, but the results are as described.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Its been dropped 1,000 of times (I&#x27;m clumsy and besides if this thing would break i&#x27;d feel less guilty about trying to buy a new one).</li>
            <li> I must have read all the reviews on amazon and other websites at least twice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the flat iron may be an unnecessary step.    </li>
            <li> Not easy to use</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that doing the back of your head is a little awkward.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little past my shoulders now</li>
            <li> I have long, very thick hair with spiraly waves.  </li>
            <li> It used to take me over an hour to straighten my very thick, curly, long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not type of girl that spends a lot of time on my hair and makeup, so previously I would just towel dry, comb out, and let my hair air dry (unless it was really cold out then I would use a dryer).  </li>
            <li> I have thin, long wavy-curly hair</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer right after Christmas this year and I have yet to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> this blower was impossible to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> and I typically end up blowdrying and using a flatiron at least 5 days a week.  </li>
            <li> This dryer makes drying my thick 4c hair less of a chore.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a thermal protector when using this, as your hair is awfully close to the dryer and it gets much hotter than my old one.</li>
            <li> It takes just a little time to get used to working it, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s a breeze!  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, definitely not a good straightener.</li>
            <li> one little negative - the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a curls and my hair is very delicate when wet.</li>
            <li> Too hard to handle, heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve ever been frustrated with hair kinks, waves, unruly curls-and too much bathroom</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this as usually my hair comes out frizzy</li>
            <li> I was NEVER able to blow it out straight...horrible results.</li>
            <li> The dryer itself still works but there are two small plastic hooks inside the rim of the dryer which hold the attachment on and one of those broke rendering the attachment unusable.</li>
            <li> I used this on damp hair in small sections (about 14).  </li>
            <li> Usually drying my hair takes upwards of 45 minutes</li>
            <li> about 7mins-(my hair is past shoulder length)</li>
            <li> I tried straightening a small strand of my hair for about 3 minutes</li>
            <li> If it dries naturally, well everyone with curly hair knows what happens, crazy hair.</li>
            <li> when I saw an ad for this, I had hopes that maybe this would be some sort of miracle product that would eliminate the need for a round brush forever!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for my birthday this past November.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it is difficult to use on the ends of my hair, and I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of doing my bangs like it shows in the book.  </li>
            <li> This dryer lets me complete the job and not cause my hands to get numb.</li>
            <li> If the length of your hair is medium or short, this blow dryer is useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the only way to get the blow dryer out of its packaging is by breaking the plastic casing.</li>
            <li> I usually just leave it curly</li>
            <li> I have never written an online review before, but I was so disgusted by this product I would love to save someone else the headache.</li>
            <li> The barrel is too short, and it&#x27;s difficult to pull your hair through the comb attachment and hold it there -</li>
            <li> I usually end up drying it and then using a straightener.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it cannot be used with only one hand.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if you could soak the attachment since it has the \\&quot;flocked discs\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Oh, by the way, my hair is past shoulder length, and layered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loves it and uses it everyday!  </li>
            <li> No more lion, no more fuzz.</li>
            <li> No static of frizz    </li>
            <li> The blow dryer is very heavy and if you have thick or long hair, your arms will get tired before you are done.</li>
            <li> Not good for black hair</li>
            <li> (hair length varying from just above the shoulders to a few inches past) and it fatigues the arm a bit with the weight shape and sometimes required awkward positioning.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it is flat and wings out in weird ways.  </li>
            <li> My hair did frizz after drying, but seemed to not frizz as badly as when drying it normally.  </li>
            <li> I have the worst time blow drying my hair, and because of that it never straightens with a flat iron very well.</li>
            <li> The dryer is heavy to me because I had wrist surgery on my predominant hand so that was not a good thing for me.  </li>
            <li> At first i was skeptical of whether or not it was going to be awkward to hold and use</li>
            <li> It works, and wasn&#x27;t that hard to use.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard at all</li>
            <li> so it is hard to hold and manipulate the ends.</li>
            <li> know it is hard to believe that something does what it claims to.  </li>
            <li> The brush is hard so bristles don&#x27;t bend or soften with the use of time and heat.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a horse&#x27;s mane in texture, and is hard to style.</li>
            <li> Bit hard to use the comb thru attachment, though.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely hard to manage hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried cleaning them but they are hard to get in between them.  </li>
            <li> this dryer does not leave my hair brittle or dull.</li>
            <li> I would pay @ least $100 for it-can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and if you want to add some curl to the ends, it&#x27;s not terribly effective.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s an entirely different story  when the product is dangerous to use. &#x3D;0</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;flocked discs\\&quot; are starting to look worn and the ceramic plates look dirty, probably from my hair products.  </li>
            <li> but it wouldn&#x27;t let me write anything without at least one star.</li>
            <li> None of the descriptions or reviews mentioned that it is designed for at least medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> This model is such a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I found something for my thick hair that works with detangling.</li>
            <li> I have mid-back length hair, thick, and curly.      </li>
            <li> and I sectioned my hair (a must!) and started slow.  </li>
            <li> and I went slow.  </li>
            <li> (it is soooo thick) but drying &amp; straightening my hair with this dryer took about 25 min.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly, and in a bob.</li>
            <li> Use the Remington T3 Tourmaline flatiron on 410 degrees (don&#x27;t pull it through too slowly</li>
            <li> It does now go through thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, frizzy, curly, Dominican hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair that is somewhere between wavy and curly.</li>
            <li> I had just about given up on finding the hair dryer and styler that could handle my thick unruly frizzy hair...</li>
            <li> I have thick, color treated hair which tends to frizz, and after using this dryer just once, I noticed my hair broke off.  </li>
            <li> and I have really thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The edges are thick and rounded so it isn&#x27;t like a comb in the sense of you having to worry about it snagging your hair.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length thick hair which still has 3-4 inches of perm on the ends</li>
            <li> Have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> have longer than shoulder length wavy course thick hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my thick haired friends needed something stronger.</li>
            <li> POINTLESS AND HARD TO USE!</li>
            <li> I usually just have to go to a salon to get the job done (and it takes them about an hour!).  </li>
            <li> I would use a round brush (SO CUMBERSOME!!)</li>
            <li> Women with curly hair will understand what I mean.</li>
            <li> (I have long thick curly crazy hair) and can&#x27;t justify it when this one works so well.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair which I have chemically straightened in the past (just to make it manageable) but cannot do so any longer AND color it as it just dries it out.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, because my hair is so difficult to manage, not wavy, not curly, just a thick, giant frizzball..</li>
            <li> It also cut my blow drying time in half!!!</li>
            <li> I always just let my hair dry naturally before, and then straightened it with my straightener, because I hated how time-consuming and awkward blow-drying with a round brush was.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, very thick.</li>
            <li> but it is not a good hair straightner.</li>
            <li> (my hair is very thick) and the end result was not nearly as good as the results I get with the Styler Dryer.   </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m willing to bet if you hair isn&#x27;t real bad curly/frizzy</li>
            <li> (For anyone who finds the hairdryer clumsy to handle, try turning the comb - it helps!)  </li>
            <li> They all left me disappointed.  </li>
            <li> As disappointed as I am, I gave three stars since the actual dryer itself is not the issue</li>
            <li> this is  literally a cure for any woman that has thick frizzy unmanageable hair!</li>
            <li> It is very awkward to use the hair straightner..too big and perhaps requires a lot of practice..</li>
            <li> yes it says the attachment swivels around, but you have to actually stop, then unclip it and reposition it, very awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> I am very clumsy w/styling tools.</li>
            <li> have very thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course wavy hair.</li>
            <li> have very thick \\&quot;combination\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My hair is also very thick.</li>
            <li> and it is very thick.</li>
            <li> I mean this thing WONT break!</li>
            <li> The straightening attachment was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> Hard to maneuver, difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> The unit isn&#x27;t heavy or awkward to handle, and there&#x27;s no worry of burning my ears or neck like I might with a flatiron.  </li>
            <li> The only part that is slightly annoying is that the cord gets all tangled up...</li>
            <li> I have thin, curly hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m quite retarded with a regular hairdryer and brush, and i was a bit worried that i would be with this one too...</li>
            <li> I feel sorry for those who gave it negative reviews because you seem to lack the skill or patience for using styling tools.</li>
            <li> and my arms aren&#x27;t tired when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also heavy to use at those awkward angles.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin but frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Either way I am not happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought countless expensive blow-dryers that are supposed to be \\&quot;the best\\&quot; and have been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I found this dryer to be so heavy and bulky that it was very difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> the whole using my hair straightening iron at the end isn&#x27;t that bad, sometimes annoying, but I got used to it.  </li>
            <li> , it was awkward, heavy and expensive.</li>
            <li> However, as winter approaches, and a wet head equals a very cold body, I thought I&#x27;d give the Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer a try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward and hard to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy thick even when relaxed.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t support 220v and hence not ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> I is a very heavy dryer, the straightening attachment is crap, it would take 2 hours using this even if your hair is thin..</li>
            <li> They are expensive (around $100)</li>
            <li> you can not go wrong</li>
            <li> so I give this a 1 star becuase its useless as what your paying the product for..</li>
            <li> I saw this hairdryer at TJMaxx and purchased it and went home to look at the reviews before I even opened the packaging (beware the packaging is horrible, you will never get the dryer back in like it was!!).  </li>
            <li> (Some people say it was difficult for them.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> This type of attachment was just too difficult and ineffective for me to use.</li>
            <li> would also add that all of this ceramic technology (of which I was skeptical,</li>
            <li> alothough, i thought it was rather expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to handle and doesn&#x27;t grip my hair.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I threw the box out otherwise</li>
            <li> A bit expensive</li>
            <li> I am returning this as it is incredibly difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> so I asked for it as a gift, but I was still skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the random crinkly waves of hair underneath</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who has difficult hair and can&#x27;t afford weekly blow-drys.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I rated this a 3 star because it is difficult to style with...</li>
            <li> Difficult to control hair while drying, which gives us curly-tops unwanted volume.  </li>
            <li> So, I can&#x27;t remove all the stars since it might just be too difficult for me -</li>
            <li> When I opened the Amazon box, I immediately noticed that something was wrong.</li>
            <li> My hands used to get very tired having the dryer in one hand and brush in another.</li>
            <li> So thank goodness cause I was going crazy trying to learn to work a hairdryer and a brush.</li>
            <li> I was to the point where I was considering cutting it all off.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would just be another disappointment</li>
            <li> It was extremely awkward.</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer as a gift, and was very skeptical after reading some of these reviews but, let me tell you...</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because I&#x27;m all thumbs when it comes to my hair, &amp; I wasn&#x27;t blessed to be one of those wash and go types.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer and was very skeptical it would work.</li>
            <li> but it is very expensive (</li>
            <li> They say to try to use it under your hair so you can get it to turn under, but that is very difficult to do.  </li>

            <li> Just what my hair needed! I am a African-American woman with not so course or kinky hair but definitely unruly since I don&#x27;t use chemical relaxers any more. This dryer is a miracle worker for my type of hair; drys quickly and straightens for a very nice look. Humidity and wind recks my hair but at the end of the day this tool restores it to its somewhat natural beauty.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hairdryer. I do NOT have the coordination to blow dry my hair with a round brush. This was a great find for a person who doesn&#x27;t like to waste a lot of time getting ready. The unit is awkward to use at first, but i&#x27;m getting the hand of it. Conair took the old stick-style Hair Designer and made it better. This one is more powerful and dries hair more quickly. Highly reccommend this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this product. I&#x27;m an African-American with natural hair (no perm or texturizer). I was looking for an easy way to dry my hair without it getting really tight. This dryer provided just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I de-tangle my hair first with a wide tooth comb and section it (this is important!). Then I use this dryer to blow dry my hair straight so I can get long two-strand twists. It&#x27;s much better than holding a dryer in one hand and a brush in the other. If you&#x27;re African-American with natural hair, this dryer will work IF you de-tangle your hair first. Hold the section of hair you want to dry, and slowly comb through the section with the dryer.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Works really well on my hair, which is wavy and thick. It reduces my time to blow dry my hair into half. I now take just 10 - 15 minutes to do my hair. My one concern is if it would dry my hair, on a long term use. So i massage oil into my hair on weekends and leave it on for an hour and then shampoo it(before blow drying it). The result - my hair feels silky and soft. I would definitely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> am African American with natural hair that presses very easily. I saw this blow dryer at TJ Maxx for 40 dollars. and thought it would be a pretty good buy. But I refused to spend 40 dollars for a blow dryer. I personally have never seen the commercial so I knew nothing about it. I kept seeing it different places, and it was always on sale. but never less then 30 dollars. I went cruising down a Big Lots aisle and saw it for 18 dollars and said what the heck. I have nothing to lose. I have the worst time blow drying my hair, and because of that it never straightens with a flat iron very well. My hair has to be blow dried to feel healthy. For some reason with out the blow out, it sheds and breaks very easily. I looked at the video and tried it out and was blow away, it felt as if I had gone to the hair dresser. My hair was healthy feeling and with little breakage and shedding, unlike when I had tried to do it before with a brush and blow dryer. I cannot say it got my hair as straight as with a flat iron, but honestly I didn&#x27;t think it would. I was was looking for a good blow out. This delivered and am so happy. I personally did not find it bulky, and I thought it was easier to use then the brush/blow dryer combo. It was fast, easy and well the worth it. I went to bed bath and beyond for 14.99 and got another one the next day, just in case this one breaks. I do not know why they have discontinued this product, maybe because people said it was to bulky. But this blow dryer is going to save me money between going to the hair dresses. Thank you Conair</li>
            <li> I will admit that I was hesitant because this is Conair product and it honestly seemed a little too good to be true.  I&#x27;ve bought countless expensive blow-dryers that are supposed to be \\&quot;the best\\&quot; and have been disappointed.  I needed a new dryer and carefully did research this time.  I researched dryers of all prices and the amount of reviews this one had impressed me. I am one of those people that doesn&#x27;t like to blow dry with a brush in sections, so I wanted to find something that would allow me to use my straightening iron less.  I love volume, so that was a factor too.  This dryer impressed me right away when I tried it without even reading instructions. Once I actually read them, it impressed me more (and once I watch the video, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be floored, haha!)  What I like about it is that it gives GREAT volume, with way less work than I would typically need (Velcro rollers, etc).  Because I get SO much volume, I&#x27;ve been able to go several more days without washing my hair (total added bonus!).  My hair is wavy, dries with frizz, medium thickness and if you go slow enough (I&#x27;m impatient!) you will get straight strands.  You can easily use it on dry hair to fix ponytail bumps too.    The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is that I still have a hard time getting my root perfectly straight with it...I probably am not going slow enough or doing enough sections, but I did have to do a tiny touch up in a few areas to get it absolutely 100% perfectly straight...  Totally worth it and such a great price.  From a picky as heck person, I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> The Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer is the best hair dryer I have used. I have natural African American hair and this hair dryer makes my hair much more manageable when I use it before flat ironing. I use it on the low setting and it&#x27;s still powerful enough to dry a small section of my hair in 20 seconds at the most. It is a bit heavy and awkward if you are using it for more than 30 minutes, but I believe that&#x27;s not a major problem-totally worth it.    (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

            <li> Great product! My hair is really long and I have lots of hair...&lt;br /&gt;This product is really easy to use and makes your looks awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Totally recomended to buy!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer straightens and smoothes hair very well.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to take the frizz out of their hair without drying out your hair.</li>
            <li> Works fast and easy to straighten and defrizz. I use a large barrel curling iron on ends to finish styling. My hair is mid back length and total style time is 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love my new Conair Infinity designer.  I was hesitant to try this as usually my hair comes out frizzy no matter what I try.  It was very easy to use (I even did it wrong the first half of the drying process).  I don&#x27;t find it any heavier than my regular dryer and it cut my drying time down by 10 minutes!  Right now I have salon perfect hair without having to use a straightening iron. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will report back if anything changes!</li>
            <li> This works fairly well to \\&quot;pre-straighten\\&quot; and cuts down on the time spent with the straightning iron.  The models used in the demonstrations on t.v. and in print ads must have thin, thin, naturally straight hair to go from wet to super straight in just a few minutes.  My hair is very thick, and usually requires almost 2 hours with the straightning iron to get it good and straight.  Using this dryer, my \\&quot;ironing\\&quot; time was cut down to 40 minutes and my hair seemed to fight the humidity better and stay straight longer.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The best straightning tip anyone can give you---invest in a Chi Straightning Iron.  They are expensive (around $100) but WELL worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I do not know how to operate a hairdryer, and never mind adding a brush to try and straighten out my permed hair.  I have never been good at blow drying my fine hair, and would either look like a puff ball, or just a clumb of frizz.  I bought this with the hope that I could actually style my hair, and I DID!!  It works, and wasn&#x27;t that hard to use.  I don&#x27;t find it akward especially since the alternative would be to use a hair dryer and brush, this just helps me.  So thank goodness cause I was going crazy trying to learn to work a hairdryer and a brush.</li>
            <li> The product does its job of straightening and shine, but I am thinking of returning this product. I lost lot of hair in the first use and am scared of using it any more. I have thin, long wavy-curly hair, May be its just my hair type, but just wanted to let you all know.</li>
            <li> This product has far exceeded my expectations. I have shoulder length, wavy hair, and a lot of it. Not only did this product cut my drying time in half, but it does straighten it. It takes a little practice to use, but practice time is well spent. I now can have straigt, shiny hair, almost as good as a professional blow-out. Fantastic product! I replaced a newer blow dryer that was supposed to be ceramic and ion shine but this one is much better. I cannot believe how fast it drys my hair, in fact, in gets extremely hot, thankfully there is a cool shot button. It also does not trip my circuit breaker like my other one. FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer as a gift, and was very skeptical after reading some of these reviews but, let me tell you...I was AMAZED! I certainly didn&#x27;t expect a miracle out of a hair dryer (let&#x27;s be realistic) but this thing came close for me! I have thick, naturally wavy hair (which is mostly FRIZZ at all times)and after using this dryer it was incredibly smooth, soft, shiny and full of bounce (not flat like after I use a straitening iron). I even used it right after coloring and there was no frizz or damage. I was thrilled to see my hair look so healthy and beautiful again! The first use will require some patience and care to figure out the technique that works best for you. As soon as I got the hang of it, it was so easy and I was SO HAPPY! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because I&#x27;m all thumbs when it comes to my hair, &amp; I wasn&#x27;t blessed to be one of those wash and go types. My hair is long, color treated, &amp; it takes me an hour and a half to dry and straighten it just so it looks decent normally. I used this product for the first time today and it took me 45 mins start to finish with better results, and I know it will be even faster once I get the hang of it. I didn&#x27;t use it til today because I was intimidated by the directions, but it was a snap once I realized you can kind of push it down on the hair and it will grip it for you. My hair was a little fly away, but a little hairspray was all it took to settle it right down. I&#x27;m going to buy this product for every female member of my family for Xmas!</li>
            <li> I just got it today, and I really loved it.  My hair is very thick and mostly straight, but there is a huge wave or \\&quot;hump\\&quot; that goes right through the back and I can never get it out with conventional dryers using the brush method.  This worked.  It wasn&#x27;t hard at all and now my hair feels very very soft, it feels thinner and it is really shiney which is something I strive for.  No problems with the attachment or the weight of the dryer.  All hair types are different but for my hair which is very thick it this dryer works and I&#x27;ll never use anything else again.</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy curly hair. I was NEVER able to blow it out straight...horrible results. Then I tried this hair styler, and my life will never be the same.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The product is super easy to use, dries the hair quickly, NO FRIZZ, ALL SHINE. Styling my hair takes a fraction of the time it would take with the brush method. Easy to maneuver even in the back of my head, and I don&#x27;t even have to section my hair. Keep in mind, my hair is very fine, which makes it easier to straighten. But I&#x27;m sure this product is great for even the thickest and curliest locks. My hair looks just as good as it does when I get it blown out at the salon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the greatest thing since sliced bread! I know what I&#x27;m getting all of my girlfriends for the holidays. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. Try it! You have nothing to lose...and it just may change your life, like it did mine</li>
            <li> I had this dryer for a few months and absolutely loved it until it broke way before it should have.  The dryer itself still works but there are two small plastic hooks inside the rim of the dryer which hold the attachment on and one of those broke rendering the attachment unusable. I am African-American with a mix of coarse and curly long hair.  This dryer got my hair straighter than a regular blow-dryer and brush but I still had to follow it with a Chi flat-iron which was fine with me. I am torn between buying another one of these, knowing that it could break again, or finding something else. The Conair people should find a more durable way to hold the attachment on. The plastic hooks are pretty flimsy. I still give this dryer 4 stars.</li>
            <li> As a person who has used this \\&quot;type\\&quot; of hairdryer for over 30 years, I have to rate this new product as so-so.  While the design is innovative, allowing airflow through the rear of the device rather than the side (which sucks up hair and breaks it off), it does not have the heat nor the wattage to straighten curly hair as effectively as other conair &#x27;hairbrush stylers&#x27; - i.e. a hairdryer that brushes through the hair.  Other styler dryers are more effective with higher wattage (I&#x27;m currently using another Conair at 1875 watts with brush attachment) and high heat settings, which is much more effective for straightening hair, however, does cause a great deal of breakage.  The rear airflow is a much better solution to avoid breakage, but needs to have hotter temperatures to actually straighten the hair.  My hair is EXTREMELY curly and I have tried most every hair dryer out there to blow it straight.  This new product falls very short of my expectations, however, is on the right track for the perfect styler-dryer.</li>
            <li> I just got this for Christmas and I am blown away by the results.  It even tamed my cowlick.  Normally my hair can take up to 30 minutes to blow dry, but I was done in under 15 minutes.  It may take once or twice to get used to drying your hair a different way, but the results are immediate.  Everyone noticed the improvement in my hair.  I have already recommended this to many friends.  Say goodbye to frizz!</li>
            <li> I am always telling my DH read the instructions when he complains about something not working. So what do I do with this hairdryer at first? I skip the instructions, click on the special nozzle and expect super straight hair........which I did not get. It did straighten it a little, but not enough to where I was wowed. I still had too much wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I sat down and watched the DVD and realized my mistake. I followed the instructions of using the straight nozzle attachment first, and then the special ceramic one. And I now have hair almost as straight as Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s. Nothing has ever been able to get my hair this straight - not even a trip to the salon. This was well worth the $50.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick and wavy and you want something to smooth it down, don&#x27;t bother with this product. It doesn&#x27;t hold thick hair at all well as the teeth are simply too far apart and too few for this hair type.  The best that can be said for this thing is that it won&#x27;t take up too much space when it goes into your drawer forgotten and unused.</li>
            <li> I have curly shoulder length fine hair.  I use this dryer with the concentrator end, not the straightner, to dry my hair quickly. It turns out soft and mostly straight.  If I use the high heat, it is a wild mess. I still haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of the other attachment. I still have to use a round brush, but this dryer is much faster.  Def. use the cool button when done for smoothness.</li>
            <li> Got this a few weeks ago and I love it!  It works so much better than my flat iron straightener.  Took a bit to get used to how to hold it and move my hair with it, but once I did, its so easy.  It dries my hair so straight--its wonderful.  Haven&#x27;t found a product so great ever!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer!  it cuts my drying time in half.  literally! It is really great because before i had to blow dry then straighten my hair because the blow dryer would always leave some waves.  Now i can skip the straightening part and go straight to dry and straight with one thing! Plus it is fast and is easy to work.  At first i was skeptical of whether or not it was going to be awkward to hold and use but it really isn&#x27;t!  I am really glad i bought and even if the straightening attachment doesn&#x27;t work for you (which i can&#x27;t imagine why it wouldn&#x27;t) the blow dryer itself is very good and is strong.  Great buy!!!  No regrets with this one!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good hair dryer, hair come out shiny..  but it is not a good hair straightner. Hair straightner does not hold on to the hair like it is supposed to.. It is very awkward to use the hair straightner..too big and perhaps requires a lot of practice..</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer right after Christmas this year and I have yet to be disappointed. I have curly hair and it does a nice drop blow drying without making it too frizzy. If you are wanting a completely straight look then you might want to use a hair straightner like a chi.</li>
            <li> my hair gets caught in it, but I can use it without the comb.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this dryer it work&#x27;s just as good as they say!! the price was great you can not go wrong</li>
            <li> As a hair dryer, this works great. The diffuser dries my hair really fast. The straightening attachment gets my hair straighter than it is (it is naturally very wavy) but I still definately need to use a straight iron. It cuts down my overall time for doing my hair, but not the amount of gadgets needed. I blow dry, straighten, then curl under the ends. Used to take an hour, this dryer did it in half an hour. However, the issue of heat is real. The air gets REALLY hot &amp; since you&#x27;re using your free hand to guide your hair, it can burn your fingers or neck &amp; your hair gets really hot. I guess that&#x27;s why it works so fast, but it hurts so be careful.</li>
            <li> Well.. this was interesting. After reading all the reviews I thought this was a great product.. Not at all. I is a very heavy dryer, the straightening attachment is crap, it would take 2 hours using this even if your hair is thin.. Since the air is blowing the air follicles way straigh from the drying instead of going with the \\&quot;grain\\&quot; of the hair you result in frizzy \\&quot;dry\\&quot; looking hair. I ended up washing my hair all over again BTW my hair is super process blonde hair and its wavy thick hair (I am white) so my hair is manageable and not dry or damaged at all.  I ended up just useing the blow dryer as a regular drying and rouhd brush.. Doing the old fashion roller brush blow out.. My hair was softer though than using my other dryer. I will say that.. but did my hair looking 1/2 as good If I went to a salon useing the striaghtening attachment.. Hell no!! lol.. not even close.. so I give this a 1 star becuase its useless as what your paying the product for.. all its good for is using it as a regular dryer, but for $50 I would have bought a chi hairdryer.. :( .. oh well... stick to blowing out your hair. Short cuts &#x3D; a frizzy messs</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use the low heat setting and it straightens my hair and dries it.  Easy to use and very durable.  it&#x27;s a very reliable Conair styler.  Nice.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer. I had to give it a good 3 months to become a better user of it. But after that, it worked really nice. 9 months later, I am not seeing the results I used to. The hair does not become as silky as it used to. I wonder if any of the settings got switched. But overall, it is a must have if you blow dry your hair using a brush. My hands used to get very tired having the dryer in one hand and brush in another. But not anymore. Another good thing about this dryer is, it really did reduce my styling time in half. It used to take me 20 minutes do to my hair after it was washed. Now it only takes 10 mins that includes the hair being wet and then fully styled and ready to leave the house. Just for that I love it. So, yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer, my hair is curly and very frizzy this product reduces the frizz by atleast 50%.  I also like the fact that its not as noisy as other blow dryers, I can use it in my bedroom when my baby is sleeping and the noise doesn&#x27;t wake him up! Great Product!</li>
            <li> Dryers hair fast without fly aways. Does a good job or smoothing out curly hair</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for myself to help reduce the time of straightening my hair.  I&#x27;m in my 40s and am white and my hair is really starting to frizz.  This blow dryer took 20 minutes off of my getting ready time!  It&#x27;s so impressive that I got one for my niece who is half African-American.  Her hair is past her shoulders and it takes 1.5 hours to dry and straighten it after she washes it.  When she used this blow dryer it took her only 20 minutes! So I got one for her for Christmas.  She LOVES it (and her mom, too!).  Only complaint: The attachment gets very hot, so use a wash towel when removing it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever discovered.  I have bra length thick, course, wavy hair which is now graying (wirey) making it even more difficult to manage.  I&#x27;ve never been coordinated to work both a hairbrush and dryer at the same time to make my hair manageable.  When I tried the traditional method, my hair often looked frizzy and damaged compared to letting it air dry.  This is basically a dryer with an unusual ceramic comb attached to the end.  I originally thought the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; and \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; thing was just a gimmick but it actually seems to work!  My hair isn&#x27;t stick straight like I used a flat iron but it is certainly sleek and manageable and I&#x27;m able to obtain the results in very little time.  I often use jumbo curlers afterwards to make my hair appear even more silky with a slight curl to the ends.  I bought the Conair ceramic wet dry straightening hot air styler at the same time thinking it was an entirely different product.  It basically does the same thing as this dryer, but I prefer this model because it dries quicker than the hot air styler.   The hot air styler is smaller (better for travel) and may be ok if you have thinner or shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Works great on my type 4 African American hair.  I&#x27;ve have other hand held dryers that have comb attachments that always break or pop off while I dry my hair.  It&#x27;s crazy thick even when relaxed.  This dryer works great and even straightens my hair.</li>
            <li> I gather from some of the other reviews that the product advertised a straight, flat ironed look.  I&#x27;ve never seen those infomercials, so I can&#x27;t comment on that claim.  What I can say though is that the Conair Infiniti does make blow drying my hair A LOT easier and faster.  I&#x27;ve used a few other blow dryer/comb attachments, and in every case the attachment has snagged my hair and caused split ends, or it frequent separated from the dryer.  I did not have these problems with the Infiniti dryer.  The comb attachment stayed firmly in place, and I did not feel as if my hair were being snagged.  It did not give me a just-from-the-salon super straight look, but it did allow me to very quickly and easily dry my hair whilst easily detangling it.    For reference, I am African-American/Multiracial and have 4b hair, which is very fragile, thick, frizzy hair with a hard to define spiral curl pattern (think Erykah Badu).    If you are African American or multiracial, it will straighten your hair if used correctly, but certainly not on par with getting it flat-ironed or pressed at a salon.  It will, however, make blow drying your hair easier.    I have one note of caution:  if your hair is damaged or extremely fragile, then probably don&#x27;t want to use this on high.  The dryer can get very hot, and if your fair is already brittle or damaged the high temperature may exacerbate it.</li>
            <li> It works great.  Really drys my hair and straightens it at the same time.  Great time saver!  I would want to dry my hair with anything else!  So Much Faster! Turns out great!</li>
            <li> As a hair dryer this product works great, has two heat settings, and two attachments. On the other hand, definitely not a good straightener. Does nothing for my fine wavy hair. Your better off buying a cheaper hair dryer that does the same job. As for straightener I highly recommend the maxiglide straightener by maxius.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer and was very skeptical it would work. I have long, thick, curly hair. At the salon it takes them 45-60 minutes blow out. I have tried the Instyler and flat irons and have not been pleased with the results, ease of use, and felt they were frying my hair and giving me breakage. This product worked great!  And it is under $40 which is so reasonable. I have never been able to work a hairdryer with a round brush so this all in one hairdryer (which is also  a great travel size) with attachment is a great solution.   Unlike a flat iron this product enables you to have volume in your straight hair. The straightening attachment at the end rotates which enables to change the angle/position of the dryer while still getting the maximum effect when you have to do the hard to reach areas like the back of your head. I am still getting the hang of using this product; it took me 45-50 minutes to do my hair the first two times I have used this. I think I will get more efficient. Follow the directions and dry your hair a bit before you start straightening it, and work in logical small sections is key. You get a very smooth look and I used only minimal product. My only complaint is I wish it had a round brush attachment to do the ends and put some big curls/body back in. I have not had success yet with getting my ends to curl under or to be smooth. Your hair gets very hot after it goes through the dryer attachement a few times so it is hard to hold and manipulate the ends. The product worked great and the blow out lasted two days till I washed my hair again. Easy to use the hairdryer for touch ups the next morning. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I spent two weeks debating on whether or not I should get this item. I must have read all the reviews on amazon and other websites at least twice. What was worrying me the most was that there was an extreme of very low and and very high reviews, and that no description seemed ot match my hair type. My hair is thick, very thick. But it is not frizzy, or bouncy curly. I have curls, strong ones, but they are closer to small &#x27;Victorian&#x27; salon curls. However, I was getting tirred of spending over an hour every time, I needed something quick, so I ended up ordering it.  The decision to purchase this item made it on my &#x27;Top 10 Best Decisions of My Life&#x27; list. It worked SO wonderfully well. I literally really did get salon results, and in only 45 minutes on my first try. Many complained that it was hard to handle, but if you can handle a hairdryer with a round brush, then this will be super easy to handle in comparison. The different tension types really help you find the best setting for your hair, and the heat is not unbearable. The frizz really is reduced, and the cold air shot technique really does help your hair keep its style. I live in a place with 65% humidity, and for the first time, my hair held perfectly for 3 days in a row, with out needing to go over with an iron.  A personal recommendation for those who purchase this item and have pretty curly hair: The manual says to find the best tension (1,2,3, or 4) depending on your curl type. I recommend starting at one tension less then you need, go over a hair section, and then switch to one higher, go over that section again, and do that until you reach tension 4. This will even further reduce unnecessary poof while keeping the volume intact.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! I had been wanting it for a while then finally decided to go for  it. If you are a dunce when it comes to styling or drying your hair (like me) this is the way to go. It&#x27;s hair drying 101 for dummies! My goal when I dry my hair is to dry it the fastest way possible and to blow dry it straight. I have wavy hair that does not behave unless it is blow dried. This great dryer takes the guesswork out of drying your hair. It allows you to straighten and dry your hair at the same time. I usually flip my head upside down, use the regular attachment (just like a regular hair dryer) and dry it till its almost dry. Then I put the brush attachment on for the finishing \\&quot;straightening\\&quot; touch. It comes out pretty straight and frizz free and if I want even more straightening, I will use my flat iron. This is an awesome hair dryer for people who just cannot control their dryer and a brush at the same time.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift 3 or 4 years ago. Last year my blowdryer broke around december (after heavily using it for the past 2 years) and I immediately bought a new one. Is indispensable for me. I use it almost weekly. Is very easy to use and does not make you tired.&lt;br /&gt;I combine this with a flat iron (because my hair is very curly) and I end up with a great look!!</li>
            <li> Did not straighten as well as I thought it would and did not dry that quickly either.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair (very curly in some parts) and I typically end up blowdrying and using a flatiron at least 5 days a week.  I&#x27;ve only used this hairdryer a few times since I bought it last week, but I must say, I&#x27;m impressed with the results!  I generally let my hair air dry for about 20 minutes after I&#x27;m out of the shower before giving it a quick rough-dry with the air concentrator.  When my hair is about 90% dry I snap on the straightener attachment.  While it definitely doesn&#x27;t produce the same results as using a flat iron, it does a pretty fantastic job considering you&#x27;re just using a blowdryer attachment.  I love that I can get pretty straight hair without having to apply the extra heat from a flatiron, and it gets the job done very quickly.  The unit isn&#x27;t heavy or awkward to handle, and there&#x27;s no worry of burning my ears or neck like I might with a flatiron.  I&#x27;m sold!  This was definitely money well spent!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer was what I expected and more. I enjoy the end result and happy I found something for my thick hair that works with detangling.</li>
            <li> When my wife&#x27;s previous 208S hair dryer broke after many years of daily use, she had to replace it with an identical one.  She has tried many others from time to time and swears by this model. It is fairly compact and helps her combat frizz.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Blow dryer is awesome that I just had to have one for travel.</li>
            <li> I saw this hairdryer at TJMaxx and purchased it and went home to look at the reviews before I even opened the packaging (beware the packaging is horrible, you will never get the dryer back in like it was!!).  The reviews were mixed so I decided to try it.      The DVD wasn&#x27;t really helpful to me so I just washed my hair and went to it.  I have mid-back length hair, thick, and curly.      First thing I noticed is that this is not a product for people with short/shorter hair at all!  You really should have about shoulder-length hair at least!    The instructions, reading them helped a lot!, were easy enough and I sectioned my hair (a must!) and started slow.  The dryer is heavy to me because I had wrist surgery on my predominant hand so that was not a good thing for me.  Also, it takes awhile to get the hang of using the straightening attachment and the angles!  I&#x27;ve read reviews about their hair being pulled out badly, in my opinion my flat iron took out the same amount of hair because of how much and long I had to use it.    The drying time, from towel dry, took me about 7 or 8 minutes when it usually takes me about 15 to 20.      The major cons for me is the packaging, the heaviness, and it doesn&#x27;t quite straighten my cow-lick out front.    All in all I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have kind of problem hair: thick but fine, wavy in the back but stick straight in front, limp, cowlickie, and slippery. I&#x27;ve tried SO MANY PRODUCTS!! smoothers, de-frizzers, straighteners, blow dryers, straightening dryers, drying straighteners, brushes, combs, EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF!! I have asked every new hair stylist I can for tips. Most try and sell me expensive creams, sprays or treatments. They never work! If I wanted my hair to be presentable, I would need to set aside at least 45 minutes, sometimes up to an hour if I wanted to look really good. I saw this product and thought it was too good to be true - dry, straighten, bodify, de-tangle, and smooth all in one?! I gave it a shot and found it to be the best tool I have in my arsenal to date! It takes less than 20 minutes to go from wet to straight, smooth, bodified hair with minimal split ends! I get SO many more compliments and saving at least 20 minutes a day really adds up! If you have tried other multi-step hair systems in the past or have thought of it, I encourage you to give this product a chance. It&#x27;s worth it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best dryer I have EVER had!!&lt;br /&gt;I am an African-American female with shoulder length, super thick hair that takes forever to dry.  This is so great, my hair is dry in 20-30 minutes instead of the hour it used to take with my old drying straightener.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it dry super fast, but my hair is bone straight when I&#x27;m through.  I get my hair chemically relaxed, and it has been nearly 2 months since my last relaxer, and my hair is nearly as straight as it was the day I stepped from my Beverly Hills salon.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this dryer because I am swimming everyday at my gym, and didn&#x27;t want to have to get braids or extensions so my hair would be more manageable.  I own a Babybliss straightening dryer (Babybliss is the French version of Conair) and I saw this dryer on UK&#x27;s Amazon site for Babybliss.  I was so happy when I found out Conair makes the American version, but I was skeptical of course.  OMG, I wish I had it sooner!&lt;br /&gt;My only con, is that the dryer is really heavy and I have to stop part way through the process.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to get the hang of the combs. (Some people say it was difficult for them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, especially for African-American or Mixed Race women.</li>
            <li> I needed a new dryer and bought this based on reviews and the price!  I am African-American with natural (4a/b-typed) hair; and my hair is LONG (about 2 and 1/2 inches from my elbows).  My hair is also VERY THICK AND COARSE.  I usually do not blow out my hair, but every once in a while, I like to see how long my hair has gotten.  I used this on damp hair in small sections (about 14).  It was weird to use at first, but once you finish a section, you get the hang of it.  I used it on tension setting 4 (I used it on setting 1 the first time and it DID rip some of my hair out, but that WAS my fault).  I passed through a section twice on the low setting then once on the high setting SLOWLY.  Three passes on each section and my hair was nice and straight - NOT BONE STRAIGHT (only a flat-iron will do that for my thick hair!).  Once finsihed, I passed the dryer through my hair on the cool setting.  It took about an hour; remember, this was my first time and I went slow.  I liked my results.  There wasn&#x27;t a burnt smell to my hair and my hair really was smooth.  My hair was also relatively shiny compared to other methods/appliances I have used.  My hair had body and wasn&#x27;t limp-looking!  Read the instructions and tips/watch the video.  I would recommend this product.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is a little awkward at first.</li>
            <li> I bought thisone like four years ago, the attachment would constantly fall out. But i solved that problem by supergluing it on. It works great it does, but after a while since i put some product on my hair, this yucky gunk would stay on the white part of the brush and was stuck deep inside. And it was really hard to clean out. I also think it made my hair frizzier. I tried the Vidal Sassoon one with the brush attatchment, and while it overheats it left my hair way smoother. The REALLY great thing about this one, is that it doesnt overheat. at all, after four years.</li>
            <li> The good news is my somewhat thin, cotton-candy, wavy, frizzy hair is shiny and STRAIGHT (with body.) It has been very hot, and quite humid lately, but my  hair stays straight and shiny all day. That&#x27;s a first. &lt;br /&gt;The bad news is the dryer is heavier than I had hoped. It is awkward to use, although I hope to become more proficient at it. For now I keep resorting back to using a brush. And, Conair, if you&#x27;re listening, a locking cool-shot button would be a big plus for those of us with work weary hands.</li>
            <li> This product is even more amazing than I had hoped for.  I read about it in Allure Magazine as on of their Best Beauty Breakthroughs.  Wow, is it ever! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have never figured out how to even do a halfway decent job blowing out my hair myself.  So all I ever do is either stick it in a frumpy ponytail, or shell out thirty bucks for someone to do it for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time today.  Couldn&#x27;t be simpler.  It&#x27;s just like a regular hair dryer with a comb on the end.  I actually did it while I was reading the newspaper online.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In about 15 minutes my hair looked like I had just walked out of a salon!!!!  I could not believe it.  Stick straight, and no frizz, even though it&#x27;s pouring rain outside.   My daughter just did hers.  She actually used a mirror.  Her hair looks amazing too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I know it is hard to believe that something does what it claims to.  But it does.  If blow drying is an issue for you, like for me, don&#x27;t think twice!!!  Buy it now!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick curly hair and have real problems straightening it.  I usually just have to go to a salon to get the job done (and it takes them about an hour!).  In the past I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on straightening aids and products that just don&#x27;t work, so I decided I would wait a little while to buy this dryer to see what others thought of it.  I kept the box it came in so I could easily return it.  I threw the box out the first time I used this dryer.  The infiniti did SUCH a good job, though it took a few minutes to figure out how to work with the special head (you have to push or pull your hair into it, easy after a few strokes).  My hair was not dry or brittle but super soft.  I did have to use a ceramic iron to get a high gloss but this was my first time using the dryer so I might not have given it enough time to work its magic.  Usually drying my hair takes upwards of 45 minutes (it is soooo thick) but drying &amp; straightening my hair with this dryer took about 25 min.  Definitely worth the cost for anyone looking to straighten or just speed up their drying time.</li>
            <li> While I enjoy the benefits of having a diffuser-type of blow dryer, I was disappointed in the ease of operation of the straightening/anti-frizz attachment.  It&#x27;s pretty cumbersome and I&#x27;m not sure it is any better than just using a round, alumnimum-based brush.  In fact, if you are already using a round brush to take the frizz out of your hair I would recommend that you stick to that method.  This type of attachment was just too difficult and ineffective for me to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I still enjoy the quality of Conair&#x27;s products but I am sorry I spent the extra bucks for this one.  I could have purchased a much-cheaper Conair dryer with a simple diffuser. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Worked well the addons worked well too my wife like the color also</li>
            <li> Bought the dryer because it was on sale for $34...had read a bunch of positive reviews-it&#x27;s unbelievable how a little hair tool can change your life! Cut my styling time in half-takes a little coordination to use but well worth it! Knowing how well it works I would pay @ least $100 for it-can&#x27;t say much about its functioning after long periods of use (I just bought it) but (it took my fine naturally wave-prone hair and made it look Jennifer Aniston-esque in about 7mins-(my hair is past shoulder length) &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever been frustrated with hair kinks, waves, unruly curls-and too much bathroom beautifying-get this dryer!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a replacement to 3 other blow dryers I own.  My hair is medium to coarse and very curly.  I tried straightening a small strand of my hair for about 3 minutes and it did what it promised, however I felt that it took too long and it was not as straight as I wanted.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer makes straightening hair SO much easier...I can&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s taken this long for a company to come up with this relatively simple attachment.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, curly hair and it took less than 1/2 the time it normally does...around 20 minutes total.  Not only does this make it a lot easier on my arms, but I am not standing around sweating from the heat of the blow dryer (and thus negating the effects of the shower I just took)! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, the drying is still just a prelude to using the flat iron.  The attachment doesn&#x27;t hold hair taut enough to get it really straight and if you want to add some curl to the ends, it&#x27;s not terribly effective.  I use a ceramic iron and then a spiral curling iron (also ceramic)...which still makes for a pretty high maintenance style, but this hair dryer defintely makes it a lot easier.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would also add that all of this ceramic technology (of which I was skeptical, I mean how could it really make a difference?) really does make a huge difference in the texture and shininess of my hair!  I also use SunSilk Hydra TLC before I blow dry (it&#x27;s only $3) and that also makes a huge difference in the smoothness/silkiness of my hair. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  I was skeptical of whether or not it work on African-American hair; it works great. My hair is not only straight, but also soft after using the dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry much faster with this model.  It also comes out straighter with less work than using a brush.  Sometimes I use a brush with the dryer and hold the hair down over the ionic rollers.  It took a few times to get used to how to hold the dryer and where to position the head.  I still need to use the iron as well but not as much as with my old dryer.  FYI - I have very thick, coarse, shoulder length hair and I can dry my hair straight in about 20 minutes.  I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer for any type of curly hair that you want to get straight.  Easy to use and light  weight. The brush is hard so bristles don&#x27;t bend or soften with the use of time and heat.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this product. I have very curly hair. This product pulled out my curls but DID NOT straighten them. My hair was poofy and frizzy. A brush and a blow dryer or a straightening iron do a much, much better job. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. They need to go back to the drawing board and improve the design of this machine.</li>
            <li> The only nice quality of this product is its color. Believe me. It does not straighten your hair as it claims, it just dries it. Plus, it is really, really heavy.   Really, dont buy it. I wish someone had told me before buying this thing.</li>
            <li> I have medium length somewhat curly hair, layered on the top and sides, and I bought this item after seeing it on TV and looking at it on this site.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m less than impressed.  I think it might work better if you have long hair, or hair that&#x27;s pretty much all the same length, but it doesn&#x27;t really work for me the way it&#x27;s intended.  The hair dryer itself is good, I like it, but when I put the attachment on it, it doesn&#x27;t cut it.  I watched the DVD several times, but I&#x27;m still not able to get it to do what it shows in the DVD.  If it wasn&#x27;t such a pain to box it up and send it back, not to mention costly with the return shipping, I&#x27;d do just that.  Instead I&#x27;ll keep it for the hair dryer or find a friend with longer hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that has gotten curlier as I have gotten older. I prefer to wear it straight, and this dryer does the trick. It&#x27;s easy to use and my hair looks great when I&#x27;m done. There&#x27;s no need to use a brush. You hold out a section of hair with one hand, and run the dryer down it from root to tip (repeat a few times). What&#x27;s left is straighter, shinier hair. It&#x27;s fast, too. I&#x27;ve cut down my drying time in half since I got this dryer. I also like the fact that it&#x27;s small, travels well, and fits nicely in my bathroom drawer. It&#x27;s hot enough and powerful enough to give you the results you are looking for. I definitely recommend this dryer to anyone with naturally curly hair who wants to wear it straight. Great product!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, it makes your hair very soft and it is very easy to use. Drys your hair alot quicker than other hair dryers. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Best dryer I have ever used.  This product is so easy to master for even the most inept of users.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, extremely curly, frizzy, coarse, out of control hair. The slightest humidity wrecks my hair style. I suffered with this all my life and finally, a few years ago, started to get the Japanese Straightening done every four months. Expensive, but worth it. The treated hair never curls again. However, after about two months the roots start to grow in and since I am now spoiled, I wanted to use something that would easily straighten the roots (the most difficult part) and that I could use on the treated hair as well so it is smooth and shiny.    I bought this originally for $59.00 but just got it here on Amazon for my (twin) sister for $39.99. The only other place I have seen it that price was Marshalls. I can&#x27;t express how well it works, but it does take a little effort to learn how to use effectively. You need to hold the hair tight in sections when the hair is still fairly damp/wet and pull the brush section through slowly, numerous times until the hair is completely dry. If you do that you will be very happy with the results. The difference between using this and just sectioning off my hair and drying with a regular dryer and brush is night and day. The roots are totally straight.    Again, Japanese Straightening is a miracle treatment for me...nothing works like that does but it is very expensive ($400 with tip every 4 months for my hair). Since I am by no means wealthy, you can imagine how fantastic it must work and how out of control my hair is. To also extol the virtues of this product...well you get the point. It takes practice but I mastered it with the first use.    For anyone who said it was crap...they just did not know how to use it or expected it not to burn their hair if they left it on one spot for too long...any hot hair product will burn if not used properly. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product. I had the long comb style dryer infinity by Conair before and it did a great job on my hair. The only issue is that it overheated within a year. It was discontinued. I tried this as a replacement and it blows my curly frizzy into a puff ball.</li>
            <li> I saw this hair dryer last week and almost purchased it until I saw the price. Then I saw it at another store and decided to give it a try.    My hair is thick, curly, and in a bob. If it dries naturally, well everyone with curly hair knows what happens, crazy hair. When I try to use my other dryer with various attachments, and it is such a hassel, since my hair is short now.    To make a very long story short, I read the directions, put it to use and within 10 minutes I had a great style. My [...] had to get everyone in the house to come see mommy&#x27;s new hair. If he noticed, it must be great!!!    Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The straightening attachment gets VERY VERY hot and falls off  too easily. I was drying my hair and the attachment  fell off onto my lap (I was in my towel) and burned my legs.   I cannot believe Conair would allow such a design flaw. It is  one thing if this hair dryer doesn&#x27;t straighten hair (I agree  with the other reviewers, the attachment doesnt seem to \\&quot;grip\\&quot;  your hair enough to actually do anything. You might as well  be using a clothes iron) but it&#x27;s an entirely different story  when the product is dangerous to use. &#x3D;0</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this works great for some--specifically those with wavy  or slightly curly hair but if you have very curly hair like me (sprial curls) DON&#x27;T BOTHER. I have been blow-drying my hair straight since I was about 15 and i&#x27;m now 25. I&#x27;m very good at it, I really don&#x27;t find it that time-consuming (it takes me about 30 minutes--my hair is very curly but fine)but when I saw an ad for this, I had hopes that maybe this would be some sort of miracle product that would eliminate the need for a round brush forever! The one thing about very curly hair and straghtening though, is that you need to spend a lot of time on the ends or you&#x27;ll end up with frizzy ends that look damaged even when they&#x27;re not. This Conair Hair Designer does NOT facilitate that. You have to hold the ends of your hair as you run the dryer through it, which means that once the dryer gets to the ends and you have to let go, no time has been spent straightening the ends. If you have very curly hair and can relate to what i&#x27;m talking about, then just step away from the \\&quot;order now\\&quot; button. The attachement piece is supposed to grip hair firmly but it&#x27;s still not firm enough.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, this is fairly light-weight and does eliminate a step if you have fairly straight hair and just need polishing. Otherwise, save your money. I get MUCH better results with a round brush.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews before I bought this hairdryer, and I am so glad I bought it!  Sure it is slightly akward to use at first, but it works well.  My hair is a bit wirey, has no real shap, and normally I end up just wearing it in a ponytail.  But now, I can easily wear my hair down.  My hair feels soft and silky to the touch!  I just love this thing!  The combination of straightening and softening my hair was what I was interested in for this product.  I am happy with my purchase, and recommend this product.  The Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer is a must have item in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> I bought this on Sat morning and used it later in the day.  I was skeptical as many of the as seen on tv products never seem to work when you buy them.  This is NOT one of those items!  I was in disbelief at how quickly it dried my hair and how straight my hair was in so little time.  It takes just a little time to get used to working it, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s a breeze!  I highly recommend!!!!  I haven&#x27;t tried to get fancy with it yet, just using it to dry/straighten.</li>
            <li> i love this hair dryer, i got it for christmas, alothough, i thought it was rather expensive.  it works great, i straighnet my hair everyday with it, and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and makes in more manageable.  i highly suggest it to anyone who wants a good straighner, i talked my friend into buying one, YAY ME!!</li>
            <li> It works just as well as a hairdryer and round brush so its not worth getting.  It didn&#x27;t save me any time, it was awkward, heavy and expensive. I watched the instructional DVD and read the instructions to make sure I was using it properly.  I was still dissatisfied.  I returned it and invested in a good quality straightening iron instead (the Conair Infiniti straightening iron works great!)</li>
            <li> Too hard to handle, heavy and bulky. Used it twice, put it away for good.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good.  I must admit, that at first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t, but it really does straighten hair and makes it so soft.  It makes my hair a bit staticky, but it&#x27;s also because I live in the desert.  The hair dryer makes my hair feel cold and smooth, instead of hot and fried.  The straightener actually straightens my hair, almost better than my flat iron.  My hair is a bit wavy, and it works great with my hair.  Really a great product.</li>
            <li> The Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer is Absolutely Amazing!  My hair is straight and dry in record time.  And so very soft.  I usually have to use so much product and then blow dry my hair and I still look like a Christmas Tree.  But not with this!  I didn&#x27;t even look at the Video Yet!  Amazing!  Definitely worth a try.  This is my first review ever, I want to thank the other reviewers for telling us how they felt good and bad so I could read the pros and cons about the product before purchase!  I love it.  The ladies in my family will be recieving this blowdryer for Christmas.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for my birthday this past November.  This dryer is well worth the money.  I have extemely thick/wavy hair that is curly at the root.  The roots being the most difficult to straighten.  It usually takes me 2 hours, more or less, to straighten my hair.  When using this product, I was done in less than 45 mins.  It takes a little getting used to, but, I am VERY HAPPY with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer today from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond using my 20% off coupon.  I have no rave reviews about this product.  My daugher has loong hair that&#x27;s frizzy and get&#x27;s tangled. (she&#x27;s Af-Am with 1/4 Asian from me).  I&#x27;ve grown up with frizzy hair, and wished the ceramic flat iron was out in the 80/90&#x27;s, b/c I now live by my ceramic iron.  Now I have a new challenge, and have to tackle my daughter&#x27;s extremely long frizzy hair.  It&#x27;s takes me an average 2-3 hrs to do her hair.  So unfortunately, it only get&#x27;s washed like once a month (please don&#x27;t call the beauty police), b/c I&#x27;m a working single mother with no time to wash her hair, nor the money pay someone else to do it.  So I went out on a limb and purchased this $50 blowdryer.    I will admit that the dryer did dry her hair much quicker than using a blowdryer and brush.  However, it didn&#x27;t get as straight as I would&#x27;ve liked it to be.  I still had to pull out my ceramic flat iron to straighten it out.  So instead of spending 2-3 hrs washing and straightening her hair, it&#x27;ll now probably take me 2 - 2 1/2 hrs for the whole process.      It is an ok dryer.  However, I would not swear by it, like I do my ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it works great. that being said - I am on my 3rd one as over time the straigtening attachment doesn&#x27;t stay attached and goes flying off when you use it. So I guess they could design that part better. But it does last well over a year and does a great job!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient to dry your hair while straighten it too. This hair dryer is very easy to use, and makes a better result than hair straightener alone.  The only flaw is y hair is little fuzzy after using it,I guess I have to use some leave-on conditioner or some other hair product with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the last person in the world that you would see doing her hair.  I&#x27;m a big tomboy I wanted to try to do something to my hair so could be girly I&#x27;ve tried many different blow dryers and I stink at it.  This works perfectly for those who doesn&#x27;t know hwo to do hair.  I love how it makes my heair all shiny and heathy and straight and it take care of bed head I love it.  I use it right before work since I shower the night before and my hair looks great.  I love it.</li>
            <li> If you have slightly wavy or straight hair, the cost and complexity of this hair dryer are not necessary. I did a test and my hair looked the exact same when I turned my head upside down and blew it dry in less than five minutes and when I painstakingly used the comb attachment and blew it dry in sections for an hour. Guess I&#x27;m lucky, so I&#x27;m returning this for a cheaper, simpler dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for my beloved wife. She used to have Braun dryers before and this was our first experience with Conair. This was a great deal we had. The quality is really wonderful and the DVD was Ok but somehow pretty too short and not that much rich but does the job. The unit is not heavy as other reviews state AT ALL. If you tried other dryers in that class they are at least double the weight. The finish and effectiveness as my wife says, is really great and as expected from the Ads. After the discount from Amazon, it&#x27;s really a very good deal and sure we will go for Conair again. Thanks Amazon for the smooth transaction and excellent service we are used to..</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course wavy hair. It&#x27;s like a horse&#x27;s mane in texture, and is hard to style. This does the trick, no additional straightening needed! Also gives me flips when I want them--- I love this thing.</li>
            <li> OK, here&#x27;s what you do....buy this dryer (it&#x27;s WONDERFUL), buy the Remington T3 Tourmaline flat iron and buy some Chi Silk Fusion or Biosilk. Wet to silky straight takes about 25 minutes total if you follow this advice. After showering, towel dry hair, and put the silk drops on your ends (don&#x27;t use too much---this will take a few tries). Also spray your wet hair with a heat protecting flat iron spray for good measure. Use this dryer exactly as intended (it&#x27;s not hard at all- I don&#x27;t get the neg reviews). If you have shoulder-length or longer hair, it&#x27;s easiest to put your hair in two ponytails (one behind each ear) and dry the ponytails first using this dryer. Then take them out and dry the rest of your hair with this dryer. Only takes about 10-15 minutes this way (and I have VERY thick curly hair).     Use the Remington T3 Tourmaline flatiron on 410 degrees (don&#x27;t pull it through too slowly---that&#x27;s very hot).  Then when finished, spray a glossing spray on your dry hair and rub it down. FINISHED and your hair will be BEAUTIFUL!! I&#x27;ve gotten soooooo many compliments on my hair since I bought these two pieces of equipment and started straightening this way. I have been SEARCHING for 20 years for an effective way to straighten that doesn&#x27;t take forever or prevent me from having my morning shower. THIS IS IT PEOPLE.  TRY IT!    P.S. I got this on EBAY auction for $10 plus shipping. Just sayin....</li>
            <li> I would like know if this product is bivolt, like 110V - 240V. Because i need use in Brazil where the voltage is 110V in some states and 220V in other states?</li>
            <li> This product takes no time at all and works very well!  I have pretty curly hair when it is wet, and it literally takes me 5-7 minutes to get my hair dried and straightened. Of course, I have to use my Chi to get it super straight, but if you are looking for a little bit of straightening with some volume, just the dryer is the way to go. Just don&#x27;t forget the smoothing product when you are done! The only part that is slightly annoying is that the cord gets all tangled up...but I guess that is the case with all dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this dryer for years, and I def recommend this!</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from this product. As advertised I thought I did not need to use any other dryer to finish the hair and make it straight. It does not work like that. The product does not make the hair straight as advertised. I did follow every step described in the instructions, but even did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer - I have long, fine, wavy hair that becomes extremely frizzy in the summer.  Using this dryer, my hair has the bounce I get after getting a professional blowout, it&#x27;s amazing!  The only drawback is that it is difficult to use on the ends of my hair, and I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of doing my bangs like it shows in the book.  The dryer works quickly and really does leave my color treated hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that is partially curly, mostly frizzy - just depends on the weather. I was hesitant to buy at first due to the cost, but when I factored in I go through a blow dryer about one a year for $25 then the straighteners are another $25 so it evened out but the conair dryer has a 5 year warranty. I&#x27;m AMAZED at how soft it makes my hair. The first day I used it I had such bounce and it was so smooth. Even after I slept on it all night I woke the next day and still felt so great - like I didn&#x27;t even need to wash it again. I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my soft hair now!  &lt;br /&gt;It is so simple to use and saves me so much time in the mornings now. I highly recommend this blow dryer to anyone who wishes to have soft straight hair and wants to save time on their daily beauty routine!</li>
            <li> Lightest dryer I have ever used. I have thick long hair that is not curly and not straight. Drying it was a nightmare. I have arthritis and carpal tunnel in both hands and used to stop drying my hair  after just a few minutes. This dryer lets me complete the job and not cause my hands to get numb. It also makes my hair straight. This is something no other dryer could do. The attachments stay on safely once you click them in place.</li>
            <li> If u have curly hair (which I do)  this blower was impossible to get my hair straight.  It looks very easy on the commercial when in fact it just frizzed up my hair and left it wild.  I donot reccommend this product at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have no idea how anyone could give this dryer a bad review.  I got it for Christmas, and I absolutely love it.  I always just let my hair dry naturally before, and then straightened it with my straightener, because I hated how time-consuming and awkward blow-drying with a round brush was.  This dryer got my hair smoother than my straightener ever has, and I have a lot more body too!  I really looked like I had just been to a salon!  The only thing I can figure is that people aren&#x27;t even looking at the instructions and therefore aren&#x27;t using it properly.  It&#x27;s not hard to use at all.  You&#x27;re supposed to hold the ends of your hair taut and then when you get to the ends you just curl them around the dryer attachment.  It&#x27;s not rocket science!  Also, if you separate your hair into sections using clips (which the instructions suggest doing!) and dry section by section, then it&#x27;s really quick and easy.  Also, use the cool shot button on each section to finish it (closes the hair shaft and locks in style, i.e. helps eliminate frizz).  If you do all of that, I really don&#x27;t see how you can go wrong.</li>
            <li> I love love, LOVE the Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have very thick \\&quot;combination\\&quot; hair- I have ringlets, frizz, waves, and straight portions, which makes styling a challenge. It&#x27;s almost down to my waist, and it used to take forever to dry and style it.   &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;If I wanted to go with straight hair, it meant dragging out the ceramic straightener, the hot rollers, or the large barrel curling iron. If I tried to go with my waves, the diffuser would take about two hours to dry, and then I needed to style it on top of that- lots of product and scrunching, as well as the small barrel curling iron. My hair always felt sticky, and dry on the ends. I was to the point where I was considering cutting it all off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t viewed the DVD that came with this product, but a quick glance at these reviews told me just about everything I needed to know.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have used the Infiniti Hair Designer three or four times now, and it gets easier with each use- I just wrap my hair in a towel for about 10 minutes so my hair isn&#x27;t soaking wet, put some smoothing products in, comb through, and I am ready to go. I just flip my hair upside down and dry section by section. It takes about 20-30 minutes to dry and style my hair now, which is  wonderful, and I have tons of shine and volume; it looks like I just came from the salon.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It lasts, too! I locked in my style with the cool shot button, and even when I got caught in a drizzle while doing my Christmas shopping, my style still looked great. Not perfect, (and I am sure that a downpour would be another story!) but a far cry from the frizzy nightmare that I have experienced up to now.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Another bonus- I am using less product and haven&#x27;t used any of my other hair equipment since I got this, because I haven&#x27;t needed it. I did plug in my hot rollers once, just in case I needed extra volume, but I never had to use them.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Purchasing this was definitely a win/win for me- I saved time in my morning routine, I&#x27;ll save space when I get rid of all the other products that I no longer need, and I am also saving my hair...less heat styling&#x3D; less damage. Yes!</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft, fine, shoulder length, and just about the curliest hair you will find. My hair is also very thick. I found this product did not straighten my hair and left it 5 times the size it was before in frizz. I have a conair straightener that I abosolutely love so I thought this product would meet my expectations as well. Not even close. It might be however that this drier works better on thin, course hair that&#x27;s longer. Anyway, here was my step by step process: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. I got out of shower and towel dried hair. I put in my favorite straightening product and then brushed it through. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. I pulled the top section back out of the way and put the bottom sections in the dryer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s pause for a moment. Right from the start it wouldn&#x27;t cooperate. It&#x27;s difficult to handle and doesn&#x27;t grip my hair. The hair is just blown right out of the attatchment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. Continue, letting more and more hair down while putting it through the drier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I was finished, my hair looked horrible. It was frizzy and not strait whatsoever. It looked almost as curly as it did before but 5 times the size in poof!! Later I had to go over the whole thing with my conair flat iron and finish the job and it looks as good as it ever does after I do that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing that this drier does well is dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy/curly hair, it took me about 45 min the first time i used it, but i think that now i have the hang of it, so i&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t take as long the next time. My hair looks great- looks the same as if i had used a flat iron. i had no problem with the dryer exept i got over exited and was trying to dry pieces of hair that were too big. after a while i finally figured out how much hair i can do at once and it went by a lot faster. I really like this dryer and i&#x27;m glad i got it.</li>
            <li> If the length of your hair is medium or short, this blow dryer is useless. Do not buy it thinking that you have the option of returning it if you do not like it. Unfortunately the only way to get the blow dryer out of its packaging is by breaking the plastic casing.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. I watched the commercial on tv for this and had to have it. My inlaws bought it for me for Christmas and I used it immediately. I love the attachment. I used it along with Biosilk Therapy Treatment (it&#x27;s an oil) and it made my hair so silky smoothe. I dry my hair just a little with the regular attachment and then finish up with the straightener attachment. I don&#x27;t like to use this dryer without the Biosilk Treatment because it is not as silky smoothe without it. I recommend that you invest in the Biosilk if you invest in this dryer. I HIGHLY recommend them together! ENJOY!</li>
            <li> This did not do like they show you on the info on T.V.It was just a hair dryer with attachments to me. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it. It did not straighten my hair AT all. Thank goodness I got a refund. G.S. Okla.</li>
            <li> I have short/medium length curly hair. I thought this device would save me time and energy. It turned out that the prongs on this device didn&#x27;t even catch in my hair, no matter what setting/level I put it on. In the end, after trying to futz with it for over an hour, I ended up having to still use my older hair dryer to blow dry my hair and flat iron. I returned this item right away for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this hair dryer -- it seemed to good to be true, and I didn&#x27;t want to waste $55 on a hair dryer.  However, I finally gave it a try and my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.  I have long, thick, curly/wavey (depending on the humidity) hair, and this hair dryer works like a dream.  I absolutely hated struggling with round brush and blow dryer only to end up with moderatly straight but still poufy hair, and I&#x27;m just too lazy and don&#x27;t care enough to bother with a flat iron.  This hair dryer delivers on it&#x27;s promise and more.  It cut my drying time in half, and my hair looks 10 times better than it ever did with my feeble attempts with a round brush and regular dryer.  The first time I used it I literally had to drag myself away from the mirror, I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at myself and running my hands through my hair -- I just couldn&#x27;t believe it.  It sounds too good to be true, but it isn&#x27;t.  This is the best $55 I&#x27;ve ever spent on my hair.</li>
            <li> O.k. here&#x27;s the deal. Day 1, the dryer was going back; Day 2, the dryer was going back....Day 3 &amp; 4, the dryer was going back, Day 5, hey I like this thing! I got the hang of flipping the ends and my hair is pretty straight with nice flipped ends. Day 6 and on, I&#x27;m not going back to my old dryer and brush.    It really takes about a week to get used to this dryer. I have thin, curly hair. I let my hair dry on its own for awhile, then finish with this dryer. My hair is not frizzy! it doesn&#x27;t get stick straight, but it does get smooth with nice curled ends. It&#x27;s almost like the old days when I used to dry my hair smooth with a brush and then set it on electric rollers...a big hassle. This is much easier. So, hold off on sending it back immediately and give yourself time to \\&quot;get the hang of it\\&quot;. Note, I don&#x27;t dry my hair from underneath, I dry my hair from the top of each section.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000FFI228 Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer (Wine)]]I LOVED THE PRODUCT IT HELPED ME STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR IN LESS TIME THAN A CERAMIC STICK. I NEEDED THREE HANDS WITH THE STICK . THIS WORKED GREAT WITH TWO HANDS.</li>
            <li> This dryer looks so funky but works nicely and is fairly gentle on the hair. It helps smooth and straighten the hair. Depending on where you place the dial is how straight it will make your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got African American hair. Gets my hair dry super fast. However, the comb/ teeth attachment snags on my strands. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a time saver!!  Light weight, very easy to use.  Attachments are easy to take off and put on.</li>
            <li> You know when you find that perfect product and you know you&#x27;ll never use anything else again as long as you have a choice? This hair dryer is that for me. I have a very stubborn wave in my hair that nothing in my entire life has been able to correct except for this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second one of these, and I&#x27;ll be using them my whole life I&#x27;m pretty sure. You know that episode of seinfeld where Elaine goes around town trying to find all the Today Sponges? If this dryer ever went off the market, I too would be driving from store to store hoarding the last ones remaining in the bargain bin and keeping them stacked in the hall closet in my house, scaring off \\&quot;gentlemen sex guests\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This little \\&quot;Hair Designer\\&quot; was very surprising.  I purchased it, willing to try anything new to help cut down my drying/straightening time. (Total time for me is approx 25 mins w/ hair dryer if I&#x27;m using a comb/brush + 35-45 mins w/ flat iron) It actually did! I am caucasian BUT my hair is extremely wavy/curly/frizzy/damaged.  It got my hair 85% straight/smooth so I did have to use a flat iron to finish my sleek look :)  Which was fine.  But I&#x27;m willing to bet if you hair isn&#x27;t real bad curly/frizzy this might be the only tool you&#x27;ll need. It still takes a little while with this \\&quot;Conair Infiniti Hair Designer\\&quot; but it probably cuts off about 15 minutes :)</li>
            <li> I have very curly,frizzy very thick hair. I can&#x27;t straighten my hair with a blow dryer and using a flat iron damages my hair too much. This hair designer is just in between. It is easy to use, and damages my hair less than flat iron. The result is not perfect straight hair, but at least the frizz is gone and it my hair is almost straight.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this hairdryer, I had shoulder-length, kinky/coarse natural African-American hair (4B).  I HATED blowdrying my hair because it took so much time and, yes, if I wanted to straighten it, it would taken even MORE time (almost TWO HOURS).  I have owned several blow dryers in the past and the comb attachments would always break after a few uses because my hair is so thick.  When I found this one, I was pleasantly surprised.  The tension dial on the comb allow me to adjust it if I&#x27;m using it on my hair (which is now lightly relaxed) or on my daughter&#x27;s hair (which is 100% unrelaxed).  I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of products on my hair to keep it straight.  You can even turn the comb so that it is horizontal instead of vertical (as shown in the picture).  (For anyone who finds the hairdryer clumsy to handle, try turning the comb - it helps!)  It saves me so much time and, after two years, the comb has not broken!  I even bought one for my 11-year-old stepdaughter, who has mid-back-length natural hair.  I highly recommend this hair dryer (and the life-saving comb attachment) to anyone who has hard-to-manage, difficult-to-dry hair.  TEN STARS!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is not the blow dryer for you!! It does now go through thick hair. You may want to try the andis blow dryer</li>
            <li> I got this hair \\&quot;designer\\&quot; as a gift after talking about it &amp; how much I wanted it for 2 or 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-long, thick, course, frizzy, kinda curly hair that turns into a large puffball of frizz, curls, &amp; waves if I just let it air dry so a flat iron &amp; hairdryer have been my best friends for years &amp; when I saw this I thought wow, this would be awesome if it really did work!  And it does work but 1st let me say this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Read the instruction manual 1st! (I kept it in front of me, going step by step the 1st time I used it lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It found it easier to do sections @ a time by clipping most of my hair back when doing a section&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you have frizzy or staticy hair, I&#x27;d recommend using your favorite anti frizz/static lotion, cream, or serum 1st&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Towel dry your hair pretty well, while you want it wet, you don&#x27;t want it dripping or have TOO much water in it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you have problems doing the back of your head or find it akward you may want to get a cheap mirror you can hang across from the mirror you&#x27;ll be looking in b/c if you can see the back of your head it&#x27;s much easier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now about the Hair Designer!&lt;br /&gt;It does take some time so if you&#x27;re looking for something quick &amp; easy this probably isn&#x27;t for you &amp; I&#x27;m 1 of those people who is always looking for the fastest &amp; best way to dry &amp; straighten my hair so while it worked, it took a little longer than I hoped but it was worth it in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 360 degree rotating head is great but be careful! it gets hot FAST so watch your fingers when going to adjust it &amp; make it horizontal or whichever direction or turn it off for a few seconds 1st!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I took my time &amp; went slowly following the manuel the 1st time I did have great results, my mom couldn&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t flat iron my hair that it was just from using the hair designer.  My hair was smooth, straight, &amp; still had body to it so all in all it was really good, my only problem is I don&#x27;t really have the time to do this all the time being a single mom of a 4 yr. old so when I do use it, I&#x27;m pretty lazy when it comes to sectioning it &amp; everything &amp; end up going over it w/ a flat iron when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little heavy &amp; akward (esp. when doing the back of your head) &amp; takes some getting used to.mom of a 4 yr. old so when I do use it, I&#x27;m pretty lazy when it comes to sectioning it &amp; everything &amp; end up going over it w/ a flat iron when I&#x27;m done.  It is a little heavy &amp; akward (esp. when doing the back of your head) &amp; takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> The Conair Infiniti Hair Designer with straightener attachment is a great product!  It performs much better than I expected.  I have thick, wavy hair and could never get my hair straight and sleek with a regular dryer and round brush.  This product makes my hair look almost as good as when my stylist does it.  At first, it takes a little longer to dry your hair, but after a couple of tries and experiments, my drying time is the same as before and don&#x27;t have the added time of using a flat iron.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I have really thick, frizzy, curly, Dominican hair and I&#x27;ve tried everything to get it to stay straight!! I saw this one day and decided to try it, and it works perfect for what I needed it to. I didn&#x27;t expect to just use this dryer and have my hair come out straight and perfect like it&#x27;s advertised and I was right not to think that. This blow dryer is perfect for me to dry my hair with before I straighten. I&#x27;m not good at all using a blower and brush, and this dryer is kind of a &#x27;two in one&#x27; deal. I dry my hair in sections, and then use my Chi to get my hair sleek and straight. So if you&#x27;re looking for an easier way to blow dry try this, but if you&#x27;re expecting to skip the straightening step I don&#x27;t think this product is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes of it controlling my hair which is dry curly frizzy fine and somewhat fragile.  On good days, which rarely happen, my hair likes to spiral up and out otherwise it can be a matted mess. Straightening has always been a challenge even when armed with good sprays serums and and lotions my hair hardly responded positively to heat especially with blow dryers. This dryer gives me a noticeably different result.      When the instructions are followed (wash, condition, detangle, section, heat protection product, low dry, high dry, cold shot) yes it does cut down on A LOT of time and each step is worth the effort. It gives me the choice of volume or a sleeker look with the direction of my blowout, the teeth of the comb don&#x27;t break off or get tangled in my hair and I don&#x27;t need to assist the dryer with a brush during the process and YOU CAN achieve salon style results at home, no joke no gimmick (follow the instructions!). I can&#x27;t say that I no longer need my flat iron but I feel like a pro (and I&#x27;m not by any means!) with how quickly I can transform my spirals into to straights without excessive damage or breakage.  After using this dryer my hair is straight usually a bit fluffy  (not so much frizzy :D) soft and has a nice sheen to it...it gives a great blow out with body and volume that lasts and is excellent as preparation for final styling with a flat iron.  For those with more tame hair I&#x27;m guessing the flat iron may be an unnecessary step.    While I love the dryer and if it broke today I would buy another there are some down sides, I&#x27;ve used it quite a bit (hair length varying from just above the shoulders to a few inches past) and it fatigues the arm a bit with the weight shape and sometimes required awkward positioning.  After moderate use the the comb straightener attachment sometimes rotates on its own during use which doesn&#x27;t make me happy but I work around it.  Lastly, the flocked shinifying thing on the comb attachement seems to bea waste of space unless its secret purpose was to collect excess hair product, which in that case it does a great job!</li>
            <li> I used this product for straightening out my daughters hair. The blow dryer made this task quick and easy great!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer has saved me so much time over the past five years. I have very curly hair, and am not coordinated enough to blow it out with a brush and regular blow dryer like they do at the salons. The Conair Hair Designer does it for me. I only have to touch up my hair a bit with a flat iron when I&#x27;m done, as opposed to spending 30 minutes flat ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had a single problem with it for five years, and now the attachment has finally fallen off and is unfixable. I am happy to invest in another one, as this tool is a life changer!</li>
            <li> POINTLESS AND HARD TO USE!</li>
            <li> This does work wonders... It cuts drying time in half and leaves your hair shiny and soft. However, you might still need to use a flat iron to touch up some spots.</li>
            <li> Received as a gift for christmas after watching the infomercial at Bed, Bath and Beyond and absolutely love this product.  It is easy to use and actually works to straighten and smooth my thick wavy hair.  Make sure, if you get it, that you do the cold shot with the diffuser on low to set the style and control the frizz.  I recommend this to all who need control of wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she truly likes it.  She often straightens her curly hair but the hot iron was drying her hair out.  Her hair looks so much healthier now.  She still uses the hot iron after using the dryer, but it is a lot less time of the extreme heat on her hair.</li>
            <li> I have the hair that frizzes in the damp weather, and the previously used products, flat irons, curling irons, etc....really didn&#x27;t do the job.  Infiniti is smoothing as it is drying, which is also a plus... it doesn&#x27;t take as long to dry.  Love it Love it Love it</li>
            <li> I love Conair and is the only product I buy when it comes to hair products. Blowdryers, brushes etc, but the Conair 208 Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer is a true disappointment . Not easy to use and I have more frizz in my hair than ever. I still have to use my flat iron after I use the dryer. I am sorry I threw the box out otherwise I would have return it.</li>
            <li> I have fairly curly hair, and this has been an amazing help. I never even bothered blow drying my hair before, since it always did what it wanted to, no matter what. Now it does what I want! Coworkers have asked me what I&#x27;m doing to make my hair look so much better.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find it to be heavy, nor has the attachment ever fallen off, as others have said. However, it does make my hair get pretty darn hot. I&#x27;ve never used a straightening iron, so I don&#x27;t know if they do the same thing. I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, but it only takes me about 10 mins from towel drying to done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, highly.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair that is somewhere between wavy and curly. I usually just leave it curly but when I want it straight, it was the blow dryer first with a brush followed by a straightening iron. Or I&#x27;d use my hair dryer with a straightening boar brush attachment. Both processes aren&#x27;t only laborious, they always leave my hair EXTREMELY dry with frizzy ends, which I \\&quot;band-aid\\&quot; with a strong moisture creme. I passed the Infiniti in stores and read up on it and thought I&#x27;d give it a go. And after trying it for the first time, I LOVE IT! First of all, the dryer is lightweight and the straightening attachment rotates so that you can angle to whatever position&#x27;s most comfortable for you when drying. As far as straightening, although I missed a couple of spots I simply touched up on, it&#x27;s probably one of the most effective ways to straighten, and my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel as dry/damaged as it does when I use other methods. BRAVO, Conair! Very happy with your product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Sears today, after reading the reviews and deciding to buy it.  I usually wash my hair at night so it can dry naturally because I have no coordination when it comes to a hairdryer and a hair brush at the same time.  In the morning I use a straightening iron to straighten my now curly/spiral hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t blowdry my hair at night, because i think that would be too much damage with blowdrying and then using a straightening iron.  I was sceptical, and had plans on returning it if it didn&#x27;t work (why waste $60 if it doesn&#x27;t work).  After I bought it, I went home, took a shower, and let my hair dry a little.  Then I put most of my hair up so only some of my hair was down.  All I can say, is that I knew it was going to work after I started to dry the first section of hair.  GOOD BYE STRAIGHTENING IRON!!!!!  I am so amazed on how straight, smooth, and soft it got my hair.  It took me less than 10 minutes to dry my hair.  My hair looks like I just used a straightening iron on it.  I just stared in the mirror for 5 minutes admiring that I was able to dry and straighten my hair at the same time. &lt;br /&gt;All I can say to anyone who wants to try it, is don&#x27;t look at the few negative comments (OUT OF 36 COMMENTS, IT GOT A 4*s, now that&#x27;s pretty good).  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  Just go out and buy one, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, bring it back.  That&#x27;s what I did.  I had plans on bringing back to sears later tonight, but it&#x27;s a keeper, so I get to stay in the rest of the night</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, inconsistently wavy hair that I always have trouble straightening.  I tried this product for the first time tonight and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with it.  My hair looks *much* better than it did with my old hairdryer and it took a lot less time and aggravation.  I had a little trouble with flyaways on the ends and also had trouble getting the hair near the roots underneath perfectly straight - but the rest of it looks really good, especially considering the odd texture of my hair.  Pros - performance; it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Cons - it&#x27;s a little heavier than other dryers, and the straightening attachment is awkward at first.  But the cons just take getting used to.  This product was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> When I tried the conair infinity I was excited by a bit aprehensive. I&#x27;ve been let down by every styling device before.  But in about 15-20 minutes I looked like I just left a salon! No exaggeration! I&#x27;m still a little surprised quite frankly.  My hair looks smooth and shaped and feels great.  I can&#x27;t help touching my hair when I pass by a mirror. ;-)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before the infinity I tried all the new hair straightening / smoothing gadgets : straightening irons, ionic hairdryers, hairbrush dryers (shaped like a round brush).  They all left me disappointed.  They never got my hair into the correct style and they often left my hair frizzy.   Given enough time to dry my hair (40+ minutes), I was able to get a decent shape, but nothing I loved - even after a long blow dry session. I&#x27;ve stuggled with curly wavy frizzy hair my entire life.  And quite frankly I always envied those women who could get themselves together quickly compared to my \\&quot;high maintenance\\&quot; (and often not satifying) hair routine. Let&#x27;s face it - when your hair looks great, you feel wonderful.  I wanted to feel low maintenance too! ;-) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But this hair device lives up to it&#x27;s hype!!! One feature they list is that the nozzle can be rotated.  At first I thought - big deal, just packaging mumbo jumbo....but then I found this feature to be very helpful.  Instead of twisting and contorting my arm all over, I just turned the nozzle so that my hand was always in a comfortable position. Even the back of my hair feels great and smooth. My hair is curly, wavy and frizzy, with a medium texture and I used the device on setting # 3 but with low heat as the high heat was drying my hair faster than I was able to use the device.  Maybe with time I will get more adept at drying it even fast, but right now I cannot complain about 20 minutes of drying time.  The device only takes a couple of minutes to get used to holding and using. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only one little negative - the packaging. It&#x27;s a box in a plastic box and there&#x27;s really no way to open this without doing even a little minor damage to the packaging.  So if you are thinking about trying it but maybe returning it if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, be very careful.  There is tape on the inside of the cardboard box too.  So watch out if you are \\&quot;trying it\\&quot;.  But I doubt after trying it that you would even consider returning it.  I cannot say enough good things about this device.  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> OK.  Listen.  I am seriously heartbroken right now, because I REALLY wanted to love this thing.  I have long, very thick hair with spiraly waves.  I have been using the Conair 1875 Watt Styler Dryer for many, many years and have mastered the thing.  I can truly create some serious straight hair magic in about 13 minutes.  You may be wondering why then, if I loved my other dryer so much, did I decide to try the Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer?  I&#x27;ll tell you.  Because the 1875 Watt Styler Dryer has a tendency to overheat on me just about every time I use it, which requires me to always have TWO on hand.  I just don&#x27;t have the patience to wait for 5 minutes while it cools down, so when the first one dies half way through drying, I just use the 2nd one.  Kind of a pain (especially when traveling!) but still works.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, other than that minor inconvenience (having to use two dryers), the 1875 Watt Styler Dryer has been a godsend for my hair.  When I saw the Infiniti Tourmaline, I thought, \\&quot;This might be the answer to my prayers.\\&quot;  It looked much more powerful and well designed and I figured that since the air vent was in the back, it probably wouldn&#x27;t overheat.  Well, it wasn&#x27;t all I&#x27;d hoped for.  Was it relatively easy to use?  Yes. Did it overheat on me?  No.  Did it straighten my hair?  Yes.  Did it straighten it as well as my 1875 Watt Styler Dryer?  Heck no.  The ends were frizzy looking, it took way too much time to do such small sections at a time (my hair is very thick) and the end result was not nearly as good as the results I get with the Styler Dryer.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, I guess the bottom line is if you are a person who has not mastered another alternative of blowing your hair straight (other than paying someone to do it for you) and can only straighten your hair with a regular blow dryer and then a straightening iron and/or curling iron, this might be the product for you.  It will probably do a better job than what you are doing now.  However,if you (like me) have already found a tried and true way to blow your hair straight with great results, stick to what you are doing and don&#x27;t bother with this.  In my opinion, it really isn&#x27;t any better and isn&#x27;t worth the money.  Back to the store it goes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with some natural curl. I use it for drying my hair but then I still have to style using my ceramic plated flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had just about given up on finding the hair dryer and styler that could handle my thick unruly frizzy hair... This product is all it claims to be...within 10 minutes I am transformed from a screaming banshee to a civilized business executive. I don&#x27;t know how exactly it works but it does...</li>
            <li> As Described. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different hair dryers (I have thin, curly hair) and some work well, but this one was very disappointing. It looks cute and modern, but it does not straighten the hair as it \\&quot;promises\\&quot;. Not at all. One more time I read great reviews and was expecting a nice product, and...not again. I don&#x27;t know if I should not trust the reviews or if I am just not very lucky. If your hair is wavy, curly and you want to straighten it with a hair dryer, this is definetely NOT the one.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve got typical asian hair- fine and straight. i bought this hairdryer because although my hair is straight already, it needs some shape on a night out! i&#x27;m quite retarded with a regular hairdryer and brush, and i was a bit worried that i would be with this one too... but i&#x27;ve used it once and it was really easy! you just have to grab a chunk of hair (of course you can pin up sections of your hair if you can be bothered) and pull the attachment through. it wasn&#x27;t too heavy that you need to rest in between, and it&#x27;s quite maneuverable since your hair will never get sucked into the back of the dryer. i&#x27;ve got so much fewer flyaways and crazy hairs sticking up over my head. i&#x27;m glad i pestered my husband to get it for me :)</li>
            <li> I have never written an online review before, but I was so disgusted by this product I would love to save someone else the headache. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What it is: just another hair dryer with a stupid attachment that doesn&#x27;t even go thru your hair, let alone straighten it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What it isn&#x27;t:  an easy way to achieve salon straight blown out hair style. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I guess if people who do not have naturally straight hair (like me -- thick and wavy/frizzy) want straight hair, we will have to get it the old fashioned way...hair salon blow-out, or home blow out with a good hot iron to finish it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money or get your hopes up with this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for this dryer to arrive.  However, when it did, I not only found it cumbersome to use, but it burnt my hair.  I have thick, color treated hair which tends to frizz, and after using this dryer just once, I noticed my hair broke off.  I shipped the appliance back to Conair promptly.  If you decide to try it, proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> The blowdryer works fine, but the straightener did not work at all for my hair. I have shoulder length hair, soft texture, spiral curls. This product did not work at all for me, but I think if a person only had wavy hair, or only slight curls it MIGHT work...all I know for sure is that it did not work on my hair...I ended up looking like David Lee Roth did in the 80s. Not what I was going for!</li>
            <li> Wow! This Works.  It reallllly works!  I have VERY wavy hair that would never stay completly straight no matter how many styling products I would use; I was ready to do a chemical relaxer when I saw the magazine ad for the Infinity.    The first time I used it, it took only 15 minutes to dry my hair perfectly straight and now I have model hair!   Thank you Conair.</li>
            <li> I like this blowdryer, I&#x27;ve never been good at the whole styling thing using multiple hands and I have really thick hair.  THis dried it fast, I still have to use a straight iron, but this is a great start to a nice blow dry.  A bit expensive and I can&#x27;t really get my hand comfortable yet.  I do like how the head will rotate into which ever direction I choose.  I would reccomend it if you have the money to spend on a nice blowdryer.</li>
            <li> There is no difference between this product and a regular hair dryer.It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST INVENTION EVER! I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it! Anyone who says it doesn&#x27;t work or \\&quot;can&#x27;t figure out how to use it\\&quot; is CRAZY!  It&#x27;s sooooooooooo easy! I used it the first time out of the box without ever looking at any directions or watching the dvd or commercial!  It&#x27;s so fast and easy to use! My hair is VERY long and curly. I usually blow dry it first, then flat iron it. Now, I cut my time in half and my hair is totally straight!    *TIP: Instead of drying all your hair at once, use a clip to hold half of it up while you dry the bottom half, then release the clip and do the rest :-)    THIS IS THE BEST HAIR DRYER EVER! I WILL NEVER USE A NORMAL DRYER AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li> I just bought this dryer, and so far i&#x27;m loving it! My hair is wavy, so i can&#x27;t tell you it&#x27;s great on super curly hair. But it makes my hair silky soft and very smooth, where i normally have frizz and static, even with a round brush or straightening iron (i&#x27;m just not good with them i guess).      I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews, and i think people aren&#x27;t using the options on the attachment to their full advantage.  The attachment can be placed at any angle around the dryer, so it&#x27;s not really that hard to figure out which way to place it to get it at the right angle for whichever part of your hair your working on.  And there is a tension dial that can hold your hair tighter if needed, i&#x27;m guessing some people aren&#x27;t using that so they think it doesn&#x27;t hold their hair.  So you might not be able to just pull it out of the box and go, but with just a tiny bit of trial and error, anyone should be able to use this and get good results.      Overall, I highly reccommend this product, much easier and quicker than blowing dry and then flat ironing my hair and better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked using this conair product.  I don&#x27;t do my hair everyday because it&#x27;s takes a good 20 min for it to fully dry.  If i had the time i would use the conair everyday.  I do wish it wasn&#x27;t so heavy.  After 15 minutes my wrist starts to hurt.</li>
            <li> the dryer was hard to use and I still needed to use flat iron, but my hair dried a lot faster than usual. Mal</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and this dryer is great for either drying with a round brush to keep it wavy or using the attachment to make it straight, all without losing volume (which is my biggest complaint with straight irons).  Also makes my hair much less frizzy than other blow dryers. Great product!</li>
            <li> Very good and convenient. My wife uses it regularly and is happy with it.  The product built quality is good.  Cons: does not support dual voltage power supply.</li>
            <li> I am returning this as it is incredibly difficult to use.  Even though the head pivots, the L shape makes it hard to do flips or pull it out straight.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This would be so much better as a wand design either completely rounded or even a long rectangle so one can more easily work with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Just coming to this page to buy another for a friend who tried it and wants one too. It is so easy to use and does a really good job.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought the blow dryer at sears a couple days ago even though I was still a little skeptic after reading the reviews on Amazon but I figured, what the heck?!  I must say the product does as advertised, it straightened my very curly hair and it left it looking shiner.  Another plus is that it dries your hair up really fast which will save you some time.  However, in my case I needed to finish off the ends with my regular blow dryer as the conair one left them way too straight.  Aside from that, I had to touch up the roots some as well.  No big deal though.  Some folks (especially those with really curly hair) who might think this will be the only hair straightening product they&#x27;ll need will be in for a surprise.  The Conair Infiniti 208 does straighten out your hair, but you&#x27;ll probably need some other tool to finish it off (IE: a straightening iron, etc).</li>
            <li> After reading some of the online reviews, I had decided to run to my local store to purchase one of these Infiniti hair dryers by Clairol.  I was a little skeptical at first because of my concern with the close hair-to-dryer contact and over-drying.  I have thick, coarse, wavy hair which gets dyed and sunbleached throughout the year.  In the past, I&#x27;ve used a straightening iron to try to get straight hair like Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s, but found it to be torture on my hair.  It literally fried it and made me look like I stuck my finger in a socket. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo..I tried out the hair dryer this morning for the first time and found it to be one of the most wonderful purchases I&#x27;ve ever made for my hair.  It straightened it w/ ease w/o overdrying it.  I&#x27;m sure ya&#x27;ll are familiar with trying to use a curling brush with a hair dryer and how difficult it could be?  Well, this was a snap to use.  The dryer has 2 head connectors (one for regular drying and another for the comb/straightening combo).  You just run the dryer along your hair at a 35 degree angle and let it do all the work for you.  Since the comb on the combo head is only on one side you&#x27;ll have to rotate the head on the dryer when you dry the other side of your head.  No big deal, but you may have to turn off the hair dryer first before doing it b/c the dryer can get a little hot while it&#x27;s on. &lt;br /&gt;The unit itself can feel a little awkward and a little bulky at first, but you&#x27;ll get used to it after a few minutes. &lt;br /&gt;I normally let my hair air dry, but after discovering this hair dryer I&#x27;ll look forward to using it again. :)</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer! Bit hard to use the comb thru attachment, though.  I have straight, fine hair that often is tangled when wet.  Using the comb-like attachment didn&#x27;t really help get thru the tangles, so I just switched to the more focused dryer attachment. Makes hair extremely soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> This product is a good dryer, but the staightening function is not as good as I expected. It does not work well with my hair type. I think it should be good for thicker and wavier hair, mine is very thin.</li>
            <li> It used to take me over an hour to straighten my very thick, curly, long hair. I could never do that round brush thing they do at the salon. I LOVE this hair dryer. It dries and straightens my hair in about 20 minutes working in sections. It took a few tries to get it right but it does a very good job of getting the curl out. I especially love that you can turn the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually give it 4.5 stars instead of 5 only because I do still have to touch it up with a 1.5\\&quot; curling iron for some body and work out the bit of friz it leaves (also working in sections curling under). But I never really expected it would turn out like that using only the dryer. I get so many compliments on my hair with this technique. Best $60 I ever spent on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: it&#x27;s 2014 and I still use this hair dryer! I&#x27;ve lost the attachments but really only use a diffuser on it anyway. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve had this for 7 years and it still works great.</li>
            <li> things I like about this product: &lt;br /&gt;given the power of this blowdryer, it&#x27;s really light and compact.   &lt;br /&gt;it does do a good job at drying my hair overall pretty fast. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;things I don&#x27;t like about this product: &lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t straighten very well at all.  my hair is somewhere between curly and very very wavy, and super duper thick.  I recently cut some off so it&#x27;s a little past my shoulders now, pretty average length.  I can&#x27;t get enough tension so that it actually straightens. using the blowdryer with a round brush works faster and with better results (especially if you like a little volume and flip/curl to the ends) being that it&#x27;s a blowdryer you have little control over each section as opposed to a flat iron (picture stray hairs flying everywhere from the wind tunnel effect).  yes it says the attachment swivels around, but you have to actually stop, then unclip it and reposition it, very awkward to handle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a product for straightening at all.  decent blowdryer, but you could find cheaper ones for sure.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the idea is good, but I just don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve really perfected it here</li>
            <li> This is a great product I have really thick, curly, long hair and this cut my drying time in half.  I still used a hair straightener when I was done using the dryer but that is because I wanted to get my hair really straight.  I thought this product would just be another disappointment but I was pleasantly surprised!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The commercial makes this product look easy to use, but it wasn&#x27;t. It was extremely awkward. The barrel is too short, and it&#x27;s difficult to pull your hair through the comb attachment and hold it there - there&#x27;s only high and low heat and the high will burn your fingers. I&#x27;m happy for those of you who like it - but I returned mine for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Its not really that fantastic, actually its faster and easy to dry your hair with a conventional driyer. It burns your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new ways of straightening my hair and was excited when this product first came out. I bought this thinking it would be a quick and easy way to straighten my hair, but was a little disappointed.  It does straighten hair, but isn&#x27;t as quick as the advertisements would have you believe.  You do have to use the dryer by itself first to dry your hair, then you use the attachment to straighten (the promo I saw made it look like just one step).  I also found it to be very cumbersome and awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair which I have chemically straightened in the past (just to make it manageable) but cannot do so any longer AND color it as it just dries it out. For any of you over 35 I really hate the Rosanne Rosanadana look which is what would happen to me. I would use a round brush (SO CUMBERSOME!!) to straighten it and then use a flat iron essentially all over and on several layers as it is so thick. This worked but took so long and by the time I was done I was hot, sweaty and my arms hurt.    This dryer gets a little getting used to in terms of how best to hold it but it dries your hair sleek and flat. It really works. I LOVE IT!!! I have used the flat iron just for touch ups. The time spent on my hair is much less because this dries and straightens your hair all in one step. I would most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very curly/ frizzy hair. I usually end up drying it and then using a straightener. Now that I have this product all in one, I don&#x27;t have to use two devices. It does take a little bit longer to dry my hair with this. It also requires two hands to get your hair through the straightener. It doesn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as a straightener, but that&#x27;s what I like about this. My hair doesn&#x27;t end up looking \\&quot;too straight\\&quot;. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these five years ago when the price was around $20 a piece.  It has been a lifesaver many times for me.  I have extremely hard to manage hair.  It&#x27;s coarse, coily and thick.  My hair type is 4c with a little 4d, so those of you 4c/4d ladies know what I am talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing, conditioning, applying various products including Lotta Body Coconut and Shea Style Milk (that I have recently started using and have had very good results) and untangling my hair, I use the Infiniti to dry and straighten my hair.  If your hair tends to knot up, start from the bottom and work your way up.  It really works very well.  My hair ends up being so soft, straight and has a nice fragrance. You may need to adjust the tension of the Infiniti accordingly for your hair.  I put it on the highest setting for my hair.  I still have the second one still in the box. The first one has lasted so long and still works like new, I haven&#x27;t needed to open the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other plus to this, is that it works really well with straightening synthetic kanekelon or Marley hair (get a brand that is heat resistent like Vanessa).  It leaves the the hair soft and straight (not necessarily bone straight) when used with the Lotta Body Styling Milk ($4.49 at my local beauty supply shop).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great blow dryer, it keeps my relaxed hair looking permed after it gets wet. I wish it was available in stores however.</li>
            <li> My first Infiniti hair dryer lasted almost 7 years. I was brokenhearted to see it wasn&#x27;t available in stores anymore. Well, Amazon has everything and I found it!!</li>
            <li> Id need a whole day to watch video and learn the correct way to use this on my short,curly hair but perhaps if and when that day comes Ill find out its a wonderful product when I can allot 3 hours to do my hair-Im pretty sure my life wont go that way and if it does I probably have bigger problems than my hair.The few times Ive tried to use it it just doesnt work well on my hair but seems to be great for others-oh well.</li>
            <li> I have very long coarse wavy hair and it used to take 1 1/2 hrs. to dry it.  It was very hard to use the first couple of times and it pulled out a few hairs.  After I got used to it I was able to dry my hair in 15 minutes!  It doesn&#x27;t make the hair completely straight though.  I use a flat iron after it&#x27;s dry to make it straight and silky.  Work in sections.  After you dry the section with the Infiniti, go over it with a flat iron while it&#x27;s still hot.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to dry thick hair well. And the attachment is just time consuming. Just stick to using a rounded brush.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best and most efficient hair dryer I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;For women of color, or women with natural hair, if you struggle with using a rounded hair brush and a traditional hair dryer, this is a life-saver! The &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; attachment can be used directly on the hair to comb through to dry. The edges are thick and rounded so it isn&#x27;t like a comb in the sense of you having to worry about it snagging your hair. It can be easily detached for cleaning or to replace with the traditional attachment that is also included with this dryer if you did want to use it with a rounded brush for more bounce. The attachments can also be rotated with the press of handy little push buttons on the side so that you can rotate the attachment and not your hand in some awkward position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this dryer is that it only has two settings, high and low, and once your hair starts to get closer to dry, hot feels really hot. So you must be careful and switch to low or you could really burn yourself and/or damage your hair. I would give this a 5 if there was a medium setting, but other than that, I could not imagine using a different hair dryer when I have to do my hair on my on and I have a lot of it and it is very thick. This hair dryer works fast, and I can usually have my hair dried in about 15 mins if I am not doing complex styling.</li>
            <li> I have nappy hair, Dominican hair that gets very curly and very frizzy once there&#x27;s humidity, but this product is actually very good for my hair. I have hair that reaches my shoulders and what I love is that instead of doing hair rollers and getting under that big hair dryer in order to dry my hair and for it to come out straight, I just wash my hair, let it dry naturally, and then use this product to straighten it and once I&#x27;m done my hair has volume, is straight, and has not knots.  The only issue I have is that it leaves my hair straightened, but not 100% straight (like Asian-hair straight). After this, I have to use my hair straightening iron and straighten my hair so it looks better.  Other than that, this product is great. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it and the whole using my hair straightening iron at the end isn&#x27;t that bad, sometimes annoying, but I got used to it.  I also use this product when it my hair becomes frizzy/curly and I have to re-straighten it.  As for the heat, it&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s pretty hot, just wish it was a bit hotter. But other than that, this product is very good.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the photos showing someone with very long hair using this dryer.  Mine is just shoulder length and I found it nearly impossible to keep the hair between the grooves of the straightening attachment, even on the highest tension setting.  I could only hold onto the ends for about half the length of the strand, and as soon as I let go, the air coming from the dryer would just blow the hair right off the attachment.  It wasn&#x27;t helpful to use low speed either.  It was also a hassle to keep switching the position of the attachment for different areas of your head, and it gets very hot to touch when you need to turn it.  I suspect this would work great on longer hair, but for me it ended up being just another blow dryer.  Since I own three already, the sixty-dollar one has to go back.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly hair and nothing has really helped straighten it except for a permanent straightener. This hair dryer is now my best friend! I have Multiple Sclerosis which causes my one hand to act up so trying to have a dryer in one hand and a brush in another can be quite the pain - this helps for this as well.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews here, and debated about buying this blow dryer.  It seemed that it worked best on people with thick, very curly hair.  I have fine, very wavy hair, and a lot of it,  and didn&#x27;t know if this would work for me - usually I have to pull my hair very taut to straiten it with a round brush, and I can&#x27;t do it everyday because the heat and stress really damage my fine hair.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this product worked really well.  It&#x27;s a bit awkward to use at first, but no more so than trying to use a round brush on the back of my head!  My hair feels very healthy and shiny, and the drying time was a lot less than a regular dryer.  Others have complained that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, but I found it to be perfect - hot enough to do the job well and quickly, but not so hot that it fried my hair.  For once a gadget has exceeded my expectations!  It&#x27;s not perfect - I&#x27;m keeping my flat iron, but will sure use it a lot less.  Now if only Conair made a diffuser attachment to fit this dryer....</li>
            <li> I used this and my hair was a big ball of frizz.  I was at work talking about it and my co-worker overheard me and told me it made her hair flat.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> the hair dryer is not as easy as you think to use especially when you have different layers I think it is better meant for long layers or one length hair</li>
            <li> Still have to use your straighten iron...doubles the time it takes to straightn your hair.left my hair frizzy.Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I asked for this product for Christmas after reading a couple of positive articles on it. There was no way I could afford to buy it for myself so I asked for it as a gift, but I was still skeptical.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have very curly fine hair and have been straightening it myself for years and have a hard time finding salons that can get it as straight and smooth as I can at home using a round brush and then a straightener. I used the Infiniti for the first time this morning without looking at the instuctions and I was amazed at how my hair turned out. I didn&#x27;t even need to plug in my straightener. And now that I&#x27;ve actually looked at the instructions I can&#x27;t wait to try it again and see the results.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is not only easy to use, but it saves time and is better for your hair. I feel sorry for those who gave it negative reviews because you seem to lack the skill or patience for using styling tools. Straightening irons are incredibly damaging. Everyday use of them only makes hair frizzier because of the constant abuse of the straightener&#x27;s intense heat. Trust me, at one point my hair actually broke off due to too much heat styling.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As someone who has fought with their hair texture for most of their life, this hair dryer is a blessing. I admit that it is a little awkward at first; it does take some getting used to. But it&#x27;s worth the money and I&#x27;m recommending it to all my curly haired friends.</li>
            <li> I do not have use of one hand, so I thought this product was the miracle product I was looking for.  Unfortunately, it cannot be used with only one hand.  Hair must be held in one hand while the other works the dryer.  Damn!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the worst.  I&#x27;m not a fan of ionic dryers but I thought I would give this a try.  It looked great on tv.  The piece on the end that&#x27;s supposed to grab your hair doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s the most important feature and it doesn&#x27;t work properly.  It left my hair frizzy and overdry.  My Wet 2 Straight flat iron by Remington does a much better job and leaves my hair soft and silky.  Not the case here.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  I&#x27;m giving it a 2 because you can still use it as a regular dryer without the attachment.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length fine hair and I have to dry it completely in the morning otherwise it is flat and wings out in weird ways.  I used to blow out my hair with a round brush and dryer every morning and it was time consuming.  I saw this and was very excited to give it a try.  It definitely dries my hair quickly.  You have to use the dryer with out the straighten attachment first, but it takes just a couple minutes.  Then you put on the attachment and run it through sections of your hair.  It does a great job at straigtening but I don&#x27;t get the same body as I would when I used the brush.  They say to try to use it under your hair so you can get it to turn under, but that is very difficult to do.  So I&#x27;ve been using it for most of my hair then attach the concentrator attachment and finish the top and front with my round brush.  I would say it cut probably 10 minutes off of my hair drying in the morning, so well worth it.    The straightening attachment has four settings for how tight it grabs your hair.  It really only works well on the tightest one.  I can see if you had short hair it would be hard to use.  I&#x27;ve had the dryer for about 6 months and I am worrying about how long the straightening attachment will last.  The \\&quot;flocked discs\\&quot; are starting to look worn and the ceramic plates look dirty, probably from my hair products.  I tried cleaning them but they are hard to get in between them.  Not sure if you could soak the attachment since it has the \\&quot;flocked discs\\&quot;.  I really do like the dryer overall, I actually take it with me know on business trips instead of using those horrible hotel ones.  I especially like the time it saves me.    UPDATE after 1 year:  I still love this hairdryer!  I was able to soak the straigtening attachment in warm water and the flocked discs were not worn at all, just matted down with hair products, it looks as good as new.  This is a great hairdryer, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item 2 nights ago and have used it twice so far.  I.  Love.  It.  I can&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t thought to try this until now.  My hair is thick and wavy/curly (it&#x27;s getting curlier as I get older, too).  I prefer it to be straight and sleek because, frankly, it&#x27;s a lot easier to deal with, especially on humid days.  But blowdrying with a round brush took so long that I would rarely do it, resulting in a hair &#x27;do that resembled a rat&#x27;s nest.  Using this product is so easy, and what used to take at least an hour now takes about 30 minutes.  I don&#x27;t have the random crinkly waves of hair underneath that I couldn&#x27;t reach with the blowdryer and the frizz is gone-- even without using any frizz-reducing styling products.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical of buying this product because i have bought sooo many hair products in the past that have not done what they claim to do, but this one definitely works! i have verrry thick/curly hair that takes me about 40 mins to dry with a normal hair dryer and round brush. it took me less than 20 mins when i used this. i would definitely recommend it for anyone who has even the least bit curly hair because it is such a time saver! and its compact size is great for travel.    after using this blow dryer for about 6 months, i have to say i still love it and it is still such a time saver. the only negatives is it doesn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as other blow dryers, which is fine because i flat iron my hair after i blow dry it anyway, and it&#x27;s really loud, i really wish it was quieter. other than that its still going strong and i love it!</li>
            <li> Trying to blow dry my very thick, long, wavy hair was time consuming and hard on my wrists as I managed a regular brush or a curling brush along with my dryer. When I got this I was a little nervous about spending that amount of money on a dryer - it was WORTH IT! Every penny. It has cut my styling time in less than half and my arms aren&#x27;t tired when I&#x27;m done. Great product.</li>
            <li> I received the product in record time, however the product itself does straighten hair somewhat, but does not take out the frizz which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I found this product very difficult to use.  It always looks so easy on tv, but is not user friendly at all-and yes, I watched the \\&quot;how to\\&quot; video.</li>
            <li> I had been looking at this hairdryer in the store for a while, but didn&#x27;t want to pay $60.  I waited until I saw it on sale on Amazon and bought one.  I have very thick, wavy, wiry hair that takes a long time to dry and usually frizzes out when I dry it.  With this dryer, you MUST mostly dry your hair first before the straightening attachment will be able to grab your hair (it says this in the instructions).  I set the tension to 4 (highest) and it grabs pretty well, but I still have to use my free hand to keep my hair from blowing out of the comb.  No big deal, it&#x27;s not hard to do.  My hair did frizz after drying, but seemed to not frizz as badly as when drying it normally.  It also did help straightening my hair - not as straight as with my straightening iron - but really cut WAY down on the amount of time I actually had to use my iron afterwards!  Also, even though my hair was poofy after using the dryer, it WAS softer.  I think the flocked comb helps with this somehow.  After drying (which dried my hair a lot faster than with a plain dryer) and then a quick few passes with an iron to get any leftover flips out, my hair looks great.  I&#x27;d imagine this dryer might not work great for you if you have very fine hair.  So - this doesn&#x27;t eliminate the need for a straightener if you want super-straight hair, but helps a lot.  I think it&#x27;s worth the sale price but I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it (though I wouldn&#x27;t pay $60 for ANY hairdryer period).</li>
            <li> The concept is a good one. The dryer is cumbersome. The cord is long but somewhat heavy. I have curly hair. It takes a lot of work and time to straighten the hair without it getting big. Women with curly hair will understand what I mean.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I have ever used - I have long thick hair and this cuts dry time in half - love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to straighten my hair with a blow drier alone. It&#x27;s gets really fuzzy and puffy. Flat ironing it after helps considerably, but if I let my hair dry in a pony tail or braid before using the flat iron instead the end result is much better. I thought this blow dryer would give me a better result than others I have tried.     The attachment was easier to use than drying with a brush but that&#x27;s about all I can say for it. The results were no different.     What really annoyed me about this dryer however, is that I can&#x27;t find a diffuser to fit it. I think it&#x27;s safe to assume most people buying this product will have curly hair and would therefore need one, so I consider this to be a huge oversight.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer. It cut my drying time more than in half and gets my hair as straight as the salon. It was so great I already bought a second one.</li>
            <li> My favorite blow dryer in the world! I don&#x27;t need to use a flat iron if I don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> I am a Black woman and I bought this thinking it would help me get my daughters natural hair a little straighter and more manageable. It did NOT!!! it took much longer to dry her thick natural hair and her hair did not flow smoothly through the attachments. It doesnt get hot at all, more like high warm at it&#x27;s highest setting. Those of us with natural hair know that when we are drying higher heat helps make the hair more manageable, even though your hair looses moisture with high heat Black people have to moisturize our hair so vigorously either way that it&#x27;s worth it since the moisture get replaced daily through cremes and treatments. I even used this to dry me hair weave and it didn&#x27;t work well on that either. And that was Indian hair! lol. I dont think this product well unless you have fine hair. I ended up getting an anndis blow dryer with a comb attachment</li>
            <li> I found this dryer to be so heavy and bulky that it was very difficult to use.  I definately wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly (frizzy, mediterranean) hair which I straighten, but which nonetheless frizzes if not properly dried.  I&#x27;ve just tried this dryer -- I have several dryers, including the $235.00 tourmaline/ceramic/ionic -- and it works.  The ends are not a problem (see previous review).  You do have to get your fingers out of the way -- i.e., let go -- but you can curl your hand around the brush-end of the dryer to hold the ends flat as they dry. My hair looked as well or better as when I dry it in sections with the $235.00 hairdryer and a large brush.  While the Conair blow dry was not quite as smooth as those that I&#x27;ve had at a high-end NYC salon, it definitely was as smooth as a \\&quot;no appointment, FIFO\\&quot;  moderately priced salon blow dry.  I would recommend it to anyone who has difficult hair and can&#x27;t afford weekly blow-drys.</li>
            <li> This dryer certainly dries fast, and straightens, but my hair comes out frizzy. I have very fine curly hair. I can see how it might work better on thicker and fuller hair than mine. I&#x27;m used to using an old Conair air brush which they don&#x27;t make anymore, so this seems heavy and bulky in comparison.</li>
            <li> I bought this product yesterday and am thrilled.  I have very wavy, thick hair that tends to frizz and get big by the end of the day.  It&#x27;s the end of the day and my hair is as smooth and shiny as after I dried it this morning.   I&#x27;m looking forward to using it again!  It dried my hair much faster than any dryer I&#x27;ve ever used and totally pulled out the wave.  I&#x27;m sure as I work with it it&#x27;ll only get easier to use.  It is a bit bulky, but once you get a hang of how to angle it there&#x27;s no problem using it.  For anyone who gets frustrated with a straightener and just wants to dry and go, this is great.  It also came with a short DVD explaining how to use it.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I bought two, one for each of my daughters and they give it two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised how well this hairdryer worked in my long, overstressed, curly hair. If you have the patience and you get more adept at using it, you can get your hair really straight and not have to use a flat iron. For me, that alone was worth the price! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> OK, it didn&#x27;t give me the dreamy hair I get when I leave the hairdresser&#x27;s, yet, it was far better than a regular blow dryer. Perhaps I had better learn a technique that would straighten without making my hair poofy. &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave this dryer to me for Christmas.  We both had fun trying it and we both love it.  She has thick, thick, auburn hair that has a lot of natural curl and body. After using the Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer, her long layered hair was straight, but with body and movement. It also had a beautiful, healthy shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick, but very fine. I have some natural wave that turns to frizz. Big frizz.  Ugh!  I&#x27;ve used many dryers, curling irons, and flat irons, and was doubtful that this dryer would be any better.  I was wrong. It takes a little practice to learn how to hold and maneuver it, but the results on my hair is fantastic! I can go from soaking wet hair, to straight and shiny in about 15 minutes.  Sometimes I use an anti-frizz or extra body product, and sometimes I don&#x27;t.  I get nice results either way.  Recently I got soaked in a snowstorm. I let my hair dry without brushing or fussing with it, and I was surprised to see it dry straight, shiny, and frizz-free.  Oh, by the way, my hair is past shoulder length, and layered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend taking the time to watch the DVD and read the little manual before you start.  There are a few important steps, such as figuring out where to set the tension control. (The dial is for this purpose, and has nothing to do with heat control, as one reviewer seemed to think.) It&#x27;s also important to draw the appliance slowly through your hair. The slower, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really very happy with this dryer.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever use my flat iron or other hair dryers again! It&#x27;s just too lovely to be able to do it all in one step, with one tool.  There is a diffuser available for the Infiniti, too. I&#x27;m considering ordering it. Maybe it would actually dry my hair in waves rather than frizz.</li>
            <li> Because now I don&#x27;t need all the brushes, dryers, irons! This does it all. I am so impressed with this product. It looked a little hokey or gimmicky, but I was out of options. I have thick hair with just enough natural wave to make me look like a lion if I just dry my hair. If I use a straightening iron, it&#x27;s TOO flat, looks unnatural. If I use a big curling iron, it causes the layers to look flippy and retro, not really what I am going for. I rushed home over lunch to try this out. I sprayed my hair with water and gave it a whirl. It&#x27;s not very intuitive, so I read the manual quickly. Once I did that, it was easy to use. I came back to work looking fabulous! My hair still has the volume, but it&#x27;s shiny and healthy looking, and the right amount of straight. -- One thing I did notice is that it worked no mater which tension setting I had it on, so perhaps that part is defective, but regardless, this is all I&#x27;m going to need from now on.</li>
            <li> My hair is extra curly (corkscrew curls) and coarse.  I tried this product and it left my hair pretty frizzy.  I still had to flat iron my hair afterwards. I get better results with a round brush and my regular 1875 watt dryer - flat ironing is usually optional when I use these.</li>
            <li> Hard to maneuver, difficult to use.  Heavy, awkward, not user friendly by any means.  A real disappointment.  Definately must have long hair to get any benefit from it.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a professional salon-quality hair dryer and was apprehensive about shelling out hundreds of dollars for one.  I came across this product and decided to give it a try.  While it does take practice to become adept at using the attachment, once I mastered it, I really love it!!  My hair is longer than shoulder length, in layers, average thickness and fairly straight (it has a tiny bit of body).  I use the attachment to create body at my roots by drying the hair sections from the underneath side.  The manual and the instructional dvd show the product being used on top of your hair, but if you dry it from the underneath, you still get that straight style, but with a little lift at the roots (where I needed it most).  To prevent damage to my hair and overheating of the dryer, I always use it on low heat when the attachment is on.  It takes a little longer to dry my hair this way, but the result is absolutely fabulous.  My hair is smooth and straight with a little lift at the roots (ala the Rachel look of the &#x27;90&#x27;s).  I love the silkiness that my straightening iron gives my hair, but i hate the way it makes it feel limp and lifeless.  This product gives my hair similar shine and silkiness, but without the limp and lifeless feel of the straightening iron.  I recommend it for anybody with a similar cut and texture.  Just remember to use it on low so as not to burn yourself or your hair.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I thought I would get a lot more for my money. I was disappointed because the results weren&#x27;t like the ones on the infomercials. I have thick wavy hair, and it wasn&#x27;t a good straigtener. I still had to run my cheap iron through it and that worked even better! DON\\&quot;T EXPECT MIRACLES!! Plus, its kinda loud and it gets very hot against my neck. Trust a flat iron instead!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do anything to minimize the time it takes for my wife to get ready.  She calls it the \\&quot;process\\&quot;  I call it agonizing.  So when I saw this as a suggestion for a gift for my wife I didn&#x27;t hesitate.  Let tell you it cut the \\&quot;process\\&quot; time in half.  My wife loves it and I honestly saw a difference in the way her hair looked.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Read good reviews, but I have thick curly hair that I blow dry and flat iron. This product did not work at all at straightening my hair, its not even a good blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer doesnt get real hot and your gets caught in the comb on the attachment. It was a watse of money.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer, but the comb is not long enough. It definitely dries my hair very quickly.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer, it does a great job, easy to use with my carpal tunnel.  Unfortunately, it only lasts a year or two.  The little plastic clips that holds the straightener to the dryer keeps breaking.  My first one was the wine, then grey and last one blue.  It is expensive since it will only last a few years but there is no other dryer like this, so I guess I will purchase number four!</li>
            <li> I have had this for several years and love it.  It is a bit awkward at first but all you need is this, no brush.  Get used to it and it will be a Godsend.  My hair never gets snagged in the combs.</li>
            <li> I am very clumsy w/styling tools. I started trying to straighten my hair with my hands and blow dryer w/diffuser and didn&#x27;t do too bad. Then I would add a curl under w/my hot air brush. That broke so I finally bought this which I had been considering. I guarantee I am not capable of doing everything this styler can do but I am very happy with straightening and drying my hair! I have shoulder length thick hair which still has 3-4 inches of perm on the ends and I can do a very nice job with this. My daughter says it takes 10 years off me! BONUS! : )</li>
            <li> I have 4a textured, bra strap length hair. Usually it would take me an hour or so to blow dry my entire head but this thing cuts it down to 30-40 minutes of drying. It may not seem like such a huge deal, but when my usual straightening process can take up to 5 hours, it is. The tension allows for my hair to be straightened prior to using a flat iron which in turn cuts my flat ironing time in half. This is completely worth the money. Love it !</li>
            <li> this hair dryer is amazing i have raid hair and when i used it my brushing is perfect i recommended</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer.  It straights my hair very good.  The dryer is very easy to use.  I like the color and size of the dryer.</li>
            <li> séchoir idéal pour les cheveux crépus.</li>
            <li> My mom had a similar hair dryer that had broken, so I purchased this for her as a replacement.  She loves it and uses it everyday!  She can style and blow dry her hair at the same time.  I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, right out of the box but the instruction CD and printed booklet are helpful too. It dries my hair fast, and styles it nicely. Using my old products took about 25 min to do what this does in about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> love this hair dryer  I have had one for a few years  and have been looking to find another,  Lucky to find it on amazon</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a friend who lives in Malaysia. I didn&#x27;t know that this product would not have the support for 220V/240V sockets (like their other products do). I contacted their support and asked if there is anything that could be done (change to a new product or anything). They NEVER responded! Some companies just want to sell and make money. They don&#x27;t care about their customers at all.</li>
            <li> I am a black female with natural&lt;br /&gt;Hair &amp; this blow dryer reallyyyy helped me get my hair super straight for flat ironing. I have never been able to get my natural hair this straight without going to the salon. Blow dryer is simple &amp; easy to use. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer before and loved it, unitl my husband by accident dropped it into the toilet and then i threw it out.  i didnt evey try to see if it would work didnt want to rick getting electricuted.  i was happy to be able to find it. easy to use, easy to manuver and durable.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best blow dryer ever!!!!!  I loved it so much, that I ordered a second one just in case this one breaks.  My hair looks like I just left the hair salon!!!  It soft and no frizz whatsoever.  It also cut my blow drying time in half!!! I have been recommending this blow dryer to everyone I know.  I was worried when I bought it and thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt . . I read the other reviews and they all claimed what I claim now . . it is the best purchase you could make for your hair!</li>
            <li> This really helps to style my hair.  When I put it in my storage when I moved from Tempe, AZ...it remained in good condition when I moved it out this past March.  I am looking forward to using it again.  I also have a new dryer that I have purchased since then that has a brush too.</li>
            <li> So awesome I can&#x27;t believe it. I have very thick, very frizzy hair. This product takes out all the frizz and leaves a gentle, natural wave. I have never had so many compliments on my hair. What a thrill, plus it&#x27;s quick and easy to use. It works best if used with a frizz controlling product like Frizz Ease. Without something like that, your hair will not stay unfrizzed for long.</li>
            <li> IT doesn&#x27;t really work with the power you look for your hair.. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as a hair designer</li>
            <li> My wife was not happy when she received it open. I just hope if we order another one it comes in a close box.</li>
            <li> This is my third Conair Infinite Tourmaline dryer in 10 years. I absolutely love this tool. I have wavy/unruly, naturally curly,  thick hair. If I blow dry with a regular dryer, I still have a lot of volume and frizzy so I need to use a straightening iron. But with this tool, I can section my hair in pieces and blow dry, straighten and shine all in 15 minutes! I hope this tool will be around in the future too. Thank-you Conair for designing this and for Amazon for having fast and efficient delivery :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied customer :)</li>
            <li> So glad I found this hairdryer! This is my second one.  The first one I owned lasted about four years.  I love the attachment as it really smoothes out my hair.</li>
            <li> It does really good for my hair considering I&#x27;m going natural... It&#x27;s easy to use and I love it... The only thing though is that it&#x27;s hard to clean...</li>
            <li> My wife said it doesn&#x27;t make what promises. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because it had the straightening attachment. It has made my naturally wavy hair much more manageable. I can&#x27;t live without it. Wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, this dryer Is my 3rd and 4th. I had to buy two. I can not imagine not having this dryer or being without one. I&#x27;ve used this dryer for years!!</li>
            <li> I had recently ordered this blow dryer and I love!! I&#x27;ve read reviews where people say their hair got caught in the dryer. Your hair can get tangled if you don&#x27;t section it off or do a good comb through before drying but otherwise if you use the product as directed YOUR HAIR SHOULD NOT GET CAUGHT IN THE DRYER. It dries my hair really fast and it finishes silky smooth, my roots are straight 2 months from a relaxer. I&#x27;m so happy I bought this blow dryer. It does what it says it does. The only thing is that I have short hair so my hair does not come out as shiner because I think it misses the last comb through which is suppose to make it shiny.  Overall, this product is great for natural hair girls and woman with kinky or thick hair.</li>
            <li> Good for straightening, but the curling did not work. all it did was fry my hair. It only curls short hair, and I have long hair. Dissapointing.</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEM. WORKS PERFECT. NO COMPLAINTS</li>
            <li> Excellent product, easy to use and gives a salon like look.I an very happy that decided to buy this, it has become a must have hairstyling accessory.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of attachments. I just kind of wish there were different settings for temperature air that comes out. It&#x27;s kind of annoying that I have to keep holding down the cool button to get cool air.</li>
            <li> Not good for black hair the front part is to short and it takes all day to get your hair dry.  The worst hair dyer ever!!!! I wanted to give it no stars but it wouldn&#x27;t let me write anything without at least one star.</li>
            <li> This is great for the price and dory&#x27;s fast. However the only flaw is that as it oz advertised to straighten hair, it will not fully even on someone like me with half straight nd wavey hairs on the bottom. So you will still need your flat iron, but other than that, it is great for a conair product.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, wavy/curly in back and it goes more than midway down my back. I have lots of hair that tangles easily and I was worried this hairdryer might not work well for me. It did take a couple of times before I got the hang of it, but now I love it! It&#x27;s not perfect, but it does save some time and is easier than using a regular dryer and a brush once you find the most comfortable way to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by following the instructions that came with the dryer. It called for dividing the hair into small sections to dry. However, that ended up taking longer than it used to take me to dry it while pulling straight with a brush and using a flat iron afterwards. So I tried dividing my hair into quarters, two in back and two in front.  This worked much better and saved more time. It does not save as much time as I&#x27;d hoped, but it is easier than using a hairdryer, brush and flat iron.  If you don&#x27;t like the brush attachment, it includes a concentrator as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Straightens my hair&lt;br /&gt;Easier than holding a brush and hairdryer&lt;br /&gt;No heavier than my previous hairdryer&lt;br /&gt;Very long cord (I didn&#x27;t think it would matter, but it makes it much easier for me to use)&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold and use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t save as much time as I&#x27;d hoped&lt;br /&gt;Cold shot button doesn&#x27;t work well, it keeps blowing warm, although not hot, air&lt;br /&gt;No warm setting, only high and low fan on high heat&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shine my hair the way a flat iron does&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are already looking for a new hairdryer, and want to straighten and dry your hair in one step, this is worth it. However, if I had not already needed a new hairdryer, I would not have thought it worth replacing my old hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I really like this blow dryer and I would recommend it to my friends and family! It is easy to handle and dries my hair quickly leaving my hair soft and silky. \\&quot;The best\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Works very well. Gets my hair a lot straighter and less frizzier than my old hair dryer. I dislike the fact that I have to keep stopping to readjust the comb attachment as I move to different sections of my head, but at least the comb stays on a lot better than past hair dryer attachments I have used on other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, because my hair is so difficult to manage, not wavy, not curly, just a thick, giant frizzball.. but the first time i used this, my hair came out smooth, soft, and shiny w/out using any of the extra hair products i normally have to use.  it also dramatically reduced my drying time - i&#x27;m IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> The straightening attachment was a little disappointing. However, the heat produced by the dryer is phenomenal, so much so, that it makes it difficult to hold the hair in place so that it can be straightened properly. The dryer in conjunction with the concentrator attachment works wonderfully. So I rated it 3 stars because I hoping for better results from the straightener.</li>
            <li> I have worn my hair curly for many years because I am inept with a blowdryer and round brush and didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair with a flat iron. I was ready for a change and decided to try this. I am amazed at how easy it is. One pass through the hair and it is dry and straight, but not limp. I need a little practice to get the ends to flip out, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get there. The dryer is pretty light and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> This is truly a miracle product.  I have very course and slightly color damaged hair.  Before I had this product, my hair looked frizzy most of the time and felt rather course.  NOW, since the Infiniti, my hair is smooth and soft.  I get so many compliments on my long, beautiful silky hair.  It is just simply amazing.  It is also simple to use and it is not time consuming! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer.  I too own several expensive hair gadgets and products that promise to make your hair straight and silky, and this dryer does a fantastic job for my hair by delivering a quick, straight, silky style in record time.  I have medium length wirey gray hair that is prone to frizz with moisture;  If I  section my hair as per the instruction guide and use long, slow strokes while holding the ends of my hair, it performs as advertised.  I did find it a bit awkward at first to use, so it takes a few tries to get used to it.  My only complaint is that I find it difficult with bangs;  otherwise, I am extremely pleased with the results.  I have been straightening my hair for a couple of years, but since I have been using this dryer, I&#x27;ve received many compliments on how healthy my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it to curl or do other manipulations with my hair, so I cannot comment on the ease of use for those purposes.  So, for a sleek, straight look, I find it incredibly easy and quick, and have recommended it to friends.  BTW, it is more expensive at Sharper Image, where I bought it last month.</li>
            <li> Not good for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer originally at a department store.  When my sister entered college she decided to steal my hair dryer.  I basically purchased another one off amazon for myself.  It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, is within a decent price range, and my sister and I both love it.</li>
            <li> Love it. it helps my daughters hair alot.&lt;br /&gt;It dryes and strightens all in on. Dont have to use the flat iron as much.</li>
            <li> Many years later, I still use it.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this hair dryer years ago (at a retail store) its cost was near $150. I would pay the same or more now since this is a hair dryer that somehow has flown under the radar, straightens my hair in a flash. My hair is wavy/curly and within 5 minutes, my damp hair is transformed into straight and beautifully styled.  I have long hair.  I first take off the attachment and just dry my hair until just damp.  Then with the attachment just run it through my hair and I have straight, highly polished hair.  It is so quick and my hair looks like I have been to a salon.  **** My hair doesn&#x27;t look like curly hair that has this straight but bushy look.  It looks like I normally have straight hair.</li>
            <li> I used it with good results before watching the included DVD (really? A DVD for a hair dryer?) Turns out I was using it incorrectly, I was able to dry my curly/fine 3b/3c hair bone straight in less than 10 minutes!  I had the same results in my 4yo&#x27;s 4a hair as well.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because if you&#x27;re not super careful, hair can get caught/break around some of the dials.  Overall, this dryer performs better than any salon blow out I&#x27;ve ever gotten!</li>
            <li> Works great on coarse hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter has wavy hair (almost curly) and loves to go to the hair salon to thoroughly straighten her hair.  This hair dryer will save on trips to the salon.  She can use it on her own hair and it works as promised.</li>
            <li> My hair does not easily straighten, but is not the most difficult.  This dryer is much better than using a regular dryer and hairbrush to straighten the hair.  It drys the hair fast.  However, for a more sleek look after drying, I need to spray on some shine and then use a flat iron.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this dryer.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product thinking that it would work for me since I have normal hair, not curly, or straight, but somewhat wavy, my point is that my hair is manageable. The air is not as hot as other dryers on the same price range. If you are looking for something that would help you finish your style faster, this is the product for you, but bury in mind that the results would be disappointing unless you have naturally straight hair.  My suggestion is to go for a normal dryer.  But if you decide to go ahead and buy it, I wish you good luck.</li>
            <li> My daughter has beautiful curly, curly hair.  Shw says this product is a miracle worker.  No more lion, no more fuzz.</li>
            <li> A hair dryer with a round comb will do the work safer. I tryed this hair dryer and could not even finish because it just broke soooooo much of my hair, I could not belive. I returned at the same day.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have used so far. You get the salon results with this one. I&#x27;ve to admit that it took a little while to get used to the straightner positions and tension settings. But, once you&#x27;ve used it couple times and decide the straightener positions..it does wonders. My earlier Conair hair dryer made my hair so dry and frizzy. But this one doesn&#x27;t damage hair and there is no frizz. The hair looks much silkier and Smooth than ever before.     Pros:  Salon results at home in less time  No static of frizz    Cons:  A little heavier than expected.   Doesn&#x27;t support 220v and hence not ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> This product is very difficult to use.  The video they send makes it look so easy to straighten your hair.  Ha Ha.  It works if you have four hands.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, just buy a $20 blow dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair and am always looking for ways to tame it as quickly and effectively as possible.  I was hoping this would help but I sent it back within a week.  The temp. of this dryer is EXTREMELY hot and it is very cumbersome to use.  After \\&quot;straightening/drying\\&quot; my hair for 30 minutes I ended up with a burned neck, a sore hand and wrist, and fuzzy hair.  I tried again over the next few days but I never found a way to achieve silky straight hair.  So, for now I am back to using my regular hair dryer and my large barrel round brush.  20 minutes later my arms are sore but at least my hair looks great!  This product is simply not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that comes down to the bottom of my shoulder blades with some natural body to it.  I pull my hair back a lot, so I get these perminant kinks in my hair from the elastic fold in the \\&quot;half pulled out pony tial.\\&quot;      I&#x27;m not type of girl that spends a lot of time on my hair and makeup, so previously I would just towel dry, comb out, and let my hair air dry (unless it was really cold out then I would use a dryer).  I never got the hang of using a round brush because I&#x27;m just not coordinated enough.    I bought this because I love the way my hair looks straight, but as it dries naturally, all the kinks and body come back.    This is so easy to use.  I never even bothered with the instructional DVD, and I got the hang of it really fast.  I use it all the time now, and I let my hair down a lot more too.  This is just the type of product I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It used to take my wife 1.5 hours to do her hair (thick, dense and long). Now it takes her 30 minutes and she is done.</li>
            <li> OK this dryer cost more than I wanted to pay but I decided that I was worth it. It works on my African American hair. The attachements stay in place and it gets my hair really straight. I still flat iron my hair with my Wigo flat iron which I love but this dryer does not leave my hair brittle or dull. I have a nice glossy finish and it does not leave my hair looking damaged and dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes of being able to straighten my daughter&#x27;s naturally wavy hair without burning it out with a flat iron. I was able to straighten my 15 year olds hair in 20 minutes give or take. when usually it takes us 1.5 to 2 hours with the flat iron and without any breakage. I am truly satisfied, very easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is the best tool I have ever owned. I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 5 years now and it still works as good as the first day I bought it. The attachment is brilliant and has cut my style time in half. I have thick curly hair and the use of this dryer is the only way to ensure my hair will stay straight all day even in the most humid weather.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, &amp;#34;WoW!&amp;#34;  Usually, it takes forever to dry my long, thick, wavy hair.  And since hair dryers usually leave my hair dry, and brittle, I had stopped using them all together, and letting my hair air dry, naturally.  However, as winter approaches, and a wet head equals a very cold body, I thought I&#x27;d give the Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer a try.  It worked fantastically!  My hair was dry in ten minutes, silky, and smooth!  Definitely a worthwhile purchase.  I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Love it !!! It works great doesn&#x27;t break my hair but straightens it . It does a great job. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> On average it would take me about 45-55 minutes to blow dry my hair than about an hour- an hour-15 to straighten it. When I recived this package I opened it up jumped in the shower and got out as quick as I got in. I was so ecstatic to try it. I follow the directions and did my who head in 9-12 minutes!!! I still had to go over it with the straightener for 1 minute to get a little friz out but, that time was included with the 9-12 minutes. (My hair is extremely curley, frizzy, long, and thick) I was AMAZED with the results! I think Every girl should own one. Best 30 bucks I have ever spent! :) Oh, also it left my hair with volume, soft, and shiney.</li>
            <li> This item did not work for me at all. Hair was frizzy &amp; tangled,took FOREVER to dry &amp; was NOT STRAIGHT. VERY DISAPPOINTED. If I hadn&#x27;t kept the product past the 30 day return period it would be LONG GONE from my home.</li>
            <li> Horrible, terrible, can&#x27;t hold it properly to dry hair.  Don&#x27;t buy it!!!!!  Tried it a few times.  Have thick hair.  Wasn&#x27;t able to maneuver it&lt;br /&gt;in my hand to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but found it very hard to use to straighten my hair which is what I wanted it for.  The BC173 is great, but ou can&#x27;t find it anywhere, even at .Conair.</li>
            <li> My sister let me borrow this same hairdryer and the next day I immediately went online and had one rushed to my house. I simply could not live without this product!!</li>
            <li> I love the is hair dryer! I have had for about 5 years and its still going. I use it just about everyday and have dropped it more times than I can count. My dog got ahold of it and chewed the attachment beyond repair, but I still use it as a regular dryer. It heats to raging hot in just a few seconds, with a decently powerful blow. I will be getting another when this one finally dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick shoulder length hair, with lots of natural curl and a tendency to get super oily halfway through the day. I gave it a 4 because it does not straighten as smooth as a traditional straightener, but its an excellent traditional hair dryer. My usual routine consist of shower, then Tresemme Heat Tamer Spray, Blow drying with this dryer, then straightening with my Remington Wet 2 Straight. All products I have loved and used for years. My hair comes out shiny and straight, super soft, and keeps it from getting oily all day long. Usually I only have to touch up some spots with my straighter the next day and I am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I am African-Canadian, my hair can be a little tough at times;  it doesn&#x27;t comb through my hair as easily. My sister raved about how much she loved it, me....not so much.</li>
            <li> Was excited to see this dryer, as I had previously had the Conair BC173 (no longer available) and thought that this appeared to be very similar and was described as having similar abilities.  Not so!  None of the descriptions or reviews mentioned that it is designed for at least medium length hair.  My shorter hair is styled with layers, and the styling head for this dryer is too large to use on them.  With the BC173 that was never a problem.  Sure wish Conair would reconsider making the BC173 available again!  As disappointed as I am, I gave three stars since the actual dryer itself is not the issue and it seems to be a good dryer.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It does straighten hair but the best part is that even long hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled in like the older styles with the intake on the side of the dryer. Feels comfortable and not overly heavy either. I like it!  Looked for something different at every single store I knew carried hair dryers but couldn&#x27;t find one with a brush attachment and that is what usually works for me. Problem with those are they just don&#x27;t last long before it has pulled in enough hair to mess up something. Have not had this long but think it might actually last longer because the intake is far enough out of the way. You can see the waves smooth right out as you move the dryer down the length of the hair. So glad I waited and got what I wanted. Now if they don&#x27;t stop making it before I need another one. :)</li>
            <li> I rated this a 3 star because it is difficult to style with...I mean just look at the strange design!  The only reason I purchased this one is because I had their other model which was FABULOUS!!! It was shaped with a wand style handle very easy to use on your hair with great results!  This one is trying to be too many things, as you can see the brush part comes off an you have a blow dryer.  I still have to use either a flat iron or a curling iron to style with, where the other on did it all in one step!  The more I keep talking I should rate this even lower...</li>
            <li> exactly what my daughter expected</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair, and bought this for my sister who has shorter hair now, thinking it was better for her. Silly me, this blow dryer is great for all hair lengths and types! My family is a great mixer and our hair comes in every beautifully full type, to thinnnn thin baby type. But it makes blow drying a breeeeze for us all, with the built in brush, which i also initially under estimated, it makes the process so much quicker and easier! And the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural 4b/c and this product is my wonderful. My hair can be very challenging and this help eliminate a lot of the work.  I could not find it anywhere except on amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best blow dryer Ive ever had. It blow dryers at a lower heat/strength than other blow dryers ive tried but thats because it has to brush through the hair and get very close. It works really well, I get through drying my hair faster now. It also comes with an attachment that concentrates the air. I dont use that one much the attachment with the comb is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I like this product overall. The only problem is that my hair gets caught all the time in the dial at the bottom and I pretty much have to rip it out, there is no other way to free myself. If it weren&#x27;t for that I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty good, nevertheless I bought the product expecting to be a new product, came wrapped in bubble wrap, with scratch, was sold as a new item but was used! Was not even inside the original box, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am the dry, straighten &amp; curl girl..... With this I can actually blow dry my curly hair straight... This is a beauty must have for long curly hair, I blow dry in sections bottom to top &amp; this is an amazing invention. Everyone who uses it buys it :)</li>
            <li> I have been fighting my curly, wavy, frizzy, thick hair since I was a teenager (many, many, many years ago). I did the wrap-around-the-head, the soup cans, chemical straighteners, blow-dry-then-flat-iron...you name it. This dryer took my drying time from 45 minutes to less than 20 and with much better results. It straightens my hair without frying it. My hair is the healthiest it has been in years - no split ends, it&#x27;s shiny and has great body and movement. Just follow the instructions and you&#x27;ll be amazed!</li>
            <li> Lovingly! So happy with it</li>
            <li> Came quickly, works great, good heat. It dries my medium long hair in less that 5 minutes &amp; the brush helps to straighten.</li>
            <li> Very good dryer especially for my 3c natural hair</li>
            <li> This model is such a disappointment.  I loved the older model, which was lighter and dried my hair so much more quickly.  This model is extremely difficult to use and for those who live in humid areas, prepare to get your flat iron heated up.  Difficult to control hair while drying, which gives us curly-tops unwanted volume.  I cannot believe that Conair could possibly believe that this is an improvement.  It&#x27;s awkward and hard to use.</li>
            <li> this hairdryer is amazing!!!!  i have very curly, coarse hair, and it used to take me almost an hour to straighten it.  it now only takes 20 minutes.  i still have to use a flat iron, but the hair dryer does a lot of the work for me!!  i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you have to spend time drying your hair with a blowdryer then flat-ironing it to get it straight, then I would definitely recommend this dryer. If you are good with a blowdryer and a round brush, it&#x27;s not really necessary for you to buy this. It pretty much does the same job, so why waste $60?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like it because it does make your hair soft and does add a lot of volume, and I&#x27;m absolutely hopeless with a regular blowdryer. I gave it 4 stars because no matter what they tell you, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair as straight and sleek as a good flat iron. Still, like I said before it does work. The only complaint I have is that doing the back of your head is a little awkward. I haven&#x27;t really gotten the hang of that.</li>
            <li> Cool blow dryer, doesnt get my hair bone straight as the other AA posters proclaimed but it makes it more manageble. One word of advice look around before you purchase this! Im in California and saw this at a store here called DDS for 14 bucks! :(</li>
            <li> The head is built at a difficult angle to use, no matter what position I tried it in, and it&#x27;s a real pain to have to press in buttons and turn the head every time you come into the hair from a different angle. It&#x27;s also heavy to use at those awkward angles. The drying/straightening process may work very well, but I found it so difficut to manipulate while \\&quot;test driving\\&quot; it with the manual that I never actually tried in on my hair. I returned it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is not easy to use.  The directions are not clear or helpful.  I have shoulder length hair and have not been able to insert my hair properly in the tooth brush attachment.  My hair is medium to fine which  should make it very easy to use with this gadget. It simply does not work.  It looks easy on TV commercial, but is not in reality.  This was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Honestly, if I had known this product was going to exist, I wouldn&#x27;t have cut my hair last year. I have really thick hair that, while not extremely curly, has a wave pattern at the crown that is so strong even my $100 straightener doesn&#x27;t always do the job. While a bit awkward to use at first, this dryer literally cut my drying time in half, and allowed me to leave the house without curling my choppy layers. So worth the money! It made my hair shiny and straight, but without the super-limp look I get with the straightening iron. If I could give it more stars, I would.</li>
            <li> This really does straighten wavy hair. It does not get extremely hot so it is not for the usual hair drying techniques but does a great job for what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin but frizzy.  this is a great blow dryer for someone like me, who wants to tame frizz at all costs.  i was never dexterous enough to handle a brush and a dryer, so this is perfect.  very lightweight.  will be great for fighting the effects of summer humidity.  i was ticked off at the ladies in my drop-in salon for various reasons and went out and bought this dryer in revenge.  sweet revenge, because it works!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. I found it very cumbersome to work with. I think it is much easier to use a regular blow dryer and a round brush. Besides that, you still do not get that sleek look with out running a flat iron through your hair. The blow dryer is very heavy and if you have thick or long hair, your arms will get tired before you are done. Nice concept, but does not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer, especially the comb attachment. I use it to dry my hair straight. I dry and straighten my hair at once with more volume than a straightener.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for about a week now, and I have to say, aside from being a little weird to use the first few times, it does nice work. Before this, no matter how I tried, I would still have to flat iron my hair before I left the house. With this product, I get a smooth and soft look, with more volume than the flat iron would leave me. So, although it doesn&#x27;t replace the sleekness of a flat iron, I no longer &#x27;have&#x27; to use it.    I never watched the DVD and had no problems figuring it out: Just a little trouble getting the hang of it, but still ended with fabulous results. Also, it dries your hair quick-quick-quick. My old dryer couldn&#x27;t come close.    I would recommend using a thermal protector when using this, as your hair is awfully close to the dryer and it gets much hotter than my old one.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this but it just does not work for my hair. It was awkward to hold and use and did not make my hair smooth at all. My hair was straight but very frizzy. My old conair 1874 dryer with attached brush worked much better than this and is half the price.</li>
            <li> Great item for my super curly hair....it enables me to blow dry my hair straight without causing damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> A nice blow dryer for straightening the hair when you&#x27;re short on time or don&#x27;t really feel like it. This dryer makes drying my thick 4c hair less of a chore. I only gave it three stars because this really performs the same as my yellow bird hairdryer, and my Sedu hairdryer. Personally, I already have several hair dryers and rarely use heat on my hair so this was a waste of money for me. Be sure to have the comb enter your hair first, as I put my hair through the middle plates first and had a lot of hair fall stuck in the ceramic plates. You also will need to blow dry your roots with the concentrator as with the straightening detachment, your roots will not be dry at all. It&#x27;s small sized so it will be a great travel blow dryer. It does not come with the defuser, which is needed for the roots, but it comes with instructions for ordering one for $10. The straightening device does lock in place, so I&#x27;m thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to hold it on while I work through small sections of my thick natural hair. It was affordable so I&#x27;m not disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Ive had this dryer for years. I love it. Only buying this one as a back up for when I travel. 6 years and going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have longer than shoulder length wavy course thick hair. Works great.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, curly, black &amp; Asian Hair!!! WHEW I know right!!! Anyway, I love this dryer, it straightens just like I need it too, it dry quick, its truly portable, &amp; oh so sexy looking!!! I have already used it on 3 other types of hair &amp; everyone LOVES it as well. A wonderful little phenom at an excellent price!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good blow dryer. I like it because it comes with a comb and i do not have to worry about how to use a blowdryer. This i my second blow dryer after revlon, and i love it. It doesnt make as much noise at other blow-dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been that great with hairstyling tools, so it could just be me - but I am having the worst time using this thing. I can&#x27;t seem to make it work and my hair seems to get frizzier somehow. I have very thin, mostly straight, *very* limp hair. I was hoping this would give it some volume like the ads seem to show. Not much luck with that. I do find it easier to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair, since I can stand above her while I do it. Her hair is much thicker, though also straight, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to give her the frizzy like it did me. So, I can&#x27;t remove all the stars since it might just be too difficult for me - but I still can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This air dryer is the best I have ever owned and lasted longer than any I have had before. Dries my shoulder length hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Perfect dryer for my curly hair! My hair gets very straight with this!!! Quality dryer; just a little heavy but worth it overall.</li>
            <li> My hair looks just as good as if I had gone to the Dominicans. This product pays for itself after the first time you do your hair. It saves you a trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> In my search for a new blow dryer my current one pooped up. So i decided i should give this dryer the credit it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I bought this when i was 15-17 years old (I am now 29). I have lost all the parts with it besides the dryer itself. But this dryer has lasted forever. As most of you know. Finding something that keeps working longer than a few years is a miracle. It still works as good as the day i bought it. I have used and abused this iron. Its been dropped 1,000 of times (I&#x27;m clumsy and besides if this thing would break i&#x27;d feel less guilty about trying to buy a new one). Its traveled, moved, used on my dogs, kids, dragged. I mean this thing WONT break! I have been wanting to upgrade my blow dryer for years to one of those fancy ($250 ones) fast drying ones  (I have long thick curly crazy hair) and can&#x27;t justify it when this one works so well. I have probably gone through 5 flat irons (settling on the Babybliss , best flat iron i have ever owned btw). Anyways this is a great entry level blow dryer. I never did like the straighter feature but wish i still had it to retry it...</li>
            <li> I use this every time I wash my hair! I use my &amp;#34;Just Natural Organic dry hair shampoo &amp; conditioner.&amp;#34; I also give myself coconut milk treatments. I have no relaxer in my hair. This blow dryer is awesome. It straightens so you can manage your natural hair. WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> Kinda pricy but I like it.</li>
            <li> I totatlly love this blowdryer I had one before and needed a new one so I made sure to purchase it...especially at this great price..thanks</li>
            <li> El producto nunca llego a la direccion indicada y ni la transportadora ni el vendedor me respondieron, perdi mi dinero, muy malo el servicio prestado por el vendedor y quisiera saber quien me puede responder por esta compra.</li>
            <li> Two words: this dryer plus the pro styler flattening iron and brush all in one equals: Own them! I was due for a hair wash when this dryer arrived to my house yesterday. After washing my hair and of course applying the proper heat protection (Keratin Oil before blow drying and Olive Oil heat protection serum after blow drying), This dryer does the job of a salon style blow out and in under an hour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When beginning the process, I separated my hair as I do when I am going to flatten it out using my prostyler straightener and ran the blow dryer comb attachment through only two times on the low heat setting. The low setting was all I needed while the comb attachment was vertical and glided through my hair with ease on tension setting 4. :) Just like when my stylist does it, my hair came straight with ease and looked like a salon style blow out only without the salon price tag lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is, if you&#x27;re an African american woman with hard to manage hair like mine, you have to own this and the prostyler straightener and your hair troubles are over! :) Just make sure to get the proper heat protection before doing any of this so to protect your hair from the heat. After that, your hair will be hair everyone else will want to have :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total time using both tools: 25-30 minutes tops. Yes I timed it! :D</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of uses but now I can&#x27;t imagine not using this dryer. The secret is really the comb attachment. I have 3c/4a curls and my hair is very delicate when wet. This dryer speeds my dry time and straightens without damaging my hair. You do need to follow the directions but it&#x27;s great. Wish I&#x27;d had something like this when I was a teenager!</li>
            <li> love this thing lost the attachement though ):</li>
            <li> i would never use another hair dryer ever again!! this is  literally a cure for any woman that has thick frizzy unmanageable hair! takes all the work away ...drys and straightens and defrizzes all at once!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I STRAIGHT MY HAIR EVERY WEEK USING THIS HAIR DRYER FIRST AND IT TAKES HALF OF THE TIME TO DO IT THAT WAY. I DRY MY HAIR BY SECTIONS ON NUMBER 2 ( I HAVE THICK HAIR) AND THEN USE A FLAT IRON TO FINISH. PERFECT EVERY TIME.</li>
            <li> I was dying for this blowdryer when it first came out when I was in middle school. I thought that it would tame my flyaways, even though I have very fine, straight hair. Well, after a couple of weeks using the comb attachment, I gave up, because it snagged in my hair and didn&#x27;t seem to help with flyaways at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s worth five stars because I have used this dryer every day for over ten years without any trouble. It&#x27;s small enough to be portable, it&#x27;s durable, and it works crazy fast. I really hope to get a few more years out of it before I get another one. I only wish that those of us with fine hair could get a discount by buying the same one without a comb!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product and I am pleased.  I did find that the hair dryer is on the heavy side, but the results are as described.  It dried my hair quickly and it straightened and smoothed my natural African American hair completely.  The one feature that I am extremely pleased with is that the attachment locks into place and does not come lose from the dryer in the drying process.  I am happy and glad that I ordered this dryer.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product to everyone with longer wavy hair to dry and straighte at the same time which is a time saver.</li>
            <li> favorite blow dryer. I can agree with all of the good comments. I mostly like how its not bulky, easy to handle when im doing my hair and also my 2 daughters,&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that they sold the brush separately so i can order another one in the future if needed.</li>
            <li> This dryer works fine.  I like it because it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick African American, natural hair.  This did NOTHING to straighten my hair.  I ended up with a big poufy mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact blow dryer for the pass 9 years and this is my second one. I love</li>
            <li> Unlike the smaller Conair Infiniti BC173W model that I could actually grasp and style my fine but full long hair with, this model only allows for hot blow dry and then very hot pull through even on the low setting. It does slightly smooth the hair that I can grasp toward the ends but does not allow styling - not wavy, not straight, not even a Farrah whip. My hair is wavy on the sides to curly in the back. With the previous smaller model I could tug at the roots and smooth them, also getting volume with the right technique, achieving a wavy style all over, or straighten it if I wanted to that day. Unfortunately my thick haired friends needed something stronger. This model is not it. It&#x27;s just hotter. Much hotter. Forget trying to style in a wave under, or trying to reach the roots for more volume or shine or control, unless you have a giant head and very strong arms.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair dryer!</li>
            <li> This is a great blow dryer. Really smooths hair well</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, but once I got used to it, I can use nothing else to dry my hair. It dries it straight. Not flat-iron straight, but straight enough to be prepped for the flat iron. They last forever too. I have had one for 10 years until the little plastic piece came off that prevented the attachment from seating properly, so I bought a new one a couple years ago and have had no problems. It dries the hair really fast, too. Overall, if you&#x27;re in the market to get straight hair, get this blowdryer. Its so much easier than the old brush and blow routine.</li>
            <li> I had long hair for a while, and the Infiniti dried it super fast. I recently went to very short hair, and it is even faster. Nice product and the seller delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Oh how I wanted to love this product. Instead the rotating combs manage to tangle my hair more than normal. It works a bit better without it. It also get&#x27;s good heat although not too hot. I was not too impress with it&#x27;s overall performance.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. You were the only one that carried it. It is the same one we had but ours broke so we needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Every person with medium-to-long hair should own one of these things.  It is so much easier to shape my hair with this than it has ever been with any other dryer.</li>
            <li> Best do it yourself straightener! Love this. I had one that broke last week after years of use and ordered a new one the same night! Great product! I can straighten my long hair within 15 mins!!!</li>
            <li> In my order I requested a new dryer. When I opened the Amazon box, I immediately noticed that something was wrong. The shrink wrap; that covered the hair dryer box, was torn and the flap closures on the box were partially opened. A closer inspection of the hair dryer indicated that either the dryer was previously used or the item was previously sold, returned, and resold again without any attempt to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; the packaging. Either way I am not happy. There are just certain things I prefer as new and a hair dryer; that requires direct contact with my hair, is something that I would want as new.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few years back &amp; loved it. My daughter lost the attachment while I was away doing military training. I can not find them in the stores anymore. So I found them here and ordered 2 of them. It straightens my kinky hair bone straight. Holding it is a little award because of its design. But once you get use to it...it&#x27;s no problem.</li>
    </ol>
