            <li>Direct2U Wholesale LLC is the supplier I use, and I have always gotten great service from them.  </li>
            <li>Not that great.</li>
            <li>I was pleased and impressed with product.</li>
            <li>But hopefully time will tell that I made a good purchase.</li>

            <li>Really good cream.</li>
            <li>Absorbs in and leaves my skin feeling good.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles which is good since I haven&#x27;t found any, but I think is an excellent over-the-counter retinol, antioxidant rich, nighttime moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product soaks in quick, doesn&#x27;t smell, and works great!</li>

            <li>we will get refills, for sure!</li>
            <li>This Face Cream is outstanding!</li>
            <li>but it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Not burning or irritated, just slightly warm feeling.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>The lines are softening and my face has a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>I will use the bottle up, it does hydrate my skin nicely</li>
            <li>the price is more than fair....</li>
            <li>There is no irritation and my skin is nicely moisturized but not oily..</li>
            <li>Message me if you have a wonderful new discovery.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered 5 more bottles to spread the beauty to my friends! :)</li>
            <li>Since retinol is a somewhat controversial ingredient [...]</li>
            <li>Watt&#x27;s is a great mild retinol product that softens skin and prevents most of retinols peeling affects with its moisturizing ingredients.</li>
            <li>She stated that exfoliating is very important as well.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it had better scent.</li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars but I wish it contained more IUs, say 400,000.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many products on my face and this retinol face cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a high-end lotion than a cream.</li>
            <li>It has lasted for more than 2 months.</li>
            <li>I wish I could say that my skin looked better.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and the price</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>My complexion looks more even and healthy.</li>
            <li>Its ok, I have tried many retinol creams</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably ok</li>
            <li>My skin does not feel smoother nor does it look more youthful.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I feel there should have been better directions for the use of the product.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad that I decided to try Retinol products.</li>
            <li>better products to use.</li>
            <li>but I think I will continue my search for a better retinol product</li>
            <li>It actually works -- and that is the best part......</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it, and if more improvement follows, I will be ecstatic.  </li>
            <li>I have used so many retinol creams out there</li>
            <li>I love the Watts line, and I also partnered this up with the Hylaronic Acid / Vitamin C /L-Arginine Serum, and used these together with the argan oil.</li>
            <li>this is the next best thing.!!!</li>
            <li>I will defintitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>: I would recommend this product as a stepping stone from the 100,000 IUs to a more substantial product.</li>
            <li>You actually could see a great difference in your face soon after you apply the cream!</li>
            <li>I bought this product and was astounded at how quickly my skin looked better!  </li>
            <li>This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The most amazing part is the way my skin feels, super smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>But, I do have a smile line, and it doesn&#x27;t do anything for that, but my skin feels amazing upon usage.</li>
            <li>I really believe it is a good product.</li>
            <li>This product is as effective as high end products which cost 5 times more.</li>
            <li>I am in my 30&#x27;s with combo skin and this works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>I used it at night only, as advised, and I wake up with smooth beautiful feeling skin.</li>
            <li>Although I adored the glycolic product I was using previously, my skin was very happy when I switched to this product.</li>
            <li>I have fine lines around my eyes and there has been no improvement.</li>
            <li>Seem&#x27;s fine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is somewhat of a light moisturizer, so</li>
            <li>Nice product because it gentle.</li>
            <li>It works just as a light moisturizer but not for wrinkles or brightening of skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and supple on the parts that didn&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li>This feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>and my face has never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>I used this at night and woke up with smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>and I do a light chemical peel once a month</li>
            <li>I do use a skin buffer each with a light cleanser before bed time</li>
            <li>(exposure to air or light reduces effectiveness)  </li>
            <li>Just purchased this item and so far so good.</li>
            <li>There are so many retinol products on the market that are out of sight as far as price and not as effective.</li>
            <li>After a lot of research, I chose it because:  - Good concentration of retinol (many others are too low)  </li>
            <li>Not as strong as I hoped, but it is still a good basic retinol face cream.</li>
            <li>it is down right awesome...</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t rate the effects it has on my skin, but the quality and amount of product you get is definitely worth trying it!</li>
            <li>Worth purchasing!</li>
            <li>It did not harm, but it didn&#x27;t do anything special either.  </li>
            <li>really works better than any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Most stuff off the internet doesn&#x27;t work, but this really works well.  </li>
            <li>Its good to use only 2 days a week</li>
            <li>I am in my mid forties, have oily/congested skin prone to breakouts, and am fair complected.</li>
            <li>Even with Retin-A or Tretinoin, the insert says optimum results take 6 months to a year, only to use retinoids at night, and always use sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li>I like this product because of all the natural ingredients and feels really nice.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is seriously the best</li>
            <li>Having dished out oodles of money on beauty, I LOVE LOVE that this product is a utter bargain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll last years and actually does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: although I did have some very mild peeling and flaking with this product, I decided to try the real deal (Tretinoin .025)to</li>
            <li>Pretty much any kind of blemish that normally comes along has not!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on wrinkles as I don&#x27;t have fine lines (thanks to God).</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients as I buy natural products.</li>
            <li>but because it&#x27;s as effective as medical grade age fighting/wrinkle erasing products.</li>
            <li>But it felt smooth upon application, so just as a simple moisturiser and then sunscreen on top maybe.</li>
            <li>Once again, I have found success.  </li>
            <li>Every morning I wake up with fresh and glowing skin.</li>
            <li>Very rarely have I encountered a product that produces visible and real results on my skin, but Watts Beauty Retinol Face Cream delivers.  </li>
            <li>maybe because of the oils in the ingredients - even though most of it are all natural - it clogged my pores more and I started to have major break outs.</li>
            <li>Before that I happily used Shiseido Bioperformance and other high end department store brands (Le Mer and Cle de Peau).</li>
            <li>I also seem to have less breakouts starting since I  have started using this in just a week - awesome...</li>
            <li>The ingredient list has ingredients that nourish my skin (hemp, grape seed oil) and enough retinol to help my skin start looking more radiant and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I use this at night, doesn&#x27;t make my face peel, my skin feels very soft and smooth from usage</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know what really happened other than have a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>some of the organic ingredients might break me out, but instead I was left with plump and glow-y skin:)  </li>
            <li>but it gets absorbed fast.</li>
            <li>whenever I finally get to the bottom of the bottle :)</li>
            <li>I did a skin test the first night I got it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find the first one.</li>
            <li>I have bought everything from paintball guns to vinyl on Amazon and this is the first review I have written</li>
            <li>When I use it, I notice an immediate difference in the morning because I wake up to glowing, clear, and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>so I went back for more  .</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a daily moisturizer with spf during the day because the retinol/vitamin A tends to make your skin sensitive to light.</li>
            <li>I read the ingredients, and sure enough Watts contains coconut oil, which is a well-known comedogenic.</li>
            <li>: When I first began to use it,  product seemed a wee bit grainy.</li>
            <li>My first review was deleted by the seller.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it magically makes me look 10 years younger, but no cream on earth does!</li>
            <li>and I got very mild, barely noticeable sensation when I put on my face.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything except it made my skin oily and break a lot, and I am not young :)</li>
            <li>It has natural ingredients and not bad for the price, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But, I liked how it was made from 80% organic ingedients and I have heard how much retinol can help with many different skin problems ranging from acne, wrinkles, and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>so I kept it even though it looked kind of odd.</li>
            <li>I have post acne blemishes and a variety of large pores and oily skin and it hasn&#x27;t improved one issue.</li>
            <li>Large pores diminished after about a week of using twice a day.</li>
            <li>and everything was fine the next day,</li>
            <li>works like a million for big pores and fine wrinkles</li>
            <li>This lotion came with the top 1/8 th of the bottle empty but the pump did not look like it was used</li>
            <li>So I stopped using it, and got the real Retin-A from my Derm.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the fact that it didn&#x27;t mention how much % of retinol on this product.</li>
            <li>The 80% organic products is a real plus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and I&#x27;ve put it all over my face (even around eyes).</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and nothing changed.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I have also used prescriptions like Retin-A and having experience it, this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>but i did not notice much of a difference in skin texture or pore size.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really do like purchasing them for Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Watts Beauty Retinol Face Cream 150,000 IU per oz.</li>
            <li>Having been using this for over a month now, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve noticed any changes.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t have really problematic skin</li>
            <li>I also liked how the bottle came in a green tinted pump bottle to protect the retinol from unneccesary sun exposure</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry but totally kills pimples and minimizes blemish - almost like magic overnight!  </li>
            <li>I switched back to my tried and true retinol brand and immediately began peeling and had to start the process all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some products contain a small % and work effectively</li>
            <li>my skin looks like new!</li>
            <li>I notices Roc was better making my skin less blotchy and smoother compared to this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent lotion, but not an anti aging product.  </li>
            <li>my acne has been steadily improving.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a retinol cream that is high in antioxidants and NOT tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone over 30.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I had my expectations set too high.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many lotions, potions and other things to help my 40 year old skin, I have sun damage showing up with a vengeance.  </li>
            <li>I will have to give it a rest during the week I do my chemical peels...as I believe it will be to much, but so far I have not had any redness or flaking....</li>
            <li>(although, I&#x27;m not really sure how much 150000iu of retinol is, since most labels identify it as a %).</li>
            <li>I have had very mild peeling with this product, enough to show it&#x27;s working but not enough to hamper make-up application.  </li>
            <li>I used the Hylaronic acid serum with Vitamin C right after my cleanser, followed by the argan oil to seal it in, then I used this Retinol cream as my night time moisturizer last.</li>
            <li>The seller sent it out quickly, didn&#x27;t have to wait long at all.  </li>
            <li>I bought Watts retinol cream a couple weeks ago and at first I did like that it did not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>Its always a &amp;#34;hit and miss&amp;#34; trying new products</li>
            <li>Only using it at night and wake up with really smooth skin and pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>Secondly, you don&#x27;t need to use very much.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Okay, so I was not sure about getting this -</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Overall, very please and will buy again!</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to see if it helps diminish fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Third, I am noticing a difference in skin texture that is similar to what I felt after a blue light treatment (intense peel).  </li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning and my skin is new skin soft...</li>
            <li>As a 31 year old male, I bought this as my first cream for dealing with the onset of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Skeptic that I am, my expectations for this product were not high, but after reading the positive reviews, I thought there wasn&#x27;t much to lose, given the price.  </li>
            <li>I love the organic content; those sort of \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; ingredients is what I look for in my beauty products, and it is hard to find in a retinol cream.</li>
            <li>so I obviously think very highly of this product.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t that really clear</li>
            <li>I was using retinol prescription before and worked for me, so I think I won&#x27;t be having problems with this, hoping it will help it clear</li>
            <li>help clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using this since February</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even my 6yr old son made mention that my face feels so soft.</li>
            <li>but no way near ROC.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend; as the ingredients are anti-aging and natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin prone to eczema</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t given me any irritation and my skin feels so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because i&#x27;m young (25)</li>
            <li>This cream keeps my face soft and moisturized all night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 19 years old, with brown skin, and have hyper-pigmentation scars on my face.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to all my friends and family now both young and old.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it keeps my skin moist and seems to prevent further lines.</li>
            <li>I have never experienced any irritation or dryness at all, it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li>and I still have more than half left (4 months later).</li>
            <li>There is a slight medicinal/herbal scent but it disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love it, not sure if it works because I dont have any wrinkles to begin with, but prevention is the key!</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of nightly usage, I see that my skin is more tight and wrinkles are definitely starting to fade, and that says alot as I am in my mid 50&#x27;s!.  </li>
            <li>No better than a cheap alternative.</li>
            <li>I would breakout each time I used it -- even in places I don&#x27;t normally breakout, such as under the eye.</li>
            <li>It really works and I see the result in a such short period.</li>
            <li>I never review cosmetic products because quite honestly I&#x27;ve never found that any stand out so much one from the other, BUT this face cream really is something special.</li>
            <li>Most retinol products have either been too harsh or too weak but this one is just right.  </li>
            <li>It smells like some old olive oil, not offensive, but enough to not want to use it sometimes.</li>
            <li>and WOW I am simply amazed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 28 year old male</li>
            <li>Only after a couple of uses my skin is very,very soft.</li>
            <li>skin care eperts say you should start to use anti-aging products in your early to mid 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it actually got rid of the bumps along my jawline.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this product over the others that are sold on Amazon.com because it has natural ingredients and no harmful parabens.  </li>
            <li>Because this cream is really oily, my skin didn&#x27;t get dry, irritated, or red from the retinol.</li>
            <li>This product is too good to be true and, sorry to say, a rip-off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little oily when first applied</li>
            <li>I was expecting dramatic changes, something I could really notice, but let me tell you, to me this is no better than a regular light moisturizer, I used the whole thing</li>
            <li>So far, my blemishes are healing and no new blemishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and the cream is absorbed almost instantly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend using this alone since it is very lightweight and not very moisturizing for people with dry skin like me.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do too much except add a little moisture.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Direct2U Wholesale LLC is the supplier I use, and I have always gotten great service from them.  </li>
            <li> Not that great.</li>
            <li> I was pleased and impressed with product.</li>
            <li> But hopefully time will tell that I made a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good moisture regiment that men can handle.</li>
            <li> - Good value (compared to others)    </li>
            <li> All retinoid products take months to achieve good results.</li>
            <li> Really good cream.</li>
            <li> Absorbs in and leaves my skin feeling good.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles which is good since I haven&#x27;t found any, but I think is an excellent over-the-counter retinol, antioxidant rich, nighttime moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product soaks in quick, doesn&#x27;t smell, and works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value and my skin feels really smooth!  </li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> we will get refills, for sure!</li>
            <li> This Face Cream is outstanding!</li>
            <li> but it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Not burning or irritated, just slightly warm feeling.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> The lines are softening and my face has a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> I will use the bottle up, it does hydrate my skin nicely</li>
            <li> the price is more than fair....</li>
            <li> There is no irritation and my skin is nicely moisturized but not oily..</li>
            <li> Message me if you have a wonderful new discovery.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered 5 more bottles to spread the beauty to my friends! :)</li>
            <li> Since retinol is a somewhat controversial ingredient [...]</li>
            <li> Watt&#x27;s is a great mild retinol product that softens skin and prevents most of retinols peeling affects with its moisturizing ingredients.</li>
            <li> She stated that exfoliating is very important as well.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it had better scent.</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars but I wish it contained more IUs, say 400,000.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> okay,</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products on my face and this retinol face cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a high-end lotion than a cream.</li>
            <li> It has lasted for more than 2 months.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say that my skin looked better.  </li>
            <li> Love the product and the price</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> My complexion looks more even and healthy.</li>
            <li> Its ok, I have tried many retinol creams</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably ok</li>
            <li> My skin does not feel smoother nor does it look more youthful.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I feel there should have been better directions for the use of the product.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I decided to try Retinol products.</li>
            <li> better products to use.</li>
            <li> but I think I will continue my search for a better retinol product</li>
            <li> It actually works -- and that is the best part......</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, and if more improvement follows, I will be ecstatic.  </li>
            <li> I have used so many retinol creams out there</li>
            <li> I love the Watts line, and I also partnered this up with the Hylaronic Acid / Vitamin C /L-Arginine Serum, and used these together with the argan oil.</li>
            <li> this is the next best thing.!!!</li>
            <li> I will defintitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> : I would recommend this product as a stepping stone from the 100,000 IUs to a more substantial product.</li>
            <li> You actually could see a great difference in your face soon after you apply the cream!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and was astounded at how quickly my skin looked better!  </li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The most amazing part is the way my skin feels, super smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> But, I do have a smile line, and it doesn&#x27;t do anything for that, but my skin feels amazing upon usage.</li>
            <li> I really believe it is a good product.</li>
            <li> This product is as effective as high end products which cost 5 times more.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s with combo skin and this works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> I used it at night only, as advised, and I wake up with smooth beautiful feeling skin.</li>
            <li> Although I adored the glycolic product I was using previously, my skin was very happy when I switched to this product.</li>
            <li> I have fine lines around my eyes and there has been no improvement.</li>
            <li> Seem&#x27;s fine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is somewhat of a light moisturizer, so</li>
            <li> Nice product because it gentle.</li>
            <li> It works just as a light moisturizer but not for wrinkles or brightening of skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and supple on the parts that didn&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li> This feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> and my face has never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> I used this at night and woke up with smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> and I do a light chemical peel once a month</li>
            <li> I do use a skin buffer each with a light cleanser before bed time</li>
            <li> (exposure to air or light reduces effectiveness)  </li>
            <li> Just purchased this item and so far so good.</li>
            <li> There are so many retinol products on the market that are out of sight as far as price and not as effective.</li>
            <li> After a lot of research, I chose it because:  - Good concentration of retinol (many others are too low)  </li>
            <li> Not as strong as I hoped, but it is still a good basic retinol face cream.</li>
            <li> it is down right awesome...</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t rate the effects it has on my skin, but the quality and amount of product you get is definitely worth trying it!</li>
            <li> Worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> It did not harm, but it didn&#x27;t do anything special either.  </li>
            <li> really works better than any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Most stuff off the internet doesn&#x27;t work, but this really works well.  </li>
            <li> Its good to use only 2 days a week</li>
            <li> I am in my mid forties, have oily/congested skin prone to breakouts, and am fair complected.</li>
            <li> Even with Retin-A or Tretinoin, the insert says optimum results take 6 months to a year, only to use retinoids at night, and always use sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li> I like this product because of all the natural ingredients and feels really nice.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously the best</li>
            <li> Having dished out oodles of money on beauty, I LOVE LOVE that this product is a utter bargain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll last years and actually does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: although I did have some very mild peeling and flaking with this product, I decided to try the real deal (Tretinoin .025)to</li>
            <li> Pretty much any kind of blemish that normally comes along has not!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on wrinkles as I don&#x27;t have fine lines (thanks to God).</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients as I buy natural products.</li>
            <li> but because it&#x27;s as effective as medical grade age fighting/wrinkle erasing products.</li>
            <li> But it felt smooth upon application, so just as a simple moisturiser and then sunscreen on top maybe.</li>
            <li> Once again, I have found success.  </li>
            <li> Every morning I wake up with fresh and glowing skin.</li>
            <li> Very rarely have I encountered a product that produces visible and real results on my skin, but Watts Beauty Retinol Face Cream delivers.  </li>
            <li> maybe because of the oils in the ingredients - even though most of it are all natural - it clogged my pores more and I started to have major break outs.</li>
            <li> Before that I happily used Shiseido Bioperformance and other high end department store brands (Le Mer and Cle de Peau).</li>
            <li> I also seem to have less breakouts starting since I  have started using this in just a week - awesome...</li>
            <li> The ingredient list has ingredients that nourish my skin (hemp, grape seed oil) and enough retinol to help my skin start looking more radiant and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I use this at night, doesn&#x27;t make my face peel, my skin feels very soft and smooth from usage</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know what really happened other than have a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> some of the organic ingredients might break me out, but instead I was left with plump and glow-y skin:)  </li>
            <li> but it gets absorbed fast.</li>
            <li> whenever I finally get to the bottom of the bottle :)</li>
            <li> I did a skin test the first night I got it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find the first one.</li>
            <li> I have bought everything from paintball guns to vinyl on Amazon and this is the first review I have written</li>
            <li> When I use it, I notice an immediate difference in the morning because I wake up to glowing, clear, and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> so I went back for more  .</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a daily moisturizer with spf during the day because the retinol/vitamin A tends to make your skin sensitive to light.</li>
            <li> I read the ingredients, and sure enough Watts contains coconut oil, which is a well-known comedogenic.</li>
            <li> : When I first began to use it,  product seemed a wee bit grainy.</li>
            <li> My first review was deleted by the seller.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it magically makes me look 10 years younger, but no cream on earth does!</li>
            <li> and I got very mild, barely noticeable sensation when I put on my face.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything except it made my skin oily and break a lot, and I am not young :)</li>
            <li> It has natural ingredients and not bad for the price, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But, I liked how it was made from 80% organic ingedients and I have heard how much retinol can help with many different skin problems ranging from acne, wrinkles, and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> so I kept it even though it looked kind of odd.</li>
            <li> I have post acne blemishes and a variety of large pores and oily skin and it hasn&#x27;t improved one issue.</li>
            <li> Large pores diminished after about a week of using twice a day.</li>
            <li> and everything was fine the next day,</li>
            <li> works like a million for big pores and fine wrinkles</li>
            <li> This lotion came with the top 1/8 th of the bottle empty but the pump did not look like it was used</li>
            <li> So I stopped using it, and got the real Retin-A from my Derm.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the fact that it didn&#x27;t mention how much % of retinol on this product.</li>
            <li> The 80% organic products is a real plus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and I&#x27;ve put it all over my face (even around eyes).</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and nothing changed.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I have also used prescriptions like Retin-A and having experience it, this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> but i did not notice much of a difference in skin texture or pore size.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really do like purchasing them for Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Watts Beauty Retinol Face Cream 150,000 IU per oz.</li>
            <li> Having been using this for over a month now, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve noticed any changes.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t have really problematic skin</li>
            <li> I also liked how the bottle came in a green tinted pump bottle to protect the retinol from unneccesary sun exposure</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry but totally kills pimples and minimizes blemish - almost like magic overnight!  </li>
            <li> I switched back to my tried and true retinol brand and immediately began peeling and had to start the process all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some products contain a small % and work effectively</li>
            <li> my skin looks like new!</li>
            <li> I notices Roc was better making my skin less blotchy and smoother compared to this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent lotion, but not an anti aging product.  </li>
            <li> my acne has been steadily improving.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a retinol cream that is high in antioxidants and NOT tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone over 30.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I had my expectations set too high.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many lotions, potions and other things to help my 40 year old skin, I have sun damage showing up with a vengeance.  </li>
            <li> I will have to give it a rest during the week I do my chemical peels...as I believe it will be to much, but so far I have not had any redness or flaking....</li>
            <li> (although, I&#x27;m not really sure how much 150000iu of retinol is, since most labels identify it as a %).</li>
            <li> I have had very mild peeling with this product, enough to show it&#x27;s working but not enough to hamper make-up application.  </li>
            <li> I used the Hylaronic acid serum with Vitamin C right after my cleanser, followed by the argan oil to seal it in, then I used this Retinol cream as my night time moisturizer last.</li>
            <li> The seller sent it out quickly, didn&#x27;t have to wait long at all.  </li>
            <li> I bought Watts retinol cream a couple weeks ago and at first I did like that it did not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Its always a &amp;#34;hit and miss&amp;#34; trying new products</li>
            <li> Only using it at night and wake up with really smooth skin and pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> Secondly, you don&#x27;t need to use very much.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was not sure about getting this -</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Overall, very please and will buy again!</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to see if it helps diminish fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Third, I am noticing a difference in skin texture that is similar to what I felt after a blue light treatment (intense peel).  </li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning and my skin is new skin soft...</li>
            <li> As a 31 year old male, I bought this as my first cream for dealing with the onset of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Skeptic that I am, my expectations for this product were not high, but after reading the positive reviews, I thought there wasn&#x27;t much to lose, given the price.  </li>
            <li> I love the organic content; those sort of \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; ingredients is what I look for in my beauty products, and it is hard to find in a retinol cream.</li>
            <li> so I obviously think very highly of this product.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t that really clear</li>
            <li> I was using retinol prescription before and worked for me, so I think I won&#x27;t be having problems with this, hoping it will help it clear</li>
            <li> help clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this since February</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Even my 6yr old son made mention that my face feels so soft.</li>
            <li> but no way near ROC.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend; as the ingredients are anti-aging and natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin prone to eczema</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t given me any irritation and my skin feels so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because i&#x27;m young (25)</li>
            <li> This cream keeps my face soft and moisturized all night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 years old, with brown skin, and have hyper-pigmentation scars on my face.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all my friends and family now both young and old.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it keeps my skin moist and seems to prevent further lines.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced any irritation or dryness at all, it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li> and I still have more than half left (4 months later).</li>
            <li> There is a slight medicinal/herbal scent but it disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> Love it, not sure if it works because I dont have any wrinkles to begin with, but prevention is the key!</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of nightly usage, I see that my skin is more tight and wrinkles are definitely starting to fade, and that says alot as I am in my mid 50&#x27;s!.  </li>
            <li> No better than a cheap alternative.</li>
            <li> I would breakout each time I used it -- even in places I don&#x27;t normally breakout, such as under the eye.</li>
            <li> It really works and I see the result in a such short period.</li>
            <li> I never review cosmetic products because quite honestly I&#x27;ve never found that any stand out so much one from the other, BUT this face cream really is something special.</li>
            <li> Most retinol products have either been too harsh or too weak but this one is just right.  </li>
            <li> It smells like some old olive oil, not offensive, but enough to not want to use it sometimes.</li>
            <li> and WOW I am simply amazed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 28 year old male</li>
            <li> Only after a couple of uses my skin is very,very soft.</li>
            <li> skin care eperts say you should start to use anti-aging products in your early to mid 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it actually got rid of the bumps along my jawline.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product over the others that are sold on Amazon.com because it has natural ingredients and no harmful parabens.  </li>
            <li> Because this cream is really oily, my skin didn&#x27;t get dry, irritated, or red from the retinol.</li>
            <li> This product is too good to be true and, sorry to say, a rip-off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little oily when first applied</li>
            <li> I was expecting dramatic changes, something I could really notice, but let me tell you, to me this is no better than a regular light moisturizer, I used the whole thing</li>
            <li> So far, my blemishes are healing and no new blemishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the cream is absorbed almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using this alone since it is very lightweight and not very moisturizing for people with dry skin like me.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do too much except add a little moisture.  </li>
            <li> I have other products that I like as far as moisturizing, etc.  </li>
            <li> I only bought this because I was unable to purchase the usual Life-Flo Retinol A 1% Advanced Revitalization Cream product that I usually use; it&#x27;s only available in a three pack currently.  </li>
            <li> if you have extremely dry skin, maybe add this to your current beauty routine.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use as a daily facial cream until it runs out however will not purchase again due to the lack of change for my skin.</li>
            <li> Since I started to really take care of my skin in my late teens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , dont feel anything upon application, dont see a lot of difference to my skin even upon completion of whole bottle, or at least for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have medium skin, not sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with this product as long as they continue making it.</li>
            <li> If you have rough skin you definitely want to give this a try</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like how the pump was very difficult to use during last 1/4 of bottle (would require many pumps to emit anything).    </li>
            <li> I find the lotion in this product to be too thick, requiring me to use too much product to cover my face, and interfering with the application of anything else that I might want to use.  </li>
            <li> , my face is not as oily and seems to feel less irritated, its only been a lil over a month so only time will tell.</li>
            <li> so I sometimes dilute it with a cream and alternate using it on every other night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve resorted to using the product as a basic moisturizer for areas other than my face.</li>
            <li> I have used retinols in the past that did cause a slight sting after foirst feww applications which I was expecting from this having such a high concentrtion</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any peeling or severe dry spots or anything like that.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of daily use, I came to the realization that I was just putting plain, regular lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 yrs old with little to no wrinkles but creepiness and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I see a little improvement in wrinkles and I seem to have slightly smaller pores</li>
            <li> When I use it at night, the next morning my face feels well moisterized and the retinol helps remove some dead skin.</li>
            <li> I waited a few days and tried again with the same results.  </li>
            <li> I tried four times, with wait time for the pink to disappear and have decided it is not for me.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave this four out of five stars is because the bottle was probably filled only a little over half of the way :(</li>
            <li> This product is light weight and moisturizing, and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Other than that, nothing else...</li>
            <li> I received this product the other day.</li>
            <li> put this retinol cream on last night after my usual face care routine and today I see immediate results.</li>
            <li> It arrived within 5 days and I began using it every-other night for the 1st 3 weeks, with the Watt&#x27;s cream on the other nights.</li>
            <li> My skin tone became extremely even</li>
            <li> I was very pink.  </li>
            <li> I am very careful with my  skin on my face.</li>
            <li> The claim of 1.5% retinol fell short, at least its effects are less than other products containing 0.25% retinol like ROC.</li>
            <li> Not worth the risk if the results are unclear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve use the vitamin c brightener before hand and my pores have shrunk and blemishes have faded slightly before my use of watts</li>
            <li> It has made my skin seem smoother, less porous, blemishes heal faster and my skin just looks noticeably healthier all-round.</li>
            <li> recommend this Retinol cream for improving your skin and getting away with using less makeup.</li>
            <li> Out of all the artificial and natural products I&#x27;ve tried, I finally got results to repair what years of acne had been doing to my skin.</li>
            <li> I am tight on cash this month and desired to try to find a cream on Amazon and my research ended with this one by Watts Beauty....</li>
            <li> Use it at night, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and has little smell if any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for two weeks, no significant results.  </li>
            <li> I prefer retinol gel as opposed to this cream as i find it leaves the skin a little oily and glossy.</li>
            <li> No significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 months and have about 1/3 of the bottle left--very little is needed.</li>
            <li> so I was a little reluctant to try this product thinking it would be to harsh.</li>
            <li> and I still have a few blemishes.</li>
            <li> After a recent protracted illness and surgery, I noticed my skin looked tired and lackluster.  </li>
            <li> but it maybe because I use the buff everyday when washing my face.</li>
            <li> A few squirts onto a hand</li>
            <li> I had trouble with the product too.</li>
            <li> But after a few uses i noticed my pores getting clogged.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, I noticed a change in my skin&#x27;s texture: it was smoother, softer and clearer.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used the product for a few months, I still cannot see a difference.  </li>
            <li> Also, this product feels sticky and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of stickiness.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for other people just not for me.</li>
            <li> The 2 oz size seemed small,but you need very little.</li>
            <li> I also like that this has made the small wrinkles around my eyes go away.</li>
            <li> Over the past three day my face feels a lot smoother</li>
            <li> and I have had fillers and Botox treatments in the past.</li>
            <li> Although it was difficult to compare results scientifically, my overall conclusion is that the difference was unclear.    </li>
            <li> fewer than usual)</li>
            <li> Even if no more improvement follows, I will STILL re-purchase, as it has already improved my skin&#x27;s appearance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to balance product quality with price point in the world of beauty at times, but this does it well.</li>
            <li> Definetely works as a moisturizer but not as a retinol cream, it has very little retinol or its effects are very weak.</li>
            <li> I would estimate the improvement to be about 50% after using Watts Beauty Retinol Face Cream for approximately three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a retin A user and this is a very weak substitute.</li>
            <li> So I purchased an expensive Skin Medica Retinol and used it for two month....</li>
            <li> was not impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> , it was so expensive I wanted to find an alternative</li>
            <li> As i&#x27;m learning this secret world of eye and sky care i have found that retinol is the BOMB!!</li>
            <li> repairing themselves, crazy!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been searching for a retinol cream that is high in antioxidants and NOT tested on animals.  I found it here!  I was nervous some of the organic ingredients might break me out, but instead I was left with plump and glow-y skin:)  I only purchased the 2 oz this time, but definitely will purchase the 4 oz next time.  It is somewhat of a light moisturizer, so if you have extremely dry skin, maybe add this to your current beauty routine.  It&#x27;s a great value and my skin feels really smooth!  There is a slight medicinal/herbal scent but it disappears quickly.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know enough about retinol products to judge its efficiency but I like this as a night cream option. It&#x27;s a little oily when first applied but it gets absorbed fast. I have medium skin, not sensitive and I got very mild, barely noticeable sensation when I put on my face. Not burning or irritated, just slightly warm feeling. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it had better scent. It smells like some old olive oil, not offensive, but enough to not want to use it sometimes.</li>
            <li> This product soaks in quick, doesn&#x27;t smell, and works great! I use it for acne and wrinkle prevention. My acne is well managed and I only get one or two zits around my period now. I also like that this has made the small wrinkles around my eyes go away. So far I&#x27;ve been using this since February (I bought the 2 oz. bottle) and I still have more than half left (4 months later). I use it nightly on my face, neck, and chest. I will be buying this again...whenever I finally get to the bottom of the bottle :)</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars but I wish it contained more IUs, say 400,000. I buy this product over others because it contains no parabens. Use it at night, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and has little smell if any. I&#x27;m 39 and have some lines which after using this product I can actually see the creases filling in/ repairing themselves, crazy! Wish I would have started using retinol at a much younger age.</li>
            <li> I can not notice any difference, and I have been using it over a month.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 days now and WOW I am simply amazed. I have sensitive skin so I was a little reluctant to try this product thinking it would be to harsh. I did a skin test the first night I got it and everything was fine the next day, that night I used it over my entire face and almost immediately I could feel the difference. Over the past three day my face feels a lot smoother and I can see discoloration lightening. The most amazing part is the way my skin feels, super smooth and supple. Even my 6yr old son made mention that my face feels so soft. I love it, I am going to order a second bottle just to keep it on hand in case I can&#x27;t find the first one. Going to order some for my mom also.</li>
            <li> okay, but no way near ROC.  will keep for backup</li>
            <li> Nice product because it gentle. I&#x27;m not blown away that&#x27;s for sure.  But hopefully time will tell that I made a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  I am happy with it.  Will do a reorder.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was not sure about getting this - but it is amazing. I use it two or three times a week and every time I do I wake up and my skin looks like new! Tightens pores and eliminates redness; I use it over some argan oil and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This lotion came with the top 1/8 th of the bottle empty but the pump did not look like it was used so I kept it even though it looked kind of odd. I have nit seen any difference in my skin after 2-3 weeks of use so I cannot recommend it. It works just as a light moisturizer but not for wrinkles or brightening of skin.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this item and so far so good. My skin is starting to peel so we shall see how it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some OTC Retinol, and after reading the reviews here, I decided to get this one. It has natural ingredients and not bad for the price, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin. Even I go regularly to have my facial. My skin isn&#x27;t that really clear and I still have a few blemishes. I was using retinol prescription before and worked for me, so I think I won&#x27;t be having problems with this, hoping it will help it clear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only like this product because it&#x27;s moisturizing and I like that it has a pump. Other than that, nothing else...maybe because of the oils in the ingredients - even though most of it are all natural - it clogged my pores more and I started to have major break outs. My skin feels smooth and supple on the parts that didn&#x27;t break out. This is the only product that I added to my regimen, so I know this is the cause. So I stopped using it, and got the real Retin-A from my Derm. So far, my blemishes are healing and no new blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you don&#x27;t have acneic-skin, it MIGHT work and this will definitely help in keeping your face moisturized. I also don&#x27;t like the fact that it didn&#x27;t mention how much % of retinol on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month and have used it faithfully every night.  Wow!  The texture of my skin is noticeably softer and smoother.  My pores seem to be smaller.  I&#x27;ve used so many products on my face and this retinol face cream really works better than any I&#x27;ve used. The 80% organic products is a real plus. I have melasma and believe this has lightened it.  I will continue to use this cream on my face and neck.  I love the price!  There are so many retinol products on the market that are out of sight as far as price and not as effective.</li>
            <li> Received this item on time and the price was great. This feels so smooth. It&#x27;s more like a high-end lotion than a cream. It&#x27;s gentle and I&#x27;ve put it all over my face (even around eyes). I also put it on my hands at night. It has lasted for more than 2 months. I would recommend; as the ingredients are anti-aging and natural. I am in my 30&#x27;s with combo skin and this works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Because this cream is really oily, my skin didn&#x27;t get dry, irritated, or red from the retinol. Even though the cream is oily, it didn&#x27;t cause any pimple/breakout...and I have acne proned and oily skin! The oily cream helps \\&quot;balance\\&quot; the strenght of the retinol, I think. When I use it at night, the next morning my face feels well moisterized and the retinol helps remove some dead skin. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome. I love the ingredients as I buy natural products. When I put this on my face I instantly look and feel hydrated. I use this on my decollete and the back of my hands too. I will be incorporating this product into my daily facial routine. I highly recommend this product for anyone over 30. The quality of the products and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and nothing changed.  It did not harm, but it didn&#x27;t do anything special either.  I wish I could say that my skin looked better.  I continue to try different products, looking for a miracle in a bottle, but nothing beats Oil of Olay every day.  Message me if you have a wonderful new discovery.  I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
            <li> I received this product the other day. I&#x27;m a 28 year old male and I have to say I have been using this Watts Retinol face cream and my face has never felt so smooth. I use it every night and it does wonders for my skin. I&#x27;ll stick with this product as long as they continue making it. This is the real deal. I have bought everything from paintball guns to vinyl on Amazon and this is the first review I have written so I obviously think very highly of this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many lotions, potions and other things to help my 40 year old skin, I have sun damage showing up with a vengeance.  Most retinol products have either been too harsh or too weak but this one is just right.  The ingredient list has ingredients that nourish my skin (hemp, grape seed oil) and enough retinol to help my skin start looking more radiant and fresh.  I have had very mild peeling with this product, enough to show it&#x27;s working but not enough to hamper make-up application.  Love the product and the price, this will be on my must have list for face care.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product yet so I can&#x27;t rate the effects it has on my skin, but the quality and amount of product you get is definitely worth trying it!</li>
            <li> I really believe it is a good product. I used it at night only, as advised, and I wake up with smooth beautiful feeling skin. I can&#x27;t comment on wrinkles as I don&#x27;t have fine lines (thanks to God). But, I do have a smile line, and it doesn&#x27;t do anything for that, but my skin feels amazing upon usage. I noticed that day one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my low 20&#x27;s but I like to use retinol for targeted issues. I like this one because it comes in a pump rather than a jar. I love the organic content; those sort of \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; ingredients is what I look for in my beauty products, and it is hard to find in a retinol cream.</li>
            <li> I like this Watts Retinol Face Cream. Only after a couple of uses my skin is very,very soft. I see a change in the texture. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results with continued use. I&#x27;m 54 yrs old with little to no wrinkles but creepiness and dark circles under my eyes. This seems to be helping that too!!</li>
            <li> I am a long-time user of retinol products. I try different things every one in a while, and because of the price I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. After about two weeks of daily use, I came to the realization that I was just putting plain, regular lotion on my face. I switched back to my tried and true retinol brand and immediately began peeling and had to start the process all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely do not recommend. This product is too good to be true and, sorry to say, a rip-off.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product not just for it&#x27;s price but because it&#x27;s as effective as medical grade age fighting/wrinkle erasing products. I don&#x27;t recommend using this alone since it is very lightweight and not very moisturizing for people with dry skin like me.  Instead, use it at night in conjunction with with your skin care (toner, eye cream, and night cream). When I use it, I notice an immediate difference in the morning because I wake up to glowing, clear, and smooth skin. I have sensitive skin prone to eczema so I sometimes dilute it with a cream and alternate using it on every other night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Currently I use dermatologist sold products such as Neocutis Lumiere eye cream and Vivate serum and night cream. Before that I happily used Shiseido Bioperformance and other high end department store brands (Le Mer and Cle de Peau). I have also used prescriptions like Retin-A and having experience it, this is the real deal.  Having dished out oodles of money on beauty, I LOVE LOVE that this product is a utter bargain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent lotion, but not an anti aging product.  I&#x27;ve been using for two weeks, no significant results.  The lotion will soften, regular lotions do though.</li>
            <li> This is truly great product.  I love it.  It works!  Most stuff off the internet doesn&#x27;t work, but this really works well.  I would recommed it to all.</li>
            <li> I use this at night, doesn&#x27;t make my face peel, my skin feels very soft and smooth from usage and I really like the pump it comes in, dispenses what I need without waste.  The seller sent it out quickly, didn&#x27;t have to wait long at all.  I will definitely be a repeat user, I like this product a lot</li>
            <li> I received this promptly, the customer service is excellent, and I love the product!  I am already seeing improvement in brown spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I used this at night and woke up with smooth skin.  However, looking in the mirror I was very pink.  I waited a few days and tried again with the same results.  I tried four times, with wait time for the pink to disappear and have decided it is not for me.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this lotion! Only using it at night and wake up with really smooth skin and pores look smaller. I have been using it for about a 2 weeks and feel that skins overall texture and appearance has improved. I wish I could use it during the day too, but worried about the sun sensitivity from the Retinol (although, I&#x27;m not really sure how much 150000iu of retinol is, since most labels identify it as a %). Overall, very please and will buy again!</li>
            <li> I was expecting dramatic changes, something I could really notice, but let me tell you, to me this is no better than a regular light moisturizer, I used the whole thing and I don&#x27;t know what really happened other than have a good moisturizer. All those 5 stars reviews I&#x27;ve been reading about this product, I don&#x27;t share the same thinking.</li>
            <li> I was skepitcal at first about buying such a small bottle for almost 15$. But, I liked how it was made from 80% organic ingedients and I have heard how much retinol can help with many different skin problems ranging from acne, wrinkles, and uneven skin tone. I also liked how the bottle came in a green tinted pump bottle to protect the retinol from unneccesary sun exposure (Vitamin A is photosensitive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this retinol cream on last night after my usual face care routine and today I see immediate results. I&#x27;m 23(and I look about 5 years younger than my age) Since I started to really take care of my skin in my late teens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many skin care eperts say you should start to use anti-aging products in your early to mid 20&#x27;s. It hasn&#x27;t given me any irritation and my skin feels so soft and supple. My complexion looks more even and healthy. I will continue to use this cream I think it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this four out of five stars is because the bottle was probably filled only a little over half of the way :(</li>
            <li> After a recent protracted illness and surgery, I noticed my skin looked tired and lackluster.  I had been dealing with cystic outbreaks along my jawline for months. The bumps were quieted with a mixture of sulfur and salicytic acid, but I needed to improve the texture and tone of my skin.  I bought this product and was astounded at how quickly my skin looked better!  I was surprised that it actually got rid of the bumps along my jawline.  I use this with the hyaluronic serum and emu oil from this seller, and I add a salicytic acid/sulfur cream only on specific breakouts.  Although I adored the glycolic product I was using previously, my skin was very happy when I switched to this product.</li>
            <li> Its ok, I have tried many retinol creams, dont feel anything upon application, dont see a lot of difference to my skin even upon completion of whole bottle, or at least for my skin. Will not rebuy again. But it felt smooth upon application, so just as a simple moisturiser and then sunscreen on top maybe. Concentration just too low for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably ok but I really only want my retinol product to do only that one thing.  I have other products that I like as far as moisturizing, etc.  I find the lotion in this product to be too thick, requiring me to use too much product to cover my face, and interfering with the application of anything else that I might want to use.  It also seems to interfere with the action of the product, because I never really noticed a difference.  I only bought this because I was unable to purchase the usual Life-Flo Retinol A 1% Advanced Revitalization Cream product that I usually use; it&#x27;s only available in a three pack currently.  Next time I&#x27;ll just get the three pack of Life-Flo.  It&#x27;ll last years and actually does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> I am very careful with my  skin on my face. I am 46 and have some sun damage, which I am trying to correct and I do a light chemical peel once a month and I have had fillers and Botox treatments in the past. My Dr. Told me to not spend a lot of money on OTC products as nothing is a miracle worker and the only items the you must use is a cleanser, toner, retinol cream and sunscreen. She stated that exfoliating is very important as well. So I purchased an expensive Skin Medica Retinol and used it for two month....was not impressed with the results. I am tight on cash this month and desired to try to find a cream on Amazon and my research ended with this one by Watts Beauty....well I must say I am very happy with this Cream....it is down right awesome...I do use a skin buffer each with a light cleanser before bed time, I use a toner then rub about two pumps of this cream on my face. I wake up in the morning and my skin is new skin soft...I think I found a cream that actually does what a retinol cream is suppose to do. I will have to give it a rest during the week I do my chemical peels...as I believe it will be to much, but so far I have not had any redness or flaking....but it maybe because I use the buff everyday when washing my face.</li>
            <li> As i&#x27;m learning this secret world of eye and sky care i have found that retinol is the BOMB!! Some products contain a small % and work effectively but this has 150.000 IU per Oz and that is great. Don&#x27;t go for products containing SPF as it may neutralize the strength of the product.  I prefer retinol gel as opposed to this cream as i find it leaves the skin a little oily and glossy. Whatever!! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and my skin looks great in the morning. Go on......at this price?..........buy it already!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because i&#x27;m young (25) or what but i did not notice much of a difference in skin texture or pore size.&lt;br /&gt;I do use this cream as a daily moisturizer in addition to a vitamin c skin brightener and have yet to notice anything spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve use the vitamin c brightener before hand and my pores have shrunk and blemishes have faded slightly before my use of watts i&#x27;m an AA woman by the way. When i started using the watts no change has occurred. My skin does not feel smoother nor does it look more youthful. I have post acne blemishes and a variety of large pores and oily skin and it hasn&#x27;t improved one issue. Will continue to use as a daily facial cream until it runs out however will not purchase again due to the lack of change for my skin. The only pro is that it does not break you out or cause any additional issues for your face.</li>
            <li> Best to use a cream in a jar</li>
            <li> have been using this in combo with watts hydro. acid. Results...best feeling skin I have ever had. If you have rough skin you definitely want to give this a try</li>
            <li> The lines are softening and my face has a nice glow.  I use it at night so it works while I sleep.  Thank you</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple of months - not religiously every night like I should be - I&#x27;m convinced that it&#x27;s a very good product.  For one, it has a rather neutral smell and I don&#x27;t like anything perfumy on my skin. Almost every skin product I&#x27;ve ever tried has some sort of feminine smell which I don&#x27;t want on my face. Secondly, you don&#x27;t need to use very much.  A few squirts onto a hand and you can do your entire face. The 2 oz size seemed small,but you need very little. Third, I am noticing a difference in skin texture that is similar to what I felt after a blue light treatment (intense peel).  This seems to be a good moisture regiment that men can handle.</li>
            <li> works like a million for big pores and fine wrinkles</li>
            <li> I never review cosmetic products because quite honestly I&#x27;ve never found that any stand out so much one from the other, BUT this face cream really is something special. It has made my skin seem smoother, less porous, blemishes heal faster and my skin just looks noticeably healthier all-round. LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Its good to use only 2 days a week</li>
            <li> This cream keeps my face soft and moisturized all night.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> I feel there should have been better directions for the use of the product.  I am not seeing results as yet, and have been using every night since I received it.  Which is around 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> If I could only buy one product for my skin it would be this! I wash my face, use a toner, and apply the retinal cream. It&#x27;s all I need on a day to day basis. My skin tone is improved and my pores appear smaller. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I love it. I have seen a difference in my skin so I went back for more  . Everyone should try this you will be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was pleased and impressed with product. It works well and the price point is excellent.It&#x27;s hard to balance product quality with price point in the world of beauty at times, but this does it well. Worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> As a 31 year old male, I bought this as my first cream for dealing with the onset of wrinkles.  After a lot of research, I chose it because:  - Good concentration of retinol (many others are too low)  - Opaque bottle with pump (exposure to air or light reduces effectiveness)  - Good value (compared to others)    I used it for 5 months every night around my eyes and forehead, and I took pictures before and after.  Although it was difficult to compare results scientifically, my overall conclusion is that the difference was unclear.    I also didn&#x27;t like how the pump was very difficult to use during last 1/4 of bottle (would require many pumps to emit anything).    Since retinol is a somewhat controversial ingredient [...] and this product also includes Phenoxyethanol [...], I am not planning on continuing to use the product.  Not worth the risk if the results are unclear.</li>
            <li> I received this retinol cream two weeks ago. It really works and I see the result in a such short period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I decided to try Retinol products. I really do like purchasing them for Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Watts Beauty Retinol Face Cream 150,000 IU per oz. has lightened and evened out my skin complexion&lt;br /&gt;so well that my friends are taking notice. I also use Skincare L&amp;L Cosmetics Retinol day and night cream.&lt;br /&gt;I am a African American baby-boomer woman. I have always taken care of my skin. but recent I have&lt;br /&gt;discovered better products to use. Thank you Amazon for carrying them.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Retinol cream for improving your skin and getting away with using less makeup.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with the product too. I would breakout each time I used it -- even in places I don&#x27;t normally breakout, such as under the eye.</li>
            <li> Having been using this for over a month now, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve noticed any changes. I have used retinols in the past that did cause a slight sting after foirst feww applications which I was expecting from this having such a high concentrtion but no. I will use the bottle up, it does hydrate my skin nicely but I think I will continue my search for a better retinol product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product over a month &amp; haven&#x27;t noticed any changes. I have fine lines around my eyes and there has been no improvement. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It actually works -- and that is the best part......the price is more than fair....we will get refills, for sure!</li>
            <li> Hoped to get something for neck area to reduce crepiness.  Doesn&#x27;t do too much except add a little moisture.  I&#x27;m a retin A user and this is a very weak substitute.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I hoped, but it is still a good basic retinol face cream. There is no irritation and my skin is nicely moisturized but not oily..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream as part of my nightly regime for a couple months now and I must say that my skin looks and feels great!!  Definitely recommend this product over the others that are sold on Amazon.com because it has natural ingredients and no harmful parabens.  Be sure to use a daily moisturizer with spf during the day because the retinol/vitamin A tends to make your skin sensitive to light.</li>
            <li> I bought Watts retinol cream a couple weeks ago and at first I did like that it did not dry my skin. But after a few uses i noticed my pores getting clogged. I read the ingredients, and sure enough Watts contains coconut oil, which is a well-known comedogenic. I&#x27;m tossing the rest out!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and am very pleased with the results. I am in my mid forties, have oily/congested skin prone to breakouts, and am fair complected. I have had only one pimple since I started using this product(far fewer than usual), although I still have some blackheads. My skin feels fresher and smoother. I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles which is good since I haven&#x27;t found any, but I think is an excellent over-the-counter retinol, antioxidant rich, nighttime moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: although I did have some very mild peeling and flaking with this product, I decided to try the real deal (Tretinoin .025)to help clear up my acne. I ordered the Tretinoin (generic Retin-A) here on Amazon through Benjay&#x27;s Amazon Web Store. It arrived within 5 days and I began using it every-other night for the 1st 3 weeks, with the Watt&#x27;s cream on the other nights. BIG DIFFERENCE with the drying and peelling affects, and my acne has been steadily improving. I now use the Tretinoin every night and use the Watt&#x27;s on my neck and chest. All retinoid products take months to achieve good results. Even with Retin-A or Tretinoin, the insert says optimum results take 6 months to a year, only to use retinoids at night, and always use sunscreen during the day. Watt&#x27;s is a great mild retinol product that softens skin and prevents most of retinols peeling affects with its moisturizing ingredients. Some people don&#x27;t peel at all with either retinol or Tretinoin but cellular turnover is still taking place.</li>
            <li> I see a little improvement in wrinkles and I seem to have slightly smaller pores, my face is not as oily and seems to feel less irritated, its only been a lil over a month so only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Definetely works as a moisturizer but not as a retinol cream, it has very little retinol or its effects are very weak. The claim of 1.5% retinol fell short, at least its effects are less than other products containing 0.25% retinol like ROC.</li>
            <li> Skeptic that I am, my expectations for this product were not high, but after reading the positive reviews, I thought there wasn&#x27;t much to lose, given the price.  After 2 weeks of nightly usage, I see that my skin is more tight and wrinkles are definitely starting to fade, and that says alot as I am in my mid 50&#x27;s!.  I will continue to use it, and if more improvement follows, I will be ecstatic.  Even if no more improvement follows, I will STILL re-purchase, as it has already improved my skin&#x27;s appearance.  This product is as effective as high end products which cost 5 times more.</li>
            <li> I have used so many retinol creams out there I could probably open a drugstore or sell them on ebay! However, this one is extremely different. At 41 I have begun to develop &amp;#34;mid-life&amp;#34; acne and this cream not only took care of that, but it also brightened my complexion without drying it out. My skin tone became extremely even, blemishes diminished, skin firmed, and I noticed a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that hadn&#x27;t been there since my teens. I love the Watts line, and I also partnered this up with the Hylaronic Acid / Vitamin C /L-Arginine Serum, and used these together with the argan oil. I used the Hylaronic acid serum with Vitamin C right after my cleanser, followed by the argan oil to seal it in, then I used this Retinol cream as my night time moisturizer last. Yes, it seemed like several steps, but let me tell you, it only takes a pump or two of each, and they all lasted me about 4-5 months. The end effect looks as though you stepped through a time machine!! For those of us who can&#x27;t do the Botox, fillers, etc. this is the next best thing.!!! Keep em&#x27; coming Watts!!!</li>
            <li> Very rarely have I encountered a product that produces visible and real results on my skin, but Watts Beauty Retinol Face Cream delivers.  Within a few days, I noticed a change in my skin&#x27;s texture: it was smoother, softer and clearer.  Inspired, I decided to try it on my neck and chest in the hopes that it might address years of sun damage.  Once again, I have found success.  I would estimate the improvement to be about 50% after using Watts Beauty Retinol Face Cream for approximately three weeks.  A little goes a long way and the cream is absorbed almost instantly.  I have very sensitive skin and this produces no irritation at all, which is a definite plus.  Direct2U Wholesale LLC is the supplier I use, and I have always gotten great service from them.  I will defintitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything except it made my skin oily and break a lot, and I am not young :)</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful,I recommend same to my friends,they compliment me on my skin always,Retinol face cream works please keep product.</li>
            <li> No significant difference in my skin. No better than a cheap alternative.</li>
            <li> Love it, not sure if it works because I dont have any wrinkles to begin with, but prevention is the key!</li>
            <li> I wanted to move up from the 100,000 IU Retinol cream that I was using and chose this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:  The container is colored so the Retinol content is not exposed to sun light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs: When I first began to use it,  product seemed a wee bit grainy. Maybe  it had to settle. Seem&#x27;s fine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMATION: I would recommend this product as a stepping stone from the 100,000 IUs to a more substantial product.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good. I didn&#x27;t experience any peeling or severe dry spots or anything like that. I would have given it a 5 but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to see if it helps diminish fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This Face Cream is outstanding! The cream does as what it is advertized to do! You actually could see a great difference in your face soon after you apply the cream! I&#x27;m very pleased and amazed at the results of how this cream works! I&#x27;m very glad that I purchased this product!</li>
            <li> I have only had this for one week and I can already see some difference in my face.  I am 65 this year and the wrinkles have started to multiply.  I hope this Retinol cream keeps working.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This product is light weight and moisturizing, and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor. The perfect combination of oils! I&#x27;m 19 years old, with brown skin, and have hyper-pigmentation scars on my face. Since changing my face care routine, diet, and using this product, I&#x27;ve had fewer breakouts and smoother skin, but my scars haven&#x27;t faded any. I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 months and have about 1/3 of the bottle left--very little is needed. I bought this as an alternative to using Retin-A again, a cream my doctor prescribed before which cleared my face, but had adverse effects later. It worked, just in a different way for me.</li>
            <li> I  am very happy with this product!  Large pores diminished after about a week of using twice a day. Pretty much any kind of blemish that normally comes along has not!  I like this product because of all the natural ingredients and feels really nice.  Its always a &amp;#34;hit and miss&amp;#34; trying new products and I am very happy to have found this one.  However,  I don&#x27;t see any changes with the sun spots on my face, I was hoping to have results with those too.  I would recommend Watts Retinol face cream, and will reorder.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t this be 0.15% retinol? The conversion factor is 1 IU &#x3D; 0.3 mcg of retinol. So if you do the math, percent weight by volume is 0.15% and percent weight by weight is 0.16%. Misleading.</li>
            <li> I hoped to see a difference. I used as directed, and I didn&#x27;t see a lick of a difference. No sireeeee bob.</li>
            <li> Not that great. I never finished the bottle but moved on to something else and that says it all for me. It doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for other people just not for me.</li>
            <li> Really good cream. Absorbs in and leaves my skin feeling good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Retinol before and it did wonders, it was so expensive I wanted to find an alternative, this did not compare, I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I notices Roc was better making my skin less blotchy and smoother compared to this product. Perhaps I had my expectations set too high. Also, I don&#x27;t have really problematic skin but when I use roc I can actually feel the difference. Also, this product feels sticky and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of stickiness.</li>
            <li> My first review was deleted by the seller.  Now that I&#x27;ve used the product for a few months, I still cannot see a difference.  I&#x27;ve resorted to using the product as a basic moisturizer for areas other than my face.</li>
            <li> Every morning I wake up with fresh and glowing skin. Out of all the artificial and natural products I&#x27;ve tried, I finally got results to repair what years of acne had been doing to my skin. I recommend this product to all my friends and family now both young and old. Just ordered 5 more bottles to spread the beauty to my friends! :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it magically makes me look 10 years younger, but no cream on earth does! I really like this product because it keeps my skin moist and seems to prevent further lines. I have never experienced any irritation or dryness at all, it&#x27;s a nice product and I will likely reorder when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously the best and I have tried a lot of them.  I am definitely going to buy this again!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry but totally kills pimples and minimizes blemish - almost like magic overnight!  I also seem to have less breakouts starting since I  have started using this in just a week - awesome...</li>
