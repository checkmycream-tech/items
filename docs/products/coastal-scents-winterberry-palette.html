            <li>I totally love every color in it!!</li>
            <li>Very amazingly pigmented, however they were too shiny.</li>
            <li>These have awesome pigmentation &amp; are very smooth when you swatch them.</li>
            <li>Its amazing!</li>
            <li>Nice colors !</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this pallete its perfect and the colors are pigmented but buildable and are just da bomb!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this pallet; the colors are beautiful!</li>
            <li>I loved beautiful colors and good price</li>
            <li>Great staying power with a good primer too.</li>
            <li>So I already love coastal scents products, but this palette was awesome!</li>
            <li>Gift for sister, she loved the colors, and said they were the most beautiful she has ever seen!</li>
            <li>this is a great bargain with an even better product!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re bright jewels and with a bit of imagination they can take you from work to dinner</li>
            <li>The great thing is that you&#x27;ll find great colors for all eye colors and the mirror is so huge, you&#x27;ll never need to use a hand mirror and struggle with it to see both eyes!  </li>
            <li>Pot # ME003 Bright Copper</li>
            <li>Pigmentation is great and it&#x27;s an amazing deal...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Really good brand,</li>
            <li>is you have a darker skin tone and have issues finding a good quality brand.</li>
            <li>The shadows are fairly pigmented The pots are removable, but not magnetic.</li>
            <li>but it looks really good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my fair share of disappointments buying cheaper palettes,  but given the price and the reviews</li>
            <li>and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>Remember to wear a primer underneath though, or else the staying power won&#x27;t be as good.</li>
            <li>Do buy if you are on a budget and want a really good eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>pigmented and lasts a good while</li>
            <li>i would recomend rhis palette to anyone whos looking for quality makeup at a good price</li>
            <li>Anyway I think this is a good brand.</li>
            <li>These are gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>This is just about as good.  </li>
            <li>Good products.</li>
            <li>Great pigment, nice and silky.</li>
            <li>Its good too shimmery for my taste</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just all around a good by.</li>
            <li>good range of colors</li>
            <li>They apply very easily &amp; have a great quality mirror in the palette.</li>
            <li>Well, perfect, nice, vivid and wonderful colors...</li>
            <li>The light shades are perfect for my skin and look nice on my eyes</li>
            <li>It arrived in perfect condition and quickly.</li>
            <li>so very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I am also very pleased on how it was packaged.</li>

            <li>Oh and the packaging and shipping was excellent thanks people and keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>The pigments were not as bright as I had originally thought they were going to be, and I wasn&#x27;t as happy with the colors on my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>Love this pallet!</li>

            <li>I simply love the colors!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love!</li>
            <li>The great part about this brand is that the pigment is strong and it has a balance of matte and shimmer shades.</li>
            <li>Great colors that go on easy, stay on well with primer.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still an amazing palette.</li>

            <li>Amazing colors</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift and when I got it I almost wanted to keep it because the quality was amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>The price is perfect, the Colors are amazing, and the shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li>Really nice value for the price</li>
            <li>&gt;* &amp;#34;Duh&amp;#34;  moment:  I also own Revealed 2,  </li>
            <li>I tried ordering this after trying (and loving) Coastal Scents&#x27; Go Palette.</li>
            <li>but they are good colors to have more then one color).</li>
            <li>Coastal scents makes excellent shadows that are very affordable.  </li>
            <li>Perfect shades to compliment my skin tone and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Packaged nicely</li>
            <li>but for the money it was a good buy :)</li>
            <li>These eyeshadows were really nice.</li>
            <li>My skin-tone is close to a hazelnut color and they show up nicely</li>
            <li>Gorgeous love the colors 💜</li>
            <li>And it shipped nice too.</li>
            <li>Wish Amazon had the neutral version of this pallet,  but still loving the autumn tones.</li>
            <li>Colors are nice.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li>I do not use a primer because I do not want the colors to be true,but, these are bold an beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are bold but beautiful for fall and shoes what colors go well.</li>

            <li>I bought this on a whim because the colors in this palette are so unique and looked absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Beautiful shades that are mostly very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Colors ate HOT and pigment  is great</li>
            <li>I think these colors are too bright and bold for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although most of the colors are incredible and have fabulous color payoff there are 3 colors that, unfortunately, do not measure up, IMO:</li>
            <li>Way better in person than in the pictures.</li>
            <li>I love Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li>I love these shades, they&#x27;re so pigmented.</li>
            <li>I used them without an eyeshadow primer and they wouldn&#x27;t stay more than three hours.</li>

            <li>Ok I&#x27;m lovin</li>
            <li>I bought them for more autumn colors.</li>
            <li>Thinking of ordering more.</li>
            <li>It seems there are so many &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I then take one of the colors I&#x27;ve used on the top lid and run it under my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>Love the reddish colors.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best palette from Coastal scents!!&lt;br /&gt;It contains the following colors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>--I love its texture&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>I love this collection.</li>
            <li>I love to blend colors together</li>
            <li>I love Coastal Scents products.</li>
            <li>Love that the shadows are interchangeable.</li>
            <li>It drives me nuts that they aren&#x27;t arranged in a more monochromatic way, but I can do that myself.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>In love with these colors and pigmented shades.</li>
            <li>this will help the color go on more even.</li>
            <li>makes them POP as does the 4th color on the top row.</li>
            <li>Ive seen more fallout with my sephora eyeshadows than i have with these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanna buy 5 more.</li>
            <li>I love this fall festival palette from Coastal Scents.  </li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>The colors are very rich and pigmented.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  Beautiful.</li>
            <li>just as great as any of my high end eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>COASTAL SCENTS has quickly become a favorite of mine!  </li>
            <li>Beautiful rich colors that really bring out my hazel eyes.</li>
            <li>This is the first palette that i have found that shows up so good on my mocha skin.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure to use a eye primer of course and a good flat eye shadow brush for good results.</li>
            <li>pictures opn amazon should be better to show the true colors!</li>
            <li>Each of the color&#x27;s can be removed from the palette and on the bottom there is the color written on it so if you ran out of a color that you love you can easily buy it.</li>
            <li>They go on better when used with fingers and blend out easily with brushes.</li>
            <li>The shadows apply easily with makeup brushes, and the shadows have pretty good stay-on power.  </li>
            <li>I am not blowing smoke up the behinds of Amazon Fulfillment, but, I still say, if you order something, try to make sure that it comes from Amazon Fulfillment; you will get special care, attention, and, you can get most of the stuff overnight....</li>
            <li>some of the palate colors did crumble, however I was able to smooth them over for continued use.  </li>
            <li>They are great quality, they are all really soft and satiny in texture, the colors are buildable.</li>
            <li>I tried the product and, wow, I am so happy.</li>
            <li>The palettes are also very sturdy and have a full sized mirror,  great for traveling.  </li>
            <li>The colors are a lot lighter than pictured and while they do have good pigmentation they are VERY powdery.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact , great pigmentation, and came quickly.</li>
            <li>They are rich and I love the way the pallette looks.</li>
            <li>The product fades easily</li>
            <li>And the pressed compacts powder off rather easily</li>
            <li>This palette is amazing especially for the price, It is just as good as my lorac pro palette</li>
            <li>I love how the colors pick up great and last all day!  </li>
            <li>I can go from a nude to smokey eye easily.  </li>
            <li>and I am most impressed with this palette for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The palette itself is sturdy and easily customized as well.</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors with good blendability.</li>
            <li>The colours are amazing and suits my dusky complaxion very much.</li>
            <li>These colors will especially look beautiful in the fall.  </li>
            <li>I used it the second day and the colors r beautiful but no need to pack it on just lightly</li>
            <li>The colors are fine but it was so obnoxious to use I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li>So the fallout is a minor problem, but these colors are gorgeous!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely one of my favorite palettes!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s secure when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>Was xcite to receive and happy with the overall purchase.</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow pallette is perfect for those who like earthy tones: it also has a few metallic:</li>
            <li>I love fall colors and this palette was so fun to play with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;COLORS ARE SO SMOOTH, LONGWEARING, AND RICH&lt;</li>
            <li>Light Apricot&lt;br</li>
            <li>Start with a light application and build up to your desired result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Start with a light application and build up to your desired result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous addition to any makeup arsenal and</li>
            <li>Pot # ME017 Light Apricot&lt;br /&gt;Hot</li>
            <li>is worth having :-)</li>
            <li>for beginners or advanced makeup artist.</li>
            <li>The quality is high, and the colors are very pretty!!!  </li>
            <li>The palette is very nice, the color pans can come out and you can put different ones in.</li>
            <li>The colors go on amazing and are so vibrant.</li>
            <li>these eyeshadows are amazing and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>Great value for the money, worth every penny I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous for women of color like myself who have a hard time finding eye make up shades that look good.</li>
            <li>I wish they made more complete palettes in more neutral shades.</li>
            <li>Extremely affordable and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Then take an angled eye shadow brush and gently blend, blend blend (very important step).  </li>
            <li>It made me feel that they listened to feedback and took special care.</li>
            <li>Colors are true to pic.</li>
            <li>Really, ladies, you are going to love these.</li>
            <li>Seriously I love this so much.</li>
            <li>but &amp;#34;great despite the price&amp;#34; i never order makeup online and especially didnt expect this pallette to be so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact and convenient with all the colors I love.  </li>
            <li>This is a true selling point for someone like me that has combination oily skin.</li>
            <li>Love the color choices and they compliment darker skin tones very well in my opinion.</li>
            <li>one of mine did, not bad but</li>
            <li>Not a bad palette.</li>
            <li>Colors are great quality but the only downside is if you have any dry patches on your eyelids it wil cling and make them more prominent</li>
            <li>and I am sure it would look really nice on light and dark tones.</li>
            <li>Amazing more the what I expected colors are pigmen.</li>
            <li>I was actually expecting something smaller, however this is a great size!</li>
            <li>But I quickly realized I had already purchased this palette before and returned the one I bought off Amazon.</li>
            <li>I loved the golden and red colors for night.  </li>
            <li>There are metallics and satins, a lovely group that has many different looks in it.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this brand and their eyeshadows and this is my FAVORITE palette even over my NAKED palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a lot of high end makeup products and coastal cents should get more credit.</li>
            <li>Love these colors, I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful colors, the palette is big just the right size, I will definitely buy more, I hope it also stays longer</li>
            <li>Very pretty fall colored palette.</li>
            <li>They were very pretty, but when I put them on, the for would flake under my eyes or onto my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; --Is very pigmented and easily blendable</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very pigmented and is just pretty not to mention the big mirror it comes with is great too.</li>
            <li>--It is pocket friendly and the quality is comparable to higher end products&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality--the shadows are rich and apply pretty well</li>
            <li>This palette was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Sleek matte black pallet is very nice.</li>
            <li>One word ....  WOW !!!!!</li>
            <li>easy to work with and a very large palette for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The green is great for my brown eyes too.  </li>
            <li>Having fun creating some spring looks with this pallet as well.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with pigmentation of cs palettes, just wish i got my first palette earlier.</li>
            <li>totally worth checking out.</li>
            <li>Has a nice big mirror.</li>
            <li>High quality and easily blended.</li>
            <li>Colors are highly pigmented and they blend so easy</li>
            <li>looks beautiful on black skin!!</li>
            <li>Definitely looking into the other palettes :D</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I liked pretty much all the colors.  </li>
            <li>THIS RIGHT NOW HAS TO PURCHASE THIS FOR SURE&lt;</li>
            <li>eye shadow palettes out there right now</li>
            <li>so if you ever run out of one, you can easily put a new eyeshadow in.</li>
            <li>Chamois Nude, Bright Copper, Dark Golden Olive,</li>
            <li>Hands down the best eyeshadow pallet ever purchased....would definitely purchase again...</li>
            <li>These colors are so true and very much vibrant!  </li>
            <li>but I just would love this palette so much more if it had came with an opaque matte black.</li>
            <li>Brilliant quality for the price, the mattes are definitely the weakest performing of the shadows but all the other shades make it worth it anyway.</li>
            <li>The black is not as pigmented as if hoped but the rest are good.</li>
            <li>I use this every single day, the picture kind of makes them look matte</li>
            <li>these very pretty thanks</li>
            <li>Yes, I would very much consider purchasing again.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me a little of Fashion Fair.</li>
            <li>This was my first pallet from them</li>
            <li>first I couldn&#x27;t get used to the magnet.</li>
            <li>like a copper gold, and black/gold, that really pop when combined or used alone!</li>
            <li>I love the colors, quantity and quality,  just maybe some extra adhesive to keep the container&#x27;s in place.</li>
            <li>I would definitely get more products from them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a naked palette type of girl.</li>
            <li>the colours are so much better when you actually see them, the picture does not give them justice.</li>
            <li>totally worth checking out.n texture, there isn&#x27;t much fallout in the pans.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more shawdows from this company.</li>
            <li>I first apply an eye moisturizing cream, then I apply a Lorac eye primer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing more of these palettes</li>
            <li>Much larger than I expected, the colors are beautiful and looks just like the photo.</li>
            <li>All but the first cream shade on the top left, are shimmery</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more from this brand.</li>
            <li>OF APPLICATION: goes on pretty well if you use a primer.</li>
            <li>i will definitely be ordering more of these eye shadows and palettes as well</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty palette, I have only used it few times but the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li>Building up the color is possible BUT incredibly time consuming and often results in an uneven finished result.</li>
            <li>I then choose the color I&#x27;m in the mood for and pat very gently in the crease and very outer corner of my lid.</li>
            <li>Again, anything positive I&#x27;ve posted is all dependent on the use of primer; otherwise, don&#x27;t even bother.  </li>
            <li>yes, but I honestly purchased because of how dark it looked online.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have purchased from Coastal Scents, and their eyeshadow are much more pigmented than Urban Decay (my previous favorite).</li>
            <li>The actual shadows are a bit more vibrantly coloured than in the picture, but they are still very wearable.</li>
            <li>I always use certain colors faster than others and this solves my problem.</li>
            <li>light taupey shimmery color ( shows up slightly darker than nude color), light  shimmery bronze/ brown color,</li>
            <li>Palette shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Very protected in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>I expected more of a matte tone on all shades.</li>
            <li>also really like that you can purchase these pots separately and place them in the palette.</li>
            <li>and it works very well with my skin tone</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVEEEE these colors.</li>
            <li>If you need basic eyeshadow that&#x27;s fairly cheap, give it a try.</li>
            <li>I lime this so much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shadow!  </li>
            <li>The palette itself is VERY sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li>I was looking for intense pigments that show on my mocha skin.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and the colors are very deep.</li>
            <li>i really recomend to buy it</li>
            <li>The case--it&#x27;s very sleek and substantial (interior and exterior).</li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars if the shadow didn&#x27;t fall so much off the brush.</li>
            <li>Like I had to wash my whole face and start over..</li>
            <li>the 2nd color on the top row is my ALL-TIME favorite for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>The colors are very opaque.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and heavy which I like.</li>
            <li>Small, easy to ship, but filled with choices.</li>
            <li>I was thinking of using them wet to get more vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>love the colors, the fact that they are removable and can add other colors to customize.</li>
            <li>I really love this palete as well as other</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;d buy more.</li>
            <li>I do wish the colors were as dark as this picture makes them look, but regardless, they are all still gorgeous colors, especially for Fall and Winter looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented, very shimmery.</li>
            <li>specially the blue that looks like purple</li>
            <li>It even has (In the upper right corner) a highlighting pot for the browbone!</li>
            <li>You have a basic brown and black which is always good to have</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for *very* affordably priced eye makeup for everyday wear that has really decent staying power, you really can&#x27;t beat this brand, and this palette in particular really is quite lovely.   </li>
            <li>True to picture , also currently using.  </li>
            <li>The colors are true and last hours and hours!  </li>
            <li>The colors are true and they last all day with no creasing or fading.</li>
            <li>The top left cream color is a perfect highlighter or base color.</li>
            <li>The shades are all very pretty, I just was disappointed because the picture made it seem like some of the colors were matte, which I would have liked much more than shimmer.</li>
            <li>Ok, I am back, March 3rd.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be ordering this particular palette again.</li>
            <li>there are many possible looks in this palette - from neutral to deep - and since it is flattering on anyone it is a must in any make-up junkie&#x27;s collection.</li>
            <li>Even the red that most people would think not that wearable actually is.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented and such a fun pallet to play around with.</li>
            <li>very flattering on nearly any skin tone!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are as pigmented as my high end</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to break out my high end makeup.</li>
            <li>I like that they are of high quality, comparable to the high end shadows.</li>
            <li>I can not stress enough how much primer makes all the difference in the world as far as getting the full and complete effect of how vibrant the colors in the palette are.  </li>
            <li>a few of the colors will be to dark for just an all over color for me but could be great in the crease or something else.</li>
            <li>Despite how soft they are in texture, there isn&#x27;t much fallout in the pans.</li>
            <li>and, if the colors were in the same range (i.e. brown and bronze) pretty much indistinguishable from one another.    </li>
            <li>Ok I was disappointed because I loved the colours</li>
            <li>I use this palette year round :).</li>
            <li>easy to apply and surprisingly little fall-out,  and while they won&#x27;t necessarily last 12 hours they do last a good long time without creasing or melting away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>left to right)</li>
            <li>Its my new go-to pallet from day to evening event as well as traveling.  </li>
            <li>Cherry Chocolate, Raisin Berry, New Penny,</li>
            <li>Pot # ME023 New Penny&lt;br /&gt;Hot</li>
            <li>Be very careful and don&#x27;t drop these because the shadows are so soft they crack easy</li>
            <li>The only matte in this palette, Chamois Nude, is so light and sheer</li>
            <li>I initially tried the NYX primer in white, and it made absolutely no difference; however, when I tried Coastal Scents own brand in matte, the \\&quot;wow\\&quot; effect officially kicked in.  </li>
            <li>More fall out than other shadows I have, theses are similar to the Kat Von D shadows.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t stress enough how pretty these colors are</li>
            <li>First time to try Coastal Scents and this will be the last.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I sprayed My finished look with my urban decay</li>
            <li>Major pigment!!!</li>
            <li>i love these colors, they are very pigmented and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I found them a little harder to use then MAC&#x27;s but far more consistent.</li>
            <li>This being the case, I first found the colors on application to be very flat</li>
            <li>Often when I tried to get it off my face, I would only smear it on more, ending with a mess on my face...</li>
            <li>I would say the size of each is larger than the ones you get in those large palettes.</li>
            <li>Only flaw some people might not like is that the colors are a little more pinkish on some of the tans/neutrals than the picture shows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a notorious makeup junkie, so I was really surprised by how much I like this product considering the low price.</li>
            <li>They shipped early, too.</li>
            <li>It was under my matte shadow search and the shadows are far from matte.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li>And I like you can re-purchase the shadows individually if you happen to run out of a shade you really like.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t notice any issues with fallout.  </li>
            <li>Make no mistake though, Coastal Scents eyeshadows, from what can tell, have a pretty high talc content, and therefore don&#x27;t have the same high consistency quality as MAC or other comparatively priced brands.  </li>
            <li>Most of my eyeshadows were dry and slightly powdery, though none broke in shipping.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way with anything with quality pigmentation like this:)</li>
            <li>I also love that you can lift each shadow out and put in a empty small MAC shadow palette if you dont want to carry the whole thing around.</li>
            <li>At first when I got it I was a little disappointed because the colors aren&#x27;t exactly like on the picture, but when I tried it out I fell in love with it right away!!</li>
            <li>My first Coastal Scents product and definitely will NOT be my last.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if you&#x27;re looking for a decently priced makeup palette with shimmery colors, look no further.</li>
            <li>Very very pigmented and literally lasts all day long!!!</li>
            <li># ME001 Dark Golden Olive&lt;br /&gt;Hot</li>
            <li>the colors are so pigmented u only need a little they go on so smooth and blend like a dream</li>
            <li>All of the colors are amazing except the black color, the black is supposed to be sheer</li>
            <li>I gently pat the entire upper and lower lid with the lightest color in the palette.  </li>
            <li>There is only one matte shade in the entire palette, the very light cream color in the upper left, the rest are all extremely shimmery, bordering on glittery.</li>
            <li>pigmentation and quality is like no other palette i have ever used/bought.</li>
            <li>Typically cheap eyeshadows are hard, don&#x27;t blend well and are chalky.</li>
            <li>For an even bolder and brighter look, I&#x27;ll apply NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk or MAC Paints in Bare Canvas to my lids after I apply my UD Primer Potion.</li>
            <li>For an even bolder and brighter look, I&#x27;ll apply NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk or MAC Paints in Bare Canvas to my lids after I apply my UD Primer Potion.</li>
            <li>a sturdy case with a big mirror, which can be reused&lt;br /&gt;--Has got a magnetic palette, which can be reused for other hot pots too</li>
            <li>The one thing i like about these palettes are that if you want a subtle look or a bold look you can achieve it!</li>
            <li>The other reviews are correct; the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as in the picture and you HAVE to use a primer.</li>
            <li>and there is a slight sparkle but not too much to where it is obnoxious.</li>
            <li>orangey/peachy shimmery color, shimmery coppery color, shimmery burgundy, shimmery light plum, shimmery medium brown, shimmery medium plum, shimmery olive green, shimmery bronzy color and shimmery dark gray.</li>
            <li>The colors are not as dark as they appear online but have a rich pigment and a little goes</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love Coastal Scents colors!!</li>
            <li> I totally love every color in it!!</li>
            <li> Very amazingly pigmented, however they were too shiny.</li>
            <li> These have awesome pigmentation &amp; are very smooth when you swatch them.</li>
            <li> Its amazing!</li>
            <li> Nice colors !</li>
            <li> And that price for 12 shadows and a really nicely made palette!</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette are so beautiful, great pigmentation, and are a nice size as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallete its perfect and the colors are pigmented but buildable and are just da bomb!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this pallet; the colors are beautiful!</li>
            <li> I loved beautiful colors and good price</li>
            <li> Great staying power with a good primer too.</li>
            <li> So I already love coastal scents products, but this palette was awesome!</li>
            <li> Gift for sister, she loved the colors, and said they were the most beautiful she has ever seen!</li>
            <li> this is a great bargain with an even better product!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re bright jewels and with a bit of imagination they can take you from work to dinner</li>
            <li> The great thing is that you&#x27;ll find great colors for all eye colors and the mirror is so huge, you&#x27;ll never need to use a hand mirror and struggle with it to see both eyes!  </li>
            <li> Pot # ME003 Bright Copper</li>
            <li> Pigmentation is great and it&#x27;s an amazing deal...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Really good brand,</li>
            <li> is you have a darker skin tone and have issues finding a good quality brand.</li>
            <li> The shadows are fairly pigmented The pots are removable, but not magnetic.</li>
            <li> but it looks really good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my fair share of disappointments buying cheaper palettes,  but given the price and the reviews</li>
            <li> and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> Remember to wear a primer underneath though, or else the staying power won&#x27;t be as good.</li>
            <li> Do buy if you are on a budget and want a really good eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> pigmented and lasts a good while</li>
            <li> i would recomend rhis palette to anyone whos looking for quality makeup at a good price</li>
            <li> Anyway I think this is a good brand.</li>
            <li> These are gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> This is just about as good.  </li>
            <li> Good products.</li>
            <li> Great pigment, nice and silky.</li>
            <li> Its good too shimmery for my taste</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just all around a good by.</li>
            <li> good range of colors</li>
            <li> They apply very easily &amp; have a great quality mirror in the palette.</li>
            <li> Well, perfect, nice, vivid and wonderful colors...</li>
            <li> The light shades are perfect for my skin and look nice on my eyes</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition and quickly.</li>
            <li> so very glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I am also very pleased on how it was packaged.</li>

            <li> Oh and the packaging and shipping was excellent thanks people and keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> The pigments were not as bright as I had originally thought they were going to be, and I wasn&#x27;t as happy with the colors on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> Love this pallet!</li>
            <li> I love this pallet!  </li>
            <li> The pans are $1.99 each on the Coastal Scents website so its affordable to buy more for your palette!  </li>

            <li> I simply love the colors!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love!</li>
            <li> The great part about this brand is that the pigment is strong and it has a balance of matte and shimmer shades.</li>
            <li> Great colors that go on easy, stay on well with primer.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still an amazing palette.</li>
            <li> This pallet is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing colors</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and when I got it I almost wanted to keep it because the quality was amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> The price is perfect, the Colors are amazing, and the shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li> Really nice value for the price</li>
            <li> &gt;* &amp;#34;Duh&amp;#34;  moment:  I also own Revealed 2,  </li>
            <li> I tried ordering this after trying (and loving) Coastal Scents&#x27; Go Palette.</li>
            <li> but they are good colors to have more then one color).</li>
            <li> Coastal scents makes excellent shadows that are very affordable.  </li>
            <li> Perfect shades to compliment my skin tone and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely</li>
            <li> but for the money it was a good buy :)</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows were really nice.</li>
            <li> My skin-tone is close to a hazelnut color and they show up nicely</li>
            <li> Gorgeous love the colors 💜</li>
            <li> And it shipped nice too.</li>
            <li> Wish Amazon had the neutral version of this pallet,  but still loving the autumn tones.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I do not use a primer because I do not want the colors to be true,but, these are bold an beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are bold but beautiful for fall and shoes what colors go well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors &amp; very pigmented !!😍</li>

            <li> I bought this on a whim because the colors in this palette are so unique and looked absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shades that are mostly very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Colors ate HOT and pigment  is great</li>
            <li> I think these colors are too bright and bold for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although most of the colors are incredible and have fabulous color payoff there are 3 colors that, unfortunately, do not measure up, IMO:</li>
            <li> Way better in person than in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I love Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li> I love these shades, they&#x27;re so pigmented.</li>
            <li> I used them without an eyeshadow primer and they wouldn&#x27;t stay more than three hours.</li>
            <li> I just want to start off by saying not only do i love the colors, i love that when i got it in the mail, it was packages wonderfully.</li>

            <li> If you already have most of these colors, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Maybe the eyeshadow on Coastal Scents&#x27; website would be better.</li>
            <li> Make sure to knock the excess off your brush or you will have eyeshadow all over your face.</li>

            <li> I bought them for more autumn colors.</li>
            <li> Thinking of ordering more.</li>
            <li> It seems there are so many &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I then take one of the colors I&#x27;ve used on the top lid and run it under my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> Love the reddish colors.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best palette from Coastal scents!!&lt;br /&gt;It contains the following colors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> --I love its texture&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I love this collection.</li>
            <li> I love to blend colors together</li>
            <li> I love Coastal Scents products.</li>
            <li> Love that the shadows are interchangeable.</li>
            <li> It drives me nuts that they aren&#x27;t arranged in a more monochromatic way, but I can do that myself.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> In love with these colors and pigmented shades.</li>
            <li> this will help the color go on more even.</li>
            <li> makes them POP as does the 4th color on the top row.</li>
            <li> Ive seen more fallout with my sephora eyeshadows than i have with these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanna buy 5 more.</li>
            <li> I love this fall festival palette from Coastal Scents.  </li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> The colors are very rich and pigmented.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  Beautiful.</li>
            <li> just as great as any of my high end eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> COASTAL SCENTS has quickly become a favorite of mine!  </li>
            <li> Beautiful rich colors that really bring out my hazel eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the first palette that i have found that shows up so good on my mocha skin.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure to use a eye primer of course and a good flat eye shadow brush for good results.</li>
            <li> pictures opn amazon should be better to show the true colors!</li>
            <li> Each of the color&#x27;s can be removed from the palette and on the bottom there is the color written on it so if you ran out of a color that you love you can easily buy it.</li>
            <li> They go on better when used with fingers and blend out easily with brushes.</li>
            <li> The shadows apply easily with makeup brushes, and the shadows have pretty good stay-on power.  </li>
            <li> I am not blowing smoke up the behinds of Amazon Fulfillment, but, I still say, if you order something, try to make sure that it comes from Amazon Fulfillment; you will get special care, attention, and, you can get most of the stuff overnight....</li>
            <li> some of the palate colors did crumble, however I was able to smooth them over for continued use.  </li>
            <li> They are great quality, they are all really soft and satiny in texture, the colors are buildable.</li>
            <li> I tried the product and, wow, I am so happy.</li>
            <li> The palettes are also very sturdy and have a full sized mirror,  great for traveling.  </li>
            <li> The colors are a lot lighter than pictured and while they do have good pigmentation they are VERY powdery.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact , great pigmentation, and came quickly.</li>
            <li> They are rich and I love the way the pallette looks.</li>
            <li> The product fades easily</li>
            <li> And the pressed compacts powder off rather easily</li>
            <li> This palette is amazing especially for the price, It is just as good as my lorac pro palette</li>
            <li> I love how the colors pick up great and last all day!  </li>
            <li> I can go from a nude to smokey eye easily.  </li>
            <li> and I am most impressed with this palette for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The palette itself is sturdy and easily customized as well.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors with good blendability.</li>
            <li> The colours are amazing and suits my dusky complaxion very much.</li>
            <li> These colors will especially look beautiful in the fall.  </li>
            <li> I used it the second day and the colors r beautiful but no need to pack it on just lightly</li>
            <li> The colors are fine but it was so obnoxious to use I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li> So the fallout is a minor problem, but these colors are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of my favorite palettes!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s secure when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Was xcite to receive and happy with the overall purchase.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow pallette is perfect for those who like earthy tones: it also has a few metallic:</li>
            <li> I love fall colors and this palette was so fun to play with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;COLORS ARE SO SMOOTH, LONGWEARING, AND RICH&lt;</li>
            <li> Light Apricot&lt;br</li>

            <li> Start with a light application and build up to your desired result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fabulous addition to any makeup arsenal and</li>
            <li> Pot # ME017 Light Apricot&lt;br /&gt;Hot</li>
            <li> is worth having :-)</li>
            <li> for beginners or advanced makeup artist.</li>
            <li> The quality is high, and the colors are very pretty!!!  </li>
            <li> The palette is very nice, the color pans can come out and you can put different ones in.</li>
            <li> The colors go on amazing and are so vibrant.</li>
            <li> these eyeshadows are amazing and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money, worth every penny I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous for women of color like myself who have a hard time finding eye make up shades that look good.</li>
            <li> I wish they made more complete palettes in more neutral shades.</li>
            <li> Extremely affordable and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Then take an angled eye shadow brush and gently blend, blend blend (very important step).  </li>
            <li> It made me feel that they listened to feedback and took special care.</li>
            <li> Colors are true to pic.</li>
            <li> Really, ladies, you are going to love these.</li>
            <li> Seriously I love this so much.</li>
            <li> but &amp;#34;great despite the price&amp;#34; i never order makeup online and especially didnt expect this pallette to be so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact and convenient with all the colors I love.  </li>
            <li> This is a true selling point for someone like me that has combination oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love the color choices and they compliment darker skin tones very well in my opinion.</li>
            <li> one of mine did, not bad but</li>
            <li> Not a bad palette.</li>
            <li> Colors are great quality but the only downside is if you have any dry patches on your eyelids it wil cling and make them more prominent</li>
            <li> and I am sure it would look really nice on light and dark tones.</li>
            <li> Amazing more the what I expected colors are pigmen.</li>
            <li> I was actually expecting something smaller, however this is a great size!</li>
            <li> But I quickly realized I had already purchased this palette before and returned the one I bought off Amazon.</li>
            <li> I loved the golden and red colors for night.  </li>
            <li> There are metallics and satins, a lovely group that has many different looks in it.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this brand and their eyeshadows and this is my FAVORITE palette even over my NAKED palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a lot of high end makeup products and coastal cents should get more credit.</li>
            <li> Love these colors, I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, the palette is big just the right size, I will definitely buy more, I hope it also stays longer</li>
            <li> Very pretty fall colored palette.</li>
            <li> They were very pretty, but when I put them on, the for would flake under my eyes or onto my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; --Is very pigmented and easily blendable</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very pigmented and is just pretty not to mention the big mirror it comes with is great too.</li>
            <li> --It is pocket friendly and the quality is comparable to higher end products&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality--the shadows are rich and apply pretty well</li>
            <li> This palette was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Sleek matte black pallet is very nice.</li>
            <li> One word ....  WOW !!!!!</li>
            <li> easy to work with and a very large palette for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The green is great for my brown eyes too.  </li>
            <li> Having fun creating some spring looks with this pallet as well.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with pigmentation of cs palettes, just wish i got my first palette earlier.</li>
            <li> totally worth checking out.</li>
            <li> Has a nice big mirror.</li>
            <li> High quality and easily blended.</li>
            <li> Colors are highly pigmented and they blend so easy</li>
            <li> looks beautiful on black skin!!</li>
            <li> Definitely looking into the other palettes :D</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I liked pretty much all the colors.  </li>
            <li> THIS RIGHT NOW HAS TO PURCHASE THIS FOR SURE&lt;</li>
            <li> eye shadow palettes out there right now</li>
            <li> so if you ever run out of one, you can easily put a new eyeshadow in.</li>
            <li> Chamois Nude, Bright Copper, Dark Golden Olive,</li>
            <li> Hands down the best eyeshadow pallet ever purchased....would definitely purchase again...</li>
            <li> These colors are so true and very much vibrant!  </li>
            <li> but I just would love this palette so much more if it had came with an opaque matte black.</li>
            <li> Brilliant quality for the price, the mattes are definitely the weakest performing of the shadows but all the other shades make it worth it anyway.</li>
            <li> The black is not as pigmented as if hoped but the rest are good.</li>
            <li> I use this every single day, the picture kind of makes them look matte</li>
            <li> these very pretty thanks</li>
            <li> Yes, I would very much consider purchasing again.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me a little of Fashion Fair.</li>
            <li> This was my first pallet from them</li>
            <li> first I couldn&#x27;t get used to the magnet.</li>
            <li> like a copper gold, and black/gold, that really pop when combined or used alone!</li>
            <li> I love the colors, quantity and quality,  just maybe some extra adhesive to keep the container&#x27;s in place.</li>
            <li> I would definitely get more products from them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a naked palette type of girl.</li>
            <li> the colours are so much better when you actually see them, the picture does not give them justice.</li>
            <li> totally worth checking out.n texture, there isn&#x27;t much fallout in the pans.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more shawdows from this company.</li>
            <li> I first apply an eye moisturizing cream, then I apply a Lorac eye primer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing more of these palettes</li>
            <li> Much larger than I expected, the colors are beautiful and looks just like the photo.</li>
            <li> All but the first cream shade on the top left, are shimmery</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more from this brand.</li>
            <li> OF APPLICATION: goes on pretty well if you use a primer.</li>
            <li> i will definitely be ordering more of these eye shadows and palettes as well</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty palette, I have only used it few times but the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Building up the color is possible BUT incredibly time consuming and often results in an uneven finished result.</li>
            <li> I then choose the color I&#x27;m in the mood for and pat very gently in the crease and very outer corner of my lid.</li>
            <li> Again, anything positive I&#x27;ve posted is all dependent on the use of primer; otherwise, don&#x27;t even bother.  </li>
            <li> yes, but I honestly purchased because of how dark it looked online.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have purchased from Coastal Scents, and their eyeshadow are much more pigmented than Urban Decay (my previous favorite).</li>
            <li> The actual shadows are a bit more vibrantly coloured than in the picture, but they are still very wearable.</li>
            <li> I always use certain colors faster than others and this solves my problem.</li>
            <li> light taupey shimmery color ( shows up slightly darker than nude color), light  shimmery bronze/ brown color,</li>
            <li> Palette shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Very protected in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I expected more of a matte tone on all shades.</li>
            <li> also really like that you can purchase these pots separately and place them in the palette.</li>
            <li> and it works very well with my skin tone</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVEEEE these colors.</li>
            <li> If you need basic eyeshadow that&#x27;s fairly cheap, give it a try.</li>
            <li> I lime this so much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shadow!  </li>
            <li> The palette itself is VERY sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li> I was looking for intense pigments that show on my mocha skin.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely.  </li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> They go on smoothly and the colors are very deep.</li>
            <li> i really recomend to buy it</li>
            <li> The case--it&#x27;s very sleek and substantial (interior and exterior).</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars if the shadow didn&#x27;t fall so much off the brush.</li>
            <li> Like I had to wash my whole face and start over..</li>
            <li> the 2nd color on the top row is my ALL-TIME favorite for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> The colors are very opaque.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and heavy which I like.</li>
            <li> Small, easy to ship, but filled with choices.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of using them wet to get more vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> love the colors, the fact that they are removable and can add other colors to customize.</li>
            <li> I really love this palete as well as other</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;d buy more.</li>
            <li> I do wish the colors were as dark as this picture makes them look, but regardless, they are all still gorgeous colors, especially for Fall and Winter looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented, very shimmery.</li>
            <li> specially the blue that looks like purple</li>
            <li> It even has (In the upper right corner) a highlighting pot for the browbone!</li>
            <li> You have a basic brown and black which is always good to have</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for *very* affordably priced eye makeup for everyday wear that has really decent staying power, you really can&#x27;t beat this brand, and this palette in particular really is quite lovely.   </li>
            <li> True to picture , also currently using.  </li>
            <li> The colors are true and last hours and hours!  </li>
            <li> The colors are true and they last all day with no creasing or fading.</li>
            <li> The top left cream color is a perfect highlighter or base color.</li>
            <li> The shades are all very pretty, I just was disappointed because the picture made it seem like some of the colors were matte, which I would have liked much more than shimmer.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am back, March 3rd.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be ordering this particular palette again.</li>
            <li> there are many possible looks in this palette - from neutral to deep - and since it is flattering on anyone it is a must in any make-up junkie&#x27;s collection.</li>
            <li> Even the red that most people would think not that wearable actually is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented and such a fun pallet to play around with.</li>
            <li> very flattering on nearly any skin tone!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are as pigmented as my high end</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to break out my high end makeup.</li>
            <li> I like that they are of high quality, comparable to the high end shadows.</li>
            <li> I can not stress enough how much primer makes all the difference in the world as far as getting the full and complete effect of how vibrant the colors in the palette are.  </li>
            <li> a few of the colors will be to dark for just an all over color for me but could be great in the crease or something else.</li>
            <li> Despite how soft they are in texture, there isn&#x27;t much fallout in the pans.</li>
            <li> and, if the colors were in the same range (i.e. brown and bronze) pretty much indistinguishable from one another.    </li>
            <li> Ok I was disappointed because I loved the colours</li>
            <li> I use this palette year round :).</li>
            <li> easy to apply and surprisingly little fall-out,  and while they won&#x27;t necessarily last 12 hours they do last a good long time without creasing or melting away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> left to right)</li>
            <li> Its my new go-to pallet from day to evening event as well as traveling.  </li>
            <li> Cherry Chocolate, Raisin Berry, New Penny,</li>
            <li> Pot # ME023 New Penny&lt;br /&gt;Hot</li>
            <li> Be very careful and don&#x27;t drop these because the shadows are so soft they crack easy</li>
            <li> The only matte in this palette, Chamois Nude, is so light and sheer</li>
            <li> I initially tried the NYX primer in white, and it made absolutely no difference; however, when I tried Coastal Scents own brand in matte, the \\&quot;wow\\&quot; effect officially kicked in.  </li>
            <li> More fall out than other shadows I have, theses are similar to the Kat Von D shadows.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t stress enough how pretty these colors are</li>
            <li> First time to try Coastal Scents and this will be the last.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I sprayed My finished look with my urban decay</li>
            <li> Major pigment!!!</li>
            <li> i love these colors, they are very pigmented and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I found them a little harder to use then MAC&#x27;s but far more consistent.</li>
            <li> This being the case, I first found the colors on application to be very flat</li>
            <li> Often when I tried to get it off my face, I would only smear it on more, ending with a mess on my face...</li>
            <li> I would say the size of each is larger than the ones you get in those large palettes.</li>
            <li> Only flaw some people might not like is that the colors are a little more pinkish on some of the tans/neutrals than the picture shows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a notorious makeup junkie, so I was really surprised by how much I like this product considering the low price.</li>
            <li> They shipped early, too.</li>
            <li> It was under my matte shadow search and the shadows are far from matte.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li> And I like you can re-purchase the shadows individually if you happen to run out of a shade you really like.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t notice any issues with fallout.  </li>
            <li> Make no mistake though, Coastal Scents eyeshadows, from what can tell, have a pretty high talc content, and therefore don&#x27;t have the same high consistency quality as MAC or other comparatively priced brands.  </li>
            <li> Most of my eyeshadows were dry and slightly powdery, though none broke in shipping.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with anything with quality pigmentation like this:)</li>
            <li> I also love that you can lift each shadow out and put in a empty small MAC shadow palette if you dont want to carry the whole thing around.</li>
            <li> At first when I got it I was a little disappointed because the colors aren&#x27;t exactly like on the picture, but when I tried it out I fell in love with it right away!!</li>
            <li> My first Coastal Scents product and definitely will NOT be my last.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if you&#x27;re looking for a decently priced makeup palette with shimmery colors, look no further.</li>
            <li> Very very pigmented and literally lasts all day long!!!</li>
            <li> # ME001 Dark Golden Olive&lt;br /&gt;Hot</li>
            <li> the colors are so pigmented u only need a little they go on so smooth and blend like a dream</li>
            <li> All of the colors are amazing except the black color, the black is supposed to be sheer</li>
            <li> I gently pat the entire upper and lower lid with the lightest color in the palette.  </li>
            <li> There is only one matte shade in the entire palette, the very light cream color in the upper left, the rest are all extremely shimmery, bordering on glittery.</li>
            <li> pigmentation and quality is like no other palette i have ever used/bought.</li>
            <li> Typically cheap eyeshadows are hard, don&#x27;t blend well and are chalky.</li>
            <li> For an even bolder and brighter look, I&#x27;ll apply NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk or MAC Paints in Bare Canvas to my lids after I apply my UD Primer Potion.</li>
            <li> For an even bolder and brighter look, I&#x27;ll apply NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk or MAC Paints in Bare Canvas to my lids after I apply my UD Primer Potion.</li>
            <li> a sturdy case with a big mirror, which can be reused&lt;br /&gt;--Has got a magnetic palette, which can be reused for other hot pots too</li>
            <li> The one thing i like about these palettes are that if you want a subtle look or a bold look you can achieve it!</li>
            <li> The other reviews are correct; the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as in the picture and you HAVE to use a primer.</li>
            <li> and there is a slight sparkle but not too much to where it is obnoxious.</li>
            <li> orangey/peachy shimmery color, shimmery coppery color, shimmery burgundy, shimmery light plum, shimmery medium brown, shimmery medium plum, shimmery olive green, shimmery bronzy color and shimmery dark gray.</li>
            <li> The colors are not as dark as they appear online but have a rich pigment and a little goes</li>
            <li> The colors are rich and dark so a little might go a long way.</li>
            <li> This palette does not live up to the general online Coastal Scents hype.</li>
            <li> I really love all the colors in here, Must have for those dramatic smokey eye addicts like me!</li>
            <li> Has very little fallout&lt;br /&gt;--Does not crease much on my oily eyelids&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Palette is small which I really like and the colors are pigmented</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long it would last on</li>
            <li> LONG DOES IT LAST?</li>
            <li> All their eye shadows last all day long!</li>
            <li> if I just got an old palette, but it did not live up to the expectations I had from previous purchases of Coastal Scents products.</li>
            <li> An eye primer will make any cheap eye shadow work like an expensive one.  </li>
            <li> I took so long to order them and now, I am kicking myself.</li>
            <li> I just used a pen cap and used the long piece (no idea</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The pallet lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I initially was going to give this brand the thumbs down, because I&#x27;ve used MAC eye shadows almost exclusively for years, and have personally never had to use a primer as a result.  </li>
            <li> A few of the color&#x27;s are use in more then 1 palette (white, black a few of the pink&#x27;s and a few purple&#x27;s</li>
            <li> let it dry a bit then applied the shadow..</li>
            <li> The colors are matte light nude color (doesn&#x27;t show up much) which I use as a base,</li>
            <li> The pods are also loose so use can replace them if needed.</li>
            <li> Also, FWIW, I&#x27;m a black female who&#x27;s wears an a &#x27;8&#x27; in MAC MatchMaster foundation.  </li>
            <li> You can apply them wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I had to order this same pallet twice BECAUSE they sent me the wrong pallet the first time.</li>
            <li> Granted, some are too bold for daytime or casual looks.&lt;br</li>

            <li> nothing was broken and i really appreciate the time you took in putting it together.</li>
            <li> just be careful.</li>
            <li> You know how sometimes you buy it in a case and you can only use a few.</li>
            <li> then I expected.  </li>
            <li> Think Pink.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care that it was broken (</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Kiwi Green, Deep Cantaloupe,  Regalia Purple,</li>
            <li> and they go on as expected.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have no problems with this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i want to buy the other colors too</li>
            <li> on the other eye i applied two faced eyeshadow</li>
            <li> other colors in this palette are like butter to apply and blend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have those colors in my other palettes</li>
            <li> A couple I may not use but other colors I will.</li>
            <li> The other two darker colors, Regalia Purple and Gunmetal aren&#x27;t as soft in texture as the other colors in this palette, making it very hard to pick color up with your brush.</li>
            <li> My only negative on this is the container is hard to open.  </li>
            <li> I then run a dark color eye pencil on the bottom rim of eye and again blend everything in.  </li>
            <li> I have medium skin tone, brown eyes and dark hair.  </li>
            <li> and I seriously don&#x27;t see anything different with these.</li>
            <li> the black</li>
            <li> but I already have a black one for Coastal Scents).</li>
            <li> Was expecting less quality from this brand because of the price, but was blown away with the quality and pigmentation of the shadows.</li>
            <li> : there is slight fallout with these shadows</li>
            <li> This should last me at least a few years.....and even then I can get refills!</li>
            <li> Some of the shadows are a little chalky, but don&#x27;t let that sway you.</li>
            <li> After about 8 hours, you may want to touch up a little.</li>
            <li> it was not pretty!!  </li>
            <li> I compare these shades with the MAC eyeshadows, not a cheap product what-so-ever...</li>
            <li> leaving a patchy and uneven result, even under primer.</li>
            <li> To reduce fallout on your face during application, save the fluffy brushes for targeted blending and apply color with a flatter, tighter bristled shadow brush..tap off excess and dab to apply color.</li>

            <li> colors for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;long</li>
            <li> I changed out a few color singles that I already had and made it a custom palette.</li>
            <li> I use this palette everyday.  </li>
            <li> I can fix it with some rubbing alcohol, so not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I have some what pale skin</li>
            <li> I usually apply a few layers just to make it pop.&lt;br /&gt;HOW</li>
            <li> but it really isnt bad.</li>
            <li> I am not sure</li>
            <li> The only thing that disappointed me was that it was smaller</li>
            <li> In the past I purchased mineral shadows.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what material the case is made of but it feels almost like metal.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I felt spoiled because other people have had broken pieces.....</li>
            <li> The colors are so pigmented and there is hardly any fallout.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped like CRAZY in bubble wrap, no way possible it would have came in damaged!</li>
            <li> There are a couple like the really orange one that i thought i would hate</li>
            <li> Note: When I got mine a few of the colors were broken 1</li>
            <li> The added base really allows colors to pop and aid in longevity of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The added base really allows colors to pop and aid in longevity of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These 3 colors are almost impossible to work with dry as they have very little pickup from the pan.</li>
            <li> Nothing broken.</li>
            <li> I am not happy.</li>
            <li> Quality of the powder is poor.</li>
            <li> I use nyx eyes hadow base in white and the nyx jumbo pencil in milk</li>
            <li> They are serious!  </li>
            <li> It is NOT true to the picture shown, but it isn&#x27;t a bad palette.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed by this palette because some of the shadows were so hard that I was unable to pick up the color or to even swatch them.  </li>
            <li> I promise you that you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would say to use any eye shadow base.</li>
            <li> when I tried to load the color onto my finger or a brush, it would keep spinning which was very annoying.</li>

            <li> I think coastal Scents it&#x27;s really good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Great colors. Way better in person than in the pictures.</li>
            <li> Major pigment!!! And the pots can be changed out loove!</li>
            <li> I love Coastal Scents. I use a setting spray so I don&#x27;t know how long it would last on it&#x27;s own. Colors are true to pic.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors with good blendability. I like the fact that you can remove/rearrange the shades in this palette.</li>
            <li> love the colors, the fact that they are removable and can add other colors to customize. Extremely affordable and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Palette shipped fast. The colors appear darker in the picture. They are absolutely beautiful. The one thing i like about these palettes are that if you want a subtle look or a bold look you can achieve it! I initially wanted these pallets after seeing a makeup tutorial on youtube and the one girl used coastal scents. All their eye shadows last all day long! will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Received palate in good condition,  sealed in original box.  True to picture , also currently using.  Quality of costal scents palates are great ...can be used for all your makeup needs. I did however drop the palate on a ceramic floor.  some of the palate colors did crumble, however I was able to smooth them over for continued use.  The pigments are stong and reliable .</li>
            <li> Colors are great quality but the only downside is if you have any dry patches on your eyelids it wil cling and make them more prominent but overall I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love these shades, they&#x27;re so pigmented. I used them without an eyeshadow primer and they wouldn&#x27;t stay more than three hours. I have oily skin lol but when I use my Urban Decay eyeshadow primer I have no problems.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, the palette is big just the right size, I will definitely buy more, I hope it also stays longer</li>
            <li> I just want to start off by saying not only do i love the colors, i love that when i got it in the mail, it was packages wonderfully. nothing was broken and i really appreciate the time you took in putting it together.</li>
            <li> These have awesome pigmentation &amp; are very smooth when you swatch them. They apply very easily &amp; have a great quality mirror in the palette. They shipped early, too. (: 5 stars! Beat my expectations Lol</li>
            <li> Beautiful rich colors that really bring out my hazel eyes. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this palette. I use it every day now, and I am beginning to wonder how I ever got along without it.</li>
            <li> Very nice and very impressed! !</li>
            <li> Nice colors ! Great for fall . Having fun creating some spring looks with this pallet as well.</li>
            <li> love the pigmented colors.</li>
            <li> Amazing more the what I expected colors are pigmen.</li>
            <li> The product fades easily</li>
            <li> These are beautiful. And interesting choice of colors,lots of versatility. They are great quality, they are all really soft and satiny in texture, the colors are buildable. I found them a little harder to use then MAC&#x27;s but far more consistent. And that price for 12 shadows and a really nicely made palette! UNREAL! I wish they made more complete palettes in more neutral shades. Be very careful and don&#x27;t drop these because the shadows are so soft they crack easy one of mine did, not bad but just be careful.</li>
            <li> Great colors, very chic look, just like on television. My wife was very pleased! Small, easy to ship, but filled with choices.</li>
            <li> Great color! Very pigmented and great for the prices. The pots cone off and is magnetic so it&#x27;s secure when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Gift for sister, she loved the colors, and said they were the most beautiful she has ever seen!</li>
            <li> This is the first palette that i have found that shows up so good on my mocha skin. I absolutely love these. You have to make sure to use a eye primer of course and a good flat eye shadow brush for good results. Well thats what i recommend. I will definitely be buying another palette of different colors. Really good brand, and I would definitely recommend this is you have a darker skin tone and have issues finding a good quality brand. Im sure it works even better on fair or tanned skin as well.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004A8LFJI Coastal Scents Fall Festival Palette, 8.5-Ounce]]I had this product arrive overnight. This is the best eye shadow I have ever had. It reminds me a little of Fashion Fair. It is great for a woman of color. It arrived in one perfect piece. Nothing broken. I felt spoiled because other people have had broken pieces.....It made me feel that they listened to feedback and took special care. But, it could also be postal. I heard the postal guy drop it on my patio. I freaked when I opened it, knowing it was the shadows. Well, perfect, nice, vivid and wonderful colors...I love the set. I have the fall and winterberry....I so love these. I took so long to order them and now, I am kicking myself. Coastal Scents will hear from me again. I am not blowing smoke up the behinds of Amazon Fulfillment, but, I still say, if you order something, try to make sure that it comes from Amazon Fulfillment; you will get special care, attention, and, you can get most of the stuff overnight....I love Amazon....Ok, I am back, March 3rd. I tried the product and, wow, I am so happy. You know how sometimes you buy it in a case and you can only use a few. These, in both sets, I can use them all. I do not use a primer because I do not want the colors to be true,but, these are bold an beautiful colors. I am so happy with this purchase. I love browns and beige, so,maybe I will buy more. I like the fact that the ones I chose are not shimmery. Really, ladies, you are going to love these. I promise you that you will not be disappointed. That is why I gave five stars.</li>
            <li> Seriously I love this so much. I have Mac eyeshadows and I seriously don&#x27;t see anything different with these. These are even closer to MUG eyeshadows too. These are perfect for the fall but I&#x27;m going to wear them whatever season I want. These come in an aweso magnet palette so if you ever run out of one, you can easily put a new eyeshadow in. The price is perfect, the Colors are amazing, and the shipping was fast also. Very protected in bubble wrap. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very pretty fall colored palette. The shadows are fairly pigmented The pots are removable, but not magnetic. Really nice value for the price i think</li>
            <li> I love the fall colors.</li>
            <li> All of the colors are amazing except the black color, the black is supposed to be sheer but I just would love this palette so much more if it had came with an opaque matte black.</li>
            <li> This was my first pallet from them and I love the colors. There are a couple like the really orange one that i thought i would hate but it looks really good on my skin. I was surprised that I liked pretty much all the colors.  Glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> I initially was going to give this brand the thumbs down, because I&#x27;ve used MAC eye shadows almost exclusively for years, and have personally never had to use a primer as a result.  This being the case, I first found the colors on application to be very flat and, if the colors were in the same range (i.e. brown and bronze) pretty much indistinguishable from one another.    I can not stress enough how much primer makes all the difference in the world as far as getting the full and complete effect of how vibrant the colors in the palette are.  Make no mistake though, Coastal Scents eyeshadows, from what can tell, have a pretty high talc content, and therefore don&#x27;t have the same high consistency quality as MAC or other comparatively priced brands.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for *very* affordably priced eye makeup for everyday wear that has really decent staying power, you really can&#x27;t beat this brand, and this palette in particular really is quite lovely.   Again, anything positive I&#x27;ve posted is all dependent on the use of primer; otherwise, don&#x27;t even bother.  Also, FWIW, I&#x27;m a black female who&#x27;s wears an a &#x27;8&#x27; in MAC MatchMaster foundation.  One last thing:  I initially tried the NYX primer in white, and it made absolutely no difference; however, when I tried Coastal Scents own brand in matte, the \\&quot;wow\\&quot; effect officially kicked in.  Grade: B</li>
            <li> i love it! The colors are beautiful and pigmented. More fall out than other shadows I have, theses are similar to the Kat Von D shadows. I can&#x27;t wait to order the winter berry one</li>
            <li> It was under my matte shadow search and the shadows are far from matte. I am not happy.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed by this palette because some of the shadows were so hard that I was unable to pick up the color or to even swatch them.  I am not sure if I just got an old palette, but it did not live up to the expectations I had from previous purchases of Coastal Scents products.</li>
            <li> this came packaged goo with no damage. Was xcite to receive and happy with the overall purchase. I am envied by my friends they love the colors too. thank you</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT...color, texture, application, blendability....SO HAPPY!! This is a fantastic purchase on all levels! I will definately suggest Coastal Scents..Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my fair share of disappointments buying cheaper palettes,  but given the price and the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so very glad I did.  The colours are beautiful - the photos don&#x27;t do it justice.  They&#x27;re bright jewels and with a bit of imagination they can take you from work to dinner and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply and surprisingly little fall-out,  and while they won&#x27;t necessarily last 12 hours they do last a good long time without creasing or melting away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &amp;#34;Duh&amp;#34;  moment:  I also own Revealed 2,  which is an excellent quality palette - I should have known,  shouldn&#x27;t I?  Well done,  Coastal Scents!!</li>
            <li> Very amazingly pigmented, however they were too shiny. I expected more of a matte tone on all shades. And the pressed compacts powder off rather easily so there is a lot of fallout when applied.</li>
            <li> I tried ordering this after trying (and loving) Coastal Scents&#x27; Go Palette. The colors in this palette are so beautiful, great pigmentation, and are a nice size as well. Definitely worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I couldn&#x27;t get used to the magnet. when I tried to load the color onto my finger or a brush, it would keep spinning which was very annoying. Other than that, I have no problems with this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stress enough how pretty these colors are and I got them just in time for fall!&lt;br /&gt;I also really like that you can purchase these pots separately and place them in the palette. I always use certain colors faster than others and this solves my problem. I saw them for $2 on the coastal scents website.</li>
            <li> This palette is amazing especially for the price, It is just as good as my lorac pro palette and it works very well with my skin tone and I am carmel complexion.</li>
            <li> This palette is so amazing!! Love using the apricot color all over my lid, and there are so many crease colors. This is the first product I have purchased from Coastal Scents, and their eyeshadow are much more pigmented than Urban Decay (my previous favorite).</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this purchase. I love how the colors pick up great and last all day!  Best. Ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely madly in love with this palette!! My first Coastal Scents product and definitely will NOT be my last. The colors go on amazing and are so vibrant. This will become one of my regular palette&#x27;s from now on!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallete its perfect and the colors are pigmented but buildable and are just da bomb!!!! Must BuY!!!</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow pallette is perfect for those who like earthy tones: it also has a few metallic: like a copper gold, and black/gold, that really pop when combined or used alone! It even has (In the upper right corner) a highlighting pot for the browbone! The great thing is that you&#x27;ll find great colors for all eye colors and the mirror is so huge, you&#x27;ll never need to use a hand mirror and struggle with it to see both eyes!  The color lasts all night without primer and it&#x27;s very pigmented. Definitely looking into the other palettes :D</li>
            <li> I brough this eye shadow for my daughter for xmas and she loved it.  The only thing that disappointed me was that it was smaller then I expected.  The picture is not like the compact at all.  The eye shadow quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this pallet; the colors are beautiful!</li>
            <li> First time to try Coastal Scents and this will be the last. Quality of the powder is poor. You need to use an eyeshadow primer or it will flake off during the day. Will not be buying Coastal Scents again.</li>
            <li> So the fallout is a minor problem, but these colors are gorgeous! Remember to wear a primer underneath though, or else the staying power won&#x27;t be as good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVEEEE these colors. They are rich and I love the way the pallette looks. I was actually expecting something smaller, however this is a great size! I am happy with my purchase. I am also very pleased on how it was packaged. It was wrapped like CRAZY in bubble wrap, no way possible it would have came in damaged!</li>
            <li> I love love the colors. They&#x27;re very pigmented and is just pretty not to mention the big mirror it comes with is great too. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have some what pale skin a few of the colors will be to dark for just an all over color for me but could be great in the crease or something else. The light shades are perfect for my skin and look nice on my eyes I have blue eyes the colors all kind of give my eyes a good pop of color. Some of the color&#x27;s I would say to use any eye shadow base. I use nyx eyes hadow base in white and the nyx jumbo pencil in milk they both work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love Coastal Scents I have Creative Me 1 and 2. Think Pink. Winterberry and Fall Festival Palette&#x27;s. I love them I would recommend them to ANYONE who needs an affordable eye shadow palette that would have an array of color&#x27;s. If you are thinking on getting them all something you should note. A few of the color&#x27;s are use in more then 1 palette (white, black a few of the pink&#x27;s and a few purple&#x27;s but they are good colors to have more then one color). Each of the color&#x27;s can be removed from the palette and on the bottom there is the color written on it so if you ran out of a color that you love you can easily buy it. They are a bit tricky to take out of you don&#x27;t have nails (I don&#x27;t) I just used a pen cap and used the long piece (no idea what you call that lol)&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: When I got mine a few of the colors were broken 1 I really didn&#x27;t care that it was broken (the black but I already have a black one for Coastal Scents). But I quickly realized I had already purchased this palette before and returned the one I bought off Amazon. But it&#x27;s still an amazing palette. Do buy if you are on a budget and want a really good eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Great color payoff, superfast delivery. Not just &amp;#34;great for the price&amp;#34; but &amp;#34;great despite the price&amp;#34; i never order makeup online and especially didnt expect this pallette to be so good. I plan on ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> This palette is awesome! I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this color pallet.  It&#x27;s very compact and convenient with all the colors I love.  Delivery was very good and the packaging was great!</li>
            <li> I love the colors, quantity and quality,  just maybe some extra adhesive to keep the container&#x27;s in place.</li>
            <li> This palette does not live up to the general online Coastal Scents hype. Most of my eyeshadows were dry and slightly powdery, though none broke in shipping. If you need basic eyeshadow that&#x27;s fairly cheap, give it a try. If you already have most of these colors, don&#x27;t bother. Maybe the eyeshadow on Coastal Scents&#x27; website would be better.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting. The colors are a lot lighter than pictured and while they do have good pigmentation they are VERY powdery. Make sure to knock the excess off your brush or you will have eyeshadow all over your face. There is only one matte shade in the entire palette, the very light cream color in the upper left, the rest are all extremely shimmery, bordering on glittery. I won&#x27;t be ordering this particular palette again.</li>
            <li> i love these colors, they are very pigmented and a little goes a long way. It looks just like the picture</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!! pigmented and lasts a good while..love these earth tones on my face</li>
            <li> Love this pallet! Colors are creamy and beautiful! And such a great price!</li>
            <li> I purchase this eyeshadow palette after seeing a review on YouTube. Let me tell you it is beautiful ! The colors are not as dark as they appear online but have a rich pigment and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt; It arrived in perfect condition and quickly. I would definitely get more products from them. Great value for the money, worth every penny I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous for women of color like myself who have a hard time finding eye make up shades that look good.</li>
            <li> The pigments were not as bright as I had originally thought they were going to be, and I wasn&#x27;t as happy with the colors on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this pallet!  The colors are true and last hours and hours!  I can go from a nude to smokey eye easily.  I lime this so much, I looked online and bought one with even more colors!!  I&#x27;m still waiting for that one to be delivered.  In the past I purchased mineral shadows.  They were very pretty, but when I put them on, the for would flake under my eyes or onto my face.  Often when I tried to get it off my face, I would only smear it on more, ending with a mess on my face...it was not pretty!!  This powder eye shadow does not do this, thank goodness!  I highly recommend this shadow!  The quality is high, and the colors are very pretty!!!  Get 2!!  Your gf will want one too!!!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Coastal scents makes excellent shadows that are very affordable.  I have this one and the winter berry palette. The colors are very pigmented and last all day. These colors will especially look beautiful in the fall.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try these. They are as pigmented as my high end Too Faced, Lorac, &amp; Urban Decay shadows.  Great quality at a great price.  The palettes are also very sturdy and have a full sized mirror,  great for traveling.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors great pigment</li>
            <li> beautiful colors..love it</li>
            <li> My skin is caramel complexion. I think these colors are too bright and bold for me. I&#x27;m more of a naked palette type of girl.</li>
            <li> I love fall colors and this palette was so fun to play with.  I loved the golden and red colors for night.  The two taupe colors are great for day.</li>
            <li> the colours are so much better when you actually see them, the picture does not give them justice. I have been very pleased with pigmentation of cs palettes, just wish i got my first palette earlier. there are many possible looks in this palette - from neutral to deep - and since it is flattering on anyone it is a must in any make-up junkie&#x27;s collection.</li>
            <li> a great product! looks beautiful on black skin!! the colors also are fantastic! i surely recommend this product!! i want to buy the other colors too</li>
            <li> I loved this pallet! Perfect shades to compliment my skin tone and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST PALETTE EVER ITS SO UNDERRATED&lt;br /&gt;EVERYONE LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT NOW HAS TO PURCHASE THIS FOR SURE&lt;br /&gt;COLORS ARE SO SMOOTH, LONGWEARING, AND RICH&lt;br /&gt;THESE ARE ON-PAR WITH MY URBAN DECAY SHADOWS FOR SUCHHH A FRACTION OF THE COST</li>
            <li> This palette is so gorgeous! Some of the shadows are a little chalky, but don&#x27;t let that sway you. The pigmentation is great and they apply and blend really well. You can apply them wet or dry. The palette itself is VERY sturdy and durable. And I like you can re-purchase the shadows individually if you happen to run out of a shade you really like.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best eyeshadow pallet ever purchased....would definitely purchase again...now I want the winter berry one. Very very pigmented and literally lasts all day long!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this pallet.  It is gorgeous and I will order again!!!</li>
            <li> I loved beautiful colors and good price</li>
            <li> Love the size of each color and the fact that the pallette is refillable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this palette. It&#x27;s very compact , great pigmentation, and came quickly. Packaged nicely and I love it!!!! Must have</li>
            <li> I loved the colors!!! I compare these shades with the MAC eyeshadows, not a cheap product what-so-ever... My sisters just ordered some today.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast so that&#x27;s always a plus. i tried it without primer and i wasn&#x27;t impressed. on the other eye i applied two faced eyeshadow let it dry a bit then applied the shadow..Big Difference! This isn&#x27;t MAC so don&#x27;t compare it to it. but for the money it was a good buy :)</li>
            <li> Great pigment.  The colors are beautiful.  Even the red that most people would think not that wearable actually is.  If you love gold and penny tones you&#x27;ll love these I think.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> These colors are so true and very much vibrant!  Its my new go-to pallet from day to evening event as well as traveling.  I have to mention that almost brick red... great transitional colour! LOVE IT :)) Oh and the packaging and shipping was excellent thanks people and keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> I would give this a 10 star if I could.  This pallet is amazing. The colors are so pigmented and there is hardly any fallout. I love love love this and will defiantly be ordering this again.. Oh and also they are magnetized so you can just pop them out to add to a z-pallet with ease. Pick this up now!!</li>
            <li> Im a cosmetologist and i would recomend rhis palette to anyone whos looking for quality makeup at a good price the colors are so pigmented u only need a little they go on so smooth and blend like a dream dont fade or crease i did use an eyeshadow primer prior to use  yet i love this palette and u will too! :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors . Can&#x27;t wait to start using them!!!  Palette is small which I really like and the colors are pigmented</li>
            <li> Great for the price. I was hesitant to order because I&#x27;d heard it was chalky &amp; had lots of fall out. But I fell in love with the colors so I ordered it. Was really impressed. Although they are a bit chalky, the color payoff is great! Highly pigmented, very shimmery. Great staying power with a good primer too. I work 12 hour shifts in an Emergency Room. My makeup still looks great at the end of my shift! I love this for days I don&#x27;t want to break out my high end makeup. Great for day to day wear.</li>
            <li> The palate was in perfect condition and well packed. It came on time as well. The colors are bold but beautiful for fall and shoes what colors go well. The great part about this brand is that the pigment is strong and it has a balance of matte and shimmer shades. A little goes a long way with anything with quality pigmentation like this:)</li>
            <li> This is my first Coastal Scents palette, and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I bought this on a whim because the colors in this palette are so unique and looked absolutely gorgeous. I do wish the colors were as dark as this picture makes them look, but regardless, they are all still gorgeous colors, especially for Fall and Winter looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This slim palette comes with 12 colors&lt;br /&gt;(From left to right) Row 1: Chamois Nude, Bright Copper, Dark Golden Olive, Light Apricot&lt;br /&gt;Row 2: Kiwi Green, Deep Cantaloupe,  Regalia Purple, American Rose&lt;br /&gt;Row 3: Cherry Chocolate, Raisin Berry, New Penny, Gunmetal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although most of the colors are incredible and have fabulous color payoff there are 3 colors that, unfortunately, do not measure up, IMO: Chamois Nude, Regalia Purple and Gunmetal. These 3 colors are almost impossible to work with dry as they have very little pickup from the pan. The only matte in this palette, Chamois Nude, is so light and sheer it&#x27;s almost unnoticeable. I can&#x27;t see much use for this color besides using it under the arch of your brows, even then it&#x27;s not a fantastic highlight since it&#x27;s matte. The other two darker colors, Regalia Purple and Gunmetal aren&#x27;t as soft in texture as the other colors in this palette, making it very hard to pick color up with your brush. They are more difficult to work with and don&#x27;t blend as well as the others....leaving a patchy and uneven result, even under primer. Building up the color is possible BUT incredibly time consuming and often results in an uneven finished result. I&#x27;m assuming these two colors use Ultramarine pigment bases, and Ultramarines don&#x27;t adhere to the skin as well as Mica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other colors in this palette are like butter to apply and blend. They are all shimmer, except for Cherry Chocolate, which is the only color that has discernible glitter within the color (it looks like a copper/rose gold glitter) but doesn&#x27;t come off overly glittery. Despite how soft they are in texture, there isn&#x27;t much fallout in the pans. To reduce fallout on your face during application, save the fluffy brushes for targeted blending and apply color with a flatter, tighter bristled shadow brush..tap off excess and dab to apply color. Start with a light application and build up to your desired result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that these shadows wear better, apply better, and look better when applied on top of a shadow primer. For an even bolder and brighter look, I&#x27;ll apply NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk or MAC Paints in Bare Canvas to my lids after I apply my UD Primer Potion. The added base really allows colors to pop and aid in longevity of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an NC20 in MAC and all these colors work well with my skin tone. Granted, some are too bold for daytime or casual looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great palette for an affordable price. If you love experimenting with color, you&#x27;ll love it. It&#x27;s a fabulous addition to any makeup arsenal and totally worth checking out.n texture, there isn&#x27;t much fallout in the pans.

            <li> great product, fast shippment. couldnt be more pleased</li>
            <li> My favorite of the brand!!!!! Awesome set</li>
            <li> Ok I was disappointed because I loved the colours but omg the fallout with this pallet is horrendous!&lt;br /&gt;Even when I do my eyeshadow before putting on foundation or after doesn&#x27;t matter, I end up looking like I was beat up! Ugh</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this pallet !! It&#x27;s very pigmented and such a fun pallet to play around with.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m lovin this awsome pallette I don&#x27;t have those colors in my other palettes I used it the second day and the colors r beautiful but no need to pack it on just lightly</li>
            <li> Amazing colors and they are a great size, they are interchangeable as well. Only flaw some people might not like is that the colors are a little more pinkish on some of the tans/neutrals than the picture shows. but they are still absolutely beautiful! very flattering on nearly any skin tone! The mirror is very nice too!!! This should last me at least a few years.....and even then I can get refills!</li>
            <li> COASTAL SCENTS has quickly become a favorite of mine!  Great colors that go on easy, stay on well with primer.  Great bang for your buck!  The palette is very nice, the color pans can come out and you can put different ones in. The pans are $1.99 each on the Coastal Scents website so its affordable to buy more for your palette!  The colors in this palette are wonderful.  There are metallics and satins, a lovely group that has many different looks in it.  You should be very happy with this!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this eye shadow palette. The colors are true and they last all day with no creasing or fading. This is a true selling point for someone like me that has combination oily skin. Don&#x27;t hesitate ladies... this is a great bargain with an even better product!</li>
            <li> I bought them for more autumn colors. A couple I may not use but other colors I will. If you use a brush to apply you will get a lighter coverage but if you use a  sponge applicator  they go on darker plus you can layer them. I was thinking of using them wet to get more vibrant colors. I would say the size of each is larger than the ones you get in those large palettes. The colors are matte light nude color (doesn&#x27;t show up much) which I use as a base, light taupey shimmery color ( shows up slightly darker than nude color), light  shimmery bronze/ brown color, orangey/peachy shimmery color, shimmery coppery color, shimmery burgundy, shimmery light plum, shimmery medium brown, shimmery medium plum, shimmery olive green, shimmery bronzy color and shimmery dark gray. That&#x27;s about the best I can do. You can rearrange the colors which I have done. Colors are sheer with brush. You can mix colors, layer or use them damp. Does not come with sponge or brush. Could probably use q-tip to apply. Anyway I think this is a good brand. Thinking of ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great pallet. The other reviews are correct; the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as in the picture and you HAVE to use a primer. I use Urban Decay primer and my eyeshadow stays on all day. Primer also gives the eyeshadow a richer color. But with that said, its an awesome value for all the beautiful shades you get.</li>
            <li> I just received my fall festival pallete, and it delivered in three days! I expecting a lot longer, and it was well padded. Nothing damaged. The pigment in these eyeshadows are so awesome and are interchangeable to if u run out u can buy another one. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for intense pigments that show on my mocha skin.  These are gorgeous.  Absolutely.  They are serious!  I like that they are of high quality, comparable to the high end shadows.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more shawdows from this company. I also love that you can lift each shadow out and put in a empty small MAC shadow palette if you dont want to carry the whole thing around.</li>
            <li> Colors are more vibrant than shown in the picture, but they look great!</li>
            <li> Beautiful palette.  It seems there are so many &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; eye shadow palettes out there right now and I wanted color!  This fits the bill.  The colors are very rich and pigmented.  I ALWAYS use an eye primer.  An eye primer will make any cheap eye shadow work like an expensive one.  There is no fall out with these shadows. Very impressed with the quality. I first apply an eye moisturizing cream, then I apply a Lorac eye primer.  I gently pat the entire upper and lower lid with the lightest color in the palette.  I then choose the color I&#x27;m in the mood for and pat very gently in the crease and very outer corner of my lid. You can then add a third lighter color in the corner of your lid.  Then take an angled eye shadow brush and gently blend, blend blend (very important step).  This will eliminate any patches.  I then take one of the colors I&#x27;ve used on the top lid and run it under my bottom lashes. I then run a dark color eye pencil on the bottom rim of eye and again blend everything in.  Wow!  Beautiful. Love the reddish colors.  The green is great for my brown eyes too.  I have medium skin tone, brown eyes and dark hair.  My only negative on this is the container is hard to open.  I feel like it&#x27;s going to pop out of my hands and the eye shadows will break.  The pods are also loose so use can replace them if needed.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I wear a lot of Mac, urban decay, and it cosmetics.  This is just about as good.  But, I also use a primer with my eye shadow.  The primer makes the difference.  It allows your eye shadow to stay on richer in color and all day.</li>
            <li> Good products. Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. They go on smoothly and the colors are very deep. The pallet lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a notorious makeup junkie, so I was really surprised by how much I like this product considering the low price. Typically cheap eyeshadows are hard, don&#x27;t blend well and are chalky. These eyeshadows were really nice. Great pigment, nice and silky. My only gripe is that the bottom left shadow came shattered. I can fix it with some rubbing alcohol, so not a huge deal. I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing more of these palettes int he future.</li>
            <li> Its good too shimmery for my taste, colors look a lil diffrwnt and one pod came destroyed</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of my favorite palettes! Love the color choices and they compliment darker skin tones very well in my opinion. I use this palette year round :).</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors &amp; very pigmented !!😍</li>
            <li> So I already love coastal scents products, but this palette was awesome! it arrivedon time in mint condition and the pigment quality is wonderful, I will probably be ordering a couple more for my mother and myself!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best palette from Coastal scents!!&lt;br /&gt;It contains the following colors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pot # M004 Chamois Nude&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pot # ME003 Bright Copper&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pot # ME001 Dark Golden Olive&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pot # ME017 Light Apricot&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pot # ME009 Kiwi Green&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pot # ME026 Deep Cantaloupe&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pot # S014 Regalia Purple&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pot # S017 American Rose&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pot # S030 Cherry Chocolate&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pot # ME015 Raisin Berry&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pot # ME023 New Penny&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pot # M023 Gunmetal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of Coastal Scents Fall Festival Palette:&lt;br /&gt; --It is pocket friendly and the quality is comparable to higher end products&lt;br /&gt; --Is very pigmented and easily blendable&lt;br /&gt;-- Has very little fallout&lt;br /&gt;--Does not crease much on my oily eyelids&lt;br /&gt;-- Has a beautiful combination of colors with matte, shimmer and metallic finish&lt;br /&gt; --I love its texture&lt;br /&gt;-- Perfect for ethnic wears&lt;br /&gt;--Has a sturdy case with a big mirror, which can be reused&lt;br /&gt;--Has got a magnetic palette, which can be reused for other hot pots too</li>
            <li> Much larger than I expected, the colors are beautiful and looks just like the photo.</li>
            <li> Not a bad palette. Pigmented yes, but I honestly purchased because of how dark it looked online. It is NOT true to the picture shown, but it isn&#x27;t a bad palette. All but the first cream shade on the top left, are shimmery</li>
            <li> I really love this palete as well as other i have the colors are so beutiful specially the blue that looks like purple i really recomend to buy it is worth having :-)</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty palette, I have only used it few times but the colors are beautiful. My skin-tone is close to a hazelnut color and they show up nicely and I am sure it would look really nice on light and dark tones. The colors are rich and dark so a little might go a long way. I only wish some of the colors were matte, I only found one matte and I use it to highlight my brow. Overall NICE!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have bought Coastal Scents makeup before and I am most impressed with this palette for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The case--it&#x27;s very sleek and substantial (interior and exterior). I am not sure what material the case is made of but it feels almost like metal.&lt;br /&gt;2) The colors--Not just for Fall. There is a variety of metallic, shimmery and matte colors which makes this a year around palette, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;3) The quality--the shadows are rich and apply pretty well (note: I always use primer). I am brown skinned and the colors show up quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The palette came well packaged and in-tact. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect condition! pigmentation and quality is like no other palette i have ever used/bought.</li>
            <li> Colors have great pigments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;neutral colors for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;long lasting product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great for beginners or advanced makeup artist. great product</li>
            <li> The colours are amazing and suits my dusky complaxion very much. Also it had no adverse effect on the skin. I love this collection.</li>
            <li> Love Coastal Scents colors!!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous love the colors 💜</li>
            <li> At first when I got it I was a little disappointed because the colors aren&#x27;t exactly like on the picture, but when I tried it out I fell in love with it right away!! I put it on around 7 in the morning and when I got home from work around 6 the colors were still in place looking perfect! I&#x27;m thinking about getting one for my sister!</li>
            <li> This palette was exactly what I wanted! I love to blend colors together and these work perfectly for my complexion.</li>
            <li> The lid of this palatte clasps so tightly I actually have to use a coin to pry it open!  The colors are fine but it was so obnoxious to use I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li> I totally love every color in it!! Excellent quality for a professional makeup. I love Coastal Scents products. I want to have them all!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful shades that are mostly very pigmented. They go on better when used with fingers and blend out easily with brushes. The black is not as pigmented as if hoped but the rest are good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to buy again. I bought this as a gift and when I got it I almost wanted to keep it because the quality was amazing. The eye shadows have magnets on the bottom and you can take them in and out. Has a nice big mirror. It&#x27;s nice and heavy which I like. It&#x27;s just all around a good by. And it shipped nice too. Only thing is that I don&#x27;t think I received the one I ordered. But I was still happy with what I got.</li>
            <li> Was expecting less quality from this brand because of the price, but was blown away with the quality and pigmentation of the shadows. So far, I haven&#x27;t notice any issues with fallout.  Was well packaged with two layers of bubble wrap. Sleek matte black pallet is very nice. Love that the shadows are interchangeable. It drives me nuts that they aren&#x27;t arranged in a more monochromatic way, but I can do that myself.Wish Amazon had the neutral version of this pallet,  but still loving the autumn tones. Will definitely be purchasing more from this brand. Very happy happy happy with this purchase.  :)</li>
            <li> I use this every single day, the picture kind of makes them look matte but they they are actually shimmery and satin. I really love all the colors in here, Must have for those dramatic smokey eye addicts like me!</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are in beautiful Fall colors and shades--not too overpowering. The shadows apply easily with makeup brushes, and the shadows have pretty good stay-on power.  I simply love the colors!</li>
            <li> Pigmentation is great and it&#x27;s an amazing deal... I would have given 5 stars if the shadow didn&#x27;t fall so much off the brush. Other than that, I&#x27;d buy more.</li>
            <li> In love with these colors and pigmented shades. I changed out a few color singles that I already had and made it a custom palette.</li>
            <li> wished I had got two of these very pretty thanks</li>
            <li> Colors are nice. I had to order this same pallet twice BECAUSE they sent me the wrong pallet the first time. The first time I used this I sprayed My finished look with my urban decay all nighter setting spray,  and the eyeshadows literally melted off of my face. Like I had to wash my whole face and start over..i don&#x27;t know why that happened. The only thing I changed was useing these. Shadows.</li>
            <li> One word ....  WOW !!!!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this brand and their eyeshadows and this is my FAVORITE palette even over my NAKED palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLORS: good range of colors and they go on as expected. Ladies, use an eyeshadow primer or foundation! this will help the color go on more even. The top left cream color is a perfect highlighter or base color. the 2nd color on the top row is my ALL-TIME favorite for everyday wear. I have blue eyes and this color makes them POP as does the 4th color on the top row. You have a basic brown and black which is always good to have and there is a slight sparkle but not too much to where it is obnoxious. The two reds also pair well together&lt;br /&gt;FALLOUT: there is slight fallout with these shadows but it really isnt bad. Ive seen more fallout with my sephora eyeshadows than i have with these.&lt;br /&gt;EASE OF APPLICATION: goes on pretty well if you use a primer. I usually apply a few layers just to make it pop.&lt;br /&gt;HOW LONG DOES IT LAST? for me, these eye shadows will last my entire work day and then some. After about 8 hours, you may want to touch up a little. To make it last longer, use primer before and a finishing spray at the end.&lt;br /&gt;IRRITATION? Ive gotten no irritation whatsover from these shadows. I do get some irritation from cheaper products so i was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a perfect addition to the up and coming makeup geek. they offer a good range of colors and the product itself is excellent.</li>
            <li> Colors are perfect! Very pigmented and lasts a good while. I wanna buy 5 more. Lol</li>
            <li> Colors are pigmented.</li>
            <li> The shades are all very pretty, I just was disappointed because the picture made it seem like some of the colors were matte, which I would have liked much more than shimmer. Otherwise, if you&#x27;re looking for a decently priced makeup palette with shimmery colors, look no further.</li>
            <li> The actual shadows are a bit more vibrantly coloured than in the picture, but they are still very wearable. High quality and easily blended. A great set!</li>
            <li> I use this palette everyday.  The colors are very opaque. I use a lot of high end makeup products and coastal cents should get more credit. Their brushes are great and so are the shadows! Absolutely love!</li>
            <li> Brilliant quality for the price, the mattes are definitely the weakest performing of the shadows but all the other shades make it worth it anyway. The palette itself is sturdy and easily customized as well.</li>
            <li> Great palette!!!! Colors are highly pigmented and they blend so easy</li>
            <li> these eyeshadows are amazing and highly pigmented. easy to work with and a very large palette for a reasonable price. just as great as any of my high end eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> very nice! pictures opn amazon should be better to show the true colors!</li>
            <li> Its amazing! All the colors are so pigmented, I&#x27;m in loveee!</li>
            <li> I love this fall festival palette from Coastal Scents.  i was packaged secured and shipped promptly.  Yes, I would very much consider purchasing again.  Love these colors, I would highly recommend this product.  Just love it.</li>
            <li> Colors ate HOT and pigment  is great</li>
            <li> the pigmentation is just incredible, no fall out and it lasts all day. the colors are just so beautiful!!! i will definitely be ordering more of these eye shadows and palettes as well</li>
