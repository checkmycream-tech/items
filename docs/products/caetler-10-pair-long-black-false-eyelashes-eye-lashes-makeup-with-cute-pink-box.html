            <li>pretty good.</li>
            <li>I love how cheap they are.</li>
            <li>You need to trim the lashes to fit the length of your lash line.</li>
            <li>They came in just right!</li>
            <li>These lashes are soft and looks very good for going out or daily.</li>
            <li>They are pretty straight and not curved but with a hairdryer and a little bending they are fine and perfect for cosplay !</li>
            <li>still it came early and they&#x27;re still pretty nice lashes,</li>
            <li>You just need to trim them first!</li>
            <li>but they are definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I have trimmed them, changed glue , they are just so stiff they will not curve to my own lashes!</li>
            <li>I would wear everyday, they fit perfect if you cut a little off the ends.</li>
            <li>The lashes that you see on the picture, are exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>They are surprisingly pretty on.  </li>
            <li>, it looks exactly as the pictures show</li>

            <li>I usually curl it around my thumb and bend it until it gets a more curvy shape.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>then that the packaging is cute but is quite a small box.</li>
            <li>very disappointing, but the lashes are tapered and nice if you&#x27;re going for a more natural look, even though i WASN&#x27;T!</li>
            <li>Lashes were soft, easy to put them on an easy to put on others, very dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li>Very long.. great with dramatic eye looks.</li>
            <li>You are getting 10 pairs of lashes for the less than I pair you are able to get at your local beauty supply or drugstore with similar attributes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> these r great, the always saves the day</li>
            <li> Literally plastic strands fused together. Nothing like actual lash extensions</li>
            <li> The lashes that you see on the picture, are exactly what I got. There are made out a soft plastic that makes the application easy ( at least for me), item arrived in a white box, just like in the picture, and the same in a dark gray plastic bag/ envelope. My lashes arrived 20 plus days after placing the order, and still reaching before the ETA. You are getting 10 pairs of lashes for the less than I pair you are able to get at your local beauty supply or drugstore with similar attributes. The company customer service is really good, replying almost immediately, caring for the client, and that makes me a happy returning customer!!!</li>
            <li> I love them i got what i wanted!</li>
            <li> They are surprisingly pretty on.  Love them.</li>
            <li> These lashes are great and if you know what you are doing then you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems putting them on. All the bad reviews because they are &amp;#34;too stiff&amp;#34; are from people who do not know how to put them on. So here are a few tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. You need to trim the lashes to fit the length of your lash line. This prevents the lashes from going out past your eye and makes them easier to put on.&lt;br /&gt;2. Before you apply your lash you need to bend it to losen it up and make applying easier. I usually curl it around my thumb and bend it until it gets a more curvy shape.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply glue. I always use Salon Perfect strip lash glue and have never had a problem with it. Apply glue to eyelash and let sit for about 30 seconds before putting them on.</li>
            <li> These are plastic lashes so you have to leave the glue on for a while and let it get tacky, then stick them on. If you put them on before the glue gets tacky you&#x27;ll have a hard time applying them. I love how cheap they are.</li>
            <li> They came in just right! These lashes are soft and looks very good for going out or daily. I took one star away because you have to work with them a little bit. Overall it works good!&lt;br /&gt;- Mimi</li>
            <li> look at one of the pictures another review posted, the ones with the thinner lashes, i got the same ones. should have listened. very disappointing, but the lashes are tapered and nice if you&#x27;re going for a more natural look, even though i WASN&#x27;T! still it came early and they&#x27;re still pretty nice lashes, just not what&#x27;s on the picture...</li>
            <li> I ordered these last month along with lashes from other sellers these took the longest to come but they are definitely worth the wait. These are absolutely gorgeous. A lot of people don&#x27;t know how to apply these but there are tutorials on YouTube that&#x27;ll have you master putting these on in no time. I am very pleased with my purchase, I just ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li> Lashes were soft, easy to put them on an easy to put on others, very dramatic lashes. Give it four stars, reason why 2 pairs were torn, but I&#x27;m okay with it, the price was amazing .</li>
            <li> They work great for me. You just need to trim them first!</li>
            <li> Do not order this product. I ordered 8 boxes and received a total different lash from the picture.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re more for dress up, not lashes I would wear everyday, they fit perfect if you cut a little off the ends. Good product !</li>
            <li> wife loves them, Thanks...</li>
            <li> So I got these in 2-3 weeks was hoping I was getting the style of lashes that are shown in the picture but I instead received a different style slightly disappointed ðŸ˜© other then that the packaging is cute but is quite a small box.</li>
            <li> The lashes came a week earlier and all the lashes are perfectly fine. There was a small dent on the side of the box but it didn&#x27;t damage the lashes or anything. I haven&#x27;t tried them on yet but when I get lash glue I will. I like the style, it looks exactly as the pictures show and they&#x27;re very false like so for my usage it works perfectly. I&#x27;m so glad and for the price I would totally buy like ten more boxes. As soon as I get a working camera, I&#x27;ll take pictures of them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my girlfriend thought they would be.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> Very long.. great with dramatic eye looks. However, I took one star away because they are tough to work with. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with putting on fake eyelashes I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these due to the fact that they don&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;natural curve&amp;#34; to this to go along the lash line. They stay straight as a board and it&#x27;s tricky to put them on and can be time consuming. Satisfied with the overall look and quality for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> pretty good. great price</li>
            <li> After waiting for over a month no lashes and waiting for my refund</li>
            <li> came in perfect condition and are gorgeous</li>
            <li> Item was early and was what i expected. I will buy again and refer friends.</li>
            <li> They are pretty straight and not curved but with a hairdryer and a little bending they are fine and perfect for cosplay !</li>
            <li> I love tthese eye lashes  wish i would of known about this a long time ago you cant bet 10 pairs of eyelashes for less then $2.00 dollars. you have too doctor them up a little n no glue comes with them but they are less then 2 dollars...</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these that&#x27;s why I ordered 4. They are VERY stiff and don&#x27;t have a curve to them. I have tried 3 times to apply them and they do not stay on. I have trimmed them, changed glue , they are just so stiff they will not curve to my own lashes!</li>
