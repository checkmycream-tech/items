            <li> Helps with dry mouth too.  </li>
            <li> I searched and searched and could find no other toothpaste that was green!  </li>
            <li> I prefer it over Spry due to this, and I also do not like the way Spry tastes.  </li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I bought this toothpaste simply because the tube matches my green bathroom!  </li>
            <li> I like that it has fluoride, but not a bunch of other chemical crud or sugar.</li>
            <li> My mother did believe in my fathers back country medicine so was forced to use toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> You mouth does not explored with mint and weird flavors like some other brands do, and to tell you the truth, I can live without that.  </li>
            <li> They worked so so perhaps because they had so little of it in the product.</li>
            <li> With other brands, I had to add a small amount of high-fluoride toothpaste to my brush in order to get everything I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this toothpaste has that weird texture that other xylitol toothpastes can have.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately am susceptible to cavities.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my son had already used it before he noticed the ingredient.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste contains zinc - it is very irritating to my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> I hate using mouthwash since it dries my mouth badly overnight.</li>
            <li> Now I have two worthless tubes of toothpaste and am out over $9.00.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product; my teeth have never felt cleaner, plus the taste is refreshing. (I had to use &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste once  last week and that taste now bothers me, tastes medicinal) - The Xylitol toothpaste is great.</li>
            <li> I like using as many xylitol products as possible because I&#x27;ve had so many problems with my teeth.  I&#x27;m so glad I found epic dental xylitol products.  This is just one of several that I&#x27;ve used from their line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy. Always when I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth in the past I have felt as if my teeth needs more cleaning. I hate using mouthwash since it dries my mouth badly overnight. Never touched the mouthwash ever since I started using this. Great tooth paste and worth the small price.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is smooth and taste just fine.  You mouth does not explored with mint and weird flavors like some other brands do, and to tell you the truth, I can live without that.  It is gentle on the taste buds and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has everything I&#x27;ve needed - fluoride and xylitol. I don&#x27;t feel like this toothpaste has that weird texture that other xylitol toothpastes can have. It cleans my teeth perfectly and helps reduce my cavities. My kid loves to use this toothpaste too!</li>
            <li> recommended by my hygenist</li>
            <li> I like the product  but wish it came in a fluoride free form. We have fluoride in our water and don&#x27;t need the additonal fluoride in the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste if you like a nice, mild but not unpleasant flavor and really clean, shiny teeth.</li>
            <li> highly recommended by our dentist &amp; now us! I was worried that it would taste like..well, like, yuck, but it didn&#x27;t! left a nice clean &amp; refreshing feeling.  this will be our go to toothpaste from now on</li>
            <li> I switched to using this toothpaste 18 months ago. Does a good job removing plaque. Haven&#x27;t had any cavities since, and the twice-yearly cleanings seem to go much quicker. I get it for my family using Super Saver and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately am susceptible to cavities. I tried going no flouride and just ended up with cavities. So, realizing I need flouride, I am so happy to have found this great tasting toothpaste with Xylitol AND Fluoride and it&#x27;s as natural as a toothpaste can get. I&#x27;m very happy. My teeth already feel like they&#x27;re winning the battle against cavities.  Will buy a larger pack next time</li>
            <li> I am a dentist, if that means anything to anybody. The research is reasonably strong with some contending opinions regarding the quality of the research protocols. Maybe so. I noticed many &#x27;re-mineralizing&#x27; products in dentistry had xylitol as a component. They worked so so perhaps because they had so little of it in the product. The stated research sounded good to me, even if it has protocol flaws (can the results be reproduced?). I have found this: I have a 96 year old mom with implants and some crown and bridge work. Prior to giving her the xylitol paste her teeth and implant bars were covered in plaque. After 3 or more at home observations post xylitol, she is nearly plaque free. I questioned her assistant as to whether she helped my mom in brushing. &#x27;No&#x27; was the answer. So, anecdotally speaking, it is working for my mom. As for myself, I know how to brush properly so plaque is not my issue, but the science works for me and it has great taste so I use it and recommend it to patients. FYI: xylitol is a 5 carbon aliphatic straight chain, alcoholic sugar (it has an &#x27;OH&#x27; at one end). Sugar (sucrose) is a 2 hexane ring sugar. Germs look at xylitol and do not know what to do with it. Therefore, no bacterial growth&amp;#62;&amp;#62;lower acidity from their processes. Good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. I had a lot of cavities as a kid. I started using this toothpaste and I haven&#x27;t had one since.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste almost exclusively for two years now.  I went from having suboptimal dental health to having great dental health over those two years.  I love the &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; feeling that xylitol toothpaste gives you.  Also, this product has one of the highest levels of xylitol for a toothpaste, which I really appreciate.  I prefer it over Spry due to this, and I also do not like the way Spry tastes.  Another benefit of this toothpaste is that it contains fluoride, which is essential for any quality toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;  Dental health does not happen overnight!!  In addition to using this toothpaste, I also use xylitol mints after snacks or if I cannot brush for an extended period of time.  I also use a fluoride mouthwash (ACT) and mix xylitol into the mouthwash myself.  This saves money instead of buying &amp;#34;xylitol mouthwash&amp;#34;, plus fluoride is great for teeth!</li>
            <li> Has become the only toothpaste i use.</li>
            <li> I am comparing this to Squigle.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Squigle. It seems to do the job.  Nice flavor and it leaves my teeth clean.  However, I still think Squigle is better.  Squigle leaves you with a completely clean feeling.  Epic still has a hint of mint when you rinse out.  But for the price, I&#x27;d still use it.</li>
            <li> fantastic toothpaste - no more cavities for over a year</li>
            <li> I love Xylitol products! Toothpaste, gum, mints, etc....</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time.  it definitely feels cleaner on your teeth than regular toothpaste.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a film just nice and clean.  We always order this brand. Watch out for kids toothpaste..some of them actually add sugar in it.  My 5yr old loves brushing with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste, i wear invisalign braces, and when you have invisalign you are more prone to cavities. I use this toothpaste to help reduce that if I were to get any cavities. Keeps my mouth fresh also.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh spearmint taste of this toothpaste--much better than peppermint. As a mother of a child with dental decay, I know there&#x27;s some controversy about fluoridated products. However, as we live in an area without fluoridated water, I want to make sure that I&#x27;m doing all I can to protect her teeth. This toothpaste offers a high amount of xylitol and fluoride, both of which help protect against caries when offered topically. If you&#x27;re looking for a fluoride/xylitol paste, this is it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I know it is good for my mouth care. Vendor did very well with this purchase</li>
            <li> Works great ! came quickly and in pristine condition. Works just as good as the big name brand. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very good for your dental health, great tasting also. I am a happy customer. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really needs to be a 10 Star.  I have used this toothpaste for years, never have any problems when I see the densist.  However she might not like that.  I use the toothpaste at night and the mints thoughout the day.  the mints are by epic as well amazon sells them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this product and you will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I bought this toothpaste simply because the tube matches my green bathroom!  I searched and searched and could find no other toothpaste that was green!  Having used this toothpaste, though, I find that I like it.  It&#x27;s got a different kind of taste (spearmint), and it does match my bathroom, too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It makes my teeth feel so clean, and I love the taste. I really like the fact that it has so much Xylitol in it. It makes me feel like the microbes in my mouth are being exterminated!</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste and good for your mouth and teeth.  Helps with dry mouth too.  I like that it has fluoride, but not a bunch of other chemical crud or sugar.</li>
            <li> Wanted a Xylitol toothpaste with fluoride, and this fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;Has a mellow mint taste... not over powering. We are happy with it and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> The description of this product does not mention fluoride.  Most people switch from regular toothpaste to xylitol because they are trying to get away from the neurotoxin fluoride.  Unfortunately, my son had already used it before he noticed the ingredient. Now I have two worthless tubes of toothpaste and am out over $9.00.  UGH!!!</li>
            <li> My father never used toothpaste.  His uncle was a doctor who told him never use toothpaste.  Its full of sugar. He used baking side with Crisco. My mother did believe in my fathers back country medicine so was forced to use toothpaste.  Also when younger never had my teeth scr as ped or gums picked at. Once a friend insisted they were healthier I developing receding gums and have caps on every tooth. Now we use this product and oil pulling to Whitten teeth. Peroxide that is food grade is used on our meats to kill bacteria but it  .  Also causes cancer. Currently going thru cancer treatment.  Also this product fights tonsil stones. Love it.</li>
            <li> At 31% xylitol this toothpaste seems not as sweet as it should. (Xylitol is very sweet). I prefer Xylishield as it seems to do a better job of \\&quot;lasting\\&quot; through the day and has a pleasanter flavor, however it is no longer available. After trying several other xylitol pastes this is the next best, and yes, I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> This is the third brand of xylitol toothpaste I&#x27;ve purchased, and the first one I&#x27;ve found that contains fluoride.  There are plenty of non-fluoride options for those who want that.  With other brands, I had to add a small amount of high-fluoride toothpaste to my brush in order to get everything I wanted.  This also has 24% higher xylitol content than my previous brand (25% vs 31%.)</li>
            <li> Should this product drip onto clothing, your bathroom tile grout or just about anything else outside of your mouth it will probably stain it. I assume the product clean my teeth though.</li>
            <li> As a sufferer of Lupus, Sjrogen&#x27;s Syndrome and other chronic illnesses, this toothpaste has been a great product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about it&#x27;s effectiveness really, but it is a good toothpaste as far as consistency and flavor. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> For those who want the possible benefits of xylitol, but do not subscribe to the anti-flouride movement, this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a mild taste, and suds up well. Some toothpastes tend to give me mouth ulcers, but I have had no such problem with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been my primary dentifrice for a year now, and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste contains zinc - it is very irritating to my mouth.  so be aware of this</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste!! My teeth feel clean and it leaves a nice taste in my mouth-plus the whitening power is something I am looking forward to!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste! My teeth feel clean and since I&#x27;m benefiting from both xylito AND fluoride, I feel like my teeth are truly healthy.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste on the market. I have been using it for over 10 years. It guarantees that you will have no cavities by using this natural toothpaste..used accordingly...and it works! Pleasant tasting and worth paying the extra money for it. They also have mouthwash, mints and gum that is made with this natural sugar.The toothpaste is not foamy and does not leave an aftertaste in your mouth after using it.</li>
