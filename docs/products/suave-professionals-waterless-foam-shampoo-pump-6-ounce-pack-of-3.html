            <li>I tried my best.  </li>
            <li>What a wonderful product for individuals like her.  </li>

            <li>and he smells great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to do &amp;#</li>
            <li>Awesome product, quick shipping... great experience!  </li>
            <li>Amazing Deal!</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t have oily roots and want to replenish your curls this product might be perfect, but you&#x27;ll want to use much more than the 1 to 2 pumps</li>
            <li>This product is good.  </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>It has a light smell and refreshes your hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love It !,,</li>
            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still better than the spray-on  powder products!</li>
            <li>And it makes her hair smell nice too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice for someone elderly in the hospital.</li>
            <li>but his works just as well and smells nice .</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Love Love Love</li>
            <li>I love using it when I don&#x27;t have time to fully wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Spray is ok.</li>
            <li>I know I feel better when my hair feels clean, and this helps with that.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good for my daughter who&#x27;s hair gets greasy really quick.  </li>
            <li>If you want to spray product on the root of your hair to get rid of the oil, try [[ASIN:B004DBUAGQ Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo Spray, Beautiful Clean, 5-Ounce]].</li>
            <li>however I have long straight hair and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is also perfect for lazy days when you&#x27;re bumming around the house but still don&#x27;t want that \\&quot;greasy hair\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t look clean after using it.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and clean, but not too perfume-y.</li>
            <li>However I forgot to mention that my hair is pretty fine</li>
            <li>It made my roots and the rest of the hair super crunchy, sticky and even dirtier looking.</li>
            <li>I have since purchased the waterless spray at my local Kroger&#x27;s market and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This has a strong perfume smell which really bothers me because it seems overpowering to me.</li>
            <li>Just like a fresh shampoo.</li>
            <li>Fortunately this stuff will clean a lot of the dirt and oil out of the hair and buys us a few more days of avoiding the full shower.  </li>
            <li>also recommend Suave&#x27;s Dry Shampoo ([[ASIN:B004DBUAGQ Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo Spray, Beautiful Clean, 5-Ounce]]).</li>
            <li>It will make you feel better, and when you feel better your day might be a little brighter.</li>
            <li>Actually made my hair more oily</li>
            <li>But, while this smells okay, is very sticky and left my hair with a tacky feel.</li>
            <li>One bottle rolling around in the great big box, lost its entire content so that I had to clean the other 2 bottles before putting them away.</li>
            <li>I found this product works very well to de-tangle my hair and also add a bit of moisture to it.</li>
            <li>It cleans hair a bit, but leaves 2 much residue and smell</li>
            <li>Love this product I had  been using the more expensive Tresemne</li>
            <li>Refresh it with a little more.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really too bad, not just because I could certainly use the help, but because I&#x27;ve always been more than satisfied with Suave products before - always.  </li>
            <li>It helps my hair curl nicely and works on barely damp hair unlike other products I have used that require hair to be totally soaked.</li>
            <li>It had a feeling of a typical cheap hair product.</li>
            <li>It works very well and does not dry my hair out like another foam product that I used.</li>
            <li>but wish it smelled better and less medical.</li>
            <li>So glad to finally have found a source for this little miracle worker.</li>
            <li>Run a little through your hair, let it air dry and magic</li>
            <li>This foam shampoo is for dry and curly hair not greasy looking straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that I can only wash twice per week with shampoo, yet teach several classes a week at the gym -- so this waterless foam shampoo helps me out in between hair washings really well.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this on the shelves I was beyond excited, however, after giving it many tries I am sadly disappointed.  </li>
            <li>we all have days where washing our hair, drying it, straightening/styling is the last thing on our minds -- or is something we just don&#x27;t have time for in our busy lives.</li>
            <li>I use this product every other day and it works very well.</li>

            <li> matter how busy you get as a career woman, wife, mom, and all the other roles you take on, take 60 seconds out to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Due to her mental and physical challenges, it is not always feasible to wash her hair by getting her whole head wet.  </li>
            <li> so dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t work for me (white powdery look is so 18th century).</li>
            <li> If your hair is thin and limp, this product refreshes your hair and leaves it fuller and most manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Does not work as a dry shampoo at all.</li>
            <li> I generally wash my hair everyday, but just like anyone...and any woman...</li>
            <li> We just had a kid this past year so finding time to take a full shower where the wife could wash her hair on a regular basis was difficult.  </li>
            <li> I broke my leg and was unable to shower every day - this product enabled me to have fresh hair every day.</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily roots but the rest of my hair consists of dry frizzy curls.  </li>
            <li> Just keep in mind a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I saw reviews from other website say this product gives greasy looking hair, well, do not blame on the product before you read the instruction and know what it is for.</li>
            <li> Was all I expected it to be considering brand and previous experience.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair</li>
            <li> Sorry I really wanted it to work &amp; had read about it in a beauty magazine.</li>
            <li> I will say it did revive my curls, making them wonderfully soft and not frizzy; but my roots looked worse than before I had used the foam.  </li>
            <li> It takes less than a minute to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; your hair with this.</li>
            <li> Never gets greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and the end of my hair is very dry and badly tangled.</li>
            <li> As a foam, it is not waterless and was a total disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It was poorly packaged.</li>
            <li> and if I shampoo everyday, then my hair dries out really bad.  </li>
            <li> and it is difficult for her to bend her head backwards for me to wash it in a basin.  </li>
            <li> That smell has made me shy away from using this too often.</li>
            <li> This product is disappointing.  </li>

            <li> I have curly hair that I can only wash twice per week with shampoo, yet teach several classes a week at the gym -- so this waterless foam shampoo helps me out in between hair washings really well. Pleasant smell and easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t leave a film or feel grimy. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair AND son&#x27;s hair as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  After you wash/blowdry your hair.  Run a little through your hair, let it air dry and magic \\&quot;beachy waves\\&quot; Perfect and lasts all day.  Refresh it with a little more.  Never gets greasy or heavy.  Love Love Love</li>
            <li> Used it on my elderly dog (who is terrified of tub) and it was great.  His fur looks as if he took a tub bath and he smells great.</li>
            <li> Does not work as a dry shampoo at all. Actually made my hair more oily</li>
            <li> Works like its supposed to.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works great! Definitely would give five stars in my opinion!</li>
            <li> We just had a kid this past year so finding time to take a full shower where the wife could wash her hair on a regular basis was difficult.  Hopping in and out, no problem, but the 45 minute hair washing process big problem.  Fortunately this stuff will clean a lot of the dirt and oil out of the hair and buys us a few more days of avoiding the full shower.  And it makes her hair smell nice too.</li>
            <li> I generally wash my hair everyday, but just like anyone...and any woman...we all have days where washing our hair, drying it, straightening/styling is the last thing on our minds -- or is something we just don&#x27;t have time for in our busy lives.

            <li> Awesome product, quick shipping... great experience!  I love using it when I don&#x27;t have time to fully wash my hair. It cleans and also gives me needed body.</li>
            <li> This is advertised as waterless, but it&#x27;s not like the waterless Suave spray that I&#x27;ve purchased locally.  As a foam, it is not waterless and was a total disappointment.  I have since purchased the waterless spray at my local Kroger&#x27;s market and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I tried my best.  I followed directions.  I experiments with varying amounts of product.  My hair still looks like hell if it doesn&#x27;t get a proper wash every day.  And it&#x27;s really too bad, not just because I could certainly use the help, but because I&#x27;ve always been more than satisfied with Suave products before - always.  It must be my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this in place of a curl scrunching gel. Dampen hair and then then rub in about five pumps of this. It helps my hair curl nicely and works on barely damp hair unlike other products I have used that require hair to be totally soaked. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair too crunchy, just the tiniest bit and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily.</li>
            <li> works well when travelling</li>
            <li> This product is good.  I have very fine hair and if I shampoo everyday, then my hair dries out really bad.  I use this product every other day and it works very well.</li>
            <li> So glad to finally have found a source for this little miracle worker. Love It !,,</li>
            <li> Good but wish it smelled better and less medical.</li>
            <li> Don,t like this at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this. I have dark hair so dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t work for me (white powdery look is so 18th century). But, while this smells okay, is very sticky and left my hair with a tacky feel.</li>
            <li> I broke my leg and was unable to shower every day - this product enabled me to have fresh hair every day.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this for a long time.  I am a full-time caregiver for my sister with cerebral palsy who is wheelchair bound and bedridden.  Due to her mental and physical challenges, it is not always feasible to wash her hair by getting her whole head wet.  She has a hump in her back and it is difficult for her to bend her head backwards for me to wash it in a basin.  What a wonderful product for individuals like her.  If you are a caregiver or if you just don&#x27;t always have time to wash your hair, this works miracles.  It gives her hair body and shine, as well as making it look fuller and easier to brush and style.  Leave it to Suave to come up with the best product with the best cost for the customer!  Will order this time and time again!</li>
            <li> Was all I expected it to be considering brand and previous experience.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good for my daughter who&#x27;s hair gets greasy really quick.  It does sting if it gets in the eyes though.</li>
            <li> Amazing Deal! works great and smells good!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product to take camping. It&#x27;s great to do &amp;#34;2nd day hair&amp;#34; on the 1st day. It&#x27;s really nice for someone elderly in the hospital. It smells so fresh and clean, but not too perfume-y.</li>
            <li> Just was I was looking for. Treseme used to have a similar product, however I can no longer find it. It has a light smell and refreshes your hair wonderfully. It says it&#x27;s for curly hair however I have long straight hair and it works perfectly. Just keep in mind a little goes a long way. Start with small amounts first and work your way up form there.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! It works very well and does not dry my hair out like another foam product that I used.</li>
            <li> This has a strong perfume smell which really bothers me because it seems overpowering to me. That smell has made me shy away from using this too often. When I did use it, it did seem to improve the oily appearance of my roots, but I do not find it to be a wonder product and I will definitely not repurchase this.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thin and limp, this product refreshes your hair and leaves it fuller and most manageable.  I rinse with a washrag and then blow-dry.  Just like a fresh shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product just made my hair sticky and crunchy. Sorry I really wanted it to work &amp; had read about it in a beauty magazine. A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love this product I had  been using the more expensive Tresemne but his works just as well and smells nice .</li>

            <li> It was poorly packaged. One bottle rolling around in the great big box, lost its entire content so that I had to clean the other 2 bottles before putting them away. It cleans hair a bit, but leaves 2 much residue and smell</li>
            <li> I use the spray version of this product on the days I stay home and Batiste - the rest of the time. Spray is ok. This foam didn&#x27;t work for me. It made my roots and the rest of the hair super crunchy, sticky and even dirtier looking. It had a feeling of a typical cheap hair product. However I forgot to mention that my hair is pretty fine and I have lot of it. It might work for those with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this on the shelves I was beyond excited, however, after giving it many tries I am sadly disappointed.  I have slightly oily roots but the rest of my hair consists of dry frizzy curls.  The bottle said it would remove oil and revive my curls between washes.  I will say it did revive my curls, making them wonderfully soft and not frizzy; but my roots looked worse than before I had used the foam.  So if you don&#x27;t have oily roots and want to replenish your curls this product might be perfect, but you&#x27;ll want to use much more than the 1 to 2 pumps the bottle suggests using.  If you have oily hair keep looking!  Don&#x27;t trust that it will remove oil like it says it will.</li>
