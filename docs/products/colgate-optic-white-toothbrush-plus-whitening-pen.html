            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>Tooth brush is great but the paste for whiter teeth does not work.</li>
            <li>great product works as advertised</li>
            <li>Still it is very handy.</li>
            <li>Love this, the brush is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great product, good results</li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant with both the toothpaste and the gel.</li>
            <li>I have heard good things about both items.</li>
            <li>and I loved it....</li>
            <li>Good brush&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t tell if whitening works or not</li>
            <li>On time, just what I ordered, good price.</li>
            <li>this is a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Great results- much better price than in any big-box store.</li>
            <li>Happy w my purchase :)</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to use and a good value.</li>
            <li>&amp; it really works!!!!!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything amazing.</li>
            <li>Nothing amazing, does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best whitening system I have tried.</li>
            <li>This works nicely.</li>
            <li>The gel contains hydrogen peroxide, which is clinically proven to provide effective whitening.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost too good to be true, but it is!  </li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;m impressed!  </li>
            <li>Love love love!  </li>
            <li>The handle is more flexible than most toothbrushes that I have used, and I liked the feel of it in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good product....whitener finishes too quickly...</li>
            <li>when using whitening products to stay away from coffee and wine while using them since these products soften the enamel of your teeth, it makes it more prone to absorb stains</li>
            <li>I use Amazon reviews for many things before I buy them that is why I am doing a review on this item even though I did not buy it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love how the whitening pen fits in the handle of the toothbrush and that is about it.  </li>
            <li>It may work for others but it sure did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I know for sure</li>
            <li>and I have healthy gums.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I like most every thing about this.  </li>
            <li>OK, the results are in</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure why I&#x27;d even whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li>(it felt like it was cleaning my teeth better).</li>
            <li>The whitening gel worked OK.</li>
            <li>Much better price than in stores.....</li>
            <li>So much better than the strips.</li>
            <li>it ok not to sure about the gel tho</li>
            <li>The kids love this as it leaves their teeth whiter than the &amp;#34;kiddy&amp;#34; one they were using.</li>
            <li>Also, it sticks more to your lips than your teeth, makes your mouth water</li>
            <li>I was able to get from the pen.</li>
            <li>My favorite on this line is the toothbrush and whitening brush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50, married and have a good job.  </li>
            <li>First off, I loved this idea of having a built in whitening pen.</li>
            <li>Gel helps even more and goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t need to be rinsed off.</li>
            <li>There are better products available.</li>
            <li>Did good whitening but the stuff inside ran out fast</li>
            <li>Easy to throw in purse&lt;</li>
            <li>so I thought this was such a great idea and from a reputable company.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush is fine.</li>
            <li>Seller was fine - The product wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I bought one for my sister and hers works fine.</li>
            <li>Results seen quickly just as stated!</li>
            <li>Having the whitening pen fit into the toothbrush is convenient and reminds one to use it after brushing one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>this is fantastic</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very unique stay-on gel formula that adheres to your teeth and starts working right off the bat.</li>
            <li>I have just ordered another of the Smile pens which gave me great results, it even lightened a temporary cap that I have on a front tooth (however not as much as it does real teeth).</li>
            <li>My husband and I both own and use this and agree that it whitens teeth better than any white strips.  </li>
            <li>Soft on gums, love the whitening pen!</li>
            <li>This brush is very comfortable to use,I think my teeth are much cleaner using this brush.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive teeth and can‚Äôt use most whitening stuff, but my teeth seem to love this one, and I‚Äôm hooked.</li>
            <li>I used the pen as advised and it seems to clump on your top teeth not making it very even and disappear after a minute on your bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a way cool design; and everything functions as it should.</li>
            <li>he saw a commercial on TV about it , tootbrush works good</li>
            <li>Such a shame, I loved the idea.</li>
            <li>Not bad; I just don&#x27;t like that it is slimy.</li>
            <li>First, I need to say that with OTC strips or dental trays from my dentist, my teeth whiten easily</li>
            <li>I love my morning coffee and even though I take good care of my teeth, they are not the whitest.&lt;br /&gt;The gel has a slimy texture, which I didn&#x27;t love, but it wasn&#x27;t such a big deal.</li>
            <li>2 weeks of using on top teeth only and see no difference between top and bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li>I prefer my own vibrating toothbrush, so I used the brush part of this a few times and then just started using my own brush</li>
            <li>Best tooth brush ever brushed my thee th then used the whitening pen because of my yellow teeth</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that there are some small rubber bristles built into the brush head, and hello nurse do they feel good on the teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy to do it twice a day, as recommended.  </li>
            <li>Very convienent , no strips and it works !!</li>
            <li>But I was willing to give it a go for whiter teeth!</li>
            <li>I had been using the Finishing Touch Smile whitening pen (which I bought from Amazon)</li>
            <li>It is uplifting my spirits to see myself smile with whiter teeth.  </li>
            <li>Honestly the whitening gel feels a bit gross</li>
            <li>: I received the Colgate Optic Toothbrush with the whitening pen complimentary from Influenster for testing and review.purposes.</li>
            <li>I would rinse my mouth with warm water several times.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>it has brought my teeth back a couple shades whiter will def keep using hoping to get better results as i cut down on the smoking and soda drinking GREAT PRODUCTüòç</li>
            <li>i saw results right away.</li>
            <li>The whitening pen fits right in to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The price is right too.  </li>
            <li>It seemed very easy and very simple to use.</li>
            <li>&#x3D; good product, if it doesn&#x27;t dispense whitening gel, try twisting the other way!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this new teeth whitening product out.</li>
            <li>A product that is on point and does exactly what it says...</li>
            <li>White Toothbrush Plus Whitening Pen was okay for about a week.</li>
            <li>I know this because I only used the pen on my top teeth.  </li>
            <li>After 7 days, my top teeth are still the exact same shade as my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>Both my top and bottom teeth were the SAME SHADE when I started, of course!  </li>
            <li>i wasnt aware of the whitening stick because I use the toothpaste</li>
            <li>your teeth are, then use this product, as it will just keep your teeth that yellow and not let more yellowing continue.</li>
            <li>I use my electric toothbrush first then use the whitener.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The steps are to first brush your teeth and then whiten them.  </li>
            <li>Tomorrow night will make exactly one week since I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush, toothpaste, whitening pen system and must I say it really works!</li>
            <li>But when I tried to use this for the first time, I must have clicked the pen about 500 times.</li>
            <li>Plus, I wonder if the rubber applicator counts as a gum stimulator ;)  </li>
            <li>The product runs out rather quickly, but there is the physical limit of sizing it to fit into the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The brush&#x27;s bristles are nice and firm and I feel like my teeth are getting a really thorough clean.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has tons of bristles in the right places, making it easy to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li>I was very excited with the idea of such a simple and easy to use whitening system.</li>
            <li>It Really whitens FAST !</li>
            <li>Good product, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>the toothbrush was quite large but nothing that i couldn&#x27;t get used to</li>
            <li>Once daily is working fine.</li>
            <li>The whitening pen works very well.  </li>
            <li>, I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>And I really recommend this to anyone who wants whiter teeth‚ô•</li>
            <li>I really like the toothbrush</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li>no moving your lips too much so it won&#x27;t rub off the paste you spread all over your teeth.</li>
            <li>This is cheaper than buying in a store (Walgreens wants $16 for it).</li>
            <li>fast delivery I like item</li>
            <li>I like it a lot and really like the whitening pen that comes with it.</li>
            <li>so I had to use a q-tip or my finger to apply the product evenly onto my teeth which still didn&#x27;t really go on evenly.</li>
            <li>I used this product every day for about 5 days straight.</li>
            <li>That‚Äôs how much use</li>
            <li>The solution housed in the handle was ok too, but really, there is not much point to it.</li>
            <li>Kind of gimmicky.</li>
            <li>Maybe my gums are more sensitive than the standard?</li>
            <li>I am trying a few more products to see if they will really work.</li>
            <li>Been using it pretty consistently for the last couple of weeks and not seeing a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>The tooth brush is comfortable (only use soft brushes).  </li>
            <li>Decent brush.</li>
            <li>so it washes it all away and you end up swallowing a decent amount.</li>
            <li>so I know it will take a little longer than most people.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, and this whitening pen does the trick without making them hurt for two days straight.</li>
            <li>a plus (but pretty much, the only plus).</li>
            <li>my teeth were super white, since I have sensitive teeth, it hurt).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using at night right before bed time.</li>
            <li>and I just told them I got a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>After I brush my teeth, I actually patted my teeth dry with a kleenex and found this helps make the gel go on smoothly and not clump up as much.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is icy mint, and isn‚Äôt very strong in the mouth, and the taste isn‚Äôt to bad, and works great on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>But my problem with this is that my gums are very, very sensitive.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is express white platinum, for white teeth to help make your teeth look more white and help build it up.</li>
            <li>okay though its hard to tell any difference.  </li>
            <li>Ordered a soft brush.</li>
            <li>After a week of use I saw a marked difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist</li>
            <li>So I switched to my old tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so if I was you I would switch between using a soft bristle brush every now and than.</li>
            <li>You apply the gel directly to your teeth so you can get it in all the crevices.  </li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>At first, it was a little strange and gooey putting the gel on but the learning curve was quick.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because sometimes the pen runs out very quickly though lately that hasn&#x27;t been happening.</li>
            <li>The gel did make my gums a bit sensitive and red, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li>after a full week using it, I see a small improvement in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad mine wasnt broken</li>
            <li>But I have noticed a little change in the color of my teeth,a little more whiter.</li>

            <li> Not bad; I just don&#x27;t like that it is slimy.</li>
            <li> First, I need to say that with OTC strips or dental trays from my dentist, my teeth whiten easily</li>
            <li> I love my morning coffee and even though I take good care of my teeth, they are not the whitest.&lt;br /&gt;The gel has a slimy texture, which I didn&#x27;t love, but it wasn&#x27;t such a big deal.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks of using on top teeth only and see no difference between top and bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li> I prefer my own vibrating toothbrush, so I used the brush part of this a few times and then just started using my own brush</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush ever brushed my thee th then used the whitening pen because of my yellow teeth</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that there are some small rubber bristles built into the brush head, and hello nurse do they feel good on the teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy to do it twice a day, as recommended.  </li>
            <li> Very convienent , no strips and it works !!</li>
            <li> But I was willing to give it a go for whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> I had been using the Finishing Touch Smile whitening pen (which I bought from Amazon)</li>
            <li> It is uplifting my spirits to see myself smile with whiter teeth.  </li>
            <li> Honestly the whitening gel feels a bit gross</li>
            <li> : I received the Colgate Optic Toothbrush with the whitening pen complimentary from Influenster for testing and review.purposes.</li>
            <li> I would rinse my mouth with warm water several times.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> it has brought my teeth back a couple shades whiter will def keep using hoping to get better results as i cut down on the smoking and soda drinking GREAT PRODUCTüòç</li>
            <li> i saw results right away.</li>
            <li> The whitening pen fits right in to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The price is right too.  </li>
            <li> It seemed very easy and very simple to use.</li>
            <li> &#x3D; good product, if it doesn&#x27;t dispense whitening gel, try twisting the other way!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this new teeth whitening product out.</li>
            <li> A product that is on point and does exactly what it says...</li>
            <li> White Toothbrush Plus Whitening Pen was okay for about a week.</li>
            <li> I know this because I only used the pen on my top teeth.  </li>
            <li> After 7 days, my top teeth are still the exact same shade as my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> Both my top and bottom teeth were the SAME SHADE when I started, of course!  </li>
            <li> i wasnt aware of the whitening stick because I use the toothpaste</li>
            <li> your teeth are, then use this product, as it will just keep your teeth that yellow and not let more yellowing continue.</li>
            <li> I use my electric toothbrush first then use the whitener.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The steps are to first brush your teeth and then whiten them.  </li>
            <li> Tomorrow night will make exactly one week since I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush, toothpaste, whitening pen system and must I say it really works!</li>
            <li> But when I tried to use this for the first time, I must have clicked the pen about 500 times.</li>
            <li> Plus, I wonder if the rubber applicator counts as a gum stimulator ;)  </li>
            <li> The product runs out rather quickly, but there is the physical limit of sizing it to fit into the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The brush&#x27;s bristles are nice and firm and I feel like my teeth are getting a really thorough clean.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has tons of bristles in the right places, making it easy to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I was very excited with the idea of such a simple and easy to use whitening system.</li>
            <li> It Really whitens FAST !</li>
            <li> Good product, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> the toothbrush was quite large but nothing that i couldn&#x27;t get used to</li>
            <li> Once daily is working fine.</li>
            <li> The whitening pen works very well.  </li>
            <li> , I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> And I really recommend this to anyone who wants whiter teeth‚ô•</li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> no moving your lips too much so it won&#x27;t rub off the paste you spread all over your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is cheaper than buying in a store (Walgreens wants $16 for it).</li>
            <li> fast delivery I like item</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and really like the whitening pen that comes with it.</li>
            <li> so I had to use a q-tip or my finger to apply the product evenly onto my teeth which still didn&#x27;t really go on evenly.</li>
            <li> I used this product every day for about 5 days straight.</li>
            <li> That‚Äôs how much use</li>
            <li> The solution housed in the handle was ok too, but really, there is not much point to it.</li>
            <li> Kind of gimmicky.</li>
            <li> Maybe my gums are more sensitive than the standard?</li>
            <li> I am trying a few more products to see if they will really work.</li>
            <li> Been using it pretty consistently for the last couple of weeks and not seeing a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush is comfortable (only use soft brushes).  </li>
            <li> Decent brush.</li>
            <li> so it washes it all away and you end up swallowing a decent amount.</li>
            <li> so I know it will take a little longer than most people.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, and this whitening pen does the trick without making them hurt for two days straight.</li>
            <li> a plus (but pretty much, the only plus).</li>
            <li> my teeth were super white, since I have sensitive teeth, it hurt).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using at night right before bed time.</li>
            <li> and I just told them I got a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After I brush my teeth, I actually patted my teeth dry with a kleenex and found this helps make the gel go on smoothly and not clump up as much.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is icy mint, and isn‚Äôt very strong in the mouth, and the taste isn‚Äôt to bad, and works great on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> But my problem with this is that my gums are very, very sensitive.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is express white platinum, for white teeth to help make your teeth look more white and help build it up.</li>
            <li> okay though its hard to tell any difference.  </li>
            <li> Ordered a soft brush.</li>
            <li> After a week of use I saw a marked difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist</li>
            <li> So I switched to my old tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so if I was you I would switch between using a soft bristle brush every now and than.</li>
            <li> You apply the gel directly to your teeth so you can get it in all the crevices.  </li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> At first, it was a little strange and gooey putting the gel on but the learning curve was quick.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because sometimes the pen runs out very quickly though lately that hasn&#x27;t been happening.</li>
            <li> The gel did make my gums a bit sensitive and red, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> after a full week using it, I see a small improvement in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad mine wasnt broken</li>
            <li> But I have noticed a little change in the color of my teeth,a little more whiter.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my teeth too sensitive like other systems do.  </li>
            <li> Those white strips tend to sit on the flat surfaces of your teeth, leaving the nooks and crannies looking dingy.  </li>
            <li> This little works well at removing decades of stains, and is highly portable.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it doean&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great idea to twist the gel out of the base of the toothbrush until it jammed after only a week.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but haven&#x27;t used it long enough either.</li>
            <li> I even dry my teeth off before I apply it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes a few months to see any whitening results, but after a few weeks I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this product is the whitening pen is not available individually and according to mfg</li>
            <li> The price is half through Amazon, about 8$ and in our local retail about 16$, plus you get a toothbrush !!</li>
            <li> This brush on tube is almost empty</li>
            <li> Refills for the whitening pen are not available which is the only part of this product that I like.  </li>
            <li> I literally spent over 15 minutes trying to get some gel out of there, and no gel ever came out.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t usually have a very white smile, sadly.  </li>
            <li> The gel does not cause any sensitivity problems like some of the other whitening products, thats</li>
            <li> I used the product religiously and hardly noticed any change in teeth color.  </li>
            <li> The brush is a bit too rough for me to use everyday</li>
            <li> They seem whiter, even if slightly.</li>
            <li> I have used whitening strip and trays with little to no results.</li>
            <li> It has these thick white squishy things that make brushing your teeth a hard task.  </li>
            <li> Heavy smoker and soda drinker and</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was very careful to not eat or drink for at least 2 hours after the application.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit messy in the application and expensive, thus only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening pens and the taste was not pleasant and stayed with me all day.</li>
            <li> I also did not experience sensitivity immediately as usual.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t look forward to using it everyday :(</li>
            <li> however, I guess my specific whitening pen was wonky because after several minutes of twisting it clockwise with no product being dispensed, I got frustrated and for s</li>
            <li> Small improvement to whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> You twist the pen once and a small amount of product will pop out.</li>
            <li> was hard at 1st.</li>
            <li> I find the toothbrush is a liitle rough---to hard for my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> My husband has always had problems with stained teeth and thought professional whitening was too painful.</li>
            <li> I drink at least a cup of coffee every day and drink tea too.</li>
            <li> I can understand before bed, but if you brush your teeth and use it in the morning, you can&#x27;t do ANYTHING with your mouth for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> Seriously upset.</li>
            <li> If they consider that a soft brush then I&#x27;d hate to see the medium.</li>
            <li> And now I&#x27;m going to be late for work!</li>
            <li> got tired of using it when a change did not occur.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice dramatic results and the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; was a bit chalky.</li>
            <li> Totally wrong thought process.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> *** and giggles twisted it COUNTER clockwise and TA-DA.</li>
            <li> It has no flavor, doesn&#x27;t make me salivate like crazy, and no one knows you have it</li>
            <li> This whitening system seems not to been too destructive to the teeth.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee all day and my teeth were badly stained.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> SHE didn&#x27;t have to stand there like an idiot clicking for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I hate the rubber inserts between the bristles, they feel awful and smell rubbery.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is terrible!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Too soon to determine.</li>
            <li> Results seen quickly just as stated! I also did not experience sensitivity immediately as usual. I&#x27;m not using twice daily as directed though. Once daily is working fine. Very convienent , no strips and it works !! I do take precautions to prevent sensitivity, use a toothpaste for sensitivity relief and use a floride rinse that builds enamel as part of the process. The price is half through Amazon, about 8$ and in our local retail about 16$, plus you get a toothbrush !!</li>
            <li> Easy to throw in purse&lt;br /&gt;Works great</li>
            <li> good product....whitener finishes too quickly...</li>
            <li> I have observed no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Heavy smoker and soda drinker and it has brought my teeth back a couple shades whiter will def keep using hoping to get better results as i cut down on the smoking and soda drinking GREAT PRODUCTüòç</li>
            <li> Great results- much better price than in any big-box store.</li>
            <li> I actually like the toothbrush and continue to use it.  I tried this product with the 3d whitening rinse also. I got this foe the obvious reason on the whitening pen hopefully working for my yellowing teeth. I used the pen as advised and it seems to clump on your top teeth not making it very even and disappear after a minute on your bottom teeth. I have used whitening strip and trays with little to no results. I am trying a few more products to see if they will really work. Next I am trying Crest HD 2 step paste and whitening gel kit. If that doesn&#x27;t work I will move on to shine whitening teeth whitening system. I have heard good things about both items. Hopefully this helps.</li>
            <li> This is a way cool design; and everything functions as it should. My favorite part is that there are some small rubber bristles built into the brush head, and hello nurse do they feel good on the teeth.</li>
            <li> i saw results right away. the toothbrush was quite large but nothing that i couldn&#x27;t get used to</li>
            <li> Happy w my purchase :)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, and this whitening pen does the trick without making them hurt for two days straight. I get compliments on how white my teeth are, and this is the only whitening product I use</li>
            <li> Made no difference on the colour of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It does make your teeth white and easier to use than the Crest strips (though I think after about a month of Crest strips my teeth were super white, since I have sensitive teeth, it hurt). Works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note when using whitening products to stay away from coffee and wine while using them since these products soften the enamel of your teeth, it makes it more prone to absorb stains</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s a basic toothbrush with a whitening pen.  Maybe it takes a few months to see any whitening results, but after a few weeks I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> The whitening pen works very well.  The product runs out rather quickly, but there is the physical limit of sizing it to fit into the toothbrush.  Having the whitening pen fit into the toothbrush is convenient and reminds one to use it after brushing one&#x27;s teeth. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use Amazon reviews for many things before I buy them that is why I am doing a review on this item even though I did not buy it from Amazon.  I bought this item at a well known retail store and paid a whopping $15 for it.  I had been using the Finishing Touch Smile whitening pen (which I bought from Amazon) and I loved it....so I thought this was such a great idea and from a reputable company. Love how the whitening pen fits in the handle of the toothbrush and that is about it.  The toothbrush is just a toothbrush and I saw no difference in my teeth after using the pen for a number of days strictly following directions. It may work for others but it sure did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this item again (won&#x27;t even finish using this one).  I have just ordered another of the Smile pens which gave me great results, it even lightened a temporary cap that I have on a front tooth (however not as much as it does real teeth).</li>
            <li> Good brush&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t tell if whitening works or not</li>
            <li> First, I need to say that with OTC strips or dental trays from my dentist, my teeth whiten easily and I see results immediately. This brush on tube is almost empty and I see NO difference! I didn&#x27;t use it on bottom teeth so I know for sure and I followed the directions. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> My husband has always had problems with stained teeth and thought professional whitening was too painful. Bought this product and within 3 days his teeth are whiter than they have ever been.  Bravo!!!</li>
            <li> Unlike some, I actually like the toothbrush.  The whitening gel did NOT do a thing though. 2 weeks of using on top teeth only and see no difference between top and bottom teeth.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I did not see a difference using this pen.&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of using it when a change did not occur.</li>
            <li> Ordered a soft brush. If they consider that a soft brush then I&#x27;d hate to see the medium. This &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brush just about ripped my gums apart and I have healthy gums. I used the pen for 2 weeks and saw no change. Rip off!</li>
            <li> Love love love!  A product that is on point and does exactly what it says...it&#x27;s almost too good to be true, but it is!  Would buy again and if it weren&#x27;t taken offensively I would buy them and pass them out as gifts.</li>
            <li> It Really whitens FAST ! Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Been using it pretty consistently for the last couple of weeks and not seeing a noticeable difference. I&#x27;ve only been using at night right before bed time. I even dry my teeth off before I apply it. I guess I&#x27;ll step it up to twice a day and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I drink coffee all day and my teeth were badly stained. After a week of use I saw a marked difference. My only problem with this product is the whitening pen is not available individually and according to mfg no plans to make it so. I have a Sonicare toothbrush that I want to use and I don&#x27;t like having to pay for a toothbrush just to get the pen. I have tried other whitening pens and the taste was not pleasant and stayed with me all day. The taste is pleasant with both the toothpaste and the gel.</li>
            <li> I like most every thing about this.  The tooth brush is comfortable (only use soft brushes).  It has a nubbed rubber pad on the back off the head that seems to brush your cheeks as you brush your teeth, I had not seen that before.  The dispensing of the bleach product is so well thought out. Now I just need to see some results. I drink at least a cup of coffee every day and drink tea too. I like that the bleach dispenser stores in the handle. I like you don&#x27;t have to wait 30 minutes with strips in your mouth.  I like this doesn&#x27;t make your mouth foam up like you have rabies.  I like the feel of the brush both on my teeth and cheeks.  I&#x27;ll update this review after I use the entire supply of bleach/whitener.    UPDATE- OK, the results are in, I really like this product.  It is so easy to use. It only takes a minute. I didn&#x27;t have noticeable results after a couple of days, but after a week, yes I did.  After a month there is a definite difference.  I will never use those yucky strips again.    I wasn&#x27;t sure why I&#x27;d even whiten my teeth.  I&#x27;m 50, married and have a good job.  Totally wrong thought process.  It is uplifting my spirits to see myself smile with whiter teeth.  Upgraded review from 4 to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> On time, just what I ordered, good price.</li>
            <li> I have been trying various products to whiten my teeth.  The whitening pen works.  Even my wife noticed.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> After using the product 4.5 days, the twisting mechanism of the gel product stopped working. Am returning the item to Colgate. Will give it another try.</li>
            <li> I prefer my own vibrating toothbrush, so I used the brush part of this a few times and then just started using my own brush (it felt like it was cleaning my teeth better). The solution housed in the handle was ok too, but really, there is not much point to it. It didn&#x27;t do anything amazing. Kind of gimmicky. I would pass on this one. Especially at this price.</li>
            <li> The Colgate Optic. White Toothbrush Plus Whitening Pen was okay for about a week. I didn&#x27;t notice dramatic results and the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; was a bit chalky. I didn&#x27;t like that at all. I thought it was a great idea to twist the gel out of the base of the toothbrush until it jammed after only a week. And that was the end of that. Nothing worked to get that gel out. Waste of money. There are better products available.</li>
            <li> Decent brush. In my opinion it doean&#x27;t last long enough. The whitening gel worked OK. Nothing amazing, does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Take for ever to get white teeth.</li>
            <li> I used this toothbrush and whitening pen religiously for 14 days, twice a day.  I was very careful to not eat or drink for at least 2 hours after the application.  The pen made no difference at all whitening my teeth.  I know this because I only used the pen on my top teeth.  After 7 days, my top teeth are still the exact same shade as my bottom teeth. Both my top and bottom teeth were the SAME SHADE when I started, of course!  That&#x27;s how I know the pen does not work.</li>
            <li> Love this, the brush is perfect. I&#x27;m used to a battery operated brush,so to go back to a manual brush was hard at 1st. This brush is very comfortable to use,I think my teeth are much cleaner using this brush. The whitener tho is going to take some time. I smoke&amp;drink coffee so I know it will take a little longer than most people. But I have noticed a little change in the color of my teeth,a little more whiter. I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;  Maureen</li>
            <li> Much better price than in stores.....&amp; it really works!!!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband. he saw a commercial on TV about it , tootbrush works good the whitening pen is stickie on your teeth. I suggest buying white strips over the pen. But ...nice try for the money you spend on this product. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I took a lot of antibiotics as a kid that stained my teeth from the inside.  Add red wine and coffee and I don&#x27;t usually have a very white smile, sadly.  I&#x27;ve had my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different whitening toothpastes and strips.  Then I tried this.  Wow, I&#x27;m impressed!  It&#x27;s only been three days but I can already see an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It doesn&#x27;t make my teeth too sensitive like other systems do.  It&#x27;s fast and easy to do it twice a day, as recommended.  It has no flavor, doesn&#x27;t make me salivate like crazy, and no one knows you have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It&#x27;s pricey, but I waited till it was on sale and I used coupons, so I got mine for about $7 at CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely happy with this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Soft on gums, love the whitening pen! Noticing a difference with a week of use.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush takes some getting used to but I noticed a difference just using the toothbrush for surface stains. Gel helps even more and goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t need to be rinsed off. You don&#x27;t even realize its there</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is fine. Honestly the whitening gel feels a bit gross and I really don&#x27;t look forward to using it everyday :(</li>
            <li> Expired bought one expired in a day. Returned next one expired in thirty days</li>
            <li> this is a good toothbrush. I almost never brush my teeth. and everyone tells me how yellow my teeth are and I get upset. so I bought this and when I started using this my friends starting telling me that my teen got white and they were asking how I did it and I just told them I got a new toothbrush. This is great. And I really recommend this to anyone who wants whiter teeth‚ô•</li>
            <li> Excellent results with brush and cleaner.  It&#x27;s my 2nd one.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best whitening system I have tried. So much better than the strips.</li>
            <li> This little works well at removing decades of stains, and is highly portable. The whitening pen fits right in to the toothbrush. I find the toothbrush is a liitle rough---to hard for my teeth and gums. This whitening system seems not to been too destructive to the teeth.</li>
            <li> i like this product it help me get a shade whiter it not going to do what a dentist can do but if you want a shade whiter then this product is what you are looking for buy it and try it you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> nothing compared to whitestrips- the whitening paste is sort of gummy- haven&#x27;t noticed any difference</li>
            <li> Great product, good results</li>
            <li> this is fantastic i wasnt aware of the whitening stick because I use the toothpaste but it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li> This works nicely. It is a bit messy in the application and expensive, thus only 4 stars. Still it is very handy.</li>
            <li> I used this toothbrush with the whitening pen for 7 days, morning and night. I was very excited with the idea of such a simple and easy to use whitening system. I love my morning coffee and even though I take good care of my teeth, they are not the whitest.&lt;br /&gt;The gel has a slimy texture, which I didn&#x27;t love, but it wasn&#x27;t such a big deal. I really like the toothbrush, I would buy it even without the whitening pen in a heartbeat (although buying this just for the toothbrush would be kinda pricey.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after a full week using it, I see a small improvement in the color of my teeth. They seem whiter, even if slightly. But my problem with this is that my gums are very, very sensitive. They haven&#x27;t bled (yet?) but they are swollen and they bother me every time I floss. Thus, I won&#x27;t keep using this pen. Such a shame, I loved the idea. Maybe my gums are more sensitive than the standard? Dunno...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I received the Colgate Optic Toothbrush with the whitening pen complimentary from Influenster for testing and review.purposes.</li>
            <li> this it ok not to sure about the gel tho</li>
            <li> Refills for the whitening pen are not available which is the only part of this product that I like.  I hate the rubber inserts between the bristles, they feel awful and smell rubbery.  I will not be buying another toothbrush just to get the whitening pen.  I guess the whitening gel works okay though its hard to tell any difference.  The gel does not cause any sensitivity problems like some of the other whitening products, thats a plus (but pretty much, the only plus).</li>
            <li> Never notice a difference ...so a bit pricy for a tooth brush .</li>
            <li> i think it is brighteneing my teeth after 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li> The kids love this as it leaves their teeth whiter than the &amp;#34;kiddy&amp;#34; one they were using.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush cleans and brightens my teeth along with the Colgate whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;The whitening part included with the tooth brush doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> If you like the shade of yellow your teeth are, then use this product, as it will just keep your teeth that yellow and not let more yellowing continue. But if you want to WHITEN your teeth find something else. I&#x27;ve used this for a month and no changes. It says you should use it in the morning and before bed. I can understand before bed, but if you brush your teeth and use it in the morning, you can&#x27;t do ANYTHING with your mouth for at least an hour. No coffee at work, no moving your lips too much so it won&#x27;t rub off the paste you spread all over your teeth. Also, it sticks more to your lips than your teeth, makes your mouth water so it washes it all away and you end up swallowing a decent amount. I&#x27;m really not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two days now and my teeth ARE already whiter. The brush&#x27;s bristles are nice and firm and I feel like my teeth are getting a really thorough clean. This is cheaper than buying in a store (Walgreens wants $16 for it). The instructions say to turn the whitening pen clockwise to bring whitener to the tip and has arrows to instruct you in case you don&#x27;t know what direction \\&quot;clockwise\\&quot; is- however, I guess my specific whitening pen was wonky because after several minutes of twisting it clockwise with no product being dispensed, I got frustrated and for s*** and giggles twisted it COUNTER clockwise and TA-DA. I&#x27;m glad mine wasnt broken but maybe it was assembled incorrectly? Anyway now it works and bottom line &#x3D; good product, if it doesn&#x27;t dispense whitening gel, try twisting the other way!</li>
            <li> Seller was fine - The product wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush ever brushed my thee th then used the whitening pen because of my yellow teeth and it worked in 2 mins after I applied it.</li>
            <li> This did not work on my teeth. From one reviewer&#x27;s experience, I brushed only my lower teeth. However, I didn&#x27;t see any difference between my upper and lower teeth.</li>
            <li> fast delivery I like item</li>
            <li> I use my electric toothbrush first then use the whitener. Small improvement to whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I always buy this toothbrush. I like it a lot and really like the whitening pen that comes with it. I gave it four stars because sometimes the pen runs out very quickly though lately that hasn&#x27;t been happening.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this new teeth whitening product out. It seemed very easy and very simple to use. It comes with a toothbrush and a teeth whitening pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steps are to first brush your teeth and then whiten them.  So I brushed my teeth with the toothbrush. The toothbrush is terrible! I couldn‚Äôt even brush my teeth with it. It has these thick white squishy things that make brushing your teeth a hard task.  Using this toothbrush made me feel like my teeth wasn&#x27;t getting cleaned enough. So I switched to my old tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I applied the teeth whitening product onto my teeth. You twist the pen once and a small amount of product will pop out. When I applied the product onto my teeth, it would apply in clumps and would not go on evenly/smoothly so I had to use a q-tip or my finger to apply the product evenly onto my teeth which still didn&#x27;t really go on evenly. So I kept the product onto my teeth until the product start to look like suds/foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I would rinse my mouth with warm water several times. I used this product every day for about 5 days straight. That‚Äôs how much use I was able to get from the pen. I did not see a difference in my teeth. My teeth didn‚Äôt look white, and then still looked the same. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> Tooth brush is great but the paste for whiter teeth does not work.</li>
            <li> Tomorrow night will make exactly one week since I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush, toothpaste, whitening pen system and must I say it really works! I have noticed an improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. Before they weren&#x27;t model white, but they weren&#x27;t sun yellow either. I just wanted something to help make my teeth a bit whiter and brighter and it did the job. I got it at Walmart for about $14.99/$15. The brush is a bit too rough for me to use everyday so if I was you I would switch between using a soft bristle brush every now and than. The gel did make my gums a bit sensitive and red, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle. I&#x27;m using it everyday, twice a day for a whole week and than after that I&#x27;ve decided to use it 2-3 times a week until I run out and than may pick up another one. It didn&#x27;t get my teeth model white, but it made it nicer than it was before and hopefully I get some compliments sometime soon! üòÄ</li>
            <li> Good product, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> PROMPT SHIPPING--&amp;#62; ITEM AS DESCRIBED--&amp;#62; EXCELLENT TRANSACTION--&amp;#62; WILL BUY AGAIN!!! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> My favorite on this line is the toothbrush and whitening brush. The toothbrush has tons of bristles in the right places, making it easy to reach the back teeth. Plus a tongue cleaner as well. Then the whitening brush that comes with it, that slides into the toothbrush from the bottom, making it one piece holder. Just take it out when you need it, and put it back in. The whitening brush has formula in it, and just squeeze the tube and will go on the pen for rubbing on your teeth. I have super sensitive teeth and can‚Äôt use most whitening stuff, but my teeth seem to love this one, and I‚Äôm hooked. The toothpaste is express white platinum, for white teeth to help make your teeth look more white and help build it up. I didn‚Äôt notice a difference until like a month in, using it. The mouthwash, which is another teeth whitening stuff. The flavor is icy mint, and isn‚Äôt very strong in the mouth, and the taste isn‚Äôt to bad, and works great on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me, is there a money back guarantee.  I used it as required, but no luck</li>
            <li> My husband and I both own and use this and agree that it whitens teeth better than any white strips.  The price is right too.  You apply the gel directly to your teeth so you can get it in all the crevices.  Those white strips tend to sit on the flat surfaces of your teeth, leaving the nooks and crannies looking dingy.  At first, it was a little strange and gooey putting the gel on but the learning curve was quick.  After I brush my teeth, I actually patted my teeth dry with a kleenex and found this helps make the gel go on smoothly and not clump up as much.  Our teeth seemed whiter after using it a couple of days.  Works great, easy to use and a good value.</li>
            <li> Love it. No issues would buy from again.</li>
            <li> Did good whitening but the stuff inside ran out fast</li>
            <li> I used the product religiously and hardly noticed any change in teeth color.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> First off, I loved this idea of having a built in whitening pen. But when I tried to use this for the first time, I must have clicked the pen about 500 times. I literally spent over 15 minutes trying to get some gel out of there, and no gel ever came out. Seriously? I bought one for my sister and hers works fine. SHE didn&#x27;t have to stand there like an idiot clicking for 15 minutes. I thought Colgate could handle something like this. Seriously upset. And now I&#x27;m going to be late for work!</li>
            <li> Regardless of some people&#x27;s complains, I could see my teeth got lighter, I assume they will continue on this path the longer I use the product.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> great product works as advertised</li>
            <li> Have used 5 days and already seeing big difference.  Very pleasantly surprised.  Plus, I wonder if the rubber applicator counts as a gum stimulator ;)  We&#x27;ll see what DDS says at my next visit.</li>
            <li> The Colgate¬Æ Optic White¬Æ Toothbrush is also part of the team. It has stain removers and polishing bristles to help remove surface stains. The handle is more flexible than most toothbrushes that I have used, and I liked the feel of it in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After brushing, I rinsed with the Colgate¬Æ Optic White¬Æ WhiteSeal‚Ñ¢ Mouthwash. You have to use it twice a day for 60 seconds each time. Let me tell you, 60 seconds feels like an eternity when you&#x27;re just standing there swishing around mouthwash. And I don&#x27;t like mouthwash. But I was willing to give it a go for whiter teeth! This mouthwash not only kills bad-breath germs, but it also whitens teeth and protects against future stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally (and in my opinion, the coolest part!), is the toothbrush&#x27;s built in whitening pen. Attached to the toothbrush handle, it contains whitening gel that you simply apply to your teeth twice a day after brushing and rinsing with mouth wash. It&#x27;s a very unique stay-on gel formula that adheres to your teeth and starts working right off the bat. You don&#x27;t even have to rinse it. Just apply and go! I did notice that there was a bit of &#x27;extra gel&#x27; and I just (ahem, pardon me) spit it out into the sink. The gel contains hydrogen peroxide, which is clinically proven to provide effective whitening.</li>
            <li> Not bad; I just don&#x27;t like that it is slimy. I like the portability of it. Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but haven&#x27;t used it long enough either.</li>
