            <li>Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie is an EXCELLENT creme hair dress and conditioner--think [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This product is best used just as you would a creme hairdressing.  </li>
            <li>best advice for using Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie is use it to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>With that said, this stuff is THE BEST CREME HAIRDRESS</li>
            <li>All these work great!</li>
            <li>The Gel Souffle was wonderful, but the stickiness wasn&#x27;t desirable (I&#x27;ve since stopped using any oils in my hair if I am using the Souffle and that works best).</li>
            <li>Smells great!  </li>

            <li>To each her own!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product its wonderful.</li>
            <li>I think this is Shea Moisture&#x27;s top 5 best products!</li>
            <li>thought I liked these products, but owner being bald sort-of CHANGES MY MIND ABOUT CONTINUING TO PURCHASE!…scary!</li>
            <li>Okay this is the best stuff.</li>
            <li>This product smell so nice!</li>
            <li>Oh, so loving this product!  </li>
            <li>Ok... This product is awesome, but why should you pay $22.99 for it when you could go to walgreens, walgreens.com, target, or target.com and get it for $9.99.</li>
            <li>We are very impressed with Shea Moisture because this product gives her bouncy curls from the top to the bottom with no frizz.</li>

            <li>&quot; it smells good and</li>
            <li>This product has a good meeting point between the two.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it on myself and my daughter, and it&#x27;s just wonderfully silky and light.</li>
            <li>Good product adds moisture to hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten Miss Jessie Baby Buttercreme and Curly Pudding for my daugthers hair before and loved the BBC but not the CP so this for me is a cheaper equivalent to the BBC.</li>
            <li>and I always get compliments when I walk by about how good my hair smells.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to using CURLS products, I always have good luck with those.</li>

            <li>After my ends were cut I used it and loved it.</li>
            <li>so I needed a good cream to moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li>and I hear a lot of good things about this product and brand</li>
            <li>It smells really good</li>
            <li>Its really good</li>

            <li>good addition to my collection</li>
            <li>I used to use it as my primary moisturize but have since learned that (for me) homemade products work best as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product i have 360 waves</li>

            <li>also a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I buy it at Walgreens or Target for a really good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it smells exceptionally good, moisturizes and curls my hair.</li>
            <li>Because it was made for women in Africa and I am not, I took a chance with this although had bought the coconut spray and loved it.</li>
            <li>The packaging is good.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was a kid.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST THING FOR MY CURLS, IT GIVES ME FABULOUS, MOISTURIZE AND SHINY CURLS DAY AFTER DAY.</li>
            <li>Good product but hella sticky and smells like pinã colada</li>
            <li>It does not provide good hold, because that was not what this product was intended for, so for hold</li>
            <li>My hair smells good, feels good and looks good.</li>
            <li>For buying this product on a whim, I am super impressed and hooked!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s got a great smell (which females love lol,) keeps your hair moisturized most, if not all day &amp; provides a good hold while keeping frizz to a minimum.</li>
            <li>The curls are more defined, and move and bounce and have a great feel.  </li>
            <li>and well if anyone has suggestions for me I&#x27;d be happy to take it. :)</li>
            <li>The curling smoothie works great for twist outs, even better when used with the styling milk.  </li>
            <li>Works great :)</li>
            <li>a great wash n go refresher with a spritz of water and some of this smoothed on top.</li>
            <li>I love it, and the smell is great.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s nice to find a good one that works for my hair and won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Instead of using all of those harmful products for your curls that does more damage than good, use this healthy beautiful elixer.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Please be aware that its best as a styling product.</li>

            <li>the smell is wonderful, has great ingredients such as coconut oils</li>
            <li>so well I couldnt wait to buy my own.</li>
            <li>Twist-outs are nicely defined.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a grown woman who don&#x27;t know how to do my own hair</li>
            <li>Buyer purchase at your own discretion.</li>
            <li>However, I also noticed a nice, put-together quality to my hair after using it and decided to keep it.  </li>
            <li>It kind of works like a BB cream for hair...</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but I can&#x27;t see any added benefit of using this product.</li>
            <li>I like it on my 3b texture hair and it smells nice</li>
            <li>REALLY NICE</li>
            <li>I use a good amount to make sure I coat all of my hair</li>
            <li>I also use she moisture&#x27;s hold and shine spray along with it, to ensure my curls stay nice and coiled.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so moist and my curls more defined and it smell good too.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think they will.</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>but it absorbs MUCH quicker and creates a SUPERB wave &amp; curl pattern....</li>
            <li>Her hair was absolutely gorg and the curls were so perfect.  </li>
            <li>I believe this product is responsible for how awesome my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Looking at how nice her look with the product I went out and brought it.</li>
            <li>Also, I like to mix my own pomades and leave-in using shea butter.</li>
            <li>My curls come out nice and it works for me.</li>
            <li>, THE SMELL IS NICE</li>
            <li>it smelled nice and looked lucious in the jar, but it didn&#x27;t help my hair, maybe 4b or c type, i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Love love love !!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try as I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product</li>
            <li>Smells great, works quickly.</li>
            <li>Love love loooooooove!</li>
            <li>This product has by far been the best solution for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is nice, it smells lovely and it does define my curls...</li>
            <li>Like most reviewers have already noted, it does not define curls on its own.</li>
            <li>The condition and style milk is the best leave in I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I am not A CRAZED curl definition natural; as a matter of fact perfect curls bore me.</li>
            <li>I used it for a twist out style and get surprised with the excellent result</li>
            <li>It does an amazing job of keeping my hair moisturized for most of the day.</li>
            <li>I love a nice sheen as well.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair, soft, shiny and hydrated....not to mention awesome smelling.  </li>
            <li>It held my natural curls perfectly and I dare you to try this product.</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing my husband is in love with it.</li>
            <li>The frizz is gone, and my hair has a nice healthy curl that stays all day.</li>
            <li>(Garnier Fructis Leave-In Conditioning Creme) to help provide more moisture as it can make my hair kind of crunchy as it dries through out the day.</li>
            <li>excellent for those who want to go natural.</li>
            <li>Moreover, SM products smell really good and are sulfate, paraben and cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>Easy peesy!     </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!  </li>
            <li>Like most shea moisture products, the curl enhancing smoothie has pretty good ingredients and is a good price.  </li>
            <li>This product is great as a moisturizer or a mix in my deep conditioner and smells great.</li>
            <li>This product does help my hair curl beautiful but doesn&#x27;t moisturize to much.</li>
            <li>it got great reviews and core ingredients are pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have 8 daughters &amp; this product ran out quickly!!</li>
            <li>The product smells heavenly and the texture is very smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it feels like creamy butter going on your hair.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be most pleasing on my 3c type hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Curl Enhancing Smoothie for about six months and continue to be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t explain how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this this product.</li>
            <li>you didn&#x27;t like the consistency of the Healthy Hair Butter from Carol&#x27;s Daughter</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay product has protein which makes my 4b to 4c hair feel brittle after a while..</li>
            <li>also it&#x27;s a but sticky feeling, but it is ok ..</li>
            <li>Believe me if you name most of the well known brands out there, I&#x27;ve tried them.</li>
            <li>So I couldn&#x27;t believe that any product sold in Walgreen&#x27;s or Target would be any better.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>Even using this product just with a leave in conditioner is still get defined voluminous hair, it leaves a light scent after it drives and a nice heathy shine.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments on how moisturize my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because as others said, the smell is just ok and takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>Then I tap again for the more kinky curly part of my hair (the crown area mostly)</li>
            <li>I love the smell which is the smell of all of Shea Moisture products and</li>
            <li>, IT SMELLS BETTER</li>
            <li>I Have tried many products.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with it.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I love this product for my TWA (Teenie Weenie Afro).</li>
            <li>I am glad I</li>
            <li>but once you put it on your hair it has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I will be sticking with Target for $9.99.</li>
            <li>I just love my hair when I use these products.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t pay more than you have too.</li>
            <li>LOVE this line</li>
            <li>DO NOT BUY THIS FOR ANY MORE THAN $9.99.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>and it also gives the best curl definition and moisture boost (I only wash weekly)&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>To say I&#x27;m pleased is an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this stuff..</li>
            <li>my daughter has mixed hair best</li>
            <li>I cowash my hair, apply the smoothie and then apply Eco styler gel for shine and more hold.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use this lovely Smoothie when I retwist at night.</li>
            <li>I have my mom hooked as well. :-)  </li>
            <li>I purchased it and fell in love.</li>
            <li>When my hair grows more I will see how it works for me.</li>
            <li>I had to start using mousse on top to hold the curls</li>
            <li>the upside, it did define and moisturize like it said. :)</li>
            <li>my curls look much more defined</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have to which I love.</li>
            <li>My curls are more underneath</li>
            <li>My ends curl the most for some reason, and this cream doesn&#x27;t define them at all.</li>
            <li>The texture is more of a cream than a butter or gel, so if you would prefer a butter, then this is not quite what you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
            <li>I mix a 3:1 ratio using more of the curl enhancing smoothie than the gel.  </li>
            <li>On any given day, you can find most Shea Moisture products for $9.99 at Walgreen&#x27;s, Walgreen&#x27;s Online,Target and Walmart.</li>
            <li>The supplier needs to check nationwide for a more comparable/competitive price.  </li>
            <li>The Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus line has great products to cleanse and moisturize for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>and I managed to sleep on this product for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I love this product, its been my go-to from I</li>
            <li>Get it elsewhere and buy 3x more product for the money you&#x27;re spending here.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>I have another moisturizing conditioner I use, but this was even better.</li>
            <li>and so what I do is apply this on the ends and around (not the top; it leaves my roots too oily)</li>
            <li>and I love how it hydrates my curls.</li>
            <li>I really do love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li>Love, love.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>If you want more defined curls, apply more.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love them all and works wonders when used correctly.  </li>
            <li>I am able to purchase 3 for the price that Amazon sells it for at Walgreens.com.</li>
            <li>I have since then done more research and am confident that I can get what I need out of this product.</li>
            <li>FALLEN IN LOVE WITH IT.</li>
            <li>I love it,thank you</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>The curl enhancing smoothie gives them all such great definition!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>but I like that better for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love this product, as it soaks into my hair and moisturizers it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>I love this product it defines your curls and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li>All that to say, I wanted to love this because so many naturals swear by it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>think this works better when combined with the gel</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li>S Curl no drip and many more.</li>
            <li>but more so the availability of it.</li>
            <li>and I truly love the fact that it holds my curls, feels and looks moisturized.</li>
            <li>But i gave it just one more try.</li>
            <li>It gave my hair more of a glow than shine.  </li>
            <li>It helps the hair clump and gives great definition, not so much hold though.</li>
            <li>I wanted a great hair product that would keep my type 4b hair moisturized, without too much gunk, so I bought this....</li>
            <li>Love the smell, can and will leave specks</li>
            <li>I love it and use it everytime I wear my hair curley.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay more then $12.00 for it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this defines my 3b 3c curls.</li>
            <li>but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus line.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and most of them</li>
            <li>men need to project more and this smoothie will get them attention...</li>
            <li>I used to love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling healthy but not greasy</li>
            <li>I love this; it works well on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the smell the most ..</li>
            <li>Gel works much better for my 4a type.  </li>
            <li>I switched to Deva Curl curly girl method and love it.</li>
            <li>The most I&#x27;ve seen it for was $7.49</li>
            <li>It felt like hay with oil on top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a wonderful product, I would definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li>This product is like magic.</li>
            <li>After using all summer, I wanted to say that as my technique improved I was able to wear styles for 4-5 days.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it&#x27;s light, as for hold out of 10 I&#x27;d give it a 3, but that&#x27;s not a problem</li>
            <li>and I love this shea moisture product.</li>
            <li>I love the Curl Enhancing.</li>
            <li>I love the smell (it smells like pina colada), but that&#x27;s about it.    </li>
            <li>It smells delicious and it does soften my hair, but I&#x27;m not too fond of the fact that I have to use multiple products in order for the Smoothie to work.</li>
            <li>I have the most defined and shiny curls.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and great for twist outs and braid outs</li>
            <li>I love Shea Moisture products, I have 4a-c hair.</li>
            <li>If your thinking about getting it, you&#x27;ll def be pleased.</li>

            <li>I must say that I have been pleased with the results of this products and it provides moisture and curl definition to my hair.</li>
            <li>But with continued use your hair will be healthy enough to form an awesome curl patterns.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that is much better than buying cheapo mouse every week or so.</li>
            <li>Also, it takes me like 5 seconds to do my hair in the morning, and that is a definite win!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT .</li>
            <li>Got the smoothie and the mousse for the price of just the smoothie on amazon &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This product is great though, it really gets those curls going.</li>
            <li>I just think i need a better leave-in conditioner than what I am using now</li>
            <li>But I have no doubt that it will work even better</li>
            <li>Each was $9.99!!!!:)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Did I say that I love this stuff?</li>
            <li>I am not in love</li>
            <li>Okay, I love Shea moisture products, I use the Curl Enhancing smoothie, along with the Shea Moisture curl souffle and these products keep my hair moist all day and makes my curls pop.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Used it as a styler for my twist outs and it was my favorite way of using</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll fall in love too.</li>
            <li>OK BYE</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many curl creams.</li>
            <li>I love the Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Hold Smoothie - 12 oz.  </li>
            <li>Also I love this product because of the presentation of the bottle and the fact that it has silk proteins to add strength to hair.</li>
            <li>I even tried a bit in my son&#x27;s hair since his hair is more curly than his sister&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>In the morning, my hair is shiny....manageable, healthy and well hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE FRAGANCE</li>
            <li>Very great smelling product that actually works!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m In love</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I love it...</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>it defines my hair even more.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to go out and try more of Shea Moistures products. :)</li>
            <li>It just sat on top of it and did not penetrate my hair follicles.</li>
            <li>I love its smell and for styling</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair soft with a nice curl and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>This particular product wasn&#x27;t a win for me but it can be for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li>smell was pretty good.</li>
            <li>It all works wonders, the end product is beautiful natural looking frizzless hair.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning to natural hair and after reading so many great reviews and being recommended by many to try this I decided to purchase.</li>
            <li>Fantastic scent, perfect weight, adds the right amount of shine and just really works.  </li>
            <li>Its WORTH IT!!</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and healthy, and my scalp no longer itches.</li>
            <li>I love the strong coconut, tropical smell.</li>
            <li>However, for best results use the entire Coconut &amp; Hibiscus product line: shampoo, milk conditioner, Curl enhancing smoothie, Souffle and light hold spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I love the shampoo and conditioner, the Curl Enhancing Smoothie was the product I was most excited about trying out.</li>
            <li>This is a very rich product, so someone with fine, porous wavy/curly hair has to use this sparingly.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best natural hair moisturizers out there it makes ur hair nice and moisturized soft to the touch</li>
            <li>This product is great for my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This product works great since it has the oils that my hair craves to be soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I even used it on my sons hair to enhance his natural curls and it looked great.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for those that have natural hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it works best for me on wet or damp hair.</li>
            <li>like how it makes my hair feel, it itself has a creamy and smooth texture but more like a butter as opposed to a cream/crème.</li>
            <li>Great product  for natural and processed hair.</li>
            <li>Works great for my daughters natural looks.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at the great responses people have had with this product.</li>
            <li>great product for natural hair.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or greasy and has a great smell.  </li>

            <li>but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m always looking for good prices for hair and make up because i buy so much of it</li>
            <li>MOISTURE IS RIGHT!!</li>
            <li>Too sweet and too strong!</li>
            <li>If you figure out the right amount it is really effective.</li>
            <li>I know other curlies have had good luck with the Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie, but I just can&#x27;t get with this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Now I have this full jar collecting dust on my counter!</li>
            <li>The Styling Milk was great, but there were definitely days that I wished it were more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is that it&#x27;s wheat, corn, and soy free.  </li>
            <li>Easy to spread out over all my hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells strong</li>
            <li>The only nice thing about it is the fragrance - it smells really good.</li>
            <li>If you want a bouncy twist-out, you will have to add a butter or gel to it to get a really strong hold to you hair.  </li>
            <li>first impression, was that this stuff was AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It give great moisture, good curl definition, and I like the fact that it is organic and completely made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love the sweet smell of it as well.  </li>
            <li>My hair cannot live without this product, it is one of the best moisturizers ever, I recommend this product for natural hair!</li>
            <li>You only need about 4 dime sized scoops of this after applying your favorite leave in ( my fave is oyin handmade hair dew which smells like sugar cookies) and you have perfect soft shiny moisturized ringlets that still shrinks but hang more</li>
            <li>I have fine strands that are packed densely all over my head in kinky coils like pen springs, and the Smoothie did NOT absorb into the hair at all.</li>
            <li>it works so fine.</li>
            <li>I prefer heavier creams for my fine locks.</li>
            <li>My curls are baby fine yet dense.  </li>
            <li>my hair has both a fine texture but tighter curls.</li>
            <li>and I just washed my hair 2 days ago and all was fine until I put this smoothie in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It turns my frizzy  mess into a perfect, wavy curl.  </li>
            <li>My hair dries and holds in perfect little coils and curls for a bout 4 days before they turn to frizz.</li>
            <li>I tap my finger lightly into the product for each braid, twist etc.</li>
            <li>i hope it doesnt , and if it does, does anyone have any alcohol free recommendations</li>
            <li>Plus, I needed to find a use for it after the buy one, get one free sale.</li>
            <li>I smooth some of this in my hair after I wash it.</li>
            <li>And it is worry free because it is all organic</li>
            <li>Walgreens even has free shipping on orders $25 and up.  </li>
            <li>plus, you get free shipping.</li>
            <li>My hair regimen includes, spraying on a light amount of Roots of Nature, Mango Oil &amp; Cupuacu Butter, Curl Reviving Spray and then applying Shea Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- cruelty free</li>
            <li>but  this defined them and had a light hold which for me kill 2 birds with  stone.</li>
            <li>And the style was smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li>It is just great for styling, softening, sealing, moisturizing, and overall hair health.</li>
            <li>I love all of shea moisture products, they&#x27;re just pricey but its worth it</li>
            <li>He sometimes uses the smoothie with the styling milk, especially if it&#x27;s a really humid day.  </li>
            <li>The sulfate free shampoo is fantastic as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, smooth, not greasy and works well on my two strand twist out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for taming individual frizzies.</li>
            <li>so I use it with a light hand (about a dime size).</li>
            <li>In the morning, I spritz my hair with some water and lightly apply this to my hair to revive the curls.</li>
            <li>Also, one of my girlfriends also said she experienced the same thing when she applied to her scalp but not when she applied to just her hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, my hair feels soft when I apply it.</li>
            <li>I loved how my hair kept feeling moist and soft as each day wore on with the style.</li>
            <li>Its really good for twistouts,super soft but well defined.</li>
            <li>Its made with natural ingredients and it works better than any chemical based products i&#x27;v tried and keeps your hair nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got good hold and yet leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell originally, but my friends say that it smells just fine, so don&#x27;t take my word for that.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of oil and moisture to make my hair feel healthy again.  </li>
            <li>I use this product for doing either two strand twist or flat twist and its great.</li>
            <li>This is also a very moisturizing product, and I have used it all on its own on wet hair to do a braidout, and I got beautiful results.</li>
            <li>It smells beautiful and makes my natural curls really curly.</li>
            <li>Love it , it is great for laying down curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that tends to be kind of loose and frizzy, this makes my curls more defined all throughout and they stay smooth!</li>
            <li>it keeps it nice and soft, but the smell was a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>If u add oil to ur hair, add it first or it will just sit on top.</li>
            <li>First the fragrance alone will make you fall in love with it.</li>
            <li>I watched a video where a woman said that before she put the Smoothie in her hair, first she used an alcohol-free hair gel THEN applied the Smoothie on top of it.</li>
            <li>so it is worth the price!</li>
            <li>But it looked familiar and so I asked my daughter if we had already tried it.</li>
            <li>The curl enhancing smoothie underneath it is golden!</li>
            <li>It was more cost effective than many of the other brands--great for a full-time student like me.  </li>
            <li>with this cream I only apply it in the morning after my shower and it does its magic on its own.</li>
            <li>This product definitely moisturized my hair and held the formation of my natural curls perfectly.  </li>
            <li>A friend told me about the product stating she liked to put this product on her hair when wet because it gave her nice wavy curls.</li>
            <li>honestly would have given this product five stars, but it does have a tendency even with a light handed application to leave a white film, but it fades away, so I&#x27;m fine with that since I use it at night and by the morning it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>KCCC gives the best definition and hold but my hair always felt to hard.</li>
            <li>Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie was great for my high porosity natural hair.</li>
            <li>But other than that I think next month along with my five jars of this smoothie that I will also order the rest of the products since I had such a wonderful and delightful positive affects with this one.</li>
            <li>Amazing! was skeptical but it works great.</li>
            <li>It works great as a layer on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing on natural hair.</li>
            <li>It also has a sweet tropical scent to it that should be pleasing to most people, it really does smell like a smoothie...which I guess is what they were going for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, affordable and effective</li>
            <li>I am caucasian and have wavy hair that can go straight or curly but most curl products leave my hair sticky and make my scalp itch.</li>
            <li>THIS WHOLE LINE ROCKS :)  </li>
            <li>Once all the residue had vanished the day after, my hair was nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I had been purchasing supermarket hair products like Garnier, but the Shea Moisture products got such good reviews I decided to splurge.</li>
            <li>They really need to stock more.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have nothing but good things to say about the SheaMositure line and look forward to continued use of their products.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice smell to it and it has a soft hold.  </li>
            <li>The volume was a fraction of what it once was, but with frizz, could appear to be twice as full.</li>
            <li>&quot; I really did wear it well :-)</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair nicely moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I would say my hair only has a good curl pattern when its shorter.</li>
            <li>I use the whole shea moisture brand, and I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oil and doesn&#x27;t make you hair more curly</li>
            <li>and I had a good thing while it lasted, but I&#x27;m definitely moving on.</li>
            <li>Good product for my coarse hair</li>
            <li>Grainier Fruits at the drug store is better if it is a real emergency.</li>
            <li>I apply some argan oil after lunchtime and after going to the gym to revive it a bit, but it really doesn&#x27;t need much more.</li>
            <li>Now those curls are more defined and much smoother.</li>
            <li>I always am on the look out for good hair products for my relaxed hair, which is coarse and does not like relaxers.  </li>
            <li>This thing is so sickeningly sweet</li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair moisturuzed and full.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product overall.</li>
            <li>(BUT definitely not as bad as coconut oil)</li>
            <li>My hair is type 3 natural and this product is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>No bad chemicals&lt;</li>
            <li>Since transitioning and having a little girl I find that of all the natural, black hair products from Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful, Kinky Curly, Shea&#x27;n&#x27;More, etc that Shea Moisture products are the best bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li>What I love the most is that it is truly moisturizing for my dry hair, and gives great hold, especially when I just wash my hair and leave.</li>
            <li>GET IT ON WALGREENS OR TARGET&#x27;S DIRECT WEBSITE AND MORE LIKELY GET FREE SHIPPING!!!    </li>
            <li>If you have dry hair this is the one so far that works best for my hair..</li>
            <li>On the other hand, because the product hydrates curls, it is great for finishing your \\&quot;wash and go\\&quot; or \\&quot;rod set\\&quot; after it dries.  </li>
            <li>The cream is thicker than other products that I have used so it gives my curls and twists some weight, and works great for my 4b hair.</li>
            <li>I have found some hair smooties that work a little better, but this a good product.</li>
            <li>Seriously this is THE best hair product that I have ever invested in.</li>
            <li>I use Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie as a moisturizer in low-humidity weather (it contains glycerin) for my super dense, Afro-textured hair.</li>
            <li>The product is great but $30 is definitely way too much for it.</li>
            <li>I went natural and sulfate free almost a year ago, and I dont think I would have been able to do it if I didnt find the Shea Moisture product line.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, but don&#x27;t use too much or it will appear white.</li>
            <li>The second time I did a twist out, I used the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Gel Soufflé and the style held for two days and was perfect for a defined puff the following day.</li>
            <li>And even more importantly the price tag in comparison with my old product line</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for refreshing second day hair because it helps curls to spring back and smoothes frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product from Target and it smells great but for my naturally frizzy/curly hair it really doesn&#x27;t give me much condition like it says it should.</li>
            <li>However, this product was different, it added a nice shine, it left my hair soft, and best of all, whether I was rocking a wash and go or a braidout, it really made my curls pop!</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for adding life to your hair without weighing it down or making it feel greasy.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product because of the price (i bought it at a store and it was very reasonable)</li>
            <li>I would love to buy more to support the company, but it takes a LONG time to use up the container.</li>
            <li>Shea Coconut Curl Smoothie actually worked pretty good in creating waves &amp; curls (once you work with it)</li>
            <li>The good news this is a great product a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>First!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much!!</li>
            <li>I buy the whole line, shampoo, conditioner and body wash!!</li>
            <li>This product never fails me!</li>
            <li>It has quite a strong coconut, tropical smell-which I love, but may be too much for those who are sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It also really brings out the natural curls in her hair making them more defined!</li>
            <li>However, after about two weeks of using it 3x per week (along with liberal spritzes of a homemade mixture of filtered water, Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil and John Freida Curl Around conditioner) noticed that my hair was getting very crunchy and hard.</li>
            <li>If I continue to have such amazing results, I will continue to buy the product.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reverted back to my natural hair texture (4c) about a year ago and this is the best product I have purchased thus far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days, and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li>moisturize, I apply leave-in conditioner and then Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie on freshly washed and conditioned hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying, but for $30...</li>
            <li>Many years ago I had 3 years of natural hair growth that I used to just 2 strand twist with Carol&#x27;s Daughter products.</li>
            <li>Most of the natural women I have come across on You Tube, in forums, and in the natural locs grps love this product also, but they use it w/ Eco Styler w/ olive oil to get the desired curl definition they want.</li>
            <li>In addition... using this product without a gel or something to define curl will result, in my opinion, a more soft, wispy look.</li>
            <li>but it was worth</li>
            <li>Love the product hair is soft and bounce</li>
            <li>They are well worth the $7.99 each.</li>
            <li>This is making my transitioning to natural so much better.</li>
            <li>love that this line is 100% natural and organic.</li>
            <li>I guess it works better on natural twisting</li>
            <li>and my hair is soft and has movement and the lovely sent of the smootie.</li>
            <li>Since this product is used mostly by sisters in the natural movement, they are scared it will take MONEY away from  the PUSHERS of CREAMY CRACK.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this product to any curly girl who loves organic products that work just as good even better than many expensive products marketed to curly girls</li>
            <li>To be honest, my hair didn&#x27;t feel different at all.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product and wanted to love it, however after using the whole jar</li>
            <li>I have also used as a deep which was effective</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried about spending 12 bucks on it, dont worry, its worth it.</li>
            <li>Just a quarter worth is enough to coat my whole head; however, if your hair is longer you might use more (at most a 2 dollar coins worth).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth it</li>
            <li>It contains most, if not all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Amazing did everything it said it will do left my hair moist smooth works great on my thick hair</li>
            <li>I am talking freshly washed and out the shower hair (no towel drying).</li>
            <li>I love the affordable price and how soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>Love it for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Doesnt take much, you have to rub it in really good unless its at bedtime (covered with a silk bonnet) because it will leave a white film.</li>
            <li>I have tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s, Kinky Curly, Keracare Natural hair line and more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth looking into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>In Conditioner (about 50 cent piece worth).</li>
            <li>but this product was worth none of my money.</li>
            <li>I have natural  4C hair, and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>and this product contains more \\&quot;natural ingredients\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>This may not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth it to try.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 2 becauseof the nice smell, but as for styling properties and the price, it only rates a 1.</li>
            <li>It has a nice non-overbearing smell, thick, custardy, texture, and provides great hydration even on really hot days (I live in a non-humid environment).</li>
            <li>Right now, the only thing that provides that kind of hold is gel, but I don&#x27;t like using gel on my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is softer than ever, with great definition, without being spongy, or stiff.</li>
            <li>Right afterwards, I evenly distributed two 50 cent pieces worth of Shea Moisturizer Smoothie.</li>
            <li>and that seemed to be about right for me.  </li>
            <li>once I get the right conditioner.</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy this product as much as I have ;)</li>
            <li>My daughter is of West Indian decent and this product is fantastic, it provides moisture without the oil like residue that the olive oil would leave in some clothing.</li>
            <li>i love it so much, it defines my curls, makes my hair super soft and shiny and smells heavenly</li>
            <li>This stuff both makes my hair super soft and frizz free</li>
            <li>Even my most damaged areas were feeling healthy again, and my split ends were way less noticeable-maybe even on the road to repaired.</li>
            <li>I have actually been able to wear my hair natural more than I used too since using this product.</li>
            <li>It holds that curl without becoming frizzy and it is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It is pretty pricey but is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am a 3c/4a hair type and it has been a true struggle for me to find what really works well in my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells better and makes my hair soft and moisturized with water for 2-3 days in the middle of the most humid weather.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product for those would like to go natural, it really works on hydrating and control those frizzy curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and tend to get migraines easily</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for natural hair works well with twist outs and any natural style.</li>
            <li>It seems to work well for my relaxed hair, but I&#x27;ve only used it once which was last night and my hair feels great this morning.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and easy to manage and I like the smell of it.</li>
            <li>(wavy hair easily gets a \\&quot;Soul Glo\\&quot; look), and the hold is natural but persistent.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been able to get about 3 days of wear with my wash and go, but it has been very humid</li>
            <li>This product provides needed moisture to dry hair and allows curls to clump nicely.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic (it is a little overpowering at first, but fades nicely).  </li>
            <li>Amazing results every single time.</li>
            <li>Plus the price is great in comparison with other natural hair care products.</li>
            <li>I am new to the natural hair biz (3b almost shoulder length hair) and am still trying to find the right potion of products for keeping my hair moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>I apply it while my hair is still wet, it does an amazing job at retaining curls.</li>
            <li>The first few uses, I loved the way my hair felt.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the product (my first of the Shea Moisture Line) after continually seeing it at Target.</li>
            <li>, you most definitely will not like the Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li>at first.</li>
            <li>I was able to get second day hair out of this one application.</li>
            <li>its the only product I use on most days after I apply my leave in, no gel - no serum, nothing.</li>
            <li>partly what drew me to their soaps when they first became a part of the Target line.</li>
            <li>Really?!</li>
            <li>I have no idea why it&#x27;s about 3x as much on Amazon!</li>
            <li>this works better as a DC but have found cheaper products that do the same thing</li>
            <li>I have found that with Shea Moisture products there can be so many different uses for each product!!!</li>
            <li>The product smells great and will last a long time for $10 bucks.</li>
            <li>this curling smoothie is affordable 7.99 - 11.00 in most drugstores like Walmart Walgreens Target, smells like pineapple now&amp;laters candy, and it actually works!</li>
            <li>and I enjoy how soft it makes my hair feel days after using it.  </li>
            <li>After trying MANY products to moisturize my 4a/b hair, I finally found the one!</li>
            <li>I decided to pull out the Shea Moisture curl enhancing smoothie for the first time this week, thinking it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li>The first day I just showered and put it in my hair and then braided my hair and went on my way.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I love this product!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what it smells like.  </li>
            <li>Well, I work in a corporate office, so I applied more.</li>
            <li>Two cons: it made my hair crunchy at first until I smoothed the strands with my fingers</li>
            <li>I love the entire line.  </li>
            <li>Shea Moisture really helps out a lot!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I even started liking the smell, which is SO interesting because I actually am not a fan of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I hope this journey is finally taking a better road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off I would like to say...</li>
            <li>It felt soft and light</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since the summer and my hair absolutely loves this smoothie!</li>
            <li>It has become an instant staple!! :-)</li>
            <li>so imagine what my two strand twists were looking like when I first tried this hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like this at first but now that I know how to use it</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>and i put cantu&#x27;s coconut curl cream in FIRST place.</li>
            <li>This was one of the first products I bought.  </li>
            <li>I use this for many different purposes.</li>
            <li>but I apply it one day and don&#x27;t have to apply any more product the next day.</li>
            <li>It hydrates instantly, and has a lovely smell.</li>
            <li>However after months of using it I found it leaches alot of residue on my forehead and sides of my face leading to consistent break outs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the price here is PRETTY STEEP.</li>
            <li>Try there first.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it for my twist</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was hooked.</li>
            <li>It defines my 3 a, b curls and gives them so much bounce and volume!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update Bioinfusion has a curling pomade that does EXACTLY what I was hoping Curl Smoothie would do</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time I fell in love with a curl-enhancing product, if ever.  </li>
            <li>At first, I like how my hair felt moisturized after a dryer set.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried using it</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>Now my curls pop instead of just a big ball of frizz on top of my head.</li>
            <li>Please look carefully at the ingredients and make sure you are not spending more money for this product which doesn&#x27;t contain all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Ingredients better than similar products.</li>
            <li>It drys lightly firm, with a good sheen.  </li>
            <li>It is also great if I don&#x27;t have time to do all that to just pull my curls out a bit on my dry high hair for a bit of a messier natural look.</li>
            <li>As a new natural, I went over the top with trying products.</li>
            <li>and it really helps the curls stay put if I apply right after rinsing out the SM gold line restorative conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it states with friendly natural hair ingredients.</li>
            <li>It not only smells good , but it holds my fine, kinky hair down...</li>
            <li>They make a fine, all natural product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing like coconut and other fruits.</li>
            <li>However, this product is available at my local Walgreens for about $10, so I suggest if you have a store nearby to check there first before purchasing online!</li>
            <li>It is extremely moisturizing, and smells like a nice coconut conditioner.</li>
            <li>it smells good, but i perhaps used a little too much.  </li>
            <li>Only ten bucks :) Some people say that the scent is too strong</li>
            <li>love their whole line of hair products as well as some of their facial products.</li>
            <li>On top of that, my hair is very kinky/curly, and I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t actually do what it says - &amp;</li>
            <li>Nice but be careful and don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li>very, very did I say very curly hair.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not doing twists or anything special, I just leave it with this and a spray of water and a natural oil for the day.  </li>
            <li>I added didn&#x27;t come out right and straightened my hair instead it doesn&#x27;t really put too much curls in my hair</li>
            <li>while this is the best for me, I have a client that it does the opposite with her natural hair, it makes hers drier, and limp.</li>
            <li>But on the first day out of the shower, my hair can get really curly.</li>
            <li>The first thing I will say is that I really believe the outcome of any product depends on your hair type and</li>
            <li>A true natural hair product.  </li>
            <li>Oh and it smells great too..but can be a little overwhelming if you wear different scented products at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have type 4 hair that is sensitive, fine and gets dry easily.</li>
            <li>My braid outs looked lovely when dry in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am very particular about which curl products I use</li>
            <li>She also made sure to tell her audience that her hair was DRY when she did this.</li>
            <li>This product left me with bouncy, moisturized curls and easy to manage hair.</li>
            <li>but I imagine it would work ok on dry hair as well</li>
            <li>but it would just be a lot more work to coat through dry hair.</li>
            <li>For the first 5 minutes, my hair had a light layer of white coating.</li>
            <li>I normally put this in right after a co-wash and then, add a pure shea butter pending on the style I&#x27;m going to work that day.  </li>
            <li>now to last a good, long time.</li>
            <li>Ok so in full disclosure, my all time #1 leave in styler/moisturizer is Qhemet Biologics Alma &amp; Olive Heavy Cream...</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with it is the strong scent of coconut.</li>
            <li>The tricks to managing frizz is to divide hair into sections, they can be large, and then apply the product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but these products help your hair maintain moitsure without a large concentation of humectants, glycols or even butters.      </li>
            <li>After much research, and trial and error, I decided to try this (partly because of all the positive reviews).  </li>
            <li>Smells great, organic, only con is that it leaves a slight sticky coating on my 4A/4B curls.</li>
            <li>It always enhances waves with no need for extra stuff and can be applied wet or dry best moisturizer i&#x27;ve used in 25yrs.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely not a go to product if you are looking for hold, which is fine by me.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair like me and type 3 in nature, I would say definitely give this a try.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and worked well for me however a little pricey.</li>
            <li>And I want interested shoppers to realize that they don&#x27;t have to pay this high price.</li>
            <li>I have very thick and unruly hair, the Curl Enhancing Smoothie  left my hair perfectly moisturized and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and moist,looks shinier with a soft hold , and my hair smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have 4a hair and this does moisturize very well.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use too much of it to do so.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my type 3 hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so much money here, but I would recommend not buying it here.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this stuff really does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>I can vouch to say this stuff really does it for me.</li>
            <li>The Shea Moisture products have really transformed my hair.</li>
            <li>smells is also very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff is simply fantastic, and it&#x27;s only a bonus</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something to replace KCCC for me and read and heard so much about Shea Moisture</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t moisturize my 3c/4a hair at all.</li>
            <li>I have been using it faithfully through much trial and error</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be repurchasing and I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li>could try using just one of the products instead of two, but for my hair they work very well together.</li>
            <li>It works very well in holding twist.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the versatility</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all about really paying attention to your hair and learning it&#x27;s likes and dislikes.</li>
            <li>And yes, if you leave too much in one spot and don&#x27;t scrunch in the lotion you will get those darn \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; spots people keep talking about.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying this product again, and for my curly headed girls beware this product is very drying, use sparingly</li>
            <li>I really like how my hair feels using this product.</li>
            <li>This did not work very well to define my curls alone.  </li>
            <li>leaves it very curly</li>
            <li>Then again I don&#x27;t have much in my experience to compare it to.</li>
            <li>and I was ready to go.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Who buys this for so much money.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my hair as a moisturizer( doesn&#x27;t really define curls) and it really helps my hair</li>
            <li>my hair is really growing fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this smoothie.</li>
            <li>I have really curly/kinky hair</li>
            <li>Some people use too much.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much work through.</li>
            <li>Real men use this too.</li>
            <li>I purchased that from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>really wanted the Shea Moisture brand to work for me after I heard the founders story.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Best suited for:&lt;br /&gt;Medium to very curly hair</li>
            <li>When I woke up my hair was very curly (once I removed the twists).</li>
            <li>and you can even use it alone if you don&#x27;t like too much product.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>I made the error of using too much on my hair while damp</li>
            <li>I ended up using this as a conditioning mask, which worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I gave the product away to a neighbor who is mixed (Caucasian &amp; African American), and it worked great for her.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care for it all that much for my 3c hair.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb the product very well.</li>
            <li>It is very dense, creamy.</li>
            <li>This stuff really feels like its working.</li>
            <li>this smoothie is really the ticket.</li>
            <li>really works on it.  </li>
            <li>My hair stayed moisturized that whole time.</li>
            <li>My 4b/4c hair seems like it wants to like this product</li>
            <li>so, it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so i had to wet it some more to get it to shine</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I bought them for.</li>
            <li>she used to much, so</li>
            <li>I really cant go without it.</li>
            <li>Really this product, shea butter and olive oil is all I really use on my hair.</li>
            <li>But then, in the Atlanta humidity, all my curls went straight and frizzy in minutes.  </li>
            <li>, I thought Maybe I used too much product.</li>
            <li>I really really REALLY tried to like this product</li>
            <li>I really just needed something to get rid of the frizz and help my curls shape up and stay for the day, and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>The great part is that this tub is going to last me forever, and it only cost me $10 from a local store-</li>
            <li>it being much cheaper in price</li>
            <li>I really do like this product.</li>
            <li>AND IT IT IS VERY CREAMY.</li>
            <li>My only question is: Why in the world are people paying $18.95 for a 12 oz when it&#x27;s available at Target for $9.99?</li>
            <li>, I could not bear to use it much.</li>
            <li>and it really holds the moisture in your hair, and is never sticky.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of products, just a couple that your hair really loves.</li>
            <li>My hair absolutely loves LOVES LOVESSSSS this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has really curly hair.  </li>
            <li>and it does make your hair greasy if you put too much in your hair</li>
            <li>This smoothie really tamed my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The one thing I&#x27;d like to warn others about is that if you are protein sensitive this more than likely isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>So far the Shea Moisture Products have worked for me making my hair more manageable and soft; this product so far being one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased I&#x27;ve finally found natural products that work, and as a bonus they smell heavenly too.</li>
            <li>I see this product getting recommended on most natural hair styling tutorials, so there&#x27;s definitely something here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a really great line for people with thick, wavy, curly, and coily natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different natural products and methods, but this one did it for me.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and these are the only two that work for me so far.</li>
            <li>This product is very light, but extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have 3b, fine, causasian hair, thats been bleached several times, straightened, frizzy and highly porous.</li>
            <li>But the smell of strawberries is just too strong for me, it does not go away and you have to smell it all day long.</li>
            <li>I originally bought one jar and at the second use, I returned to Target for me</li>
            <li>I know there is a possibility of her hair rubbing out or coming out although I use satin hair savers and a satin kid&#x27;s bonnet, but I am doing my part to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen due to negligence on my part.  </li>
            <li>I originally used this product for twist-outs, but it always left my hair feeling like it had a lot of build up.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but feels so good!</li>
            <li>The ingredients are great, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>somewhere in there)--for this kind of hair, use coconut oil or raw shea butter as an overnight moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>$10 is more than what I usually pay for a hair product, but this is worth it.</li>
            <li>The acne showed up the next day after using this for the first time on freshly washed hair worn out.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the product is creamy which I usually dont like (I prefer oils and butters) but overall I am happy.</li>
            <li>This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural, cruelty-free products.</li>
            <li>It has a mild aroma of a tropical fruit, with a creamy texture that most likely aids in well defined curls with minimal frizz.</li>
            <li>I really had high expectations of this product...</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s natural and wet it looks amazing, but completely dries out once the water is gone.</li>
            <li>When I first started wearing my natural curls, I&#x27;d read the product description instead of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s all natural and not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>It is weird though because the SM curly milk works good on my hair and has most of the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>First of all, I was in Duane Reade searching for hair products that I could use on my naturally curly hair, and I was struggling on whether to get this or not because of the price.</li>
            <li>I first used it when I was transitioning from relaxed to natural &amp; I borrowed it from my sister &amp; it</li>
            <li>infused sweet treat.(It&#x27;s not actually edible.)</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t figured out the full potential of it yet</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only is my hair super wavy after using this (thus the title of \\&quot;crazy lion curls\\&quot;), but it also smells wonderful and stays very soft and pliable.  </li>
            <li>I need something that weighs my hair down more when I wear it curly.</li>
            <li>Hence I do put it on sparingly and water it down a bit, but all in all I am enjoying not using gels and volume enhancers.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other produce! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>At night i use just a little of the smoothie on its own to keep my hair soft overnight.</li>
            <li>this same product and this whole line of products is much cheaper at target for instance this particular product is 4.98 at target right now.</li>
            <li>one of my new favs!</li>
            <li>Well move over Queen Jess, there&#x27;s a new sheriff in town!  </li>
            <li>I wanted badly to like this product,aft I saw so many good reviews,  </li>
            <li>I use Wave Nouveau moisturizing lotion then putmy hair in medium size 2 strand twist and use just a dab per section Jamaican Black Castor oil on the twist but mostly concentrating on my ends.</li>
            <li>main reason for this review though, is that I got this product at Walgreens for $9.99.</li>
            <li>This is some decent stuff for curly hair.</li>
            <li>love the smell although it does kinda suck that i have to make sure i rub it in thoroughly or ill</li>
            <li>B001RVKB50 Double Strength Super Gro Maximum]]) had hormones that could lead to cancer...</li>
            <li>Something about the coconut oil as a main ingredient just does not sit well with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives your hair a natural shine last longs, its light</li>
            <li>I found this product at target and decided to try mainly because of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely five star worthy.</li>
            <li>This works great on my thick curly white girl hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I put in waaaay too much, but even still, my hair looked fantastic even if it was a little goopy.  </li>
            <li>this product is fairly new to me, but i tried a small amount from a store and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does much for my hair because it is so short right now</li>
            <li>Calms my frizzy damaged hair and turns it into silky smooth waves and loose curls</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but there&#x27;s definitely something not so natural hidden in this product because my natural hair sheds tremendously when it does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>I am not or have not been highly impress with Shea moisture products but this one may become a staple in my hair regimen.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Just a little on my hair gives it a soft feel and makes it very easy to style.  </li>
            <li>My other sister and mom, who are both natural, also use and love this product.</li>
            <li>idk.&lt;br /&gt;Cause when it&#x27;s wet, it looks PERFECTLY FINE.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t really that curly or hard to manage, I have soft waves but this product totally keeps the shine without looking greasy, well defines the curls for more than one day!!</li>
            <li>just a little more sparingly.</li>
            <li>it leave my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li>For myself, I found that the Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner worked better in styling (its a little bit lighter on the hair).</li>
            <li>But just because we are curly girls it does not mean that we should throw away our money.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 3 and she has mixed hair, very curly!!</li>
            <li>The bright side: a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>When used as a leave in conditioner, it made my hair smell amazing, kept frizz at minimum, and defined my curls and made them shiny without making them hard or crunchy.</li>
            <li>It clumps my curls together nicely and leaves my dull hair shiny.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair pretty oily, a little goes a long way, smells amazing though</li>
            <li>I love this product but this one was watered down!</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for a truely all natural leave in conditioner, i was wondering if this product contains any alcohol?</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural, it smells yummy, and it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>I have now been natural for almost a year and this product doesnt really work for my hair.</li>
            <li>After a few days I noticed that after it dried the curls wouldn&#x27;t really hold as great as I thought.</li>
            <li>It was very curly and my hair felt really soft.</li>
            <li>the curls stayed in place the whole day and it was so soft.</li>
            <li>used this on my daughter&#x27;s finer 4b hair and her curls were very pronounced and soft.</li>
            <li>The natural hair community raves about this product so much that i felt that i had to try it, even though it cost $17.</li>
            <li>They both fight frizz really well and keep his hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>but it does keep hair very moist and soft.</li>
            <li>It really helped bring out the natural curl in my hair, and it holds without making it look 80s crunchy.  </li>
            <li>so when I see products that say use quarter size or go lenient I usually ignore that because I just have too much hair to do so</li>
            <li>know a lot of naturals LOVE this product, but it did not work for me and did not fit into my regimen.</li>
            <li>so that means nothing harsh for my hair and safe for the environment.  </li>
            <li>Within seconds, my curls became more defined as it dried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of factors that go into people getting good results and others getting really poor results from some products.</li>
            <li>This product smells really nice, it is thick and moisturizes my hair.</li>
            <li>very heavy product which is good considering my hair drys out rather quickly but definitely use sparingly as this product is rather thick (which is just fine for me).</li>
            <li>Every other day will do you just fine.</li>
            <li>It was silky, soft and smooth, even my previously dry ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So the following afternoon when my hair was bone dry, I used an alcohol-free hair gel, THEN applied the Smoothie on top of it, and my curls began to stand out.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t smooth or soft to the touch, just dry.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to like it because a lot of other naturals use it, but it seems like for me all it did was enhance the frizz in my hair and my styles didn&#x27;t last for more than a day.</li>
            <li>- the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is right after application</li>
            <li>, especially when you discover this right before work at 8 a.m.</li>
            <li>Its also perfect for next day curls, I just wet them a little and then apply this the same way</li>
            <li>It is quite light and smooth, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for &#x27;my&#x27; hair, I have 3c hair been natural for 10 years, and this is the only product that keeps my hair moisturized without having to constantly reapply everyday.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t enhance my curls as much as my homemade concoction; seems more wet and conditioner-feeling than having the right balance of oil which I am not sure I like as much on my hair; I will use it up for my twists.</li>
            <li>I had tried two other styling products from Shea Moisture before I purchased the Curl Enhancing Smooth (I tried Curl Styling Milk and the Curl Enhancing Gel Souffle).</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy on my hair, and keeps it pretty frizz free and soft.</li>
            <li>Usually i cringe at products that are ten or more but its worth it.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>However it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>just can&#x27;t compare, so I&#x27;ve taken my savings and bought some new shoes...</li>
            <li>This is my new product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always looking for new products to take care of my hair.</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean and it is not sold in my country, so i had no choice to order it.</li>
            <li>Arrived in new condition.  </li>
            <li>Her hair was not hard at all, the curls were defined and soft!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing but left my hair sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li>I picked this up at Target when I was on vacation and ran out of my regular product which is only available online.</li>
            <li>I am American/Caucasian with thick, curly, and frizzy hair... more frizzy really than anything.</li>
            <li>Her dry hair issues subsided really quickly.</li>
            <li>Can I rave about how much I absolutely love this product for a little bit?!</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product,i even used it for my 4 yr old daughter...</li>
            <li>My hair is normally very soft, has \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; and bounce to it.</li>
            <li>so I applied this with a heat protectant before blow drying and my hair was very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have purchased too many products with very little luck.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells pretty and it definitely makes my curls softer and thicker and as for definition</li>
            <li>The jar is pretty big</li>
            <li>Start with a small amount and add more if needed.</li>
            <li>Coconut and Hibiscus has been a Godsend to my 4c natural hair!  </li>
            <li>You really have to be careful on how much you use, too much will make it look greasy</li>
            <li>I also love the feeling on my hands after I use this, with other products like gels or serums, my hands are left sticky, with the smoothie</li>
            <li>Next, I apply coconut oil with Bergamot and frankincense essential oils (love the smell) to each section, followed by a spritz of water and essential oil blend.  </li>
            <li>I have hair like Tanika Ray (google her) and I first have to detangle my hair in the shower with a different conditioner.</li>
            <li>I expected the product to be too heavy, greasy and sticky but the product smells great and isn&#x27;t at all greasy, sticky, gummy or gritty.</li>
            <li>After the first time using it, there was a VAST difference.</li>
            <li>just used it for the first yesterday, and because my hair got smushed in my sleep last night (as it always does when it&#x27;s curly)</li>
            <li>The first couple days I had not used enough in my hair.</li>
            <li>but then I used a generous amount and WOW!</li>
            <li>and although i&#x27;m no longer rocking my curly natural fro, it did my fro justice!</li>
            <li>it used to be my first choice in moisturizers but now put this in SECOND place</li>
            <li>It truly enhances the curl, which is something worth mentioning as my locks go straight, curly and every other look within that spectrum.</li>
            <li>I first tried it as a deep conditioner</li>
            <li>My search is complete!</li>
            <li>so all my natural sister buy this product !</li>
            <li>It will make it feel nice and soft for a few hours, but then your hair goes back to the norm.</li>
            <li>Let me say that I&#x27;m a true product junkie having spent hundreds of dollars on over priced hair products through the years.</li>
            <li>It smells a little Strong when applied</li>
            <li>I used too much the first time because my hair was super dry, and learned through the residue I saw the next day that it only takes a bit.</li>
            <li>I really thought I was going to enjoy using it after reading other reviews on different</li>
            <li>Oh, I would like to also mention when using this product I use it on dry freshly washed and conditioned hair.</li>
            <li>But the next day, it gets so soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>Your hair begins to curl quickly when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, smooth &amp; not weighed down at all.</li>
            <li>However, the positive side is that it truly moisturized my 2c/3b afro american hair and held my wavy pattern.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it moisturizes my hair very well alone, but when mixed with oils it seems to work better.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps to define my curls and REALLY moisturizes my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>and finally I finger comb in  a little bit of a very light gel.</li>
            <li>I am always interested in having natural hair but it does become very difficult to manage and does not offer many styling options (not denying my true texture</li>
            <li>So right now I&#x27;m using Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque as a leave in conditioner (it&#x27;s not heavy) and their Black Soap for Dry Scalp, and absolutely love both.</li>
            <li>I stopped using relaxers recently and my natural hair was becoming extremely course, my roots looked frizzy and not maintained.</li>
            <li>and take a little more only if I need it.  </li>
            <li>Curly hair is usually much more dry than other hair types and this is what I use to ensure that I get the hydration that I need.</li>
            <li>but it took me a week to clear up the acne.</li>
            <li>My sister is natural and I&#x27;m relaxed</li>
            <li>I may be protein sensitive</li>
            <li>I have natural locks and used this product to twist and hold my locks.  </li>
            <li>I should say that it is quite a natural smell though</li>
            <li>I would recommend this without a doubt to all those who have natural hairstyles coils, twists, spirals, locks, afros.      </li>
            <li>Parts of it can be wavy, straight, or curly all at the same time.</li>
            <li>When I tell you after using various shea moisture products that my hair is very hydrated and moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m once again transitioning to natural hair and so far I&#x27;ve been amazed by how well the shea moisture products work in my hair.</li>
            <li>I will continue to give this product a chance and see how it helps to grow out my natural hair texture.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I prefer Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li>The result was that my hair was soft again.</li>
            <li>(who is now 4 mos old today) in developing a natural haircare routine for her</li>
            <li>I have been natural for almost 2years</li>
            <li>I have been having issues with frizziness the last year or so, but don&#x27;t want it straight; I like having the wave.</li>
            <li>/wave I like, but my hair stays soft and it gets some conditioning with this product.</li>
            <li>Also purchase at Target, Amazon price is completely marked up.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have learned it really depends on your individual hair.</li>
            <li>and i have been natural for 2 1/2 years.</li>
            <li>it leaves it feeling REALLY REALLY soft and its not greasy.</li>
            <li>All of the items I&#x27;ve tried smell like pina colada and leave my hair feeling soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and this stuff works</li>
            <li>My hair is also glycerin sensitive.</li>
            <li>I use the Curl Milk on my ends and to soften week old styles.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I have 4b or very kinky hair.</li>
            <li>She is natural as well</li>
            <li>but I think that is because I am protein sensitive.</li>
            <li>And it feels so soft &amp; it looks healthier.</li>
            <li>This product is what I&#x27;ve been looking for ever since I went natural.</li>
            <li>It is a natural product and is not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product if you&#x27;ve got hair like mine, but especially if your curls are tighter.</li>
            <li>Soft</li>
            <li>It will enhance your curls and for me it offers a lite hold when styling my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and wanted a product that would moisturize and define my curls.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays soft.  </li>
            <li>BUT as far as my 4a hair type goes....it doesn&#x27;t give sheen when it dries.    </li>
            <li>Anywho, I am a natural girl</li>
            <li>Seems to work well so far for my 4a 4b hair texture.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for about 7 years and learning to care for my hair had always been a struggle.</li>
            <li>make my hair soft and curl</li>
            <li>It really is natural and affordable too.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it if you want your natural curls to pop.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Im almost 3 months natural and</li>
            <li>Maybe I just have this natural frizz that can&#x27;t go away once it dries</li>
            <li>It brings out the curls and keeps your hair soft.</li>
            <li>So far, I have used it for braid-outs.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm, and even on my relaxed ends, the curly pattern lasts well in most areas for at least a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I have been completely natural for 7 months.</li>
            <li>I tried this product early on in my journey with the transitioning kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Caucasian but have very curly and coarse hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>then a natural oil (I use coconut oil), then the cream (Shea Moisture Curl Enhance).</li>
            <li>, It has a really soft hold, so depending on the humidity, you might have to add a gel along side it in order to retain definition for an extended period of time..</li>
            <li>Make my hair soft</li>
            <li>Keeps hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am upset I was foolish enough to buy the whole line of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have 4a natural hair.</li>
            <li>My hair came out moisturized, soft to the touch, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>They all are natural and this defines the styles they wear.</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair well moisturized and soft to the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I used this for my curls after watching a youtube video of how this natural girl made her curls pop out.</li>
            <li>I am in my 40&#x27;s with natural curly 3a/3b hair.</li>
            <li>I have 3 all natural daughters and my wife decides to try this &amp;#34;Shea Moisture&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it cost to much here.  </li>
            <li>did t help my hair feel soft but this product does.</li>
            <li>I use it on my 12 year old boy, and myself.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly 3b hair with 3c in the crown area</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and my curls shiny.  </li>
            <li>I am a naturally curly, type 3b, 3c hair and this cream</li>
            <li>Both times my hair was fluffy, light, moisturized and</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft that it didnt even hold the curl.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft n shining</li>
            <li>Leaves them soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>I shaved my hair 3 years ago to start my natural journey.</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I was worried what my natural hair  would look as it grew.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair really soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>There is one ingredient that isn&#x27;t natural which is caprylyl glycol.</li>
            <li>I read that it&#x27;s just used to preserve the natural ingredients in the product and won&#x27;t cause any harm to hair.</li>
            <li>Recommend this for anybody and even their kids with everything being all natural.</li>
            <li>My hair never dried.  </li>
            <li>It helps define&lt;br /&gt;your natural curls.</li>
            <li>My hair became completely soft.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner really help, of course, and the styling products are simply the icing on the cake.  </li>
            <li>, you get a lot of it, and it has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Light enough to use multiple times a day if necessary.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to some scents and this is one of those scents my nose cannot stand.</li>
            <li>This product does contain glycols which they try to hide in the ingredient list by listing it with natural components.</li>
            <li>hair, which has been a hassle for the last few weeks for me, is now one of my favorite features, once again.</li>
            <li>l was skeptical about trying this, even though the reviews were good.</li>
            <li>I am very new to the natural community having just did my Big Chop about a week ago.</li>
            <li>Right now her hair is 3a/b/c with 2c in the very bottom back, thick yet fine, and rather long for a baby (she was born w/ a headful of hair) and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was disappointed by the fact that it did not make my hair curlier (which I thought it would do, due to the fact that it says \\&quot;curl enhancing\\&quot;) and that there was a very fine line between getting good moisture with no frizz and greasy stringy hair.</li>
            <li>and I let it sit on my hair over night; I first wash and air dry my hair and then use the LOC Method.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair but live in a dry climate</li>
            <li>For fine haired coily girls like me, it&#x27;s been a challenge to find a product that works consistently to provide LASTING moisture to my dry hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully this will end my never ending search for a daily moisturizer for my super dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is like paste and only weighs down my hair which is curly/frizzy fine hair.  </li>
            <li>i love using this on my kids they&#x27;re mixed asian and black</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously going to buy more shae products.</li>
            <li>At first I stopped using any product whatsoever so that any residue would dissipate after a few washes as this product contained coconut oil and made my hair very oily.</li>
            <li>cream does the same exact thing, and I get the same results as when I attempt to use coconut oil by itself to pre-poo.</li>
            <li>and I think I could actually wear it with out pairing it with a gel (I usually use a gel over  serum to get more control).</li>
            <li>It enhances/defines my curls (particularly the ones in the back, which are the curliest).&lt;br /&gt;MY FAULT WITH</li>
            <li>BUT I see is that when the hair dries it does still look a little dry, but I guess it will become better.</li>
            <li>I end up weighing my hair down with too much product because I have to put so much moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, especially for 4b/c textures.</li>
            <li>I was just careful in the amount of product I put in because of my fine strands, but after my perm rod set my curls were so beautifully, and softly defined, I was shocked!</li>
            <li>No other curly product compares!</li>
            <li>Little is fine enough because it curls your hair even when you put some on your palm and massage it into your head.</li>
            <li>The only drawback to this is that because it is moisturizing and acts as a sealant at the same time, if you use it on wet hair, it won&#x27;t dry as quickly, but there are many work arounds for this, such as using a blow dryer to dry your hair instead of air drying it.</li>
            <li>(I have 4a, kinky hair with normal porosity, and medium coarse strands).</li>
            <li>use this and shea moisture curling souffle mixed together in the palm of my hand, rub it all over my slightly wet (but not driping) hair, then let it air dry, and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;I find that wetting my hair with my hands in the mornings, makes me use much less product</li>
            <li>This product really helps to moisturize my hair and scalp which are  uncomfortably dry.</li>
            <li>He has a really course and dry afro.</li>
            <li>I know too much protein can dry the hair so that may have been the reason.</li>
            <li>I thought my real hair was nappy, unruly, dry, frizzy, and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently in the process of transitioning from relaxed hair to natural and I must say this product helps bring out my hairs natural curls.</li>
            <li>(that didn&#x27;t work for my thick hair, I need more than sparingly) and if you over use, you may leave a white film on your hair.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and makes your hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>My hair was very soft, but when I separated my hair it just became a big frizz ball.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for African American women who are going natural/are natural.</li>
            <li>She all my good stuff! :-(</li>
            <li>God bless the folks who make this stuff, because no other product tames my tresses like the Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li>Shea Moisture smoothie has none of that junk, all good-for-hair ingredients, smells heavenly and defines my curls like no other.  </li>
            <li>No regrets!</li>
            <li>I have major allergies and have had to replace almost all of my products.  </li>
            <li>This is a thicker version of the curl milk, I would suggest using it if you are lacking extreme moisture in your hair, but using the curl milk first.</li>
            <li>My ends aren&#x27;t dry any more and no more breakage.</li>
            <li>&quot; hair, with little success, and part of it I learned might&#x27;ve been from a) lots of split ends and b) heat damaged-hair from one time using too near-boiling water to rinse, and my one-time out of 4 years that i blow-dried.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this product, I was worried because it seemed like this product was mainly for African American type hair.</li>
            <li>smells good, very moisturizing, and a little goes a long way because it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li>My curls were defined and I had a light hold which wasn&#x27;t too hard or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>All I do when I get up is use a couple of dabs of Shea Moisture to condition and style my hair apply a dab or two of ECO styling gel, use a silicon scrunchie to pull my hair back from my face, dab a little bit of gel to smooth any stray hairs on my temples and forehead or the back of my neck with a brush, throw on a head band or two</li>
            <li>I have dry and thick 4B/4C hair, so moisturizing is very important to me.</li>
            <li>And at least twice a year, they go on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s and Walgreen&#x27;s Online for BOGO free.  </li>
            <li>Product would have 5 stars if offered in larger quantities which would decease my frequent trips to Target.</li>
            <li>And this is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve ever used that provides both moisture and soft hold.  </li>
            <li>It smells heavenly and really clumped my curls together when I used it sparingly on just conditioned wet hair.</li>
            <li>and I barely need any.</li>
            <li>my hair is extra soft.</li>
            <li>I recently cut my hair off and went natural.</li>
            <li>However, I will definitely use it for my 12 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li>No shine either, as for curls, they&#x27;re barely there.</li>
            <li>The next day I showered and straightened my hair (without reapplying the product) and my hair felt SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>Sooooo soft FINALLY after years of coarse-ness!  </li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve had so far is the humidity on a rainy day --</li>
            <li>Overall, I think Shea moisture offers a quality value product.</li>
            <li>I just recently decided to wear my hair natural.</li>
            <li>While the Smoothie did leave my hair soft and managable, the curls definitely weren&#x27;t defined.</li>
            <li>One night she only tried the Curl enhancing Smoothie to wake up with baby soft hair and her curls &amp;#34;co-operated&amp;#34; with her when she was doing her hair.</li>
            <li>Be warned though it is marked up by over double the price you can settle for elsewhere.</li>
            <li>She says its ok for moisturizing, but not great for styling</li>
            <li>I still think the product is just okay not great</li>
            <li>As mentioned in earlier reviews, the smell can be strong, I have learned that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I bought this product when I was transitioning - only applying it to the new growth and now that I have a short pixie cut which I wear as a TWA (teeny-weeny-afro)</li>
            <li>It was only then that I realized how dry my hair really was.</li>
            <li>The product dried fairly quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to constantly deal with dripping product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 2 and a half year daughter, her hair is very curly and was getting so dry that I was really worried.  </li>
            <li>The product smells good, but it made my hair look dull, didn&#x27;t enhance the curl, and my hair felt a little dry.</li>
            <li>I did the twist out and my hair looked a shiny hot mess.  </li>
            <li>As it grows longer it tends to look like a hot mess.</li>
            <li>I had originally bought this product for my daughter, who has thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the thing, I applied it liberally to my very damp hair and proceeded to flat twist and air dry overnight.</li>
            <li>After having such a positive experience with Miss Jessie&#x27;s Buttercream, I thought I&#x27;d try this due to</li>
            <li>Now the prices from the available sellers are ridiculous</li>
            <li>Because of this I&#x27;ve transitioned back and forth between natural and relaxed hair several times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am mixed, natural 5 yrs and have 3 different textures in my hair...</li>
            <li>I love the definition it gives my curls without the crunchiness left behind by gels.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product applied to wet hair.  </li>
            <li>While my hair is softer and more manageable than the average black person, it tends to get dry</li>
            <li>so she won&#x27;t have to go through the countless relaxers, hair damage, inadequate hair products, and the general all out battle with her hair that I&#x27;ve gone through and continue to go through.  </li>
            <li>Well to say the least many of the other products that I&#x27;ve tried does not even come close to this.</li>
            <li>I only end up washing my hair because it gets oily, but it is not caused by this product (my hair is naturally oily within a few days curly or straight).  </li>
            <li>I have natural wave in my long hair and it is colored.</li>
            <li>I use this daily on my natural hair and forms my tiny curls that last all day, and like the texture of my hair not sticky!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and not frizzy all day long.</li>
            <li>so I have to be careful with this product because it has a thick consistency which makes it easier for me to grab more than I actually need.</li>
            <li>Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie is a thick, super-moisturizing cream chock full of nourishing ingredients that smells like a tropical paradise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is biracial and has a head full of thick curls.  </li>
            <li>But it was too sweet smelling and thick</li>
            <li>This product is helping me a lot, after the shower I apply small amount on her hair, mainly on the ends, give a soft massage and then....I can comb it without hurting her!!</li>
            <li>If you get the same results I got,using it the first day,at least your second day hair will be decent and you can stretch your money.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need too much to weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product line due to the convenience of it being available at Target and its effectiveness in getting me the look I want without harsh, damaging ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it does not way down my hair, it does not make my curls hard.</li>
            <li>as I have learned using too much will cause a slight residue.</li>
            <li>so if you happen to want to just wash your hair and not blow dry it..this product allows you to do that and and still leave your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price.</li>
            <li>I had seen this product on several social media sites by users recommending it.</li>
            <li>then i saw it for less but same large size jar, and purchased that one too.  </li>
            <li>and then i had to tie it back down for about another 15 minutes That takes waaaay toooo much time to get my doo together before going to work each morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just moisten the curl with a little bit of water, then smooth a tiny amount of the smoothie down the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m having a good hair day my hair is really pretty, but on a bad hair day it can be a mass of limp frizz.</li>
            <li>Also, the product is very rich so use a small amount at a time or your hair will end up feeling heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li>As my hair gets longer, I need a stronger hold to keep it looking volumized and not flat.</li>
            <li>I naturally have fairly loose curls that gradually straighten out the longer</li>
            <li>and I totally recommend it for anyone going natural with dry hair (4a/4b/4c).</li>
            <li>My hair reacted horribly, It left my hair dry, dry, dry DRY and super frizzy.</li>
            <li>This product makes that possible, before I spent 30 minutes or longer to get my hair right using globs of hair gel, than I had to tie my hair down, so the style would the style would set while I drove to work.</li>
            <li>If when your hair dries you see white little patches or specks of product, you used too much product.</li>
            <li>I even mixed it with a little grape seed/coconut oil and that did absolutely nothing but leave my hair with a white coating.</li>
            <li>This product really defines my natural curls without getting hard.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes without weighing it down!</li>
            <li>I have clear skin after I went minimal with body and hair products 2 years ago.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> All these work great!</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> One of my dessert island products for sure!!</li>
            <li> Besides that I love this product!!</li>
            <li> It clumps and forms your curls very nicely</li>
            <li> Also smells very nice</li>

            <li> It also smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing!  </li>
            <li> most days, this product is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I was able to get one of the best twist outs I&#x27;ve ever gotten using this along with the matching shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To each her own!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product its wonderful.</li>
            <li> I think this is Shea Moisture&#x27;s top 5 best products!</li>
            <li> thought I liked these products, but owner being bald sort-of CHANGES MY MIND ABOUT CONTINUING TO PURCHASE!…scary!</li>
            <li> Okay this is the best stuff.</li>
            <li> This product smell so nice!</li>
            <li> Oh, so loving this product!  </li>
            <li> Ok... This product is awesome, but why should you pay $22.99 for it when you could go to walgreens, walgreens.com, target, or target.com and get it for $9.99.</li>
            <li> We are very impressed with Shea Moisture because this product gives her bouncy curls from the top to the bottom with no frizz.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing &amp; smells really good!</li>
            <li> and I have to say that this product was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> she loved this and its smells amazing.!</li>
            <li> ON TIMES GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE I REALLY LOVE IT, GOOD PERFOMANCE, EXCELLENT JOB ,</li>
            <li> It also gives good definition to your curls</li>
            <li> Really great at defining my daughter&#x27;s curls and my own.</li>
            <li> &quot; it smells good and</li>
            <li> This product has a good meeting point between the two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on myself and my daughter, and it&#x27;s just wonderfully silky and light.</li>
            <li> Good product adds moisture to hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten Miss Jessie Baby Buttercreme and Curly Pudding for my daugthers hair before and loved the BBC but not the CP so this for me is a cheaper equivalent to the BBC.</li>
            <li> and I always get compliments when I walk by about how good my hair smells.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to using CURLS products, I always have good luck with those.</li>
            <li> It smells really good though.</li>
            <li> All good things to say, it even smells good.</li>
            <li> and it smells good.</li>
            <li> After my ends were cut I used it and loved it.</li>
            <li> so I needed a good cream to moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> and I hear a lot of good things about this product and brand</li>
            <li> It smells really good</li>
            <li> Its really good</li>
            <li> and I had those gorgeous spirals in about 5 minutes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good addition to my collection</li>
            <li> I used to use it as my primary moisturize but have since learned that (for me) homemade products work best as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> It smells good too.</li>
            <li> Good Product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product i have 360 waves</li>
            <li> fair trade&lt;br</li>
            <li> also a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I buy it at Walgreens or Target for a really good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it smells exceptionally good, moisturizes and curls my hair.</li>
            <li> Because it was made for women in Africa and I am not, I took a chance with this although had bought the coconut spray and loved it.</li>
            <li> The packaging is good.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST THING FOR MY CURLS, IT GIVES ME FABULOUS, MOISTURIZE AND SHINY CURLS DAY AFTER DAY.</li>
            <li> Good product but hella sticky and smells like pinã colada</li>
            <li> It does not provide good hold, because that was not what this product was intended for, so for hold</li>
            <li> My hair smells good, feels good and looks good.</li>
            <li> For buying this product on a whim, I am super impressed and hooked!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s got a great smell (which females love lol,) keeps your hair moisturized most, if not all day &amp; provides a good hold while keeping frizz to a minimum.</li>
            <li> The curls are more defined, and move and bounce and have a great feel.  </li>
            <li> and well if anyone has suggestions for me I&#x27;d be happy to take it. :)</li>
            <li> The curling smoothie works great for twist outs, even better when used with the styling milk.  </li>
            <li> Works great :)</li>
            <li> a great wash n go refresher with a spritz of water and some of this smoothed on top.</li>
            <li> I love it, and the smell is great.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s nice to find a good one that works for my hair and won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Instead of using all of those harmful products for your curls that does more damage than good, use this healthy beautiful elixer.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Please be aware that its best as a styling product.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I really liked Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not at a time in my life to make my own hair care products from scratch.</li>
            <li> The shampoo of this product smells just as nice</li>
            <li> I liked the $9.99 prices.</li>
            <li> I get better results with the hair milk or good ole shea butter.</li>
            <li> This product is REALLY nice as a moisturizer....</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use globs and globs of it for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was wonderful and it hydrated my hair very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell nice, but isn&#x27;t that what perfume is for?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it moisturizes well and smells good.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I think the price on this site equates to price gouging.</li>
            <li> Not sticky, touchable curls, and smells nice too.  </li>
            <li> the smell is wonderful, has great ingredients such as coconut oils</li>
            <li> so well I couldnt wait to buy my own.</li>
            <li> Twist-outs are nicely defined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a grown woman who don&#x27;t know how to do my own hair</li>
            <li> Buyer purchase at your own discretion.</li>
            <li> However, I also noticed a nice, put-together quality to my hair after using it and decided to keep it.  </li>
            <li> It kind of works like a BB cream for hair...</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but I can&#x27;t see any added benefit of using this product.</li>
            <li> I like it on my 3b texture hair and it smells nice</li>
            <li> REALLY NICE</li>
            <li> I use a good amount to make sure I coat all of my hair</li>
            <li> I also use she moisture&#x27;s hold and shine spray along with it, to ensure my curls stay nice and coiled.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so moist and my curls more defined and it smell good too.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t think they will.</li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> but it absorbs MUCH quicker and creates a SUPERB wave &amp; curl pattern....</li>
            <li> Her hair was absolutely gorg and the curls were so perfect.  </li>
            <li> I believe this product is responsible for how awesome my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Looking at how nice her look with the product I went out and brought it.</li>
            <li> Also, I like to mix my own pomades and leave-in using shea butter.</li>
            <li> My curls come out nice and it works for me.</li>
            <li> , THE SMELL IS NICE</li>
            <li> it smelled nice and looked lucious in the jar, but it didn&#x27;t help my hair, maybe 4b or c type, i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Love love love !!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try as I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product</li>
            <li> Smells great, works quickly.</li>
            <li> Love love loooooooove!</li>
            <li> This product has by far been the best solution for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is nice, it smells lovely and it does define my curls...</li>
            <li> Like most reviewers have already noted, it does not define curls on its own.</li>
            <li> The condition and style milk is the best leave in I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I am not A CRAZED curl definition natural; as a matter of fact perfect curls bore me.</li>
            <li> I used it for a twist out style and get surprised with the excellent result</li>
            <li> It does an amazing job of keeping my hair moisturized for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I love a nice sheen as well.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair, soft, shiny and hydrated....not to mention awesome smelling.  </li>
            <li> It held my natural curls perfectly and I dare you to try this product.</li>
            <li> It also smells amazing my husband is in love with it.</li>
            <li> The frizz is gone, and my hair has a nice healthy curl that stays all day.</li>
            <li> (Garnier Fructis Leave-In Conditioning Creme) to help provide more moisture as it can make my hair kind of crunchy as it dries through out the day.</li>
            <li> excellent for those who want to go natural.</li>
            <li> Moreover, SM products smell really good and are sulfate, paraben and cruelty free.  </li>
            <li> Easy peesy!     </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!  </li>
            <li> Like most shea moisture products, the curl enhancing smoothie has pretty good ingredients and is a good price.  </li>
            <li> This product is great as a moisturizer or a mix in my deep conditioner and smells great.</li>
            <li> This product does help my hair curl beautiful but doesn&#x27;t moisturize to much.</li>
            <li> it got great reviews and core ingredients are pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have 8 daughters &amp; this product ran out quickly!!</li>
            <li> The product smells heavenly and the texture is very smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it feels like creamy butter going on your hair.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be most pleasing on my 3c type hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Curl Enhancing Smoothie for about six months and continue to be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this this product.</li>
            <li> you didn&#x27;t like the consistency of the Healthy Hair Butter from Carol&#x27;s Daughter</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s okay product has protein which makes my 4b to 4c hair feel brittle after a while..</li>
            <li> also it&#x27;s a but sticky feeling, but it is ok ..</li>
            <li> Believe me if you name most of the well known brands out there, I&#x27;ve tried them.</li>
            <li> So I couldn&#x27;t believe that any product sold in Walgreen&#x27;s or Target would be any better.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> Even using this product just with a leave in conditioner is still get defined voluminous hair, it leaves a light scent after it drives and a nice heathy shine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments on how moisturize my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because as others said, the smell is just ok and takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Then I tap again for the more kinky curly part of my hair (the crown area mostly)</li>
            <li> I love the smell which is the smell of all of Shea Moisture products and</li>
            <li> , IT SMELLS BETTER</li>
            <li> I Have tried many products.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love this product for my TWA (Teenie Weenie Afro).</li>
            <li> I am glad I</li>
            <li> but once you put it on your hair it has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I will be sticking with Target for $9.99.</li>
            <li> I just love my hair when I use these products.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t pay more than you have too.</li>
            <li> LOVE this line</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS FOR ANY MORE THAN $9.99.</li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> and it also gives the best curl definition and moisture boost (I only wash weekly)&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> To say I&#x27;m pleased is an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this stuff..</li>
            <li> my daughter has mixed hair best</li>
            <li> I cowash my hair, apply the smoothie and then apply Eco styler gel for shine and more hold.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this lovely Smoothie when I retwist at night.</li>
            <li> I have my mom hooked as well. :-)  </li>
            <li> I purchased it and fell in love.</li>
            <li> When my hair grows more I will see how it works for me.</li>
            <li> I had to start using mousse on top to hold the curls</li>
            <li> the upside, it did define and moisturize like it said. :)</li>
            <li> my curls look much more defined</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have to which I love.</li>
            <li> My curls are more underneath</li>
            <li> My ends curl the most for some reason, and this cream doesn&#x27;t define them at all.</li>
            <li> The texture is more of a cream than a butter or gel, so if you would prefer a butter, then this is not quite what you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
            <li> I mix a 3:1 ratio using more of the curl enhancing smoothie than the gel.  </li>
            <li> On any given day, you can find most Shea Moisture products for $9.99 at Walgreen&#x27;s, Walgreen&#x27;s Online,Target and Walmart.</li>
            <li> The supplier needs to check nationwide for a more comparable/competitive price.  </li>
            <li> The Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus line has great products to cleanse and moisturize for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> and I managed to sleep on this product for more than a year.</li>
            <li> I love this product, its been my go-to from I</li>
            <li> Get it elsewhere and buy 3x more product for the money you&#x27;re spending here.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li> I have another moisturizing conditioner I use, but this was even better.</li>
            <li> and so what I do is apply this on the ends and around (not the top; it leaves my roots too oily)</li>
            <li> and I love how it hydrates my curls.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love.</li>
            <li> love.</li>
            <li> If you want more defined curls, apply more.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Love them all and works wonders when used correctly.  </li>
            <li> I am able to purchase 3 for the price that Amazon sells it for at Walgreens.com.</li>
            <li> I have since then done more research and am confident that I can get what I need out of this product.</li>
            <li> FALLEN IN LOVE WITH IT.</li>
            <li> I love it,thank you</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> The curl enhancing smoothie gives them all such great definition!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I received so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> but I like that better for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love this product, as it soaks into my hair and moisturizers it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> I love this product it defines your curls and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> All that to say, I wanted to love this because so many naturals swear by it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> think this works better when combined with the gel</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> S Curl no drip and many more.</li>
            <li> but more so the availability of it.</li>
            <li> and I truly love the fact that it holds my curls, feels and looks moisturized.</li>
            <li> But i gave it just one more try.</li>
            <li> It gave my hair more of a glow than shine.  </li>
            <li> It helps the hair clump and gives great definition, not so much hold though.</li>
            <li> I wanted a great hair product that would keep my type 4b hair moisturized, without too much gunk, so I bought this....</li>
            <li> Love the smell, can and will leave specks</li>
            <li> I love it and use it everytime I wear my hair curley.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay more then $12.00 for it.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this defines my 3b 3c curls.</li>
            <li> but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus line.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and most of them</li>
            <li> men need to project more and this smoothie will get them attention...</li>

            <li> Leaves my hair feeling healthy but not greasy</li>
            <li> I love this; it works well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell the most ..</li>
            <li> Gel works much better for my 4a type.  </li>
            <li> I switched to Deva Curl curly girl method and love it.</li>
            <li> The most I&#x27;ve seen it for was $7.49</li>
            <li> It felt like hay with oil on top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a wonderful product, I would definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li> This product is like magic.</li>
            <li> After using all summer, I wanted to say that as my technique improved I was able to wear styles for 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and it&#x27;s light, as for hold out of 10 I&#x27;d give it a 3, but that&#x27;s not a problem</li>
            <li> and I love this shea moisture product.</li>
            <li> I love the Curl Enhancing.</li>
            <li> I love the smell (it smells like pina colada), but that&#x27;s about it.    </li>
            <li> It smells delicious and it does soften my hair, but I&#x27;m not too fond of the fact that I have to use multiple products in order for the Smoothie to work.</li>
            <li> I have the most defined and shiny curls.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and great for twist outs and braid outs</li>
            <li> I love Shea Moisture products, I have 4a-c hair.</li>
            <li> If your thinking about getting it, you&#x27;ll def be pleased.</li>
            <li> , if you see this product for sale more than $12.99 DO NOT BUY*</li>
            <li> Most sell for $9.99 to $11.99 in-store or online.</li>

            <li> LOVE IT .</li>

            <li> This product is great though, it really gets those curls going.</li>
            <li> I just think i need a better leave-in conditioner than what I am using now</li>
            <li> But I have no doubt that it will work even better</li>
            <li> Each was $9.99!!!!:)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Did I say that I love this stuff?</li>
            <li> I am not in love</li>
            <li> Okay, I love Shea moisture products, I use the Curl Enhancing smoothie, along with the Shea Moisture curl souffle and these products keep my hair moist all day and makes my curls pop.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Used it as a styler for my twist outs and it was my favorite way of using</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll fall in love too.</li>
            <li> OK BYE</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many curl creams.</li>
            <li> I love the Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Hold Smoothie - 12 oz.  </li>
            <li> Also I love this product because of the presentation of the bottle and the fact that it has silk proteins to add strength to hair.</li>
            <li> I even tried a bit in my son&#x27;s hair since his hair is more curly than his sister&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> In the morning, my hair is shiny....manageable, healthy and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE FRAGANCE</li>
            <li> Very great smelling product that actually works!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m In love</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I love it...</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> it defines my hair even more.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to go out and try more of Shea Moistures products. :)</li>
            <li> It just sat on top of it and did not penetrate my hair follicles.</li>
            <li> I love its smell and for styling</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair soft with a nice curl and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This particular product wasn&#x27;t a win for me but it can be for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li> smell was pretty good.</li>
            <li> It all works wonders, the end product is beautiful natural looking frizzless hair.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning to natural hair and after reading so many great reviews and being recommended by many to try this I decided to purchase.</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent, perfect weight, adds the right amount of shine and just really works.  </li>
            <li> Its WORTH IT!!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and healthy, and my scalp no longer itches.</li>
            <li> I love the strong coconut, tropical smell.</li>
            <li> However, for best results use the entire Coconut &amp; Hibiscus product line: shampoo, milk conditioner, Curl enhancing smoothie, Souffle and light hold spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I love the shampoo and conditioner, the Curl Enhancing Smoothie was the product I was most excited about trying out.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich product, so someone with fine, porous wavy/curly hair has to use this sparingly.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best natural hair moisturizers out there it makes ur hair nice and moisturized soft to the touch</li>
            <li> This product is great for my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This product works great since it has the oils that my hair craves to be soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I even used it on my sons hair to enhance his natural curls and it looked great.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for those that have natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it works best for me on wet or damp hair.</li>
            <li> like how it makes my hair feel, it itself has a creamy and smooth texture but more like a butter as opposed to a cream/crème.</li>
            <li> Great product  for natural and processed hair.</li>
            <li> Works great for my daughters natural looks.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the great responses people have had with this product.</li>
            <li> great product for natural hair.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy or greasy and has a great smell.  </li>
            <li> Ok i am in love with this product it smells good, it&#x27;s natural, and my hair loves it</li>
            <li> This is a product it great for leaving my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on hair products trying to find the best one for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a natural 4b girl and this stuff has been great.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;m always looking for good prices for hair and make up because i buy so much of it</li>
            <li> MOISTURE IS RIGHT!!</li>
            <li> Too sweet and too strong!</li>
            <li> If you figure out the right amount it is really effective.</li>
            <li> I know other curlies have had good luck with the Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie, but I just can&#x27;t get with this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Now I have this full jar collecting dust on my counter!</li>
            <li> The Styling Milk was great, but there were definitely days that I wished it were more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is that it&#x27;s wheat, corn, and soy free.  </li>
            <li> Easy to spread out over all my hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells strong</li>
            <li> The only nice thing about it is the fragrance - it smells really good.</li>
            <li> If you want a bouncy twist-out, you will have to add a butter or gel to it to get a really strong hold to you hair.  </li>
            <li> first impression, was that this stuff was AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It give great moisture, good curl definition, and I like the fact that it is organic and completely made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love the sweet smell of it as well.  </li>
            <li> My hair cannot live without this product, it is one of the best moisturizers ever, I recommend this product for natural hair!</li>
            <li> You only need about 4 dime sized scoops of this after applying your favorite leave in ( my fave is oyin handmade hair dew which smells like sugar cookies) and you have perfect soft shiny moisturized ringlets that still shrinks but hang more</li>
            <li> I have fine strands that are packed densely all over my head in kinky coils like pen springs, and the Smoothie did NOT absorb into the hair at all.</li>
            <li> it works so fine.</li>
            <li> I prefer heavier creams for my fine locks.</li>
            <li> My curls are baby fine yet dense.  </li>
            <li> my hair has both a fine texture but tighter curls.</li>
            <li> and I just washed my hair 2 days ago and all was fine until I put this smoothie in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It turns my frizzy  mess into a perfect, wavy curl.  </li>
            <li> My hair dries and holds in perfect little coils and curls for a bout 4 days before they turn to frizz.</li>
            <li> I tap my finger lightly into the product for each braid, twist etc.</li>
            <li> i hope it doesnt , and if it does, does anyone have any alcohol free recommendations</li>
            <li> Plus, I needed to find a use for it after the buy one, get one free sale.</li>
            <li> I smooth some of this in my hair after I wash it.</li>
            <li> And it is worry free because it is all organic</li>
            <li> Walgreens even has free shipping on orders $25 and up.  </li>
            <li> plus, you get free shipping.</li>
            <li> My hair regimen includes, spraying on a light amount of Roots of Nature, Mango Oil &amp; Cupuacu Butter, Curl Reviving Spray and then applying Shea Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- cruelty free</li>
            <li> but  this defined them and had a light hold which for me kill 2 birds with  stone.</li>
            <li> And the style was smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li> It is just great for styling, softening, sealing, moisturizing, and overall hair health.</li>
            <li> I love all of shea moisture products, they&#x27;re just pricey but its worth it</li>
            <li> He sometimes uses the smoothie with the styling milk, especially if it&#x27;s a really humid day.  </li>
            <li> The sulfate free shampoo is fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, smooth, not greasy and works well on my two strand twist out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for taming individual frizzies.</li>
            <li> so I use it with a light hand (about a dime size).</li>
            <li> In the morning, I spritz my hair with some water and lightly apply this to my hair to revive the curls.</li>
            <li> Also, one of my girlfriends also said she experienced the same thing when she applied to her scalp but not when she applied to just her hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, my hair feels soft when I apply it.</li>
            <li> I loved how my hair kept feeling moist and soft as each day wore on with the style.</li>
            <li> Its really good for twistouts,super soft but well defined.</li>
            <li> Its made with natural ingredients and it works better than any chemical based products i&#x27;v tried and keeps your hair nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got good hold and yet leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell originally, but my friends say that it smells just fine, so don&#x27;t take my word for that.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of oil and moisture to make my hair feel healthy again.  </li>
            <li> I use this product for doing either two strand twist or flat twist and its great.</li>
            <li> This is also a very moisturizing product, and I have used it all on its own on wet hair to do a braidout, and I got beautiful results.</li>
            <li> It smells beautiful and makes my natural curls really curly.</li>
            <li> Love it , it is great for laying down curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that tends to be kind of loose and frizzy, this makes my curls more defined all throughout and they stay smooth!</li>
            <li> it keeps it nice and soft, but the smell was a bit strong.  </li>
            <li> If u add oil to ur hair, add it first or it will just sit on top.</li>
            <li> First the fragrance alone will make you fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> I watched a video where a woman said that before she put the Smoothie in her hair, first she used an alcohol-free hair gel THEN applied the Smoothie on top of it.</li>
            <li> so it is worth the price!</li>
            <li> But it looked familiar and so I asked my daughter if we had already tried it.</li>
            <li> The curl enhancing smoothie underneath it is golden!</li>
            <li> It was more cost effective than many of the other brands--great for a full-time student like me.  </li>
            <li> with this cream I only apply it in the morning after my shower and it does its magic on its own.</li>
            <li> This product definitely moisturized my hair and held the formation of my natural curls perfectly.  </li>
            <li> A friend told me about the product stating she liked to put this product on her hair when wet because it gave her nice wavy curls.</li>
            <li> honestly would have given this product five stars, but it does have a tendency even with a light handed application to leave a white film, but it fades away, so I&#x27;m fine with that since I use it at night and by the morning it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> KCCC gives the best definition and hold but my hair always felt to hard.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie was great for my high porosity natural hair.</li>
            <li> But other than that I think next month along with my five jars of this smoothie that I will also order the rest of the products since I had such a wonderful and delightful positive affects with this one.</li>
            <li> Amazing! was skeptical but it works great.</li>
            <li> It works great as a layer on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing on natural hair.</li>
            <li> It also has a sweet tropical scent to it that should be pleasing to most people, it really does smell like a smoothie...which I guess is what they were going for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, affordable and effective</li>
            <li> I am caucasian and have wavy hair that can go straight or curly but most curl products leave my hair sticky and make my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> THIS WHOLE LINE ROCKS :)  </li>
            <li> Once all the residue had vanished the day after, my hair was nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing supermarket hair products like Garnier, but the Shea Moisture products got such good reviews I decided to splurge.</li>
            <li> They really need to stock more.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have nothing but good things to say about the SheaMositure line and look forward to continued use of their products.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell to it and it has a soft hold.  </li>
            <li> The volume was a fraction of what it once was, but with frizz, could appear to be twice as full.</li>
            <li> &quot; I really did wear it well :-)</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair nicely moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I would say my hair only has a good curl pattern when its shorter.</li>
            <li> I use the whole shea moisture brand, and I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oil and doesn&#x27;t make you hair more curly</li>
            <li> and I had a good thing while it lasted, but I&#x27;m definitely moving on.</li>
            <li> Good product for my coarse hair</li>
            <li> Grainier Fruits at the drug store is better if it is a real emergency.</li>
            <li> I apply some argan oil after lunchtime and after going to the gym to revive it a bit, but it really doesn&#x27;t need much more.</li>
            <li> Now those curls are more defined and much smoother.</li>
            <li> I always am on the look out for good hair products for my relaxed hair, which is coarse and does not like relaxers.  </li>
            <li> This thing is so sickeningly sweet</li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair moisturuzed and full.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product overall.</li>
            <li> (BUT definitely not as bad as coconut oil)</li>
            <li> My hair is type 3 natural and this product is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> No bad chemicals&lt;</li>
            <li> Since transitioning and having a little girl I find that of all the natural, black hair products from Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful, Kinky Curly, Shea&#x27;n&#x27;More, etc that Shea Moisture products are the best bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li> What I love the most is that it is truly moisturizing for my dry hair, and gives great hold, especially when I just wash my hair and leave.</li>
            <li> GET IT ON WALGREENS OR TARGET&#x27;S DIRECT WEBSITE AND MORE LIKELY GET FREE SHIPPING!!!    </li>
            <li> If you have dry hair this is the one so far that works best for my hair..</li>
            <li> On the other hand, because the product hydrates curls, it is great for finishing your \\&quot;wash and go\\&quot; or \\&quot;rod set\\&quot; after it dries.  </li>
            <li> The cream is thicker than other products that I have used so it gives my curls and twists some weight, and works great for my 4b hair.</li>
            <li> I have found some hair smooties that work a little better, but this a good product.</li>
            <li> Seriously this is THE best hair product that I have ever invested in.</li>
            <li> I use Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie as a moisturizer in low-humidity weather (it contains glycerin) for my super dense, Afro-textured hair.</li>
            <li> The product is great but $30 is definitely way too much for it.</li>
            <li> I went natural and sulfate free almost a year ago, and I dont think I would have been able to do it if I didnt find the Shea Moisture product line.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, but don&#x27;t use too much or it will appear white.</li>
            <li> The second time I did a twist out, I used the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Gel Soufflé and the style held for two days and was perfect for a defined puff the following day.</li>
            <li> And even more importantly the price tag in comparison with my old product line</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for refreshing second day hair because it helps curls to spring back and smoothes frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Target and it smells great but for my naturally frizzy/curly hair it really doesn&#x27;t give me much condition like it says it should.</li>
            <li> However, this product was different, it added a nice shine, it left my hair soft, and best of all, whether I was rocking a wash and go or a braidout, it really made my curls pop!</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for adding life to your hair without weighing it down or making it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product because of the price (i bought it at a store and it was very reasonable)</li>
            <li> I would love to buy more to support the company, but it takes a LONG time to use up the container.</li>
            <li> Shea Coconut Curl Smoothie actually worked pretty good in creating waves &amp; curls (once you work with it)</li>
            <li> The good news this is a great product a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> First!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much!!</li>
            <li> I buy the whole line, shampoo, conditioner and body wash!!</li>
            <li> This product never fails me!</li>
            <li> It has quite a strong coconut, tropical smell-which I love, but may be too much for those who are sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It also really brings out the natural curls in her hair making them more defined!</li>
            <li> However, after about two weeks of using it 3x per week (along with liberal spritzes of a homemade mixture of filtered water, Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil and John Freida Curl Around conditioner) noticed that my hair was getting very crunchy and hard.</li>
            <li> If I continue to have such amazing results, I will continue to buy the product.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reverted back to my natural hair texture (4c) about a year ago and this is the best product I have purchased thus far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days, and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li> moisturize, I apply leave-in conditioner and then Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie on freshly washed and conditioned hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth trying, but for $30...</li>
            <li> Many years ago I had 3 years of natural hair growth that I used to just 2 strand twist with Carol&#x27;s Daughter products.</li>
            <li> Most of the natural women I have come across on You Tube, in forums, and in the natural locs grps love this product also, but they use it w/ Eco Styler w/ olive oil to get the desired curl definition they want.</li>
            <li> In addition... using this product without a gel or something to define curl will result, in my opinion, a more soft, wispy look.</li>
            <li> but it was worth</li>
            <li> Love the product hair is soft and bounce</li>
            <li> They are well worth the $7.99 each.</li>
            <li> This is making my transitioning to natural so much better.</li>
            <li> love that this line is 100% natural and organic.</li>
            <li> I guess it works better on natural twisting</li>
            <li> and my hair is soft and has movement and the lovely sent of the smootie.</li>
            <li> Since this product is used mostly by sisters in the natural movement, they are scared it will take MONEY away from  the PUSHERS of CREAMY CRACK.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to any curly girl who loves organic products that work just as good even better than many expensive products marketed to curly girls</li>
            <li> To be honest, my hair didn&#x27;t feel different at all.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product and wanted to love it, however after using the whole jar</li>
            <li> I have also used as a deep which was effective</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about spending 12 bucks on it, dont worry, its worth it.</li>
            <li> Just a quarter worth is enough to coat my whole head; however, if your hair is longer you might use more (at most a 2 dollar coins worth).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really worth it</li>
            <li> It contains most, if not all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Amazing did everything it said it will do left my hair moist smooth works great on my thick hair</li>
            <li> I am talking freshly washed and out the shower hair (no towel drying).</li>
            <li> I love the affordable price and how soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> Love it for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Doesnt take much, you have to rub it in really good unless its at bedtime (covered with a silk bonnet) because it will leave a white film.</li>
            <li> I have tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s, Kinky Curly, Keracare Natural hair line and more.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth looking into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> In Conditioner (about 50 cent piece worth).</li>
            <li> but this product was worth none of my money.</li>
            <li> I have natural  4C hair, and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> and this product contains more \\&quot;natural ingredients\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This may not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth it to try.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 2 becauseof the nice smell, but as for styling properties and the price, it only rates a 1.</li>
            <li> It has a nice non-overbearing smell, thick, custardy, texture, and provides great hydration even on really hot days (I live in a non-humid environment).</li>
            <li> Right now, the only thing that provides that kind of hold is gel, but I don&#x27;t like using gel on my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is softer than ever, with great definition, without being spongy, or stiff.</li>
            <li> Right afterwards, I evenly distributed two 50 cent pieces worth of Shea Moisturizer Smoothie.</li>
            <li> and that seemed to be about right for me.  </li>
            <li> once I get the right conditioner.</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy this product as much as I have ;)</li>
            <li> My daughter is of West Indian decent and this product is fantastic, it provides moisture without the oil like residue that the olive oil would leave in some clothing.</li>
            <li> i love it so much, it defines my curls, makes my hair super soft and shiny and smells heavenly</li>
            <li> This stuff both makes my hair super soft and frizz free</li>
            <li> Even my most damaged areas were feeling healthy again, and my split ends were way less noticeable-maybe even on the road to repaired.</li>
            <li> I have actually been able to wear my hair natural more than I used too since using this product.</li>
            <li> It holds that curl without becoming frizzy and it is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It is pretty pricey but is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am a 3c/4a hair type and it has been a true struggle for me to find what really works well in my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells better and makes my hair soft and moisturized with water for 2-3 days in the middle of the most humid weather.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product for those would like to go natural, it really works on hydrating and control those frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and tend to get migraines easily</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for natural hair works well with twist outs and any natural style.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well for my relaxed hair, but I&#x27;ve only used it once which was last night and my hair feels great this morning.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and easy to manage and I like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> (wavy hair easily gets a \\&quot;Soul Glo\\&quot; look), and the hold is natural but persistent.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been able to get about 3 days of wear with my wash and go, but it has been very humid</li>
            <li> This product provides needed moisture to dry hair and allows curls to clump nicely.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic (it is a little overpowering at first, but fades nicely).  </li>
            <li> Amazing results every single time.</li>
            <li> Plus the price is great in comparison with other natural hair care products.</li>
            <li> I am new to the natural hair biz (3b almost shoulder length hair) and am still trying to find the right potion of products for keeping my hair moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> I apply it while my hair is still wet, it does an amazing job at retaining curls.</li>
            <li> The first few uses, I loved the way my hair felt.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the product (my first of the Shea Moisture Line) after continually seeing it at Target.</li>
            <li> , you most definitely will not like the Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li> at first.</li>
            <li> I was able to get second day hair out of this one application.</li>
            <li> its the only product I use on most days after I apply my leave in, no gel - no serum, nothing.</li>
            <li> partly what drew me to their soaps when they first became a part of the Target line.</li>
            <li> Really?!</li>
            <li> I have no idea why it&#x27;s about 3x as much on Amazon!</li>
            <li> this works better as a DC but have found cheaper products that do the same thing</li>
            <li> I have found that with Shea Moisture products there can be so many different uses for each product!!!</li>
            <li> The product smells great and will last a long time for $10 bucks.</li>
            <li> this curling smoothie is affordable 7.99 - 11.00 in most drugstores like Walmart Walgreens Target, smells like pineapple now&amp;laters candy, and it actually works!</li>
            <li> and I enjoy how soft it makes my hair feel days after using it.  </li>
            <li> After trying MANY products to moisturize my 4a/b hair, I finally found the one!</li>
            <li> I decided to pull out the Shea Moisture curl enhancing smoothie for the first time this week, thinking it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> The first day I just showered and put it in my hair and then braided my hair and went on my way.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I love this product!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what it smells like.  </li>
            <li> Well, I work in a corporate office, so I applied more.</li>
            <li> Two cons: it made my hair crunchy at first until I smoothed the strands with my fingers</li>
            <li> I love the entire line.  </li>
            <li> Shea Moisture really helps out a lot!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I even started liking the smell, which is SO interesting because I actually am not a fan of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hope this journey is finally taking a better road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say...</li>
            <li> It felt soft and light</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the summer and my hair absolutely loves this smoothie!</li>
            <li> It has become an instant staple!! :-)</li>
            <li> so imagine what my two strand twists were looking like when I first tried this hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like this at first but now that I know how to use it</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> and i put cantu&#x27;s coconut curl cream in FIRST place.</li>
            <li> This was one of the first products I bought.  </li>
            <li> I use this for many different purposes.</li>
            <li> but I apply it one day and don&#x27;t have to apply any more product the next day.</li>
            <li> It hydrates instantly, and has a lovely smell.</li>
            <li> However after months of using it I found it leaches alot of residue on my forehead and sides of my face leading to consistent break outs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the price here is PRETTY STEEP.</li>
            <li> Try there first.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it for my twist</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was hooked.</li>
            <li> It defines my 3 a, b curls and gives them so much bounce and volume!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update Bioinfusion has a curling pomade that does EXACTLY what I was hoping Curl Smoothie would do</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I fell in love with a curl-enhancing product, if ever.  </li>
            <li> At first, I like how my hair felt moisturized after a dryer set.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried using it</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li> Now my curls pop instead of just a big ball of frizz on top of my head.</li>
            <li> Please look carefully at the ingredients and make sure you are not spending more money for this product which doesn&#x27;t contain all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Ingredients better than similar products.</li>
            <li> It drys lightly firm, with a good sheen.  </li>
            <li> It is also great if I don&#x27;t have time to do all that to just pull my curls out a bit on my dry high hair for a bit of a messier natural look.</li>
            <li> As a new natural, I went over the top with trying products.</li>
            <li> and it really helps the curls stay put if I apply right after rinsing out the SM gold line restorative conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it states with friendly natural hair ingredients.</li>
            <li> It not only smells good , but it holds my fine, kinky hair down...</li>
            <li> They make a fine, all natural product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing like coconut and other fruits.</li>
            <li> However, this product is available at my local Walgreens for about $10, so I suggest if you have a store nearby to check there first before purchasing online!</li>
            <li> It is extremely moisturizing, and smells like a nice coconut conditioner.</li>
            <li> it smells good, but i perhaps used a little too much.  </li>
            <li> Only ten bucks :) Some people say that the scent is too strong</li>
            <li> love their whole line of hair products as well as some of their facial products.</li>
            <li> On top of that, my hair is very kinky/curly, and I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t actually do what it says - &amp;</li>
            <li> Nice but be careful and don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> very, very did I say very curly hair.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not doing twists or anything special, I just leave it with this and a spray of water and a natural oil for the day.  </li>
            <li> I added didn&#x27;t come out right and straightened my hair instead it doesn&#x27;t really put too much curls in my hair</li>
            <li> while this is the best for me, I have a client that it does the opposite with her natural hair, it makes hers drier, and limp.</li>
            <li> But on the first day out of the shower, my hair can get really curly.</li>
            <li> The first thing I will say is that I really believe the outcome of any product depends on your hair type and</li>
            <li> A true natural hair product.  </li>
            <li> Oh and it smells great too..but can be a little overwhelming if you wear different scented products at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have type 4 hair that is sensitive, fine and gets dry easily.</li>
            <li> My braid outs looked lovely when dry in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about which curl products I use</li>
            <li> She also made sure to tell her audience that her hair was DRY when she did this.</li>
            <li> This product left me with bouncy, moisturized curls and easy to manage hair.</li>
            <li> but I imagine it would work ok on dry hair as well</li>
            <li> but it would just be a lot more work to coat through dry hair.</li>
            <li> For the first 5 minutes, my hair had a light layer of white coating.</li>
            <li> I normally put this in right after a co-wash and then, add a pure shea butter pending on the style I&#x27;m going to work that day.  </li>
            <li> now to last a good, long time.</li>
            <li> Ok so in full disclosure, my all time #1 leave in styler/moisturizer is Qhemet Biologics Alma &amp; Olive Heavy Cream...</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it is the strong scent of coconut.</li>
            <li> The tricks to managing frizz is to divide hair into sections, they can be large, and then apply the product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but these products help your hair maintain moitsure without a large concentation of humectants, glycols or even butters.      </li>
            <li> After much research, and trial and error, I decided to try this (partly because of all the positive reviews).  </li>
            <li> Smells great, organic, only con is that it leaves a slight sticky coating on my 4A/4B curls.</li>
            <li> It always enhances waves with no need for extra stuff and can be applied wet or dry best moisturizer i&#x27;ve used in 25yrs.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not a go to product if you are looking for hold, which is fine by me.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine hair like me and type 3 in nature, I would say definitely give this a try.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and worked well for me however a little pricey.</li>
            <li> And I want interested shoppers to realize that they don&#x27;t have to pay this high price.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and unruly hair, the Curl Enhancing Smoothie  left my hair perfectly moisturized and manageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and moist,looks shinier with a soft hold , and my hair smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have 4a hair and this does moisturize very well.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use too much of it to do so.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my type 3 hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so much money here, but I would recommend not buying it here.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this stuff really does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I can vouch to say this stuff really does it for me.</li>
            <li> The Shea Moisture products have really transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> smells is also very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply fantastic, and it&#x27;s only a bonus</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to replace KCCC for me and read and heard so much about Shea Moisture</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t moisturize my 3c/4a hair at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfully through much trial and error</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be repurchasing and I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li> could try using just one of the products instead of two, but for my hair they work very well together.</li>
            <li> It works very well in holding twist.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the versatility</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about really paying attention to your hair and learning it&#x27;s likes and dislikes.</li>
            <li> And yes, if you leave too much in one spot and don&#x27;t scrunch in the lotion you will get those darn \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; spots people keep talking about.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying this product again, and for my curly headed girls beware this product is very drying, use sparingly</li>
            <li> I really like how my hair feels using this product.</li>
            <li> This did not work very well to define my curls alone.  </li>
            <li> leaves it very curly</li>
            <li> Then again I don&#x27;t have much in my experience to compare it to.</li>
            <li> and I was ready to go.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Who buys this for so much money.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my hair as a moisturizer( doesn&#x27;t really define curls) and it really helps my hair</li>
            <li> my hair is really growing fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this smoothie.</li>
            <li> I have really curly/kinky hair</li>
            <li> Some people use too much.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much work through.</li>
            <li> Real men use this too.</li>
            <li> I purchased that from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> really wanted the Shea Moisture brand to work for me after I heard the founders story.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Best suited for:&lt;br /&gt;Medium to very curly hair</li>
            <li> When I woke up my hair was very curly (once I removed the twists).</li>
            <li> and you can even use it alone if you don&#x27;t like too much product.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> I made the error of using too much on my hair while damp</li>
            <li> I ended up using this as a conditioning mask, which worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I gave the product away to a neighbor who is mixed (Caucasian &amp; African American), and it worked great for her.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care for it all that much for my 3c hair.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb the product very well.</li>
            <li> It is very dense, creamy.</li>
            <li> This stuff really feels like its working.</li>
            <li> this smoothie is really the ticket.</li>
            <li> really works on it.  </li>
            <li> My hair stayed moisturized that whole time.</li>
            <li> My 4b/4c hair seems like it wants to like this product</li>
            <li> so, it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so i had to wet it some more to get it to shine</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much I bought them for.</li>
            <li> she used to much, so</li>
            <li> I really cant go without it.</li>
            <li> Really this product, shea butter and olive oil is all I really use on my hair.</li>
            <li> But then, in the Atlanta humidity, all my curls went straight and frizzy in minutes.  </li>
            <li> , I thought Maybe I used too much product.</li>
            <li> I really really REALLY tried to like this product</li>
            <li> I really just needed something to get rid of the frizz and help my curls shape up and stay for the day, and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> The great part is that this tub is going to last me forever, and it only cost me $10 from a local store-</li>
            <li> it being much cheaper in price</li>
            <li> I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> AND IT IT IS VERY CREAMY.</li>
            <li> My only question is: Why in the world are people paying $18.95 for a 12 oz when it&#x27;s available at Target for $9.99?</li>
            <li> , I could not bear to use it much.</li>
            <li> and it really holds the moisture in your hair, and is never sticky.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of products, just a couple that your hair really loves.</li>
            <li> My hair absolutely loves LOVES LOVESSSSS this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has really curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and it does make your hair greasy if you put too much in your hair</li>
            <li> This smoothie really tamed my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The one thing I&#x27;d like to warn others about is that if you are protein sensitive this more than likely isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> So far the Shea Moisture Products have worked for me making my hair more manageable and soft; this product so far being one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased I&#x27;ve finally found natural products that work, and as a bonus they smell heavenly too.</li>
            <li> I see this product getting recommended on most natural hair styling tutorials, so there&#x27;s definitely something here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a really great line for people with thick, wavy, curly, and coily natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different natural products and methods, but this one did it for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and these are the only two that work for me so far.</li>
            <li> This product is very light, but extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have 3b, fine, causasian hair, thats been bleached several times, straightened, frizzy and highly porous.</li>
            <li> But the smell of strawberries is just too strong for me, it does not go away and you have to smell it all day long.</li>
            <li> I originally bought one jar and at the second use, I returned to Target for me</li>
            <li> I know there is a possibility of her hair rubbing out or coming out although I use satin hair savers and a satin kid&#x27;s bonnet, but I am doing my part to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen due to negligence on my part.  </li>
            <li> I originally used this product for twist-outs, but it always left my hair feeling like it had a lot of build up.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but feels so good!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are great, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> somewhere in there)--for this kind of hair, use coconut oil or raw shea butter as an overnight moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> $10 is more than what I usually pay for a hair product, but this is worth it.</li>
            <li> The acne showed up the next day after using this for the first time on freshly washed hair worn out.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the product is creamy which I usually dont like (I prefer oils and butters) but overall I am happy.</li>
            <li> This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural, cruelty-free products.</li>
            <li> It has a mild aroma of a tropical fruit, with a creamy texture that most likely aids in well defined curls with minimal frizz.</li>
            <li> I really had high expectations of this product...</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s natural and wet it looks amazing, but completely dries out once the water is gone.</li>
            <li> When I first started wearing my natural curls, I&#x27;d read the product description instead of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s all natural and not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> It is weird though because the SM curly milk works good on my hair and has most of the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was in Duane Reade searching for hair products that I could use on my naturally curly hair, and I was struggling on whether to get this or not because of the price.</li>
            <li> I first used it when I was transitioning from relaxed to natural &amp; I borrowed it from my sister &amp; it</li>
            <li> infused sweet treat.(It&#x27;s not actually edible.)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t figured out the full potential of it yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only is my hair super wavy after using this (thus the title of \\&quot;crazy lion curls\\&quot;), but it also smells wonderful and stays very soft and pliable.  </li>
            <li> I need something that weighs my hair down more when I wear it curly.</li>
            <li> Hence I do put it on sparingly and water it down a bit, but all in all I am enjoying not using gels and volume enhancers.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other produce! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> At night i use just a little of the smoothie on its own to keep my hair soft overnight.</li>
            <li> this same product and this whole line of products is much cheaper at target for instance this particular product is 4.98 at target right now.</li>
            <li> one of my new favs!</li>
            <li> Well move over Queen Jess, there&#x27;s a new sheriff in town!  </li>
            <li> I wanted badly to like this product,aft I saw so many good reviews,  </li>
            <li> I use Wave Nouveau moisturizing lotion then putmy hair in medium size 2 strand twist and use just a dab per section Jamaican Black Castor oil on the twist but mostly concentrating on my ends.</li>
            <li> main reason for this review though, is that I got this product at Walgreens for $9.99.</li>
            <li> This is some decent stuff for curly hair.</li>
            <li> love the smell although it does kinda suck that i have to make sure i rub it in thoroughly or ill</li>
            <li> B001RVKB50 Double Strength Super Gro Maximum]]) had hormones that could lead to cancer...</li>
            <li> Something about the coconut oil as a main ingredient just does not sit well with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives your hair a natural shine last longs, its light</li>
            <li> I found this product at target and decided to try mainly because of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely five star worthy.</li>
            <li> This works great on my thick curly white girl hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I put in waaaay too much, but even still, my hair looked fantastic even if it was a little goopy.  </li>
            <li> this product is fairly new to me, but i tried a small amount from a store and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does much for my hair because it is so short right now</li>
            <li> Calms my frizzy damaged hair and turns it into silky smooth waves and loose curls</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but there&#x27;s definitely something not so natural hidden in this product because my natural hair sheds tremendously when it does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li> I am not or have not been highly impress with Shea moisture products but this one may become a staple in my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just a little on my hair gives it a soft feel and makes it very easy to style.  </li>
            <li> My other sister and mom, who are both natural, also use and love this product.</li>
            <li> idk.&lt;br /&gt;Cause when it&#x27;s wet, it looks PERFECTLY FINE.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t really that curly or hard to manage, I have soft waves but this product totally keeps the shine without looking greasy, well defines the curls for more than one day!!</li>
            <li> just a little more sparingly.</li>
            <li> it leave my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li> For myself, I found that the Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner worked better in styling (its a little bit lighter on the hair).</li>
            <li> But just because we are curly girls it does not mean that we should throw away our money.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 and she has mixed hair, very curly!!</li>
            <li> The bright side: a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> When used as a leave in conditioner, it made my hair smell amazing, kept frizz at minimum, and defined my curls and made them shiny without making them hard or crunchy.</li>
            <li> It clumps my curls together nicely and leaves my dull hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair pretty oily, a little goes a long way, smells amazing though</li>
            <li> I love this product but this one was watered down!</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a truely all natural leave in conditioner, i was wondering if this product contains any alcohol?</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural, it smells yummy, and it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li> I have now been natural for almost a year and this product doesnt really work for my hair.</li>
            <li> After a few days I noticed that after it dried the curls wouldn&#x27;t really hold as great as I thought.</li>
            <li> It was very curly and my hair felt really soft.</li>
            <li> the curls stayed in place the whole day and it was so soft.</li>
            <li> used this on my daughter&#x27;s finer 4b hair and her curls were very pronounced and soft.</li>
            <li> The natural hair community raves about this product so much that i felt that i had to try it, even though it cost $17.</li>
            <li> They both fight frizz really well and keep his hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> but it does keep hair very moist and soft.</li>
            <li> It really helped bring out the natural curl in my hair, and it holds without making it look 80s crunchy.  </li>
            <li> so when I see products that say use quarter size or go lenient I usually ignore that because I just have too much hair to do so</li>
            <li> know a lot of naturals LOVE this product, but it did not work for me and did not fit into my regimen.</li>
            <li> so that means nothing harsh for my hair and safe for the environment.  </li>
            <li> Within seconds, my curls became more defined as it dried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of factors that go into people getting good results and others getting really poor results from some products.</li>
            <li> This product smells really nice, it is thick and moisturizes my hair.</li>
            <li> very heavy product which is good considering my hair drys out rather quickly but definitely use sparingly as this product is rather thick (which is just fine for me).</li>
            <li> Every other day will do you just fine.</li>
            <li> It was silky, soft and smooth, even my previously dry ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So the following afternoon when my hair was bone dry, I used an alcohol-free hair gel, THEN applied the Smoothie on top of it, and my curls began to stand out.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t smooth or soft to the touch, just dry.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to like it because a lot of other naturals use it, but it seems like for me all it did was enhance the frizz in my hair and my styles didn&#x27;t last for more than a day.</li>
            <li> - the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is right after application</li>
            <li> , especially when you discover this right before work at 8 a.m.</li>
            <li> Its also perfect for next day curls, I just wet them a little and then apply this the same way</li>
            <li> It is quite light and smooth, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for &#x27;my&#x27; hair, I have 3c hair been natural for 10 years, and this is the only product that keeps my hair moisturized without having to constantly reapply everyday.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t enhance my curls as much as my homemade concoction; seems more wet and conditioner-feeling than having the right balance of oil which I am not sure I like as much on my hair; I will use it up for my twists.</li>
            <li> I had tried two other styling products from Shea Moisture before I purchased the Curl Enhancing Smooth (I tried Curl Styling Milk and the Curl Enhancing Gel Souffle).</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy on my hair, and keeps it pretty frizz free and soft.</li>
            <li> Usually i cringe at products that are ten or more but its worth it.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> However it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> just can&#x27;t compare, so I&#x27;ve taken my savings and bought some new shoes...</li>
            <li> This is my new product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always looking for new products to take care of my hair.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and it is not sold in my country, so i had no choice to order it.</li>
            <li> Arrived in new condition.  </li>
            <li> Her hair was not hard at all, the curls were defined and soft!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing but left my hair sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Target when I was on vacation and ran out of my regular product which is only available online.</li>
            <li> I am American/Caucasian with thick, curly, and frizzy hair... more frizzy really than anything.</li>
            <li> Her dry hair issues subsided really quickly.</li>
            <li> Can I rave about how much I absolutely love this product for a little bit?!</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product,i even used it for my 4 yr old daughter...</li>
            <li> My hair is normally very soft, has \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; and bounce to it.</li>
            <li> so I applied this with a heat protectant before blow drying and my hair was very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have purchased too many products with very little luck.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty and it definitely makes my curls softer and thicker and as for definition</li>
            <li> The jar is pretty big</li>
            <li> Start with a small amount and add more if needed.</li>
            <li> Coconut and Hibiscus has been a Godsend to my 4c natural hair!  </li>
            <li> You really have to be careful on how much you use, too much will make it look greasy</li>
            <li> I also love the feeling on my hands after I use this, with other products like gels or serums, my hands are left sticky, with the smoothie</li>
            <li> Next, I apply coconut oil with Bergamot and frankincense essential oils (love the smell) to each section, followed by a spritz of water and essential oil blend.  </li>
            <li> I have hair like Tanika Ray (google her) and I first have to detangle my hair in the shower with a different conditioner.</li>
            <li> I expected the product to be too heavy, greasy and sticky but the product smells great and isn&#x27;t at all greasy, sticky, gummy or gritty.</li>
            <li> After the first time using it, there was a VAST difference.</li>
            <li> just used it for the first yesterday, and because my hair got smushed in my sleep last night (as it always does when it&#x27;s curly)</li>
            <li> The first couple days I had not used enough in my hair.</li>
            <li> but then I used a generous amount and WOW!</li>
            <li> and although i&#x27;m no longer rocking my curly natural fro, it did my fro justice!</li>
            <li> it used to be my first choice in moisturizers but now put this in SECOND place</li>
            <li> It truly enhances the curl, which is something worth mentioning as my locks go straight, curly and every other look within that spectrum.</li>
            <li> I first tried it as a deep conditioner</li>
            <li> My search is complete!</li>
            <li> so all my natural sister buy this product !</li>
            <li> It will make it feel nice and soft for a few hours, but then your hair goes back to the norm.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I&#x27;m a true product junkie having spent hundreds of dollars on over priced hair products through the years.</li>
            <li> It smells a little Strong when applied</li>
            <li> I used too much the first time because my hair was super dry, and learned through the residue I saw the next day that it only takes a bit.</li>
            <li> I really thought I was going to enjoy using it after reading other reviews on different</li>
            <li> Oh, I would like to also mention when using this product I use it on dry freshly washed and conditioned hair.</li>
            <li> But the next day, it gets so soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> Your hair begins to curl quickly when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, smooth &amp; not weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> However, the positive side is that it truly moisturized my 2c/3b afro american hair and held my wavy pattern.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it moisturizes my hair very well alone, but when mixed with oils it seems to work better.  </li>
            <li> This product really helps to define my curls and REALLY moisturizes my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> and finally I finger comb in  a little bit of a very light gel.</li>
            <li> I am always interested in having natural hair but it does become very difficult to manage and does not offer many styling options (not denying my true texture</li>
            <li> So right now I&#x27;m using Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque as a leave in conditioner (it&#x27;s not heavy) and their Black Soap for Dry Scalp, and absolutely love both.</li>
            <li> I stopped using relaxers recently and my natural hair was becoming extremely course, my roots looked frizzy and not maintained.</li>
            <li> and take a little more only if I need it.  </li>
            <li> Curly hair is usually much more dry than other hair types and this is what I use to ensure that I get the hydration that I need.</li>
            <li> but it took me a week to clear up the acne.</li>
            <li> My sister is natural and I&#x27;m relaxed</li>
            <li> I may be protein sensitive</li>
            <li> I have natural locks and used this product to twist and hold my locks.  </li>
            <li> I should say that it is quite a natural smell though</li>
            <li> I would recommend this without a doubt to all those who have natural hairstyles coils, twists, spirals, locks, afros.      </li>
            <li> Parts of it can be wavy, straight, or curly all at the same time.</li>
            <li> When I tell you after using various shea moisture products that my hair is very hydrated and moisturized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m once again transitioning to natural hair and so far I&#x27;ve been amazed by how well the shea moisture products work in my hair.</li>
            <li> I will continue to give this product a chance and see how it helps to grow out my natural hair texture.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I prefer Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li> The result was that my hair was soft again.</li>
            <li> (who is now 4 mos old today) in developing a natural haircare routine for her</li>
            <li> I have been natural for almost 2years</li>
            <li> I have been having issues with frizziness the last year or so, but don&#x27;t want it straight; I like having the wave.</li>
            <li> /wave I like, but my hair stays soft and it gets some conditioning with this product.</li>
            <li> Also purchase at Target, Amazon price is completely marked up.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have learned it really depends on your individual hair.</li>
            <li> and i have been natural for 2 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> it leaves it feeling REALLY REALLY soft and its not greasy.</li>
            <li> All of the items I&#x27;ve tried smell like pina colada and leave my hair feeling soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and this stuff works</li>
            <li> My hair is also glycerin sensitive.</li>
            <li> I use the Curl Milk on my ends and to soften week old styles.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I have 4b or very kinky hair.</li>
            <li> She is natural as well</li>
            <li> but I think that is because I am protein sensitive.</li>
            <li> And it feels so soft &amp; it looks healthier.</li>
            <li> This product is what I&#x27;ve been looking for ever since I went natural.</li>
            <li> It is a natural product and is not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this product if you&#x27;ve got hair like mine, but especially if your curls are tighter.</li>
            <li> Soft</li>
            <li> It will enhance your curls and for me it offers a lite hold when styling my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and wanted a product that would moisturize and define my curls.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays soft.  </li>
            <li> BUT as far as my 4a hair type goes....it doesn&#x27;t give sheen when it dries.    </li>
            <li> Anywho, I am a natural girl</li>
            <li> Seems to work well so far for my 4a 4b hair texture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for about 7 years and learning to care for my hair had always been a struggle.</li>
            <li> make my hair soft and curl</li>
            <li> It really is natural and affordable too.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it if you want your natural curls to pop.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Im almost 3 months natural and</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have this natural frizz that can&#x27;t go away once it dries</li>
            <li> It brings out the curls and keeps your hair soft.</li>
            <li> So far, I have used it for braid-outs.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, and even on my relaxed ends, the curly pattern lasts well in most areas for at least a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I have been completely natural for 7 months.</li>
            <li> I tried this product early on in my journey with the transitioning kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian but have very curly and coarse hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> then a natural oil (I use coconut oil), then the cream (Shea Moisture Curl Enhance).</li>
            <li> , It has a really soft hold, so depending on the humidity, you might have to add a gel along side it in order to retain definition for an extended period of time..</li>
            <li> Make my hair soft</li>
            <li> Keeps hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am upset I was foolish enough to buy the whole line of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have 4a natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair came out moisturized, soft to the touch, and bouncy.</li>
            <li> They all are natural and this defines the styles they wear.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair well moisturized and soft to the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I used this for my curls after watching a youtube video of how this natural girl made her curls pop out.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s with natural curly 3a/3b hair.</li>
            <li> I have 3 all natural daughters and my wife decides to try this &amp;#34;Shea Moisture&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it cost to much here.  </li>
            <li> did t help my hair feel soft but this product does.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 12 year old boy, and myself.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly 3b hair with 3c in the crown area</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and my curls shiny.  </li>
            <li> I am a naturally curly, type 3b, 3c hair and this cream</li>
            <li> Both times my hair was fluffy, light, moisturized and</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft that it didnt even hold the curl.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft n shining</li>
            <li> Leaves them soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> I shaved my hair 3 years ago to start my natural journey.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I was worried what my natural hair  would look as it grew.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair really soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> There is one ingredient that isn&#x27;t natural which is caprylyl glycol.</li>
            <li> I read that it&#x27;s just used to preserve the natural ingredients in the product and won&#x27;t cause any harm to hair.</li>
            <li> Recommend this for anybody and even their kids with everything being all natural.</li>
            <li> My hair never dried.  </li>
            <li> It helps define&lt;br /&gt;your natural curls.</li>
            <li> My hair became completely soft.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner really help, of course, and the styling products are simply the icing on the cake.  </li>
            <li> , you get a lot of it, and it has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Light enough to use multiple times a day if necessary.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to some scents and this is one of those scents my nose cannot stand.</li>
            <li> This product does contain glycols which they try to hide in the ingredient list by listing it with natural components.</li>
            <li> hair, which has been a hassle for the last few weeks for me, is now one of my favorite features, once again.</li>
            <li> l was skeptical about trying this, even though the reviews were good.</li>
            <li> I am very new to the natural community having just did my Big Chop about a week ago.</li>
            <li> Right now her hair is 3a/b/c with 2c in the very bottom back, thick yet fine, and rather long for a baby (she was born w/ a headful of hair) and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was disappointed by the fact that it did not make my hair curlier (which I thought it would do, due to the fact that it says \\&quot;curl enhancing\\&quot;) and that there was a very fine line between getting good moisture with no frizz and greasy stringy hair.</li>
            <li> and I let it sit on my hair over night; I first wash and air dry my hair and then use the LOC Method.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair but live in a dry climate</li>
            <li> For fine haired coily girls like me, it&#x27;s been a challenge to find a product that works consistently to provide LASTING moisture to my dry hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully this will end my never ending search for a daily moisturizer for my super dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is like paste and only weighs down my hair which is curly/frizzy fine hair.  </li>
            <li> i love using this on my kids they&#x27;re mixed asian and black</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously going to buy more shae products.</li>
            <li> At first I stopped using any product whatsoever so that any residue would dissipate after a few washes as this product contained coconut oil and made my hair very oily.</li>
            <li> cream does the same exact thing, and I get the same results as when I attempt to use coconut oil by itself to pre-poo.</li>
            <li> and I think I could actually wear it with out pairing it with a gel (I usually use a gel over  serum to get more control).</li>
            <li> It enhances/defines my curls (particularly the ones in the back, which are the curliest).&lt;br /&gt;MY FAULT WITH</li>
            <li> BUT I see is that when the hair dries it does still look a little dry, but I guess it will become better.</li>
            <li> I end up weighing my hair down with too much product because I have to put so much moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, especially for 4b/c textures.</li>
            <li> I was just careful in the amount of product I put in because of my fine strands, but after my perm rod set my curls were so beautifully, and softly defined, I was shocked!</li>
            <li> No other curly product compares!</li>
            <li> Little is fine enough because it curls your hair even when you put some on your palm and massage it into your head.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to this is that because it is moisturizing and acts as a sealant at the same time, if you use it on wet hair, it won&#x27;t dry as quickly, but there are many work arounds for this, such as using a blow dryer to dry your hair instead of air drying it.</li>
            <li> (I have 4a, kinky hair with normal porosity, and medium coarse strands).</li>
            <li> use this and shea moisture curling souffle mixed together in the palm of my hand, rub it all over my slightly wet (but not driping) hair, then let it air dry, and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;I find that wetting my hair with my hands in the mornings, makes me use much less product</li>
            <li> This product really helps to moisturize my hair and scalp which are  uncomfortably dry.</li>
            <li> He has a really course and dry afro.</li>
            <li> I know too much protein can dry the hair so that may have been the reason.</li>
            <li> I thought my real hair was nappy, unruly, dry, frizzy, and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in the process of transitioning from relaxed hair to natural and I must say this product helps bring out my hairs natural curls.</li>
            <li> (that didn&#x27;t work for my thick hair, I need more than sparingly) and if you over use, you may leave a white film on your hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and makes your hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> My hair was very soft, but when I separated my hair it just became a big frizz ball.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for African American women who are going natural/are natural.</li>
            <li> She all my good stuff! :-(</li>
            <li> God bless the folks who make this stuff, because no other product tames my tresses like the Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture smoothie has none of that junk, all good-for-hair ingredients, smells heavenly and defines my curls like no other.  </li>
            <li> No regrets!</li>
            <li> I have major allergies and have had to replace almost all of my products.  </li>
            <li> This is a thicker version of the curl milk, I would suggest using it if you are lacking extreme moisture in your hair, but using the curl milk first.</li>
            <li> My ends aren&#x27;t dry any more and no more breakage.</li>
            <li> &quot; hair, with little success, and part of it I learned might&#x27;ve been from a) lots of split ends and b) heat damaged-hair from one time using too near-boiling water to rinse, and my one-time out of 4 years that i blow-dried.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product, I was worried because it seemed like this product was mainly for African American type hair.</li>
            <li> smells good, very moisturizing, and a little goes a long way because it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> My curls were defined and I had a light hold which wasn&#x27;t too hard or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> All I do when I get up is use a couple of dabs of Shea Moisture to condition and style my hair apply a dab or two of ECO styling gel, use a silicon scrunchie to pull my hair back from my face, dab a little bit of gel to smooth any stray hairs on my temples and forehead or the back of my neck with a brush, throw on a head band or two</li>
            <li> I have dry and thick 4B/4C hair, so moisturizing is very important to me.</li>
            <li> And at least twice a year, they go on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s and Walgreen&#x27;s Online for BOGO free.  </li>
            <li> Product would have 5 stars if offered in larger quantities which would decease my frequent trips to Target.</li>
            <li> And this is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve ever used that provides both moisture and soft hold.  </li>
            <li> It smells heavenly and really clumped my curls together when I used it sparingly on just conditioned wet hair.</li>
            <li> and I barely need any.</li>
            <li> my hair is extra soft.</li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair off and went natural.</li>
            <li> However, I will definitely use it for my 12 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li> No shine either, as for curls, they&#x27;re barely there.</li>
            <li> The next day I showered and straightened my hair (without reapplying the product) and my hair felt SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> Sooooo soft FINALLY after years of coarse-ness!  </li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had so far is the humidity on a rainy day --</li>
            <li> Overall, I think Shea moisture offers a quality value product.</li>
            <li> I just recently decided to wear my hair natural.</li>
            <li> While the Smoothie did leave my hair soft and managable, the curls definitely weren&#x27;t defined.</li>
            <li> One night she only tried the Curl enhancing Smoothie to wake up with baby soft hair and her curls &amp;#34;co-operated&amp;#34; with her when she was doing her hair.</li>
            <li> Be warned though it is marked up by over double the price you can settle for elsewhere.</li>
            <li> She says its ok for moisturizing, but not great for styling</li>
            <li> I still think the product is just okay not great</li>
            <li> As mentioned in earlier reviews, the smell can be strong, I have learned that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I was transitioning - only applying it to the new growth and now that I have a short pixie cut which I wear as a TWA (teeny-weeny-afro)</li>
            <li> It was only then that I realized how dry my hair really was.</li>
            <li> The product dried fairly quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to constantly deal with dripping product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 2 and a half year daughter, her hair is very curly and was getting so dry that I was really worried.  </li>
            <li> The product smells good, but it made my hair look dull, didn&#x27;t enhance the curl, and my hair felt a little dry.</li>
            <li> I did the twist out and my hair looked a shiny hot mess.  </li>
            <li> As it grows longer it tends to look like a hot mess.</li>
            <li> I had originally bought this product for my daughter, who has thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing, I applied it liberally to my very damp hair and proceeded to flat twist and air dry overnight.</li>
            <li> After having such a positive experience with Miss Jessie&#x27;s Buttercream, I thought I&#x27;d try this due to</li>
            <li> Now the prices from the available sellers are ridiculous</li>
            <li> Because of this I&#x27;ve transitioned back and forth between natural and relaxed hair several times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am mixed, natural 5 yrs and have 3 different textures in my hair...</li>
            <li> I love the definition it gives my curls without the crunchiness left behind by gels.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product applied to wet hair.  </li>
            <li> While my hair is softer and more manageable than the average black person, it tends to get dry</li>
            <li> so she won&#x27;t have to go through the countless relaxers, hair damage, inadequate hair products, and the general all out battle with her hair that I&#x27;ve gone through and continue to go through.  </li>
            <li> Well to say the least many of the other products that I&#x27;ve tried does not even come close to this.</li>
            <li> I only end up washing my hair because it gets oily, but it is not caused by this product (my hair is naturally oily within a few days curly or straight).  </li>
            <li> I have natural wave in my long hair and it is colored.</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my natural hair and forms my tiny curls that last all day, and like the texture of my hair not sticky!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and not frizzy all day long.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with this product because it has a thick consistency which makes it easier for me to grab more than I actually need.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie is a thick, super-moisturizing cream chock full of nourishing ingredients that smells like a tropical paradise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is biracial and has a head full of thick curls.  </li>
            <li> But it was too sweet smelling and thick</li>
            <li> This product is helping me a lot, after the shower I apply small amount on her hair, mainly on the ends, give a soft massage and then....I can comb it without hurting her!!</li>
            <li> If you get the same results I got,using it the first day,at least your second day hair will be decent and you can stretch your money.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need too much to weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product line due to the convenience of it being available at Target and its effectiveness in getting me the look I want without harsh, damaging ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does not way down my hair, it does not make my curls hard.</li>
            <li> as I have learned using too much will cause a slight residue.</li>
            <li> so if you happen to want to just wash your hair and not blow dry it..this product allows you to do that and and still leave your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price.</li>
            <li> I had seen this product on several social media sites by users recommending it.</li>
            <li> then i saw it for less but same large size jar, and purchased that one too.  </li>
            <li> and then i had to tie it back down for about another 15 minutes That takes waaaay toooo much time to get my doo together before going to work each morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just moisten the curl with a little bit of water, then smooth a tiny amount of the smoothie down the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m having a good hair day my hair is really pretty, but on a bad hair day it can be a mass of limp frizz.</li>
            <li> Also, the product is very rich so use a small amount at a time or your hair will end up feeling heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> As my hair gets longer, I need a stronger hold to keep it looking volumized and not flat.</li>
            <li> I naturally have fairly loose curls that gradually straighten out the longer</li>
            <li> and I totally recommend it for anyone going natural with dry hair (4a/4b/4c).</li>
            <li> My hair reacted horribly, It left my hair dry, dry, dry DRY and super frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product makes that possible, before I spent 30 minutes or longer to get my hair right using globs of hair gel, than I had to tie my hair down, so the style would the style would set while I drove to work.</li>
            <li> If when your hair dries you see white little patches or specks of product, you used too much product.</li>
            <li> I even mixed it with a little grape seed/coconut oil and that did absolutely nothing but leave my hair with a white coating.</li>
            <li> This product really defines my natural curls without getting hard.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes without weighing it down!</li>
            <li> I have clear skin after I went minimal with body and hair products 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> The bad thing is it took my hair forever to dry (more than 2 hours that first day).</li>
            <li> It contains, pure, raw shea butter-100% organic.  </li>
            <li> I clipped some of my remaining relaxed hair, used pure, raw shea butter as a night-time moisturizer, and braided my hair overnight.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft for several days at a time, I just use the Hold &amp; Shine Moisture Mist spray every other day to touch up.</li>
            <li> Remember a little goes a long way with these products, you will not have to use that much.</li>
            <li> Try Target, Walgreens, and other places that sell natural hair products, and you don&#x27;t have to do it online.</li>
            <li> IF LAYERED WITH OTHER OILS LIKE COCONUT, AND A SOFT HOLD FOR TWIST/BRAID OUTS.</li>
            <li> I read in one of the other reviews that this product is not for protein sensitive.</li>
            <li> After using the Smoothie, I decided to look at YouTube videos and find out how other women were using the Smoothie to define their natural hair.    </li>
            <li> As any other product junkie will tell you some of those other brands are very pricey (over priced if you ask me).</li>
            <li> The next several times, I used about a tablespoon (I have shoulder length 3a curls that are coarse and dry)</li>
            <li> I had a solid hair routine that involved Mixed Chicks shampoo, deep conditioner and leave in, which worked, but my hair still felt dry after using it.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and used small amounts on large sections of hair.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, all you have to do is spritz your hair with cold water and place the smoothie in and style.</li>
            <li> I only have to use a little bit for each section of my hair, and it stays soft and manageable for several days!</li>
            <li> Careful though, don&#x27;t use too much, just a little will do or your hair will be white and messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My naturally curly hair is short and I was just looking for something to define the curl with a slight hold.</li>
            <li> but it has a coil to it not really a z pattern), my normally dry and brittle hair is now soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> but I usually don&#x27;t get much control.</li>
            <li> I will probably use this in the near future, but for now i will look for something that gives moisture without all the mess.</li>
            <li> (Vitamin E)it flat and greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item after drooling over it for so long.</li>
            <li> In the mornings my curls (after sleeping with a silk bonnet on -- even with retwists) made my hair flat.</li>
            <li> i only gave it 2 stars because it takes way too long to absorb.  </li>
            <li> They have done wonders for his coarse, curly, long hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry, and for the first time in a long time, it dried into soft, manageable curls with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li> BUT only use a small amount, other wise it will flake and look a little dull.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for a little over 2 years now and have tried *countless* products and product lines.</li>
            <li> I actually like it but in all honesty if you use way too much it can become hard on your hair.</li>
            <li> Her hair does get extremely dry and frizzy in the back where she lays her head</li>
            <li> and all natural!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural black 4a/b hair.</li>
            <li> Well, as far as the curl definition and slight hold</li>
            <li> My hair has been really dry recently</li>
            <li> It is also very coarse and dry.</li>
            <li> am really curious why a lot of Shea Moisture products are more expensive on Amazon than in stores.</li>
            <li> and then once again on a second occasion while my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> The only con in my opinion is that once my hair is dry and I want to use this product, I have to use quite a bit to get the job done, I don&#x27;t like overloading my hair with product</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I smoothed it back with my hands and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I like to use my hair natural wavy (not style it straight) because of my thin hair and</li>
            <li> At first I was crazily skeptical about purchasing this product because I have fine hair strands (although my hair appears quite dense and thick) which made me worry about the thickness of this.</li>
            <li> Also, for my daughter&#x27;s thick natural (but soft at the roots) hair.</li>
            <li> I have very soft curls that have been limp and non existant for awhile</li>
            <li> I have long soft but dull waistlength frizzy hair that shrinks to my shoulders with any natural product when it dries.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find products for black hair that isn&#x27;t full of petrolatum, mineral oil and alcohol.  </li>
            <li> only a tiny section for black hair care which I think is ridiculous in the first place!</li>
            <li> But since qhemet is ALWAYS out of stock and/or sold out I have been on the search for a suitable (and maybe less expensive??)</li>
            <li> Dont be afraid to use this product, its not extremely heavy &amp; it has the right amount of oils (not too much, not too little)</li>
            <li> I found this product at Target and decided to give it a try considering the price of the other things that I was buying ( more expensive than Cantu but cheaper than Carol&#x27;s daughter and way cheaper than Miss Jessie&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> I have used countless and I do mean countless so called moisturizers claiming to moisturize the hair and make it soft and supple at the same time.</li>
            <li> This left my hair VERY dry.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair feeling very dry.  </li>
            <li> would totally recommend it for loose curls and wave patterns but not really for kinky, coarse hair unless you are using it specifically as a styling balm.</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and my hair is less dry.</li>
            <li> This smoothie brings them out, defines them and keeps them in tact for at least two days if I can keep my routine straight.</li>
            <li> it gives my hair moisture all day long.</li>
            <li> So I stopped using the Shea Moisture and tried using only the homemade mixture on my wet braid out.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this prodcut as long as you plan to use it with gel.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long ways</li>
            <li> ago and have been looking for a moisturizer just as long.</li>
            <li> A lil bit of this product goes a long way</li>
            <li> When my hair dried completely, I have defined curls, BUT MY HAIR IS STILL FRIZZY.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my go-to product as long as long as it keeps going what its doing.</li>
            <li> For those who claim that this product left their hair sticky with residue, try using it SPARINGLY  on SOAKING WET hair.</li>
            <li> We will continue to groom her hair with this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> My hair is now 9 inches long</li>
            <li> She loves to wear it long</li>
            <li> Lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Probably going to buy this stuff as long as they make it.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight hold, very thick, but light on the hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed black and white</li>
            <li> My main problem is that whenever I used this after a few days my hair would have white residue and I felt that even when there was no such residue, my hair just did not look as shiny as usual.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit, so the tub will last for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Most of the time products do not really bother me if they are a little thick or heavy</li>
            <li> Now, if the ingredient list is not complete, I can only imagine what other ingredients that are in there that are purposely NOT listed on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With other creams my hair would look dull after it dried up, but with this one it still looks fine, wet and shiny.</li>
            <li> I tried it several times with and without using other products, with and without blowdrying and every time there was some degree of horror that led to me rinsing it out before I could leave the house.</li>
            <li> then my ends started splitting something serious....threw it away after seeing other reviews of the same thing</li>
            <li> I just know the price this is being sold for here is too expensive target and many other stores have this along with the other Shea moisture products for 10$</li>
            <li> So I tried to use it again as a styler the next wash day for a braid out, using only a little.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been reading some other reviews and some say that it should NOT go on the scalp only on the hair</li>
            <li> Amazon should be ashame, this product is much cheaper less shipping at walgreens and riteaids!!!</li>
            <li> The only product I could find that didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy, wet looking and weighed it down and actually inhanced my curls.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything but dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> My hair always tends to the dry side.</li>
            <li> It caused my hair to dry off and break after extended usage.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t dry it out either.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has a tex will know how incredibly dry</li>
            <li> my hair is so dry and frizzy and this just works wonders for me,</li>
            <li> and you get the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look dry if I&#x27;m making any sense</li>
            <li> and it took forever to dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous how much they are charging here.</li>
            <li> I found my hair to be dry after day three of using it.</li>
            <li> I do have dry hair, so if you have oily hair this wouldn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> so I avoid them as they dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> I wash and condition my hair, towel dry, and then apply the Curl Enhancing Smoothie.  </li>
            <li> I then allow my hair to air dry until about 50% dry.  </li>
            <li> Then I apply a liquid foaming mousse and rollers and allow to air dry.  </li>
            <li> It also tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> Instead, I&#x27;m going to try the Shea Butter Restorative kit for my dry, chemicially-dyed hair instead.    </li>
            <li> When I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> but after day 2-3, it get dry and crunchy...</li>
            <li> I applied it on dry hair and then proceeded to twist.</li>
            <li> Then, I take my fingers and massage my hair in a circular fasion and then let it dry.</li>
            <li> So if you have dry hair like me</li>
            <li> but my hair looked and felt dry.</li>
            <li> ON DRY HAIR</li>
            <li> and I can dry it or let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Twist or spiral the curl, then let dry.</li>
            <li> I like that it can be used on dry hair</li>
            <li> you use a tiny, tiny (half a dime size) for half your head, mixed with either the Gel Souffle or an oil of your choice, it may work out.</li>
            <li> Instead, it sits on top of my hair like a thick paste and then when my hair dries, it leaves behind a residue-like film and flakes here and there.</li>
            <li> Me and &amp;#34;cremes&amp;#34; never seemed to mix, they would always leave my hair greasy, dull and undefined due to the large amounts of butters added to them.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that after the smoothie set, that my curls returned, and only needed a little separating to get them fluffy again.</li>
            <li> I let it dry overnight and usually wake up with soft, moisturized twists.</li>
            <li> I am an african american woman with very thick natural hair.</li>
            <li> With this, my hair is softer than with any other product WITHOUT making it flat and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes me about three weeks to use the entire jar (average 3x a week).</li>
            <li> Prior to the wide spread use of the internet and availability of other products I just didn&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
            <li> This product can be purchased directly at retail for no more than $10.99 to $12.99.</li>
            <li> OR if I go upside down and scrunch I get even smaller ringlets and curlier hair.  </li>
            <li> It down not curl my 4C coarse texure hair though</li>
            <li> Everything I tried either weighed my hair down, made it crunchy, was too greasy, not enough moisture</li>
            <li> I know it was the smoothie because it is the only new thing that I have put in my hair over the past few days</li>
            <li> , i see it definitely lasting a very long time so ill decide by then whether or not ill buy another one.</li>
            <li> First of all it has a paste like consistency and when i tied down my hair for about a half hour my hair still had a past residue</li>
            <li> , LET IT DRY, AND TAKE IT OUT!</li>
            <li> I tried to use less with the same results--it leaves a film on my hair.</li>
            <li> Kept trying this product over and over  on wet and dry hair (3c)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed (mom is black and dad is portugese).</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair wet or dry before I twist my hair.  </li>
            <li> For the wash and go, I used it with the Gel Soufflé and with the African Black Soap Leave-in Balancing Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Works well with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage just after one use and that&#x27;s a big deal for me because I&#x27;m trying to grow out my hair.</li>
            <li> As soon as I applied it to her hair, I noticed her curls instantly became moisturized and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Mind you, my hair gets a little dry after the second day</li>
            <li> If I think I need to use a little gel on the ends of my hair after I style it, the only gel I will use is Shea Moisture&#x27;s gel because it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and my hair stays soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it to be a little too heavy for styling my hair.. if I used too much it weighed it down and looked greasy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and this hydrates my thirsty hair, but is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have that white residue look goin on (not cool).</li>
            <li> I bought the product to use for my twist outs since it seemed like I was always left with an undesireable frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I only need a little?</li>
            <li> One little jar could easily last me two months</li>
            <li> I dampened my hair a little, mixed this with the gel souffle and did the two strand twists.  </li>
            <li> Because I use just a little, I am guessing it will last a while</li>
            <li> left my hair looking and feeling a little greasy).</li>
            <li> I have an extremely (I mean,an extremely) dry scalp.</li>
            <li> If your looking for something that defines your natural curls without making your hair hard; you have to try Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li> then if you are natural,you have an even harder time finding products.    </li>
            <li> When my hair is wet, I just tap my fingers in the jar and apply it all over.</li>
            <li> I tried everything from john freida, paul mitchell, pink lotion, and hawaiian silky.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rinse it out, but I do apply it to wet hair.  </li>
            <li> After detangling I applied the product on rather damp, not dripping wet, hair.</li>
            <li> All I had to do was wet and brush my edges and put on a hair band</li>
            <li> This time I raked the product through with my fingers on my sopping wet hair.</li>
            <li> only a few uses out of it.</li>
            <li> NO THANKS you can get this product at Targer for $9.99.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using with wet or damp</li>
            <li> limp waves back to my curly spirals.</li>
            <li> Does wonders with my hair as expected.  </li>
            <li> I use this product after co-washing and apply smoothie to soaking wet hair.</li>
            <li> I am a recent &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; and I have tried a few products.</li>
            <li> I tried quite a few different techniques to make it work before I threw in the towel</li>
            <li> It hadn&#x27;t grown in months, and what used to be soft, thick hair had become brittle and riddled with split ends.</li>
            <li> I have natural, thick, 4b hair and thought this product would work well.</li>
            <li> You either loved it or hated it.</li>
            <li> i even used this stuff to flat iron my hair a few days ago</li>
            <li> so you only need a little bit!</li>
            <li> little of the Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie goes a long way so the 12 oz jar lasts a couple of months.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way-</li>
            <li> Just like the style milk- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> So a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it in my L.O.C method but it left my hair dry, hard,greasy and dull.</li>
            <li> So I started my search for something that would definitely enhance these natural waves, especially since I hate straightening my hair all the time, but don&#x27;t like the natural wave I have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for something that worked for my hair that didn&#x27;t turn it into a crunchy, dry mess and this Shea Moisture delivered 100% for me.</li>
            <li> Again my hair was a frizzy dry mess.</li>
            <li> I only need a small amount, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> For a funky, crazy and free look (like Tanika) apply less.</li>
            <li> I have really course, really difficult to wrangle-in, naturally dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tight kinky curly hair that always feels dry.</li>
            <li> Your hair might feel a little stiff at the end of the day, but not dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend using it sparingly and not in conjunction with the other coconut and hibiscus line as they contain silk protein, that would probably be an overabundance.</li>
            <li> Other products I recommend to try with this are (shea moisture Jamaican castor oil hair lotion, shea moisture Jamaican castor oil shampoo &amp; leave in conditioner)</li>
            <li> I usually use it by itself for days when I want a deep moisturizing treatment.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other products.</li>
            <li> this stuff will last me a month, not something I could say with past products.</li>
            <li> I still however recommend it to other people looking for a style cream that moisturizes because i believe in this brand and its quality.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair about once or twice a week, but I shower every day, so I usually also condition my hair even when I don&#x27;t shampoo.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long away!</li>
            <li> you can view it on youtube to see the results on other people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I started off with the Leave-In Conditioner, then decided to try the other products at Target.</li>
            <li> I have used it with other products</li>
            <li> but I found out in combonation with other products it leaves your hair gucky.</li>
            <li> Now, I am not sure if it actually enhances my curls (reason for 4 stars)</li>
            <li> Hope this helps for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have extremely curly hair</li>
            <li> The next day, I style as usual and what do you know?  </li>
            <li> One of my other staple products.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t mix well with other products.</li>
            <li> I put it on my 4C extreme coiling shrinking hair and felt it did nothing</li>
            <li> and it works extremely well with extreme coily hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can rub this product all day and it will still have small white baby balls in my curls</li>
            <li> For all other races there was an abundance of hair care products.</li>
            <li> I like there other products</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m twisting my hair, to refresh a style or even to slick back my hair and prevent frizz if I don&#x27;t want to use gel.</li>
            <li> However, it is extremely overpriced on this website.</li>
            <li> I did not apply Gel and my hair was frizzy due to the summer weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they ship internationally</li>
            <li> I can use for other things.</li>
            <li> I usually then use a big comb to get knots out.</li>
            <li> I wish it would add curls to my hair but due to the fact</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be trying any other products.</li>
            <li> Hear me rave about this and some other shea moisture products i purchased on my youtube beauty channel search me on youtube @diamondrosaaye</li>
            <li> , you can pick it up for $9.99 at target, walgreens and other retailers (they also have BOGO deals as well)</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> On the 2nd day, I wet my hair down, then scrunch the Smoothie into my curls, then style as usual.</li>
            <li> The hold is not strong enough for my hair type, so I use this under my IC Fantasia Gel (Olive Oil or Hard to Hold) and achieve terrific results.  </li>
            <li> I am a wash-n-go girl, so I let my hair dry just a little and then apply it on the damp hair.</li>
            <li> Needless to say the line isn&#x27;t too bad but isn&#x27;t all that great either.</li>
            <li> Ladies, I am usually skeptical about these products but so far I&#x27;ve had no problems especially with Shea Moisture.  </li>
            <li> As if I coated a heavy oil over dry hair without putting a penetrating oil like coconut oil on first.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Previously I would use cheaper brand gel or mousse, but these would always cause my hair to either be frizzy, or crunchy with a wet look.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and short (due to me cutting off my permed/ damaged hair); I am also going natural</li>
            <li> I tried decreasing the amount I used, and putting a little in my hair while it was wet, but I just couldn&#x27;t get the hang of how to use it.</li>
            <li> I then add a little coconut or apricot oil to my wet hair, then I spritz Shea moisture volumizing spray</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy and very thick and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> This products left my braid/twist out dull and shrunken.</li>
            <li> and this is the only product that tames it without making it hard.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a product that actually defines my dense head of hair and doesn&#x27;t just look dry by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> but it left a coating on my hair that had it looking very dull and dry, and it felt like something was on my hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it can leave build up.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is that it is overpriced here.  </li>
            <li> I had no success.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is my hair doesn&#x27;t stay moisturized for longer than 3 days.</li>
            <li> Next month I will order at least 5 jars to ensure I will not run out.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say about it</li>
            <li> A small amount of this product goes a long way</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this product is that there is a LOT of shrinkage which I can&#x27;t stand</li>
            <li> I have thick blonde hair in ringlets.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about it, I wasn&#x27;t impress after my 1st use, but I kept using it because I spent 10 bucks on it and didn&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li> I have thick Curly hair (Bi-racial Mexican/African American)</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and Curley and is cut very short.</li>
            <li> Leave it on wet hair overnight with a shower cap and rinse the next day (something I failed to do) for a deep condition or use a small amount on dry hair for moisture ( and seal it with a finishing spray of course).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like it weighs down your hair</li>
            <li> hair down..</li>
            <li> I style it, leave it up for the week and take down for a day or two before co-washing again.</li>
            <li> this product is price from 42.99 down to 23.15 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried this product again and did NOT apply to scalp just hair midway down to ends</li>
            <li> I mean, I was literally whipping my head back and forth and dancing around.</li>
            <li> This left my hair a clumpy icky mess and it seemed to attract the dirt in the air.</li>
            <li> remember to only use a little bit as this product is quite thick and will otherwise weigh your hair down and/or make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Although the milk and shampoo containers are a bit small a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I DEFINITELY recommend people with dry, dull, hard to curl hair use this.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be too heavy, greasy, and nothing that I expected!</li>
            <li> and i seriously cannot recommend it enough.  </li>
            <li> I use the Black Soap Body Wash also and the Hibiscus shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I use less gel when putting my hair up in my afro puff.</li>
            <li> and I realized I was using less get to style my up into an afro puff for work.</li>
            <li> I received the product and commenced my typical hair routine.</li>
            <li> I have recently fully transitioned to natural by cutting off all my Permed hair.</li>
            <li> But personally,I want a product that doesn&#x27;t take a day and a half to work!Hopefully</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m gonna try something less oily.</li>
            <li> There was slight hold</li>
            <li> I previously gave it four stars</li>
            <li> This product is half the cost at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair is very dry.  </li>
            <li> but I have used my share of \\&quot;natural hair care\\&quot; products only to find that certain chemicals are terrible for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I simply take a few scoops with my finger (very small scoops) and work it through slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> and I normally buy expensive products and products that you don&#x27;t get from a store that is in everyone&#x27;s reach,</li>
            <li> The smoothie is thick and smallest amt goes a long way and since the container is 12 oz</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, 5 inches below my shoulders</li>
            <li> But after a while, my hair felt weighed down with a heavy residue.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy or packed down.</li>
            <li> A little background on me: I&#x27;m middle eastern with 3a/b curls that are generally not too difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> I have 4a 4b tight coil hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is a tight kinky curly hair grade without a lot of the kinky.</li>
            <li> My hair looked dull, unkept, frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> After the chop, my hair was dull, dry, had no pattern of curls.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown, S-wavy hair that was a little too fluffy and had a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li> Lately is seems my crown has been very dry and frizzy, probably from highlighting and gels to keep down on the frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dry lately so</li>
            <li> This product sleeks down my hair so it looks shiny and tame.  </li>
            <li> may my mother used Liv on my hair when I was little for braids/braid-outs, finger curls, twist/twist-outs and smoothing ponytails.  </li>
            <li> i am used to stuff that has little or no smell, so this threw me a bit.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a little cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li> If you want, just sprinkle a little water on your hair to soften it up</li>
            <li> and too little will cause frizz.</li>
            <li> a little longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some days, I looked like Little Richard with a curly bouffant.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rich or anything.</li>
            <li> A little goes</li>
            <li> My hair is moisturized with little to no shedding.  </li>
            <li> I always mix this will a little gel</li>
            <li> and I used it for our little girls hair.</li>
            <li> Then, I decided to do a little experimenting.</li>
            <li> It also holds my curls a little bit, but I don&#x27;t think anyone should buy it with that in mind.  </li>
            <li> also shake up a little curl enhancing smoothie with some aloe, olive oil, and water in a spray bottle and use it as a hair moisturizing spray in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> The reviews recommended using just a little</li>
            <li> A little goes along way</li>
            <li> I will use it as a mask and then wash it off, but I won&#x27;t leave it on as I usually do with other hair products, just because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone with thick, curly hair!</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> So, I used a little of this on my finger tips while two strand twisting my partially dried hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out very late, I carry a tiny spray bottle of water and just a few squirts activates my curls again.</li>
            <li> so I was worried a heavy cream would way it down!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use with Qhemetic Biologics Amla &amp; Olive Heavy Cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a few times to my damp hair, expecting it to support the definition of my curls, but as soon as it dries, it doesn&#x27;t hold and the curls separate and frizz.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have to go to waste though.</li>
            <li> use the smoothie just about everyday as a sealant and moisturizer after I co-wash my hair in the mornings.</li>
            <li> This product is just sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> and I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> After a few days I decided to buy this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They look limp and stringy and greasy.</li>
            <li> do like me and waste your money.</li>
            <li> Instead I wasted $10 on a product that now is in the trash.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste</li>
            <li> I use this as an everyday styling smoothie.</li>
            <li> If not, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This keeps my curls hydrated w/o making them heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used to name just a few IC gel, Hawaiian Silky 14 n 1,</li>
            <li> heavy handed  but does the job.</li>
            <li> so once I&#x27;ve used this for a few days I feel the need to wash my hair and get rid of all the product build up.</li>
            <li> tired mixing it with the products mentioned above</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> incredibly heavy and greasy and made me look like i hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a week.</li>
            <li> Heavy and sticky.  </li>
            <li> You can purchase this at Wal Mart, Targets or Walgreen for 9.99 all day Everyday.</li>
            <li> soon dried up and flaked....</li>
            <li> This smoothie does the job without being heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> I am a white latina with wavy thin hair.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have completely wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this much trouble with a hair product in decades.  </li>
            <li> but It was, sadly, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but i gave it to somebody because i didn&#x27;t want it to waste.</li>
            <li> but we were having trouble finding a product that would enhance her curls and not look frizzy.  </li>
            <li> a start, while the consistency seems like a thick, thick dream, it actually never absorbs into the hair.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair will dry out to the point where I am running to wash it, because it itches so bad.</li>
            <li> we did a small section with less</li>
            <li> I also spray my hair with water at night and put a little of the smoothie on with some raw Shea butter to help condition my hair.</li>
            <li> they sell this (and there other products) for at least 50% LESS than what is offered here!</li>
            <li> I have 2c/3a hair, I use a very small amount on soaking wet hair as a sealer before the rest of my stylers.</li>
            <li> I used Miss Jessies curly buttercreme (the minty smelling black label) and it is very heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen others with my hair type that rave about this, but where their hair absorbs it, mine just lies clumpy, stiff and residue-y.</li>
            <li> I will say that on day one after washing my hair, the texture will feel a teeny bit stiff from the smoothie.</li>
            <li> It holds curs without feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be too heavy for my soft, thick wavy brunette long hair, but wrong I was!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a mess of thick kinky frizzy tight curls.</li>
            <li> Alas,nothing works!I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient is in the smoothie that coats the hair strands that way,but it is definetly undesirable to have a milky,white substance dripping from my hair all day long!Rinsing a little bit out of my hair with water</li>
            <li> Brush my hair after the shower, twisht and drain the water out - towel soak a little then briskly apply a SMALL amount to my ends, raking it in but not coating my hair with it.</li>
            <li> This product let my hair roasted, hard and ripped, when I was washing the hair in the shower the hair fallen down.  </li>
            <li> My kinky hair has some very small spirally curls and other areas where there is an S-curl.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with raw coconut.</li>
            <li> I have very tightly curled hair.</li>
            <li> Also a little goes a LOOOOOOOONG way!</li>
            <li> Or if you use the oil to seal it, just use very little.</li>
            <li> I was having hard hair issues when my hair air dried.</li>
            <li> I usually use Kinky Curly Curling custard and I was looking for a cheaper alternative.  </li>
            <li> WOW the price on here is crazy,</li>
            <li> One of the most disgusting products I&#x27;ve ever tried for my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the product and usually mix it with an ecostyler for my twist-outs.  </li>
            <li> I go without washing my hair, which is usually twice a week, sometimes once.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually need any help making my curls pop after a wash.  </li>
            <li> Online, I usually use naturallycurly.com curl mart although I just checked and they don&#x27;t have this product.</li>
            <li> My curls are type 3 and usually when I use creme products, I get some frizz protection</li>
            <li> not sure what I could use to fix this,</li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now unfortunately the twist outs only keep for one day but it works for me because the day I untwist my twists is the day I was my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair care section for women of color was so small</li>
            <li> But after I apply the smoothie (just a small amount per section)</li>
            <li> but they need to lower their prices on their products or either make their containers bigger because its expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> I am not sure what that means but that might be me.</li>
            <li> This is only $9.99 in target and walgreen, why its so expensive here is beyond me.</li>
            <li> no more tangles spray (to detangle ofcourse) and leave my hair alone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what letter/number my hair is.</li>
            <li> I felt like owning this would be something of a rite of passage along my natural hair journey, but alas, I&#x27;m shocked that this simply did not work!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I had this issue..</li>
            <li> I would like to try it again, but it was so thick and heavy like putting glue on my hair that I dont have the patience to deal with it.lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why Amazon has a price listed as $21.99.</li>
            <li> I am not able to fully rate this product.  </li>
            <li> My curl lasts way beyond the usual 2 to 3 months.  </li>
            <li> The product does everything that it is supposed to and it isn&#x27;t harsh on your hair!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I have 4a type hair and usually co-wash</li>
            <li> I find that when i finger comb it through small sections of my hair</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s ALOT of money when you can get it for $20 LESS!!</li>
            <li> Holy cow!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie when I was at Target oneday because I was short on money and it was the least expensive.</li>
            <li> For some reason it makes it hard</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to like this product.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair hard at all.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for those looking for a moisturizer and curl defining creme that does not make the hair hard and does not burn a hole in your wallet.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel hard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little confused though, because this product is NOT $30.00.</li>
            <li> It is a bit misleading and confusing, IT IS NOT INTENDED FOR HOLD.  </li>
            <li> but it sucks up whatever moisture you put in your hair.</li>
            <li> Duh</li>
            <li> Big disappointment</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone who relaxed or straightens their hair because the water base is only going to make it harder to maintain those styles.</li>
            <li> It has a delicate scent, not over powering at all.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a thick consistency, so use it with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and curly.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this product is thick and should be used sparingly.</li>
            <li> I have kinky, thick hair</li>
            <li> It was sticky and greasy and too thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick 4c hair.</li>
            <li> It is a thick moisturizer, that makes your hair shrink into curls.</li>
            <li> I always thought I had thick hair</li>
            <li> I have really thick and curly texturized hair and my hair loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> It has a creamy, thick consistency.</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> The scent is crazy strong for me and it leaves my hair and scalp flaky :(</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid that it may give me HORRIBLE  results like Kinky Curly Custard  which is also waaaay pricey, smells like a sweet shoppe and once you touch your waves after they dry</li>
            <li> I think though, it might be less expensive at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Also, I purchased a more expensive product that my sister raved about and had horrible results.  </li>
            <li> The asking price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a bad smell by any means, just different for me</li>
            <li> well, i saw this product in target a few weeks ago and decided to try it when i twisted my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was not a good look.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy if you do work that makes you sweat a lot</li>
            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed going to two different Targets in my area</li>
            <li> If you have thick and curly hair I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Hair gets all poofy and tangled and very hard to comb or manage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to tie my hair down anymore!!!!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> have naturally very thick and wavy hair, and in humidity, I discovered it would get increasingly curly.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very thick.</li>
            <li> Finally a solution to my mad curl days!</li>
            <li> Im extremely confused as to why amazon is selling this product for $30.00 when everytime I&#x27;ve ever bought any of their products</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had a hair dresser tell me my hair is thin</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never experienced an itchy scalp issue like this</li>
            <li> It was very difficult for me to give anything with this brand name less than 5 stars for i</li>
            <li> But seriously, who prices this stuff on this site?!</li>
            <li> Seriously recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product if  you have any remote affection for the qhemet A&amp;O HC, you will be sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried a leave-in mask that I couldn&#x27;t stand (I won&#x27;t name names, but it was dreadful), and new brands of shampoos and conditioners that didn&#x27;t seem to have an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Once it dried it flaked badly.  </li>
            <li> and I hate sleeping on wet hair because it always looks smushed in the morning.</li>
            <li> once it is on the hair though it becomes very subtle and faint.  </li>
            <li> , it is expensive for what I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave any weird residue</li>
            <li> My sister and I have had two different effects from shea butter, and just as shea butter locks her hair, coconut oil makes my hair frizz something awful.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that Shea Moisture&#x27;s curl enhancing smoothie would do whit promised: enhancing my curl.</li>
            <li> Wrong answer.  </li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> This is my go to product when I want to rock twisted styles.  </li>
            <li> There is just no comparison between the two but dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> Sadly this product did not work for me. :</li>
            <li> This product failed in all categories.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.     </li>
            <li> It produced a nasty build up that I could actually see...</li>
            <li> But I thought it was because I used it wrong</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> and I felt I was doing the poor child an injustice!  </li>
            <li> My hair seems to like shea butter, but I hate the smell of it raw</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with this product on this site is the price; it is UTTERLY RIDICULOUS!!</li>
            <li> Seriously!!</li>
            <li> For instance, I am twist out gal and hate wash and go because of the excessive shrinkage.  </li>
            <li> but I got a horrible acne reaction from a single use.</li>
            <li> Although the price on here is crazy this is a PRODUCT review so the 3 stars are for the product.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also it was too heavy for my hair and my curls turned out terrible.</li>
            <li> but this one was a disappointment</li>
            <li> Which btw I think is so unfair!    </li>
            <li> Was I WRONG!</li>
            <li> And your hair feels so dirty and disgusting like you didn&#x27;t wash it in at least a month.</li>
            <li> Also it has no-no ingredients in it (petolatem, mineral oil....yuck), not to mention, very expensive.....</li>
            <li> I have a very difficult time finding hair products that work for me.</li>
            <li> Again, just RIDICULOUS!!!</li>
            <li> But, this week, was bad.</li>
            <li> It was that bad.</li>
            <li> , it was so bad that I had to wash my hair again</li>
            <li> but no matter how bad I wanted it to work, it did not.</li>
            <li> Now that you know what works for me, let me tell you why I was disappointed with the Smoothie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by that.  </li>
            <li> but when I tried it my scalp itched like crazy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say here :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> and it is not overkill or annoying.  </li>
            <li> I hate price gouging.</li>
            <li> I am using this and an oil base moisturizer to keep in the moisture.</li>
            <li> I hate wasting products</li>
            <li> but we both hated this product.</li>
            <li> Trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Get it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed!</li>
            <li> horrible... weighed my daughters</li>
            <li> but it is HORRIBLE at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is horrible.</li>
            <li> Give one because I could not give lower, didnt work for my hair, smell horrible and leave my hair like I put Crisco on it.</li>
            <li> One star because it was a terrible product for us.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These products just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This product really helps to moisturize my hair and scalp which are  uncomfortably dry. It also gives good definition to your curls</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything but dry my hair out. My sister is natural and I&#x27;m relaxed but we both hated this product. I may be protein sensitive so if you are just avoid this product</li>
            <li> It smells amazing but left my hair sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> I use Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie as a moisturizer in low-humidity weather (it contains glycerin) for my super dense, Afro-textured hair. Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie is a thick, super-moisturizing cream chock full of nourishing ingredients that smells like a tropical paradise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To moisturize, I apply leave-in conditioner and then Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie on freshly washed and conditioned hair. After air-drying, my kinky, coily, Afro-textured hair is moisturized and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of the Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie goes a long way so the 12 oz jar lasts a couple of months. I purchase it at Target or Walgreens. It&#x27;s natural, affordable and effective so it&#x27;s a staple in my hair care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Macadamia Oil, Avocado Oil, Vegetable Glycerin , Aloe Vera Leaf Extract, Silk Protein, Ammonium Salt, Neem Oil, Carrot Seed Oil, Sorbitol Esters, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B-5), Caprylyl Glycol, Essential Oil Blend, Tocopherol (Vitamin E)</li>
            <li> I have natural locks and used this product to twist and hold my locks.  Let me just say, it works amazingly!  My hair feels soft and moisturized and when it dried, the locks were held in this amazingly soft, coiled pattern.  Really brilliant stuff and i seriously cannot recommend it enough.  It is quite light and smooth, and a little goes a long way.  It can be used to style or to moisturize.  It has quite a strong coconut, tropical smell-which I love, but may be too much for those who are sensitive.  I should say that it is quite a natural smell though and it is not overkill or annoying.  My hair smells and feels great.  I would recommend this without a doubt to all those who have natural hairstyles coils, twists, spirals, locks, afros.      An added bonus for me is that all of the ingredients are organic and it does not have unnatural sulfates, parabens, etc that some are allergic too.  It contains, pure, raw shea butter-100% organic.  I hope you enjoy this product as much as I have ;)</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty and it definitely makes my curls softer and thicker and as for definition it seems to take away that frizzy and frayed-ness! When they say use sparingly, do just that. Too much will make your hair feel too heavy and greasy. I have a TON of hair(3b curls here) so when I see products that say use quarter size or go lenient I usually ignore that because I just have too much hair to do so but this stuff I would be liberal with it. I like this stuff though, it is expensive for what I&#x27;m used to but if I can get it online for cheaper I would keep buying it. I decided to try it out when I saw a bogo sale on it at CVS. Got this and the hair gel &amp;#34;souffle&amp;#34;. If you have thick and curly hair I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I have 4a hair and this does moisturize very well. My hair always tends to the dry side. I&#x27;ve used it as a deep conditioner left it on for 45 minutes and squeezed out the excess, then styled my hair in twists. The one thing I&#x27;d like to warn others about is that if you are protein sensitive this more than likely isn&#x27;t for you. It caused my hair to dry off and break after extended usage. I&#x27;d recommend using it sparingly and not in conjunction with the other coconut and hibiscus line as they contain silk protein, that would probably be an overabundance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Amazon is promoting this product as \\&quot;Curl &amp; Hold\\&quot;.  It is a bit misleading and confusing, IT IS NOT INTENDED FOR HOLD.  Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie is an EXCELLENT creme hair dress and conditioner--think [[ASIN:B00123KI8S Vitapointe Creme Daily Hairdress, 7 Ounce]] or [[ASIN:B003XZQ7AQ Liv Creme Hairdressing and Conditioner]] kicked up a dozen notches just for curls.  No mineral oil, petroleum and beeswax--Shea, coconut , mango, aloe silk protein instead!  This product is best used just as you would a creme hairdressing.  I use this in the same may my mother used Liv on my hair when I was little for braids/braid-outs, finger curls, twist/twist-outs and smoothing ponytails.  It works great as a layer on wet hair.  Use it after your leave-in conditioner and before your sealing oil.  You only need a tiny bit for shine, moisture and de-frizzing .  I tap my finger lightly into the product for each braid, twist etc. and take a little more only if I need it.  Again, do not expect hold from this product!  I DO NOT use it to set my \\&quot;wash and go\\&quot;.  Curl Enhancing Smoothie is not intended to perform like an Eco Styler Gel or Kinky Curly Curling Custard.  On the other hand, because the product hydrates curls, it is great for finishing your \\&quot;wash and go\\&quot; or \\&quot;rod set\\&quot; after it dries.  It&#x27;s also great for refreshing second day hair because it helps curls to spring back and smoothes frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best advice for using Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie is use it to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  When I first started wearing my natural curls, I&#x27;d read the product description instead of the ingredients.  If you read  the ingredients below you&#x27;ll see that it is water and Shea butter, not gel.  Use it like you would water and Shea. With that said, this stuff is THE BEST CREME HAIRDRESS I HAVE EVER USED.  Usually my hair is very dry.  Straight Shea butter is way too heavy for me. With this, my hair is softer than with any other product WITHOUT making it flat and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Deionized water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut Oil) Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Mangifera Indica (mango) Seed Butter, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Aloe Barbodensis Leaf Extract, Silk Protein, Ammonium Salt, Melia Azadirachta (Neem) Seed Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Sorbitol Esters, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B-5), Caprylyl glycol, Essential Oil Blend, Lanicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower and Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E)it flat and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Deionized water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut Oil) Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Mangifera Indica (mango) Seed Butter, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Aloe Barbodensis Leaf Extract, Silk Protein, Ammonium Salt, Melia Azadirachta (Neem) Seed Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Sorbitol Esters, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B-5), Caprylyl glycol, Essential Oil Blend, Lanicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower and Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E)</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product. The first few uses, I loved the way my hair felt. But after a while, my hair felt weighed down with a heavy residue. I tried decreasing the amount I used, and putting a little in my hair while it was wet, but I just couldn&#x27;t get the hang of how to use it. I gave up. But I do like the body products. I will stick to using Mixed Chicks in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my natural curly hair.  It makes it softer, shinier and flowing.  The curls are more defined, and move and bounce and have a great feel.  It smells good too!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 2 and a half year daughter, her hair is very curly and was getting so dry that I was really worried.  This product is helping me a lot, after the shower I apply small amount on her hair, mainly on the ends, give a soft massage and then....I can comb it without hurting her!!, the hair looks beautiful, the curls so well defined.  the only BUT I see is that when the hair dries it does still look a little dry, but I guess it will become better.</li>
            <li> I have curly mixed hair that changes textures a lot. Parts of it can be wavy, straight, or curly all at the same time. While my hair is softer and more manageable than the average black person, it tends to get dry A LOT! I end up weighing my hair down with too much product because I have to put so much moisture in my hair. When I tell you after using various shea moisture products that my hair is very hydrated and moisturized. I love this product because it feels like creamy butter going on your hair. It also smells amazing! It&#x27;s great for adding life to your hair without weighing it down or making it feel greasy. Other products I recommend to try with this are (shea moisture Jamaican castor oil hair lotion, shea moisture Jamaican castor oil shampoo &amp; leave in conditioner) All these work great!</li>
            <li> First! I hope no one out there is paying $35.50 for this product! It&#x27;s only $10 at Target.  I&#x27;ve used this product line for almost a year. Yes, all of the products work amazingingly. However, the curl enhancing smoothie works well depending on you intended use. If you are looking forward to this product changing the managebility of your hair, for get about it. It will make it feel nice and soft for a few hours, but then your hair goes back to the norm. I would 100% recommend the shampoo! it&#x27;s amazing on natural hair. I have 4a type hair but I have varying textures througout. This product seems to be most pleasing on my 3c type hair. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I use this will an oil on my hair after I get out of the shower.  I must say that it works well and smells great.  I recommended this product to my sister and she loves it too.  I bought it at CVS.</li>
            <li> This &amp; alot of the Shea Moisture products are great, but I would suggest looking for it at Walgreens, Target or waiting for their website to open.&lt;br /&gt;I JUST bought this for $10 at Walgreens. It&#x27;s worth trying, but for $30...that&#x27;s ALOT of money when you can get it for $20 LESS!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Curl Enhancing Smoothie for about six months and continue to be pleased with the results. I decided to try the product (my first of the Shea Moisture Line) after continually seeing it at Target. I originally bought one jar and at the second use, I returned to Target for me (didn&#x27;t want to run out!). It has a nice non-overbearing smell, thick, custardy, texture, and provides great hydration even on really hot days (I live in a non-humid environment). My hair is thick so I have to use quite a bit. It takes me about three weeks to use the entire jar (average 3x a week). I also use the Shea Moisture Mask on alternate days. Product would have 5 stars if offered in larger quantities which would decease my frequent trips to Target.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain how much I love this product.  First of all, it&#x27;s all natural and not tested on animals.  I have really course, really difficult to wrangle-in, naturally dry hair.  And this is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve ever used that provides both moisture and soft hold.  It turns my frizzy  mess into a perfect, wavy curl.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it weighs down your hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave any weird residue - the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is right after application it is a bit sticky, but I think it&#x27;s because of the agave nectar.  I LOVE this this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use with Qhemetic Biologics Amla &amp; Olive Heavy Cream. I have dry and thick 4B/4C hair, so moisturizing is very important to me. So far the Shea Moisture Products have worked for me making my hair more manageable and soft; this product so far being one of my favorites. As mentioned in earlier reviews, the smell can be strong, I have learned that a little goes a long way. For me, I use this smoothie cream for two strand twists wet/damp. I let it dry overnight and usually wake up with soft, moisturized twists. I would definitely recommend as a moisturizing product.</li>
            <li> Really great at defining my daughter&#x27;s curls and my own. I have actually been able to wear my hair natural more than I used too since using this product.</li>
            <li> I had tried two other styling products from Shea Moisture before I purchased the Curl Enhancing Smooth (I tried Curl Styling Milk and the Curl Enhancing Gel Souffle). The Styling Milk was great, but there were definitely days that I wished it were more moisturizing. The Gel Souffle was wonderful, but the stickiness wasn&#x27;t desirable (I&#x27;ve since stopped using any oils in my hair if I am using the Souffle and that works best). Now that you know what works for me, let me tell you why I was disappointed with the Smoothie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a start, while the consistency seems like a thick, thick dream, it actually never absorbs into the hair. I have fine strands that are packed densely all over my head in kinky coils like pen springs, and the Smoothie did NOT absorb into the hair at all. Instead, it sits on top of my hair like a thick paste and then when my hair dries, it leaves behind a residue-like film and flakes here and there. I felt like I had left drying conditioner in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a tiny, tiny (half a dime size) for half your head, mixed with either the Gel Souffle or an oil of your choice, it may work out. However, if I have to use such a tiny amount for fear of white residue, I&#x27;d rather go back to the Curl Styling Milk, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you didn&#x27;t like the consistency of the Healthy Hair Butter from Carol&#x27;s Daughter, you most definitely will not like the Curl Enhancing Smoothie. I&#x27;ve seen others with my hair type that rave about this, but where their hair absorbs it, mine just lies clumpy, stiff and residue-y. I had to wash it out after 3 days.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  But it&#x27;s okay product has protein which makes my 4b to 4c hair feel brittle after a while.. also it&#x27;s a but sticky feeling, but it is ok .. I will be sticking with the as I am product line</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product in Walgreen&#x27;s. Let me say that I&#x27;m a true product junkie having spent hundreds of dollars on over priced hair products through the years. Believe me if you name most of the well known brands out there, I&#x27;ve tried them. As any other product junkie will tell you some of those other brands are very pricey (over priced if you ask me). So I couldn&#x27;t believe that any product sold in Walgreen&#x27;s or Target would be any better. But being the product junkie that I am I couldn&#x27;t resist. I have very tightly curled hair. When it&#x27;s natural and wet it looks amazing, but completely dries out once the water is gone. It is very hard to find a product that actually defines my dense head of hair and doesn&#x27;t just look dry by the end of the day. Because of this I&#x27;ve transitioned back and forth between natural and relaxed hair several times. Many years ago I had 3 years of natural hair growth that I used to just 2 strand twist with Carol&#x27;s Daughter products. In that period of time my hair reached it&#x27;s longest length since childhood, but that product really didn&#x27;t compliment my hair and at the time I didn&#x27;t really know how to maintain health natural hair that wasn&#x27;t twisted or locked. Prior to the wide spread use of the internet and availability of other products I just didn&#x27;t know what to do. I am always interested in having natural hair but it does become very difficult to manage and does not offer many styling options (not denying my true texture but it is what it is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m once again transitioning to natural hair and so far I&#x27;ve been amazed by how well the shea moisture products work in my hair. It holds that curl without becoming frizzy and it is shiny and soft. I will continue to give this product a chance and see how it helps to grow out my natural hair texture.</li>
            <li> This stuff is what I call \\&quot;Heaven Sent\\&quot; it smells good and it gives my hair moisture all day long. I have an extremely (I mean,an extremely) dry scalp. After like 1 week (before I was introduced to this) my scalp would be red and flaky, I think I have psoriasis and Eczema (what a combination). Anywho, this product is perfect for me, every product is not for EVERYBODY, but this product is perfect for my scalp. I know people try out different products expecting the same results as everyone else, but in reality it might not work for you the way it works for me. The reason I&#x27;m stressing this is because I am a cosmetologist and I normally buy expensive products and products that you don&#x27;t get from a store that is in everyone&#x27;s reach,while this is the best for me, I have a client that it does the opposite with her natural hair, it makes hers drier, and limp. It all depends on your hair make-up. I would recommend this product to my clients, keeping in mind that everyone doesn&#x27;t have the same hair texture and scalp.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. I have 3c hair so I was worried a heavy cream would way it down! But it&#x27;s not heavy at all. It smells amazing like coconut and other fruits. I usually use it by itself for days when I want a deep moisturizing treatment. Even using this product just with a leave in conditioner is still get defined voluminous hair, it leaves a light scent after it drives and a nice heathy shine. One of my dessert island products for sure!! And the ingredients are amazing, no sulfates, parabins or mineral oil. I don&#x27;t think it could get any better!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and this product doesn&#x27;t work on my hair. I&#x27;ve tried it a few times to my damp hair, expecting it to support the definition of my curls, but as soon as it dries, it doesn&#x27;t hold and the curls separate and frizz.  Also, I find it leaves my hair feeling gummy when I run my hands through it.  I prefer Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li> I really liked Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie...at first. It smells heavenly and really clumped my curls together when I used it sparingly on just conditioned wet hair. My braid outs looked lovely when dry in the morning. However, after about two weeks of using it 3x per week (along with liberal spritzes of a homemade mixture of filtered water, Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil and John Freida Curl Around conditioner) noticed that my hair was getting very crunchy and hard. So I stopped using the Shea Moisture and tried using only the homemade mixture on my wet braid out. The result was that my hair was soft again. I think shea butter just doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair so I&#x27;ll have to remove this from my regimen. It doesn&#x27;t have to go to waste though. At night I slather it on my feet, put them in sock and in the morning my feet are softer than ever - LOL!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It definetly provides moisture to your hair.  My only complaint is that it can leave build up.  I receive so many compliments on how moisturize my hair looks.  This product works because it does not contain any alcohol &amp; it&#x27;s 100% Vegan.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find products for black hair that isn&#x27;t full of petrolatum, mineral oil and alcohol.  then if you are natural,you have an even harder time finding products.    well, i saw this product in target a few weeks ago and decided to try it when i twisted my hair.  it keeps it nice and soft, but the smell was a bit strong.  it smells good, but i perhaps used a little too much.  i am used to stuff that has little or no smell, so this threw me a bit. i will definitely continue to use it... just a little more sparingly.</li>
            <li> I have 4b curl pattern and keeping moisture in my hair is one of my biggest challenges. This product works great since it has the oils that my hair craves to be soft and moist. Plus the price is great in comparison with other natural hair care products. I definitely recommend this if are looking for a daily or twist moisturizer for your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this in combination with the Curl and Style Milk as an alternative to Hawaiian Silky 14 in 1 to define my curls when wearing a puff. The Hawaiian Silky gives me the look I want, but has mineral oil in it so I needed a replacement. This product in combo with the Curl and Style Milk does the job! My curls were defined and I had a light hold which wasn&#x27;t too hard or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;. The product dried fairly quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to constantly deal with dripping product. The best part was that my hair was nicely moisturized and the curls and moisture lasted overnight. I was able to get second day hair out of this one application. I would definitely recommend this product line due to the convenience of it being available at Target and its effectiveness in getting me the look I want without harsh, damaging ingredients. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because as others said, the smell is just ok and takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I was transitioning - only applying it to the new growth and now that I have a short pixie cut which I wear as a TWA (teeny-weeny-afro) most days, this product is PERFECT. The jar is pretty big and I barely need any. When my hair is wet, I just tap my fingers in the jar and apply it all over. Then I tap again for the more kinky curly part of my hair (the crown area mostly) and it holds all day without feeling crunchy or anything. I feel like the jar will last me forever because I only tap my fingers in 2-4 times and thats all... The smell is amazing. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and tend to get migraines easily but the scent doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Its also perfect for next day curls, I just wet them a little and then apply this the same way and I get the same results as if I just washed my hair. its the only product I use on most days after I apply my leave in, no gel - no serum, nothing.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Since transitioning and having a little girl I find that of all the natural, black hair products from Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful, Kinky Curly, Shea&#x27;n&#x27;More, etc that Shea Moisture products are the best bang for the buck.  I started from day one w/ my baby (who is now 4 mos old today) in developing a natural haircare routine for her so she won&#x27;t have to go through the countless relaxers, hair damage, inadequate hair products, and the general all out battle with her hair that I&#x27;ve gone through and continue to go through.  Right now her hair is 3a/b/c with 2c in the very bottom back, thick yet fine, and rather long for a baby (she was born w/ a headful of hair) and I know there is a possibility of her hair rubbing out or coming out although I use satin hair savers and a satin kid&#x27;s bonnet, but I am doing my part to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen due to negligence on my part.  Her hair does get extremely dry and frizzy in the back where she lays her head but the Shea Moisture Curling Smoothie helps out a lot.  I love the smell which is the smell of all of Shea Moisture products and partly what drew me to their soaps when they first became a part of the Target line. So if you like tropical smells that make you feel like you stepped out of a Gauguin masterpiece then this is for you...once it is on the hair though it becomes very subtle and faint.  The smoothie is thick and smallest amt goes a long way and since the container is 12 oz this product should last you a while.  It is not greasy yet it truly moistures your hair.  Most of the natural women I have come across on You Tube, in forums, and in the natural locs grps love this product also, but they use it w/ Eco Styler w/ olive oil to get the desired curl definition they want.</li>
            <li> This product really defines my natural curls without getting hard. It smells and feels great. I even used it on my sons hair to enhance his natural curls and it looked great. Can&#x27;t wait to try the other products.</li>
            <li> This product has by far been the best solution for my curly hair.  The tricks to managing frizz is to divide hair into sections, they can be large, and then apply the product.  Since I started using this product I do not require any additional products, and can go an extra day or two without washing.  I only end up washing my hair because it gets oily, but it is not caused by this product (my hair is naturally oily within a few days curly or straight).  BTW I&#x27;m multiracial in case that helps others as well. Finally a solution to my mad curl days!</li>
            <li> I did not purchase my curl enhancing smoothie from this seller but at Sallys for $10.00. I love this product! I am caucasian and have wavy hair that can go straight or curly but most curl products leave my hair sticky and make my scalp itch. This product leaves my hair soft with a nice curl and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I wanted badly to like this product,aft I saw so many good reviews,  aft I washd myhair with the shea moisture shampoo..WHICH I LIKE ALOT,IAPPLIED THE CURL SMOOTHIE, IT SMELLS BETTER THEN IT ACTUALLY WORKS.....IT LEFT MY Hair feeling like some crunchy noodles...&amp; my curls arent anymore define either...i wont be using this again!</li>
            <li> My hair seems to like shea butter, but I hate the smell of it raw and I&#x27;m not at a time in my life to make my own hair care products from scratch. I found this product at Target and decided to give it a try considering the price of the other things that I was buying ( more expensive than Cantu but cheaper than Carol&#x27;s daughter and way cheaper than Miss Jessie&#x27;s). The shampoo of this product smells just as nice and I would recommend that you use them together. It clumps and forms your curls very nicely and you don&#x27;t have to use too much of it to do so. If you have found that Shea Butter products do not compliment or go well with your hair PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS IF SHEA HARDENS YOUR HAIR. My sister and I have had two different effects from shea butter, and just as shea butter locks her hair, coconut oil makes my hair frizz something awful. This product has a good meeting point between the two.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item after drooling over it for so long. It works very well on my type 3 hair. I&#x27;ve tried it on myself and my daughter, and it&#x27;s just wonderfully silky and light. I was able to get one of the best twist outs I&#x27;ve ever gotten using this along with the matching shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to say, people, 32 dollars is a lot for one hair product. If I were you, I&#x27;d purchase somewhere else. I got mine from Walgreens for $9.99! NEVER buy this product from Amazon. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so much money here, but I would recommend not buying it here. Try Target, Walgreens, and other places that sell natural hair products, and you don&#x27;t have to do it online.</li>
            <li> I like it! I&#x27;m mixed black and white and I have very, very did I say very curly hair. This stuff is nice, it smells lovely and it does define my curls...BUT only use a small amount, other wise it will flake and look a little dull.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my son&#x27;s curly hair.  He is biracial and has a head full of thick curls.  I tried everything from john freida, paul mitchell, pink lotion, and hawaiian silky.  My only complaint is that is that it is overpriced here.  You can get this product for $9.99 at Walgreens!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for natural hair works well with twist outs and any natural style. Please be aware that its best as a styling product. You can find this at TARGET or WALGREENS, and its only 10.00!!! Its WORTH IT!! THIS WHOLE LINE ROCKS :)  P.S. I have been natural for almost 2years I Have tried many products.</li>
            <li> I have natural wave in my long hair and it is colored. I have been having issues with frizziness the last year or so, but don&#x27;t want it straight; I like having the wave. I picked this cream up at the drugstore and IT WORKS. Not only does it give me the curl/wave I like, but my hair stays soft and it gets some conditioning with this product. I use 2-3x per week, and I find if I spritz my hair with water the next day and scrunch it, the cream reactivates. I use it on my damp, towel-dry hair and just scrunch. I also used it on damp hair that I curled and slept in overnight, and it worked well that way too. Start with a small amount and add more if needed.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product and I am using it on my bohyme brazilian wave. Holy cow!!! it works so fine. My hair smells good, feels good and looks good. I would recommend this product for any hair type. I am so in love with it. I had to stop by to give a review. It is the best of the best!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but there&#x27;s definitely something not so natural hidden in this product because my natural hair sheds tremendously when it does.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t really that curly or hard to manage, I have soft waves but this product totally keeps the shine without looking greasy, well defines the curls for more than one day!!</li>
            <li> The curling souffle is now one of my staples. I used too much the first time because my hair was super dry, and learned through the residue I saw the next day that it only takes a bit. Really?! I only need a little? So, now it&#x27;s highly likely this stuff will last me a month, not something I could say with past products. Once all the residue had vanished the day after, my hair was nice and soft. Leave it on wet hair overnight with a shower cap and rinse the next day (something I failed to do) for a deep condition or use a small amount on dry hair for moisture ( and seal it with a finishing spray of course). But seriously, who prices this stuff on this site?! I&#x27;ve got the 12 oz jar and it was only ten dollars at Target!</li>
            <li> It seems to work well for my relaxed hair, but I&#x27;ve only used it once which was last night and my hair feels great this morning. I love the smell, and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong at all. Hopefully this will end my never ending search for a daily moisturizer for my super dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason for this review though, is that I got this product at Walgreens for $9.99. I have no idea why it&#x27;s about 3x as much on Amazon! Just an FYI...</li>
            <li> I am very new to the natural community having just did my Big Chop about a week ago. I have to say that I love this product for my TWA (Teenie Weenie Afro). Like most reviewers have already noted, it does not define curls on its own. My hairstylist recommend the souffle but the consistency of the souffle was too sticky for my taste, so I opted for the smoothie. I am glad I did!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the smoothie just about everyday as a sealant and moisturizer after I co-wash my hair in the mornings. A little does go a long way- as I have learned using too much will cause a slight residue. The smell is magnificent and is not overbearing. It smells strong but once you put it on your hair it has a nice light scent. It keeps my hair very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the smoothie with Eco-Styler Gel to help get the definition in my curls. I do not know about hair type and all, but I know when I use the smoothie with the gel, it does an excellent job of defining curl and lasts all day. I also spray my hair with water at night and put a little of the smoothie on with some raw Shea butter to help condition my hair. I do this and put a shower cap on and my satin bonnet and in the morning my hair is extra soft. In addition... using this product without a gel or something to define curl will result, in my opinion, a more soft, wispy look. Product gets 4 out of 5 only because it does not define as the label suggests. Also purchase at Target, Amazon price is completely marked up.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a little cheaper on Amazon but I&#x27;m sure I will be sticking with Target for $9.99. You can buy 3 jars from Target or Walgreens for the price they sell it for on here. OAN: The product works wonderfully on my 3c hair. It really moisturizes without weighing it down! I have tried different products including mizani coconut souffle and this stuff really does the trick for me. Over the years I have learned it really depends on your individual hair. It&#x27;s a lot of factors that go into people getting good results and others getting really poor results from some products. Some factors include diet, possible health problems, and simply hair type. I can vouch to say this stuff really does it for me. Try it and it might work for you too, if not, on to the next one. SN:first time reviewing but it was worth it seeing that price and the fact that this stuff works so well for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my hair. My hair is moisturized and my twists always come out with great definition. The condition and style milk is the best leave in I&#x27;ve used so far. It makes my hair feel great and KC Knot today doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this. I have type 4 hair that&#x27;s very thick so I need the weight of these products. I just love my hair when I use these products.I will be trying out the shampoo next. I can&#x27;t seem to find these products on Amazon&#x27;s Target store though. I liked the $9.99 prices. Now the prices from the available sellers are ridiculous so I guess I will have to shop elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is some decent stuff for curly hair. However, 32 dollars is way overpriced. You can find this at Walgreen&#x27;s or Target for under 10!</li>
            <li> horrible... weighed my daughters hair down..</li>
            <li> Love the product hair is soft and bounce</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white woman with Type 3A curly hair. When I&#x27;m having a good hair day my hair is really pretty, but on a bad hair day it can be a mass of limp frizz. The Shea Moisture products have really transformed my hair. I use the Curl Enhancing shampoo, milk and smoothie (just a dab). Although the milk and shampoo containers are a bit small a little goes a long way and I only have to wash my hair twice a week. However, as others have pointed out, the prices here and on Ebay are a RIP OFF. I bought my Shea Moisture products from Walgreens online ON SALE for just $7.99 each. I had been purchasing supermarket hair products like Garnier, but the Shea Moisture products got such good reviews I decided to splurge. They are well worth the $7.99 each. Just don&#x27;t pay more than you have too.</li>
            <li> As a new natural, I went over the top with trying products. I can confess that I am a product junkie! I originally used this product for twist-outs, but it always left my hair feeling like it had a lot of build up. I tried to use less with the same results--it leaves a film on my hair. The consistency is like pudding and I like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of naturals LOVE this product, but it did not work for me and did not fit into my regimen. To each her own!</li>
            <li> Although the price on here is crazy this is a PRODUCT review so the 3 stars are for the product. It was very difficult for me to give anything with this brand name less than 5 stars for i LOVE this line but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me. This product promises to define curls but i didn&#x27;t notice any definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 4a/b hair type and i have been natural for 2 1/2 years. I am not A CRAZED curl definition natural; as a matter of fact perfect curls bore me. This products left my braid/twist out dull and shrunken. It did however moisturize hence the reason for 3 starts but that it. I get better results with the hair milk or good ole shea butter. The description suggest it be used as a deep conditioner so i will use the remainder for my next DC treatment to finish it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless this Deep treatment method works miracles I do not see repurchasing of this product in my future.I still however recommend it to other people looking for a style cream that moisturizes because i believe in this brand and its quality. This particular product wasn&#x27;t a win for me but it can be for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW DO NOT BUY THIS FOR ANY MORE THAN $9.99. prices on here is a RIPOFF!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**7/7 this works better as a DC but have found cheaper products that do the same thing so prob wont buy as leave in.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. and all natural!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural black 4a/b hair. I use this for wash-n-go&#x27;s and twist outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my hair hydrated and adds a subtle sheen that makes my hair look super healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very good at defining and holding your curls all day. Your hair might feel a little stiff at the end of the day, but not dry. If you want, just sprinkle a little water on your hair to soften it up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a thick consistency, so use it with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smells is also very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to hide this from my also-natural sister. She all my good stuff! :-(</li>
            <li> Love this product...although I bought mine at Walmart for 11 bucks...</li>
            <li> I bought this from a local Walgreens, and have used it for about two weeks.  I also use the shampoo.  The first time I used it, I put in waaaay too much, but even still, my hair looked fantastic even if it was a little goopy.  The next several times, I used about a tablespoon (I have shoulder length 3a curls that are coarse and dry) and that seemed to be about right for me.  I don&#x27;t rinse it out, but I do apply it to wet hair.  I only wash my hair about once or twice a week, but I shower every day, so I usually also condition my hair even when I don&#x27;t shampoo.  This stuff is simply fantastic, and it&#x27;s only a bonus that&#x27;s it&#x27;s cruelty-free!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It leaves your hair feeling very soft. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky. I will be ordering this product again and again lol. This is making my transitioning to natural so much better. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be amazing like Kinky Curly but I was mistaken. The scent is crazy strong for me and it leaves my hair and scalp flaky :( Not meant for me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to replace KCCC for me and read and heard so much about Shea Moisture I bought it when it was BOGO at Walgreens. Needless to say the line isn&#x27;t too bad but isn&#x27;t all that great either. It really didn&#x27;t moisturize my 3c/4a hair at all. But it didn&#x27;t dry it out either. I used it for two strand twist which did well but it just didn&#x27;t moisturize or give me curls that can last for days. I have been using it faithfully through much trial and error but it just doesn&#x27;t hold well for me. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing and I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price. This product sells for around $10 at Walgreen&#x27;s, Target ( stores and online) and a variety of drugstores. This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural, cruelty-free products. They make a fine, all natural product at a reasonable price. This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li> I have 4b-4c texturized hair. Anyone who has a tex will know how incredibly dry your hair can get.&lt;br /&gt;I use this and shea moisture curling souffle mixed together in the palm of my hand, rub it all over my slightly wet (but not driping) hair, then let it air dry, and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;I find that wetting my hair with my hands in the mornings, makes me use much less product and it also gives the best curl definition and moisture boost (I only wash weekly)&lt;br /&gt;You could try using just one of the products instead of two, but for my hair they work very well together. My hair is moist and my curls pop all day long.&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m out very late, I carry a tiny spray bottle of water and just a few squirts activates my curls again. At night i use just a little of the smoothie on its own to keep my hair soft overnight. Shea Moisture is the BEST thing that has ever happened to my hair. It&#x27;s strong and healthy, and my scalp no longer itches. To say I&#x27;m pleased is an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this line is 100% natural and organic. All my chemical activator gels and sprays are going in the garbage. I&#x27;m so pleased I&#x27;ve finally found natural products that work, and as a bonus they smell heavenly too.</li>
            <li> I usually use Kinky Curly Curling custard and I was looking for a cheaper alternative.  This left my hair VERY dry. I&#x27;ll keep the jar I have for emergencies only, it does enhance my curls but it sucks up whatever moisture you put in your hair. It smells great though.........</li>
            <li> This product is just sticky and heavy. I guess it works better on natural twisting</li>
            <li> This product is REALLY nice as a moisturizer.... it leaves it feeling REALLY REALLY soft and its not greasy. As for curl enhancing, it doesn&#x27;t do that for me, I don&#x27;t get a curly pattern from using it which is what I wanted but it acts as a great leave in moisturizer so if you happen to want to just wash your hair and not blow dry it..this product allows you to do that and and still leave your hair soft and manageable. Don&#x27;t use too much!! a little goes a long away! you can view it on youtube to see the results on other people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Just like the style milk- a little goes a long way. It works very well in holding twist. All of the items I&#x27;ve tried smell like pina colada and leave my hair feeling soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Walgreen&#x27;s and I really wanted to like it because a lot of other naturals use it, but it seems like for me all it did was enhance the frizz in my hair and my styles didn&#x27;t last for more than a day. So I switched back to using As I Am DoubleButter Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Coconut and Hibiscus has been a Godsend to my 4c natural hair!  My hair loves this mix!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff..my daughter has mixed hair best I have found to keep moisture in</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for those that have natural hair. I cowash my hair, apply the smoothie and then apply Eco styler gel for shine and more hold. One day I used the smoothie only (without the Eco styler) and my hair was white....It was not a good look. I would recommend this prodcut as long as you plan to use it with gel. Oh yeah and it goes a long ways so you only need a little bit!</li>
            <li> I use this product to hold enhance and moisturize my waves and as a leave in conditioner. My hair is natural and this stuff works great i even used this stuff to flat iron my hair a few days ago and my hair is soft and has movement and the lovely sent of the smootie. With that said in one week this stuff has replaced like four different products I was using. I really appreciate the versatility and I don&#x27;t have to use globs and globs of it for it to be effective. One little jar could easily last me two months and I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I had to buy it online because all the Walgreens and CVSs around me have been out. I do wish it was cheaper online though. I have really thick, curly hair and this is the only product that tames it without making it hard.</li>
            <li> $10 is more than what I usually pay for a hair product, but this is worth it. The ingredients are all natural, it smells yummy, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing-- a little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;m transitioning out of my relaxer and I use this for twist outs and roller sets. It keeps my hair soft for several days at a time, I just use the Hold &amp; Shine Moisture Mist spray every other day to touch up. I&#x27;ve found that it works best for me on wet or damp hair. Also, the product is very rich so use a small amount at a time or your hair will end up feeling heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for a little over 2 years now and have tried *countless* products and product lines. For fine haired coily girls like me, it&#x27;s been a challenge to find a product that works consistently to provide LASTING moisture to my dry hair without weighing it down.  My hair is also glycerin sensitive. It&#x27;s all about really paying attention to your hair and learning it&#x27;s likes and dislikes. Well, my hair LOVES Shea Moisture!! I started off with the Leave-In Conditioner, then decided to try the other products at Target. MOISTURE IS RIGHT!! I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but these products help your hair maintain moitsure without a large concentation of humectants, glycols or even butters.      I have found that with Shea Moisture products there can be so many different uses for each product!!! It&#x27;s all about finding out for yourself. I use this lovely Smoothie when I retwist at night. My hair is softer than ever, with great definition, without being spongy, or stiff. I use the Curl Milk on my ends and to soften week old styles.  I use the Mask as a daily hairdress. I use the Black Soap Body Wash also and the Hibiscus shea butter.  I have my mom hooked as well. :-)  And the price can&#x27;t be beat!!</li>
            <li> very heavy product which is good considering my hair drys out rather quickly but definitely use sparingly as this product is rather thick (which is just fine for me). love the smell although it does kinda suck that i have to make sure i rub it in thoroughly or ill have that white residue look goin on (not cool). but overall i like the product, i see it definitely lasting a very long time so ill decide by then whether or not ill buy another one.</li>
            <li> i love using this on my kids they&#x27;re mixed asian and black</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in the process of transitioning from relaxed hair to natural and I must say this product helps bring out my hairs natural curls.</li>
            <li> GET IT FROM WALGREENS OR TARGET, THE SHIPPING AND WAITING FROM AMAZON MAKES NO SENSE! GET IT ON WALGREENS OR TARGET&#x27;S DIRECT WEBSITE AND MORE LIKELY GET FREE SHIPPING!!!    THE PRODUCT SMELLS GREAT, MOISTURIZING IF LAYERED WITH OTHER OILS LIKE COCONUT, AND A SOFT HOLD FOR TWIST/BRAID OUTS.</li>
            <li> I did the big chop 7 yrs. ago and have been looking for a moisturizer just as long. I was in Target looking for Miss Jessies and this was on display with Miss Jessies products. I purchased it and fell in love. I have used it with other products but I found out in combonation with other products it leaves your hair gucky. So I just use shea milk plus, shea curl enhancing smoothie and I&#x27;m good!! It leaves my hair soft and manageable. The downside is I never found it in Target again. They really need to stock more. Sisters are the biggest buyers of hair care products. Since this product is used mostly by sisters in the natural movement, they are scared it will take MONEY away from  the PUSHERS of CREAMY CRACK. I can&#x27;t define my hair tpye. If this helps, believe it or not I have three textures going on in my head, curly in the back, wavy in the front and coarse in the crown. TRY IT!!</li>
            <li> I use this product for doing either two strand twist or flat twist and its great. Now, I am not sure if it actually enhances my curls (reason for 4 stars) but it does the eliminate or minimize frizz. The product smells great and will last a long time for $10 bucks. I am not or have not been highly impress with Shea moisture products but this one may become a staple in my hair regimen. Lastly, I have 4b or very kinky hair. I would recommend a friend or a foe to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Good product adds moisture to hair. No hold. Not a good buy if you do work that makes you sweat a lot</li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair off and went natural. I bought this product along with some others to see what works on my hair for moisture and styling. I don&#x27;t think it does much for my hair because it is so short right now and I can get the same effect with Eco styling gel and conditioner. However, I will definitely use it for my 12 year old daughters hair. She is natural as well and I can use this for twist styles and keep it moisturized. It does have a buttery feel to it when you touch your hair but I think all the curling creams do. I&#x27;ve gotten Miss Jessie Baby Buttercreme and Curly Pudding for my daugthers hair before and loved the BBC but not the CP so this for me is a cheaper equivalent to the BBC. When my hair grows more I will see how it works for me. Oh and it smells great too..but can be a little overwhelming if you wear different scented products at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: May 28, 2012. I have now been natural for almost a year and this product doesnt really work for my hair. For some reason it makes it hard but I think that is because I am protein sensitive. It is weird though because the SM curly milk works good on my hair and has most of the same ingredients. Go figure..I still use it for my daughters hair though.</li>
            <li> I started using this after I heard that a product I was using ([[ASIN:B001RVKB50 Double Strength Super Gro Maximum]]) had hormones that could lead to cancer... At first I stopped using any product whatsoever so that any residue would dissipate after a few washes as this product contained coconut oil and made my hair very oily. It was only then that I realized how dry my hair really was. After a few days I decided to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;My first impression, was that this stuff was AMAZING. I thought the smell was wonderful and it hydrated my hair very well. The bad thing is it took my hair forever to dry (more than 2 hours that first day). You really have to be careful on how much you use, too much will make it look greasy (BUT definitely not as bad as coconut oil) and too little will cause frizz. After a few days I noticed that after it dried the curls wouldn&#x27;t really hold as great as I thought. I had to start using mousse on top to hold the curls a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was disappointed by the fact that it did not make my hair curlier (which I thought it would do, due to the fact that it says \\&quot;curl enhancing\\&quot;) and that there was a very fine line between getting good moisture with no frizz and greasy stringy hair. And yes, if you leave too much in one spot and don&#x27;t scrunch in the lotion you will get those darn \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; spots people keep talking about.&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, it did define and moisturize like it said. :)&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this product every now and then to moisturize my hair, but I will keep looking for that curl amplifier.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and as to my hair type... I have wavy hair on top (which I&#x27;m trying to make curly! &gt;:[ ) And sidewalk chalk sized ringlets on the bottom. OR if I go upside down and scrunch I get even smaller ringlets and curlier hair.  Hope this helps for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have extremely curly hair and well if anyone has suggestions for me I&#x27;d be happy to take it. :)</li>
            <li> I had seen this product on several social media sites by users recommending it. I decided to give it a try on my 18-month-old son&#x27;s hair. He has a really course and dry afro. I started using this product and the texture of his hair changed immediately. It&#x27;s easier to manage and it spells great too. I would definately recommend this product for kids and adults!</li>
            <li> This product is amazingggggg!..my hair is so dry and frizzy and this just works wonders for me, my curls look much more defined And it feels so soft &amp; it looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to like this product. My naturally curly hair is short and I was just looking for something to define the curl with a slight hold. Well, as far as the curl definition and slight hold this works well but it is HORRIBLE at moisturizing. I even mixed it with a little grape seed/coconut oil and that did absolutely nothing but leave my hair with a white coating. Not good, especially when you discover this right before work at 8 a.m. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again, and for my curly headed girls beware this product is very drying, use sparingly (that didn&#x27;t work for my thick hair, I need more than sparingly) and if you over use, you may leave a white film on your hair.  My hair texture is similar to Cree Summer or Tanika Ray.</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE SOMEONE WOULD ACTUALLY PAY $30.00 FOR SOMETHING YOU CAN GET FOR $9.99 AT TARGET OR WALGREENS ONLINE OR IN THE STORE !!</li>
            <li> Im a product junkie and have tried almost everything once I have been looking for an organic product like this for quite some time and im so happy i found it. I have long soft but dull waistlength frizzy hair that shrinks to my shoulders with any natural product when it dries.  this curling smoothie is affordable 7.99 - 11.00 in most drugstores like Walmart Walgreens Target, smells like pineapple now&amp;laters candy, and it actually works! You only need about 4 dime sized scoops of this after applying your favorite leave in ( my fave is oyin handmade hair dew which smells like sugar cookies) and you have perfect soft shiny moisturized ringlets that still shrinks but hang more and you get the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look dry if I&#x27;m making any sense I can go days without wetting my hair unless I want to but I don&#x27;t have to which I love. I will recommend this product to any curly girl who loves organic products that work just as good even better than many expensive products marketed to curly girls</li>
            <li> My hair lives for this. You don&#x27;t even need a lot so this will definitely last. Instead of using all of those harmful products for your curls that does more damage than good, use this healthy beautiful elixer. I&#x27;m seriously going to buy more shae products. I can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t use this before</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a truely all natural leave in conditioner, i was wondering if this product contains any alcohol? i hope it doesnt , and if it does, does anyone have any alcohol free recommendations</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Expensive, but feels so good!</li>
            <li> This product is like paste and only weighs down my hair which is curly/frizzy fine hair.  My curls are more underneath and my frizz is on the outside.  I will not buy this product again, nor use what I have now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell nice, but isn&#x27;t that what perfume is for?</li>
            <li> The name of this product is somewhat misleading for me because it does nothing for my curl definition, I use their curling souffl&amp;eacute; for that, and it works wonders for my hair.  But it is a wonderful leave in moisturizer and I recommend it to anyone who asks based on that.  I use this product when I am going to wear 2 strand twist or a twist out and I enjoy how soft it makes my hair feel days after using it.  The smell is great and I always get compliments when I walk by about how good my hair smells.  A lil bit of this product goes a long way so I have to be careful with this product because it has a thick consistency which makes it easier for me to grab more than I actually need. Overall, I have nothing but good things to say about the SheaMositure line and look forward to continued use of their products.</li>
            <li> WOW the price on here is crazy, i but this all the time from Target or Walgreen for $9.99 I love this stuff it moisturizes well and smells good.</li>
            <li> Helps my curls look good and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I know other curlies have had good luck with the Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie, but I just can&#x27;t get with this stuff!! Something about the coconut oil as a main ingredient just does not sit well with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already stay away from coconut oil, but I wanted to try a cream product that would give me a bit of hold. This is not it. The hold is just awful-almost non existent. As my hair gets longer, I need a stronger hold to keep it looking volumized and not flat. Right now, the only thing that provides that kind of hold is gel, but I don&#x27;t like using gel on my hair 24/7. The smoothie did nothing for curl definition. My ends curl the most for some reason, and this cream doesn&#x27;t define them at all. They look limp and stringy and greasy. Coconut oil makes my hair look and feel saturated with grease. It&#x27;s disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream does the same exact thing, and I get the same results as when I attempt to use coconut oil by itself to pre-poo. I don&#x27;t like the consistency of the smoothie either. It&#x27;s gritty feeling, and to me it&#x27;s a bit sticky. It&#x27;s also a lot runnier than I thought it would be. I prefer heavier creams for my fine locks. I&#x27;ll stick to using CURLS products, I always have good luck with those.</li>
            <li> Every body loves this, for me it didn&#x27;t do what i was expecting to my hair, i will use, because I bought it, not purchasing again</li>
            <li> Beautiful, I managed to get awesome curl definition with this. Love it!</li>
            <li> One of the most disgusting products I&#x27;ve ever tried for my hair. The only nice thing about it is the fragrance - it smells really good. But the rest? I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. I have thick blonde hair in ringlets. This product is not anti-frizz, it&#x27;s PRO-frizz. Hair gets all poofy and tangled and very hard to comb or manage. And your hair feels so dirty and disgusting like you didn&#x27;t wash it in at least a month. No shine either, as for curls, they&#x27;re barely there. My hair looked like I had teased it to death then wiped a greasy stove with it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t do like me and waste your money. I wanted to cut corners and instead of the AG recoil I bought this to save $15. Instead I wasted $10 on a product that now is in the trash.</li>
            <li> This product is what I&#x27;ve been looking for ever since I went natural. It eliminates frizz and defines my curls and coils, plus it smells heavenly. I have type 4 hair that is sensitive, fine and gets dry easily. It has worked wonders on my hair and I will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell to it and it has a soft hold.  If you want a bouncy twist-out, you will have to add a butter or gel to it to get a really strong hold to you hair.  It is a natural product and is not tested on animals.  The texture is more of a cream than a butter or gel, so if you would prefer a butter, then this is not quite what you&#x27;re looking for.  I like the product and usually mix it with an ecostyler for my twist-outs.  I mix a 3:1 ratio using more of the curl enhancing smoothie than the gel.  My biggest problem with this product on this site is the price; it is UTTERLY RIDICULOUS!! On any given day, you can find most Shea Moisture products for $9.99 at Walgreen&#x27;s, Walgreen&#x27;s Online,Target and Walmart. And at least twice a year, they go on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s and Walgreen&#x27;s Online for BOGO free.  That&#x27;s $9.99 for two jars of the product. To be honest, I think the price on this site equates to price gouging. I can buy 3 jars of this for the price of 1 jar on this site.  The supplier needs to check nationwide for a more comparable/competitive price.  Again, just RIDICULOUS!!! I like the product but gave it 3 stars because I do not like the price.  And I want interested shoppers to realize that they don&#x27;t have to pay this high price. Please Amazon, check your prices!! THIS IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY!!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  No need to use wave grease. A true natural hair product.  I wish I would have known about this product years ago. I would have never been using wave grease. ☺</li>
            <li> I naturally have fairly loose curls that gradually straighten out the longer I go without washing my hair, which is usually twice a week, sometimes once. But on the first day out of the shower, my hair can get really curly. This smoothie brings them out, defines them and keeps them in tact for at least two days if I can keep my routine straight. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell originally, but my friends say that it smells just fine, so don&#x27;t take my word for that. I will say that on day one after washing my hair, the texture will feel a teeny bit stiff from the smoothie. But the next day, it gets so soft and pretty. I really recommend this product if you&#x27;ve got hair like mine, but especially if your curls are tighter. I see this product getting recommended on most natural hair styling tutorials, so there&#x27;s definitely something here.</li>
            <li> Kept trying this product over and over  on wet and dry hair (3c) but I had no patience with the white residue left on my hair, my hair did get curly but I also didnt like the sticky feel of my hair either , I will not be re-purchasing..</li>
            <li> After trying MANY products to moisturize my 4a/b hair, I finally found the one! The ingredients are great, a little goes a long way so it lasts for a while, and it only costs $10. This product is especially great for moisturizing my mini twists. Spray with water, rub on the curl enhancing smoothie, and done! The Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus line has great products to cleanse and moisturize for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that Shea Moisture&#x27;s curl enhancing smoothie would do whit promised: enhancing my curl. But, lo and  behold it is a product that actually does what it promises!    I have 4a/b hair. I don&#x27;t usually need any help making my curls pop after a wash.  But, this week, was bad. In the mornings my curls (after sleeping with a silk bonnet on -- even with retwists) made my hair flat. Some days, I looked like Little Richard with a curly bouffant.     I decided to pull out the Shea Moisture curl enhancing smoothie for the first time this week, thinking it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try. Plus, I needed to find a use for it after the buy one, get one free sale. I was surprised that after the smoothie set, that my curls returned, and only needed a little separating to get them fluffy again. Easy peesy!     I&#x27;m a product junkie..and I managed to sleep on this product for more than a year. This definitely will become a staple product!    Ingredients: Deionized water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut Oil) Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Mangifera Indica (mango) Seed Butter, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Aloe Barbodensis Leaf Extract, Silk Protein, Ammonium Salt, Melia Azadirachta (Neem) Seed Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Sorbitol Esters, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B-5), Caprylyl glycol, Essential Oil Blend, Lanicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower and Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E)    *certified organic</li>
            <li> I love this product, its been my go-to from I started growing out my hair (May 2011). My other sister and mom, who are both natural, also use and love this product. I&#x27;m a little confused though, because this product is NOT $30.00. I was just in NY a month ago (january) and bought each of the Shea-Moisture products from target (in the store) for bout $10.00. Online, I usually use naturallycurly.com curl mart although I just checked and they don&#x27;t have this product. Im extremely confused as to why amazon is selling this product for $30.00 when everytime I&#x27;ve ever bought any of their products its been 1/3 the price. The product is great but $30 is definitely way too much for it. Get it elsewhere and buy 3x more product for the money you&#x27;re spending here.</li>
            <li> A little background on me: I&#x27;m middle eastern with 3a/b curls that are generally not too difficult to manage. My hair has been really dry recently so i decided to try this product when I came upon it in Target ($9.99). The first day I just showered and put it in my hair and then braided my hair and went on my way. To be honest, my hair didn&#x27;t feel different at all. The next day I showered and straightened my hair (without reapplying the product) and my hair felt SO SOFT. I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it. It was silky, soft and smooth, even my previously dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not work the same for everyone but I think it&#x27;s worth a try. If I continue to have such amazing results, I will continue to buy the product.</li>
            <li> So I just bought this product today at Target and it only cost me $9.99. I don&#x27;t get the rip off that&#x27;s happening here. But other than that, I love this product! My curls are type 3 and usually when I use creme products, I get some frizz protection but I usually don&#x27;t get much control. This stuff both makes my hair super soft and frizz free and I think I could actually wear it with out pairing it with a gel (I usually use a gel over  serum to get more control). I also love the feeling on my hands after I use this, with other products like gels or serums, my hands are left sticky, with the smoothie it just feels like I put some hand lotion. Lastly, the smell is amazing. For buying this product on a whim, I am super impressed and hooked!</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Target and it smells great but for my naturally frizzy/curly hair it really doesn&#x27;t give me much condition like it says it should. It&#x27;s not rich or anything. I need something that weighs my hair down more when I wear it curly. It smells really good though.</li>
            <li> I have 4 a/b-type hair.  I purchased this item from Target for 9.99 also - SO PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM HERE!  This product really helps to define my curls and REALLY moisturizes my dry hair.  It clumps my curls together nicely and leaves my dull hair shiny.  I also use the hair milk, which helps detangle my hair.  The hold is not strong enough for my hair type, so I use this under my IC Fantasia Gel (Olive Oil or Hard to Hold) and achieve terrific results.  I really like how my hair feels using this product. I gave this product 5 stars, but someone should call 911 because this vendor is ripping people off BIG TIME!!!</li>
            <li> Love it , it is great for laying down curly hair.</li>
            <li> The curling smoothie works great for twist outs, even better when used with the styling milk.  This did not work very well to define my curls alone.  It worked well when I used it along with ECO to define my curls, but no curl definition for me when using it alone.  Soft yes, but defined curls NO! I will continue to buy this product as it works well for my twist outs.</li>
            <li> If you can, GO TO WALGREENS and buy it, its only 10 bucks there! It will enhance your curls and for me it offers a lite hold when styling my hair. I use less gel when putting my hair up in my afro puff. I have 3c-4a hair. I use it daily to help maintain moisture and enhance my curls. I had my doubts about it, I wasn&#x27;t impress after my 1st use, but I kept using it because I spent 10 bucks on it and didn&#x27;t want to waste it. After about 3 days I noticed my hair was softer and I realized I was using less get to style my up into an afro puff for work. This shorten my hair style time in the morning!!! All I do when I get up is use a couple of dabs of Shea Moisture to condition and style my hair apply a dab or two of ECO styling gel, use a silicon scrunchie to pull my hair back from my face, dab a little bit of gel to smooth any stray hairs on my temples and forehead or the back of my neck with a brush, throw on a head band or two( if I feel like it), I don&#x27;t have to use them, and I am out the door in 10-15 minutes!!!! This product makes that possible, before I spent 30 minutes or longer to get my hair right using globs of hair gel, than I had to tie my hair down, so the style would the style would set while I drove to work. I don&#x27;t have to tie my hair down anymore!!!! Yes it will help to hold and style your hair but you will need to use some gel too, that&#x27;s my exprience with it.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found in all my 50 years for curly hair. Not sticky, touchable curls, and smells nice too.  I think though, it might be less expensive at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. The only product I could find that didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy, wet looking and weighed it down and actually inhanced my curls. Seriously recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and wanted a product that would moisturize and define my curls.  Wrong answer.  I have to put a ton of this stuff in my hair and it&#x27;s STILL frizzy.  Not to mention the smell.  If you want to know what it smells like go to WalMart or another drugstore and smell &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s Jam&amp;#34; hair gel.  That&#x27;s exactly what it smells like.  For the money I paid for this junk you would think the quality would be there and do what it claims to do.  NOT.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Decided to try when I saw this at Walglreen&#x27;s. I have another moisturizing conditioner I use, but this was even better. If you have dry hair this is the one so far that works best for my hair.. My hair stays soft.  I also use the shampoo and the organic coconut &amp; hisbiscus curl &amp; style milk.    \\&quot;Kudos for Shea Moisture\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is the thing......this product definetely curls and moisturizes BUT as far as my 4a hair type goes....it doesn&#x27;t give sheen when it dries.    I was disappointed by that.  The best product that I have found to work is curly pudding by Miss Jessie&#x27;s.  Expensive but it adds curls, moisture and sheen.    Just my .02 cents.</li>
            <li> Amazon should be ashame, this product is much cheaper less shipping at walgreens and riteaids!!! Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money buying it on here....Seriously!! Anywho, I am a natural girl and I freaking love the stuff....not to mention the smell is to die for!!! I just wanna eat it every time I use it....LOL!</li>
            <li> I have thick Curly hair (Bi-racial Mexican/African American) and I seen someone use this on YOUTUBE (frogirlginny) and so what I do is apply this on the ends and around (not the top; it leaves my roots too oily) after I diffuse my hair. leaves it very curly and I love how it hydrates my curls. I just scoop a bit with two fingers, rub palms together, and scrunch. Love it!</li>
            <li> great for 3a or 3b hair</li>
            <li> This is my go to product when I want to rock twisted styles.  Before bedtime, I part my hair in two sections vertically and then in four sections horizontally.  Next, I apply coconut oil with Bergamot and frankincense essential oils (love the smell) to each section, followed by a spritz of water and essential oil blend.  The next day, I style as usual and what do you know?  My hair comes out so beautifully defined, moist and curly.  I really do love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this smoothie! It smells beautiful and makes my natural curls really curly. Love, love. love. I am Definitely reordering.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well so far for my 4a 4b hair texture.  Then again I don&#x27;t have much in my experience to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about which curl products I use and I have to say that this product was a pleasant surprise. I used to use a different spray to help encourage my curls but after constant straightening, a patch of curls in the back of my head would frizz rather than curl. I saw the reviews for this product and wanted to see what the hype was about. I received the product and commenced my typical hair routine. I have hair like Tanika Ray (google her) and I first have to detangle my hair in the shower with a different conditioner. After detangling I applied the product on rather damp, not dripping wet, hair. Mind you, my hair gets a little dry after the second day so I mixed this product with silk protein serum before applying. I evenly finger combed this into my hair while scrunching, using a moderate amount on each section. I expected the product to be too heavy, greasy and sticky but the product smells great and isn&#x27;t at all greasy, sticky, gummy or gritty. If you want more defined curls, apply more. For a funky, crazy and free look (like Tanika) apply less. Well, I work in a corporate office, so I applied more. Two cons: it made my hair crunchy at first until I smoothed the strands with my fingers and it took forever to dry and I hate sleeping on wet hair because it always looks smushed in the morning. Not the case with this product! All I had to do was wet and brush my edges and put on a hair band and I was ready to go. My picky self is satisfied!</li>
            <li> it leave my hair so soft!! I used it for a twist out style and get surprised with the excellent result, it was the only ptoduct I used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for about 7 years and learning to care for my hair had always been a struggle. But I can honestly say I was VERY impressed by this wonderful product! I had been deep conditioning, steaming, ACV rinsing, and oiling my \\&quot;4b\\&quot;/\\&quot;4c\\&quot; hair, with little success, and part of it I learned might&#x27;ve been from a) lots of split ends and b) heat damaged-hair from one time using too near-boiling water to rinse, and my one-time out of 4 years that i blow-dried. BUT with those problems, the Smoothie cream still worked HEAVENLY on my hair! Sooooo soft FINALLY after years of coarse-ness!  OH I believe I used this in a deep conditioner mix (I think it was Smoothie, honey, Vatika oil, Aubrey&#x27;s Organics) then steamed my hair and my hair was like \\&quot;WHOWWWW i feel good! Duh nuhnuh nuhnuh nuhnuh\\&quot; then it started dancing.   Lol.</li>
            <li> love it. Does great things to my curly hair. Keeps curls under control and smells great. get lots of compliments</li>
            <li> The product delivers as it says, anti-frizz, adds hydration to the curls, and softness to touch. But the smell of strawberries is just too strong for me, it does not go away and you have to smell it all day long. I will not buy this product again. I will stick with odorless Jane Carter Solution Curl Defining Cream.</li>
            <li> make my hair soft and curl</li>
            <li> I like it because it has a great smell, consistency and softening attributes. It really is natural and affordable too.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and curly. It is also very coarse and dry. This product works very well for me. I only have to use a little bit for each section of my hair, and it stays soft and manageable for several days! God bless the folks who make this stuff, because no other product tames my tresses like the Curl Enhancing Smoothie. I would love to buy more to support the company, but it takes a LONG time to use up the container.</li>
            <li> I love the entire line.  I started with the leave in conditioner and have used it faithfully for 4 years. I have even ordered and mailed it to others. I have since widened my hair arsenal with the shampoo, conditioners and smoothies.  Love them all and works wonders when used correctly.  I only buy the leave in conditioner from Amazon because it&#x27;s inexpensive. The rest of the line I purchase from Walgreens or Target because they are only 10.00 a product.</li>
            <li> Who buys this for so much money.  Go to Target or Walgreens or wherever and get it for $9.99.</li>
            <li> You can find this product at Walgreens or Target for nine dollars and ninety-nine cents. It&#x27;s ridiculous how much they are charging here. Great product but why pay at twenty plus dollars?</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair as a moisturizer( doesn&#x27;t really define curls) and it really helps my hair and I seal it with an oil blend that I made. I would recommend this product as a moisturizer and for styling. I used it on my bantu knot outs and my braid outs. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it if you want your natural curls to pop.&lt;br /&gt;I am really curious why a lot of Shea Moisture products are more expensive on Amazon than in stores. Shea Moisture products tend to be around $10-ish and this is listed as $20. I would suggest buying it in stores.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite! It not only smells good , but it holds my fine, kinky hair down... I had to figure out were it helped my hair the best and when styling the smoothie makes the job easier. The smell is beyond imaginely magnificent ! One of my other staple products.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for keeping my hair moist. Normally my hair will dry out to the point where I am running to wash it, because it itches so bad. It smells wonderful too. I just had to shop around for a cheaper price. I am able to purchase 3 for the price that Amazon sells it for at Walgreens.com.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product and wanted to love it, however after using the whole jar I found my hair to be dry after day three of using it. I know too much protein can dry the hair so that may have been the reason. I will buy again and try to use every 3 days or so.......the smell is wonderful, has great ingredients such as coconut oils I just recommend not using daily becAuse of the protein. I have also used as a deep which was effective</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product its wonderful. The consistency of this product is thick and should be used sparingly. I didnt know how to use this product so maybe thats why I didnt get the results that I was looking for. I have since then done more research and am confident that I can get what I need out of this product. Im almost 3 months natural and my hair is really growing fast. I cant wait to try this on a twist out.</li>
            <li> I have type 3 curly hair that I&#x27;ve been dyeing for the last four years, and highlighting for about a year. I went to my stylist one day and she told me my hair was too severely damaged to continue as a blonde. It hadn&#x27;t grown in months, and what used to be soft, thick hair had become brittle and riddled with split ends. The volume was a fraction of what it once was, but with frizz, could appear to be twice as full. So I dyed my hair darker, and started looking for ways to repair it. I tried a leave-in mask that I couldn&#x27;t stand (I won&#x27;t name names, but it was dreadful), and new brands of shampoos and conditioners that didn&#x27;t seem to have an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this brand in Duane Reade, and for some reason, it stood out to me. I bought the shampoo for curly hair, and also this curl-enhancing smoothie. After the first time using it, there was a VAST difference. I let my hair air dry, and for the first time in a long time, it dried into soft, manageable curls with little to no frizz. Even my most damaged areas were feeling healthy again, and my split ends were way less noticeable-maybe even on the road to repaired. After one use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair, which has been a hassle for the last few weeks for me, is now one of my favorite features, once again. Thanks to this smoothie.</li>
            <li> This product is a dream. I have wavy hair that tends to be kind of loose and frizzy, this makes my curls more defined all throughout and they stay smooth! remember to only use a little bit as this product is quite thick and will otherwise weigh your hair down and/or make it feel greasy. a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love using this product! It does an amazing job of keeping my hair moisturized for most of the day. I have really curly/kinky hair and i feel like it requires a ton of moisture and Shea Moisture really helps out a lot! However, this product is available at my local Walgreens for about $10, so I suggest if you have a store nearby to check there first before purchasing online!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reverted back to my natural hair texture (4c) about a year ago and this is the best product I have purchased thus far. It makes my hair soft and easy to manage and I like the smell of it. I use shea moisture shampoo and conditioner also, but this product just seems to do wonders, even when I was using Cantu.</li>
            <li> I use this as an everyday styling smoothie. It is very easy to use, all you have to do is spritz your hair with cold water and place the smoothie in and style. Some people use too much. Little is fine enough because it curls your hair even when you put some on your palm and massage it into your head. Your hair begins to curl quickly when it&#x27;s wet so you don&#x27;t need too much to weigh your hair down. Check out @sunkissalba on YouTube. Trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed! ;)</li>
            <li> Smells great, works quickly. Don&#x27;t need much work through. However, shoes very white, so you don&#x27;t need a lot of it. And it doesn&#x27;t mix well with other products. If u add oil to ur hair, add it first or it will just sit on top. Or if you use the oil to seal it, just use very little. And do sections. The moisturizer is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> All good things to say, it even smells good. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy or packed down. It gives your hair a natural shine last longs, its light and it smells good. It always enhances waves with no need for extra stuff and can be applied wet or dry best moisturizer i&#x27;ve used in 25yrs.</li>
            <li> Got my waves on FLEEK! lot of dudes dont know about this but I been using it for my waves and it works like a charm. Not just for the ladies or lightskin dudes will baby hair. Real men use this too. I should know.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was in Duane Reade searching for hair products that I could use on my naturally curly hair, and I was struggling on whether to get this or not because of the price. It was $12. And also because I had smelled it and I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying it anyway, but I saw on my receipt that it turns out that I was on sale, so I got it for $6.29!!&lt;br /&gt;I just used it for the first yesterday, and because my hair got smushed in my sleep last night (as it always does when it&#x27;s curly) I used it again this morning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;VE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH IT. I even started liking the smell, which is SO interesting because I actually am not a fan of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;I like how it makes my hair feel, it itself has a creamy and smooth texture but more like a butter as opposed to a cream/crème. It enhances/defines my curls (particularly the ones in the back, which are the curliest).&lt;br /&gt;MY FAULT WITH THIS HOWEVER, which is why I want to give this product a 3/12, is that IT DID NOT TAKE AWAY MY FRIZZ.&lt;br /&gt;Because the label says &amp;#34;anti-frizz&amp;#34; I was hoping that my frizz would be taken away. Idk what&#x27;s up with my hair. Maybe I just have this natural frizz that can&#x27;t go away once it dries idk.&lt;br /&gt;Cause when it&#x27;s wet, it looks PERFECTLY FINE. When my hair dried completely, I have defined curls, BUT MY HAIR IS STILL FRIZZY.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what I could use to fix this, but I was hoping that it would be this. However, it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Love that it defines my curls though!</li>
            <li> I love this product but this one was watered down! Big disappointment</li>
            <li> It brings out the curls and keeps your hair soft. I highly recommend this product,i even used it for my 4 yr old daughter...I love it,thank you</li>
            <li> I just love this product. My kinky hair has some very small spirally curls and other areas where there is an S-curl. The curl enhancing smoothie gives them all such great definition! And of course, the moisturization is awesome!!! I use the product after wetting my hair and using some type of oil (the LOC method). So far, I have used it for braid-outs. Works like a charm, and even on my relaxed ends, the curly pattern lasts well in most areas for at least a couple of days. The only problem I&#x27;ve had so far is the humidity on a rainy day -- wiped out all the effects it did! I prefer the smoothie to the gel souffle. The souffle didn&#x27;t do as well in the definition area, and I don&#x27;t think it moisturized as well either. One of my faves in the Shea Moisture line!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I am a 4b/c hair type and I use it for my twist outs and its great! I first used it when I was transitioning from relaxed to natural &amp; I borrowed it from my sister &amp; it worked so well I couldnt wait to buy my own. Dont be afraid to use this product, its not extremely heavy &amp; it has the right amount of oils (not too much, not too little) The container is big enough and will definitely last you a while. If you&#x27;re worried about spending 12 bucks on it, dont worry, its worth it. I recommend to purchase it at Target, Walgreens, or Sally Beauty Supply (priced at 10.99). I think this is Shea Moisture&#x27;s top 5 best products!</li>
            <li> I have been completely natural for 7 months. My hair is 4b/4c. I have had the hardest finding the best products for me. I have purchased too many products with very little luck. I tried this product early on in my journey with the transitioning kit. I had no success. After my ends were cut I used it and loved it. I received so many compliments on my hair. \\&quot;And if I do say so myself\\&quot; I really did wear it well :-). I think I purchased this from Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets an A+ for me. I wish it worked sooner. I am also using the Giovanni Leave -in Conditioner with it. I purchased that from Whole Foods. I hope this journey is finally taking a better road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Shea Moisture hair milk but I like that better for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted the Shea Moisture brand to work for me after I heard the founders story. It looks like things are going in that direction.</li>
            <li> …Yikes! OH NO!&lt;br /&gt;I thought I liked these products, but owner being bald sort-of CHANGES MY MIND ABOUT CONTINUING TO PURCHASE!…scary!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian but have very curly and coarse hair, and a lot of it. I really love this product, as it soaks into my hair and moisturizers it. I do have dry hair, so if you have oily hair this wouldn&#x27;t work for you. A little goes a long way!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best suited for:&lt;br /&gt;Medium to very curly hair&lt;br /&gt;Dry hair&lt;br /&gt;Coarse hair&lt;br /&gt;Thick hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t suit:&lt;br /&gt;Thin, oily hair&lt;br /&gt;Light hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product fits your hair type, it&#x27;s amazing. If not, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say... I LOVE THE SMELL!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing. I am African American with a 4b/4c hair texture and I use this product when using the L.O.C Method (Liquid/Oil/Cream). My hair is very dry and short (due to me cutting off my permed/ damaged hair); I am also going natural so I needed a good cream to moisturize my hair. Shea Moisture is everywhere and I hear a lot of good things about this product and brand so I thought, let me give it a try. I used this product as my cream and I let it sit on my hair over night; I first wash and air dry my hair and then use the LOC Method. I apply a liquid (water and/or my leave in conditioner) then a natural oil (I use coconut oil), then the cream (Shea Moisture Curl Enhance). After all of that I do twist on my hair and then I wrap my hair in a scarf and go to bed. When I woke up my hair was very curly (once I removed the twists). It was very curly and my hair felt really soft. I will be using this product often. In the morning I use this product with coconut oil as coating to continue to moisturize my hair. It smells really good and you can even use it alone if you don&#x27;t like too much product. A little goes a long way. Just a quarter worth is enough to coat my whole head; however, if your hair is longer you might use more (at most a 2 dollar coins worth). Its really good and I totally recommend it for anyone going natural with dry hair (4a/4b/4c). It&#x27;s really worth it and I notice change to my hair after 2 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you like this product! I will be using this product again; however, I believe its cheaper in stores... like 4$ cheaper.... so I might be buying this product from there for now on lol</li>
            <li> I love this product it defines your curls and is moisturizing. The only complaint I have is my hair doesn&#x27;t stay moisturized for longer than 3 days. It is pretty pricey but is worth the money. Great for twistouts.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie was great for my high porosity natural hair. Their name says it all. It delivered  moisture, curl definition, and it smells just like a fruit infused sweet treat.(It&#x27;s not actually edible.) My results were amazing. My hair feels soft and moist,looks shinier with a soft hold , and my hair smells fantastic. It has a mild aroma of a tropical fruit, with a creamy texture that most likely aids in well defined curls with minimal frizz. It contains most, if not all natural ingredients. A 12 oz. jar ran me about 12 bucks. It&#x27;s pretty thick so a little goes a long way. Competing similar hair products cost between $25.00 and up for about 8oz., It has a really soft hold, so depending on the humidity, you might have to add a gel along side it in order to retain definition for an extended period of time.. Overall, I think Shea moisture offers a quality value product.</li>
            <li> I have kinky, thick hair and it really helps the curls stay put if I apply right after rinsing out the SM gold line restorative conditioner. 10/10 would buy again!</li>
            <li> This is the only curling cream I use and it works wonders. Make my hair soft so I always use it for my LOC.</li>
            <li> The first couple days I had not used enough in my hair. It felt soft and light but then I used a generous amount and WOW! It feels silky not greasy. The healthiest my hair has been in years. To me: it smells wonderful. Like coconut and pineapple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to train my hair for waves and this product is a must for my journey!! I advise anyone to buy this product, if your considering waves or adding to your arsenal!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the summer and my hair absolutely loves this smoothie! It has become an instant staple!! :-)</li>
            <li> We all know that anything that is an emulsion of oil and water requires a preservative.  This product claim to have both.  water and oils.  Upon examining the ingredient list of this product, I noticed that no preservative was listed.  This led me to think that the ingredient list of this product is incomplete.  Now, if the ingredient list is not complete, I can only imagine what other ingredients that are in there that are purposely NOT listed on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product.  But the product left a residue on my hair no matter which way I applied it.  I have 4b/c hair.  It also left my hair feeling very dry.  Please keep in mind that what may work for one person may not work for you, and the only way to find out if it will work for you is to try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, did I mention the online cost is nearly double that of all local stores who carry this product?</li>
            <li> I love this! and although i&#x27;m no longer rocking my curly natural fro, it did my fro justice! the curls stayed in place the whole day and it was so soft.</li>
            <li> I smooth some of this in my hair after I wash it. I am a wash-n-go girl, so I let my hair dry just a little and then apply it on the damp hair. It keeps my hair nicely moisturized and soft. Don&#x27;t use a lot or you will get product build up and frizzy hair. If when your hair dries you see white little patches or specks of product, you used too much product. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love their whole line of hair products as well as some of their facial products. My hair hates gels and products with glycerin so I avoid them as they dry my hair out. If I think I need to use a little gel on the ends of my hair after I style it, the only gel I will use is Shea Moisture&#x27;s gel because it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and my hair stays soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great line for people with thick, wavy, curly, and coily natural hair. It might not work for everyone because each person&#x27;s hair is different but give it a try. It might just work for you too.</li>
            <li> My hair is type 3 natural and this product is pretty good.  My hair is moisturized with little to no shedding.  Twist-outs are nicely defined.</li>
            <li> This keeps my curls hydrated w/o making them heavy or greasy. Also smells very nice</li>
            <li> I tried to use it in my L.O.C method but it left my hair dry, hard,greasy and dull.The only pro is the smell.</li>
            <li> Like most shea moisture products, the curl enhancing smoothie has pretty good ingredients and is a good price.  This product is definitely not a go to product if you are looking for hold, which is fine by me.  My main problem is that whenever I used this after a few days my hair would have white residue and I felt that even when there was no such residue, my hair just did not look as shiny as usual.  All that to say, I wanted to love this because so many naturals swear by it but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Amazing did everything it said it will do left my hair moist smooth works great on my thick hair and it smells great. And it makes your hair anti-frizz</li>
            <li> I love this product! Curls my hair up and leaves it moisturized. I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Great product  for natural and processed hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased a kit with this in it.  It was in a tube form though.  I put it on my 4C extreme coiling shrinking hair and felt it did nothing so I let it sit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a while I started experimenting with two strand twists.  I&#x27;m a grown woman who don&#x27;t know how to do my own hair so imagine what my two strand twists were looking like when I first tried this hairstyle.  I did the twist out and my hair looked a shiny hot mess.  So I stopped using this smoothie for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then purchased the gel souffle.  I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking that made me combine this and the gel souffle but I&#x27;m glad I did.  I dampened my hair a little, mixed this with the gel souffle and did the two strand twists.  I left the twists in my hair for 13 days.  I wash my hair every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I tell you when I took out my twists my hair was in these gorgeous spirals!  They were shiny and I received a lot of compliments on my hair.  So I began doing my two strand twists this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now unfortunately the twist outs only keep for one day but it works for me because the day I untwist my twists is the day I was my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did a five minute experiment.  I mixed this smoothie along with the gel souffle and did one twist for five minutes and undid my twist and I had those gorgeous spirals in about 5 minutes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this works better when combined with the gel and it works extremely well with extreme coily hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like this at first but now that I know how to use it I won&#x27;t use anything else for my two strand twists.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s organic. Works great for my daughters natural looks. Keeps hair feeling soft and moisturized. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product. It is so moisturizing and it smells great. I use it in both me and my daughter&#x27;s hair religiously.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the great responses people have had with this product. I definitely dont see the benefit of this product it does nothing for me I can rub this product all day and it will still have small white baby balls in my curls I dont understand. I am upset I was foolish enough to buy the whole line of this stuff. This Shea moisture does not provide moisture at ALL. Buyer purchase at your own discretion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this around the begining of Oct 2010 and I must say it is trully a wonderful product! I have used countless and I do mean countless so called moisturizers claiming to moisturize the hair and make it soft and supple at the same time. Well to say the least many of the other products that I&#x27;ve tried does not even come close to this. I&#x27;ve used to name just a few IC gel, Hawaiian Silky 14 n 1, S Curl no drip and many more. And in my opinion for my hair type nothing comes close to this.    First the fragrance alone will make you fall in love with it. Second but not last is the moisturizing affects it has on my hair. I am a 3c/4a hair type and it has been a true struggle for me to find what really works well in my hair. Well this is definitely it. Next month I will order at least 5 jars to ensure I will not run out. It does what it says it will do without a doubt. The only negative thing I can say about it and I&#x27;m not speaking of the product but more so the availability of it. I had to order this online through Amazon! I am a regular shopper on Amazon, but sometimes the shipping cost gets to me. I was so disappointed going to two different Targets in my area and they did not have it let alone only a tiny section for black hair care which I think is ridiculous in the first place! The hair care section for women of color was so small I went back to it 3 times thinking I must have missed something. For all other races there was an abundance of hair care products. Which btw I think is so unfair!    But other than that I think next month along with my five jars of this smoothie that I will also order the rest of the products since I had such a wonderful and delightful positive affects with this one. Oh, I would like to also mention when using this product I use it on dry freshly washed and conditioned hair. Then I applied the leave-in which works well also. But after I apply the smoothie (just a small amount per section) I use Wave Nouveau moisturizing lotion then putmy hair in medium size 2 strand twist and use just a dab per section Jamaican Black Castor oil on the twist but mostly concentrating on my ends. Then I baggy and use a satin cap. That&#x27;s it! Amazing results every single time. So if anyone out there has contemplated purchasing this, then don&#x27;t! Get it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product has cut time from my morning routine. I just wash my hair, put this product on and GO!  My hair feels amazing and I truly love the fact that it holds my curls, feels and looks moisturized. I work 8-10 hours a day and make time for the gym. Ladies, I am usually skeptical about these products but so far I&#x27;ve had no problems especially with Shea Moisture.  I have thin hair and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair get fuller. This is my go-to product as long as long as it keeps going what its doing. Happy Customer!</li>
            <li> SOOOOOOO... At first I was crazily skeptical about purchasing this product because I have fine hair strands (although my hair appears quite dense and thick) which made me worry about the thickness of this. On top of that, my hair is very kinky/curly, and I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t actually do what it says - &amp;#34;curl enhancement&amp;#34;. BOY! Was I WRONG! I was just careful in the amount of product I put in because of my fine strands, but after my perm rod set my curls were so beautifully, and softly defined, I was shocked! I mean, I was literally whipping my head back and forth and dancing around. I&#x27;ve been searching for something that worked for my hair that didn&#x27;t turn it into a crunchy, dry mess and this Shea Moisture delivered 100% for me.</li>
            <li> I have 4a natural hair. For those who claim that this product left their hair sticky with residue, try using it SPARINGLY  on SOAKING WET hair. I am talking freshly washed and out the shower hair (no towel drying). I made the error of using too much on my hair while damp and then once again on a second occasion while my hair was dry. Each time my hair came out sticky, tacky and later on, flaky. But i gave it just one more try. This time I raked the product through with my fingers on my sopping wet hair. My hair came out moisturized, soft to the touch, and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Target.  I had planned to return it as I found it somewhat drying.  However, I also noticed a nice, put-together quality to my hair after using it and decided to keep it.  It gave my hair more of a glow than shine.  It kind of works like a BB cream for hair...great as a base or primer for styling products.  I wash and condition my hair, towel dry, and then apply the Curl Enhancing Smoothie.  I then allow my hair to air dry until about 50% dry.  Then I apply a liquid foaming mousse and rollers and allow to air dry.  Works great :)</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but I can&#x27;t see any added benefit of using this product. I put it on ends of hair but my hair doesn&#x27;t look any different from before since using it.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich product, so someone with fine, porous wavy/curly hair has to use this sparingly. I have 2c/3a hair, I use a very small amount on soaking wet hair as a sealer before the rest of my stylers. It helps the hair clump and gives great definition, not so much hold though. Smells great but does not linger.</li>
            <li> Works Awesome on my 4c Hair</li>
            <li> Smells nice and worked well for me however a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I have 8 daughters &amp; this product ran out quickly!! They all are natural and this defines the styles they wear. I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> good addition to my collection</li>
            <li> I have recently fully transitioned to natural by cutting off all my Permed hair. I wanted a great hair product that would keep my type 4b hair moisturized, without too much gunk, so I bought this....now my bi-racial husband has taken it over for his hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells like something my grandmother used to bake me. It keeps your hair well moisturized and soft to the end of the day. Careful though, don&#x27;t use too much, just a little will do or your hair will be white and messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works for both of us and I am happy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on an acquaintance&#x27;s recommendation.  It was more cost effective than many of the other brands--great for a full-time student like me.  I am a long-term transitioner, and I had been pressing my hair for months.  My hair is naturally wavy and very thick and frizzy.  At first, I didn&#x27;t like it.  However, I gave it some time.  I clipped some of my remaining relaxed hair, used pure, raw shea butter as a night-time moisturizer, and braided my hair overnight.  The next day, I used the smoothie for day time styling.  Works great.  Reduces frizz (doesn&#x27;t eliminate it, but let&#x27;s face it--what does?), my hair is moisturized but not greasy (wavy hair easily gets a \\&quot;Soul Glo\\&quot; look), and the hold is natural but persistent.  The scent is fantastic (it is a little overpowering at first, but fades nicely).  I would not recommend this for overnight IF you have wavy/very curly hair (think Corinne Bailey Rae or Alicia Keys...somewhere in there)--for this kind of hair, use coconut oil or raw shea butter as an overnight moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It smells awesome and it makes my curls look and feel great. But why is it 37 bucks here? Is this some sort of error?</li>
            <li> I used this for my curls after watching a youtube video of how this natural girl made her curls pop out. She used this and eco style olive oil gel. OMG, this product just stunk, I could not wait to wash it out of my head. Also it was too heavy for my hair and my curls turned out terrible. I like there other products but this one was a disappointment</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews, watched the You Tube editorials and decided to purchase the Curl Enhancing Smoothie.  I am in my 40&#x27;s with natural curly 3a/3b hair. Lately is seems my crown has been very dry and frizzy, probably from highlighting and gels to keep down on the frizz. I am on day 3 of using this product and I am liking it. Hence I do put it on sparingly and water it down a bit, but all in all I am enjoying not using gels and volume enhancers. Stay tuned.... ps I also use it on my feet before bed with socks.</li>
            <li> I returned this item because it was not what I was looking for.  I was looking for the gel instead of the cream.  The names of the products are almost identical.</li>
            <li> I love shea moisture products! My hair does well when I use this for twists in my hair. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t enhance my curls as much as my homemade concoction; seems more wet and conditioner-feeling than having the right balance of oil which I am not sure I like as much on my hair; I will use it up for my twists.</li>
            <li> I have 3 all natural daughters and my wife decides to try this &amp;#34;Shea Moisture&amp;#34; brand. Well I have to say, I&#x27;m happy that my daughters found something for their hair texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves the smell of their hair afterwards and sometimes they use it as body lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, can and will leave specks so dont be heavy handed  but does the job.</li>
            <li> I like it on my 3b texture hair and it smells nice it used to be my first choice in moisturizers but now put this in SECOND place and i put cantu&#x27;s coconut curl cream in FIRST place. There is just no comparison between the two but dont get me wrong this serves its purpose but cantu has got it BEAT. Also i dont know who shea moisture thinks they are but they need to lower their prices on their products or either make their containers bigger because its expensive for what you get only a few uses out of it.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! It is a great styler and conditioner. A little goes a long way and makes your hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Okay this is the best stuff. I love it and use it everytime I wear my hair curley.  The only problem is that it cost to much here.  Don&#x27;t pay more then $12.00 for it.  I was almost out of it and didn&#x27;t have time to go to Target.  Prime got it to me in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed (mom is black and dad is portugese). I would say my hair only has a good curl pattern when its shorter. As it grows longer it tends to look like a hot mess. This product does help my hair curl beautiful but doesn&#x27;t moisturize to much. Maybe my hair just soaks up this product fact but to keep mositure I have to put it on twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOOKS REALLY NICE WHEN YOU USE IT, FRENCH BRAID YOUR HAIR, LET IT DRY, AND TAKE IT OUT!</li>
            <li> I love the way this defines my 3b 3c curls. It took me a moment to get used to the smell. It wasn&#x27;t a bad smell by any means, just different for me but I love this stuff. I love the Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus line. It works great when used with a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have tight kinky curly hair that always feels dry. I have tried so many products and most of them did t help my hair feel soft but this product does. I love the affordable price and how soft and moisturized my hair is!</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my natural hair and forms my tiny curls that last all day, and like the texture of my hair not sticky!</li>
            <li> I use this as a leave in conditioner. I apply it while my hair is still wet, it does an amazing job at retaining curls. It is a water based cream which does a great job at revitalizing hair in between washes. It also has a sweet tropical scent to it that should be pleasing to most people, it really does smell like a smoothie...which I guess is what they were going for. It&#x27;s a good product, my hair feels soft when I apply it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone who relaxed or straightens their hair because the water base is only going to make it harder to maintain those styles. It&#x27;s best for curly hair. The only con in my opinion is that once my hair is dry and I want to use this product, I have to use quite a bit to get the job done, I don&#x27;t like overloading my hair with product so once I&#x27;ve used this for a few days I feel the need to wash my hair and get rid of all the product build up.</li>
            <li> one of my new favs! great product for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I went natural and sulfate free almost a year ago, and I dont think I would have been able to do it if I didnt find the Shea Moisture product line.  I have 3b, fine, causasian hair, thats been bleached several times, straightened, frizzy and highly porous. This was one of the first products I bought.  It is extremely moisturizing, and smells like a nice coconut conditioner. I found it to be a little too heavy for styling my hair.. if I used too much it weighed it down and looked greasy.  I ended up using this as a conditioning mask, which worked very well.  I think for thicker, coarser hair, this cream iwould be ideal for styling.  For myself, I found that the Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner worked better in styling (its a little bit lighter on the hair). 4 stars because this is a great product, and a great bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This left my hair a clumpy icky mess and it seemed to attract the dirt in the air. My hair felt so grimy by the end of the day. Even when used sparingly, I just could not get it to work for me.</li>
            <li> Smells great, organic, only con is that it leaves a slight sticky coating on my 4A/4B curls. I am going to try to mix it with Aloe Vera gel and Jojoba oil and will update my review at a later time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/30/2011&lt;br /&gt;  Sadly this product did not work for me. :[&lt;br /&gt;I tired mixing it with the products mentioned above but nothing did the trick. I gave the product away to a neighbor who is mixed (Caucasian &amp; African American), and it worked great for her. All in all this product did not work for my texture curls.</li>
            <li> I am an african american woman with very thick natural hair. This product is great. It is not heavy or greasy and has a great smell.  Just a little on my hair gives it a soft feel and makes it very easy to style.  I hope they never stop making this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the smoothie at a local Target and I don&#x27;t care for it all that much for my 3c hair.My hair doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb the product very well.I figured I&#x27;d used too much,so I experimented with the smoothie using different amounts and different styling methods.Alas,nothing works!I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient is in the smoothie that coats the hair strands that way,but it is definetly undesirable to have a milky,white substance dripping from my hair all day long!Rinsing a little bit out of my hair with water just spread the smoothie more,still coating the strands and diffusing my hair with a blow dyrer made it sticky and I still had the coating!.However,the next day,a water rinse worked wonders and I had well defined curls.So this purchase was not a total bust.If you get the same results I got,using it the first day,at least your second day hair will be decent and you can stretch your money.But personally,I want a product that doesn&#x27;t take a day and a half to work!Hopefully this review will help you.I have a friend with 4a hair and she loves it so maybe it&#x27;s just my texture;-)Best of luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews... Never again will I believe these reviews. Waste of money and time. Save your money!!!</li>
            <li> Ok i am in love with this product it smells good, it&#x27;s natural, and my hair loves it ( i have medium/thick curly/wavy hair). But don&#x27;t buy it on here, i&#x27;m always looking for good prices for hair and make up because i buy so much of it and i&#x27;d be happier if i saved 10$. So yeah this same product and this whole line of products is much cheaper at target for instance this particular product is 4.98 at target right now.</li>
            <li> I use this for many different purposes. When I&#x27;m twisting my hair, to refresh a style or even to slick back my hair and prevent frizz if I don&#x27;t want to use gel. It can be a bit greasy but I apply it one day and don&#x27;t have to apply any more product the next day. I just refresh with water and the product reactivates. While I don&#x27;t care for the smell, it is bearable.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with type 3-4b hair. It hydrates instantly, and has a lovely smell. I use it on my 12 year old boy, and myself. It is very dense, creamy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now, and I love it! I have naturally curly 3b hair with 3c in the crown area and I always use this immediately after I get out of the shower. I use a good amount to make sure I coat all of my hair and then I add my styling product. This stuff really feels like its working. Curly hair is usually much more dry than other hair types and this is what I use to ensure that I get the hydration that I need. Definitely get it!</li>
            <li> This product smell so nice! It is not too heavy on my hair, and keeps it pretty frizz free and soft.</li>
            <li> have silver mix hair. can be frizzy, the silver hair, so was looking to soften and curl it. this smoothie is really the ticket. i only use a quarter size dab, rub my hands together and finger it thru my hair roots to ends. gives great tropical smell and shine and curl..aloha and mahalo nui loa...dixie...this product needs to be on the shelf of every person with curly hair, men and women.  men need to project more and this smoothie will get them attention...</li>
            <li> I use the whole shea moisture brand, and I love this stuff.  It leaves my hair soft and my curls shiny.  And it is worry free because it is all organic so that means nothing harsh for my hair and safe for the environment.  I give it two thumbs up.  I put it in my hair wet or dry before I twist my hair.  I also use she moisture&#x27;s hold and shine spray along with it, to ensure my curls stay nice and coiled.</li>
            <li> So right now I&#x27;m using Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque as a leave in conditioner (it&#x27;s not heavy) and their Black Soap for Dry Scalp, and absolutely love both. Target carries their entire line for $10 each. Please do not over pay here.</li>
            <li> this product is fairly new to me, but i tried a small amount from a store and really liked it.  when i saw it on line, i decided to&lt;br /&gt;buy it in a larger container.  then i saw it for less but same large size jar, and purchased that one too.  happy that i have&lt;br /&gt;lots now to last a good, long time.</li>
            <li> Love it for my naturally curly hair. I have tried others. This one is the best</li>
            <li> Shea moisture is not for me...lost a lot of hair</li>
            <li> I used to love this stuff. Great price. For me it works well if I leave my hair curly, or use before blowing out...it locks the moisture and sheen. However after months of using it I found it leaches alot of residue on my forehead and sides of my face leading to consistent break outs. So I&#x27;m gonna try something less oily. Great for chapped hands too.</li>
            <li> Unless you have ethnic hair, this isn&#x27;t  for you.&lt;br /&gt;Its incredibly heavy and greasy and made me look like i hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a week.</li>
            <li> This is horrible. It&#x27;s very oil and doesn&#x27;t make you hair more curly</li>
            <li> My hair cannot live without this product, it is one of the best moisturizers ever, I recommend this product for natural hair!</li>
            <li> moisturizes well and penetrates deeply. Leaves my hair feeling healthy but not greasy</li>
            <li> I love this; it works well on my hair. However, it is extremely overpriced on this website. It sells for $10 at Target and Wallgreens.</li>
            <li> I am definitely planning to try this product...it got great reviews and core ingredients are pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the price here is PRETTY STEEP. Take a trip over to your local TARGET store or Online, you&#x27;ll find it there for about $10.60!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who doesn&#x27;t love a bargain?!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at walgreens, since it was $5 cheaper and I don&#x27;t regret it! I have 4a/b hair, and although I have seen a lot of naturals praise this product, I was a bit skeptic. Me and &amp;#34;cremes&amp;#34; never seemed to mix, they would always leave my hair greasy, dull and undefined due to the large amounts of butters added to them. However, this product was different, it added a nice shine, it left my hair soft, and best of all, whether I was rocking a wash and go or a braidout, it really made my curls pop! This is also a very moisturizing product, and I have used it all on its own on wet hair to do a braidout, and I got beautiful results. The only drawback to this is that because it is moisturizing and acts as a sealant at the same time, if you use it on wet hair, it won&#x27;t dry as quickly, but there are many work arounds for this, such as using a blow dryer to dry your hair instead of air drying it. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell the most ..dont no why it makes my hair with no shine at all</li>
            <li> The first thing I will say is that I really believe the outcome of any product depends on your hair type and what style you are trying to achieve.  For instance, I am twist out gal and hate wash and go because of the excessive shrinkage.  Also, I purchased a more expensive product that my sister raved about and had horrible results.  After doing some internet product research for type 4 hair I came across Shea Moisture.  It has been my staple for about two years.  I used to use it as my primary moisturize but have since learned that (for me) homemade products work best as a moisturizer.  This Shea Moisture product is perfect for defining curls and waves.  I&#x27;ll also say use sparingly (but that&#x27;s for any product).  I&#x27;m not a product junkie but I have used my share of \\&quot;natural hair care\\&quot; products only to find that certain chemicals are terrible for my hair.  I used to have a lot of breakage before I started using organic/home made products, which is one of the reasons I purchased Shea Moisture.  Another is I can purchase from Walgreen&#x27;s (I have seen it now at Walmart) and not just on-line.  To wrap this up, Shea Moisture is an excellent product and I would recommend to Naturalistas with type 4 hair.</li>
            <li> This is a product it great for leaving my hair soft and moisturized. I think on the jar they claim that it leaves your hair defined which is untrue. I always mix this will a little gel and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> Heavy and sticky.  Tried using in a variety of ways and no luck.  My curls are baby fine yet dense.  Gel works much better for my 4a type.  I switched to Deva Curl curly girl method and love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my daughter&#x27;s hair. My husband bought it for himself and I used it for our little girls hair. Perfect for her. However, when I found out he paid $14 for it I was like, no way! The most I&#x27;ve seen it for was $7.49 but I price matches it at Target.</li>
            <li> Give one because I could not give lower, didnt work for my hair, smell horrible and leave my hair like I put Crisco on it.</li>
            <li> I hate price gouging. The good news this is a great product a little goes a long way. But just because we are curly girls it does not mean that we should throw away our money. Before you buy this on Amazon please check Target, Walgreens or Walmart- they sell this (and there other products) for at least 50% LESS than what is offered here!</li>
            <li> Ok so in full disclosure, my all time #1 leave in styler/moisturizer is Qhemet Biologics Alma &amp; Olive Heavy Cream...I know, I know...so is everyone else&#x27;s. But since qhemet is ALWAYS out of stock and/or sold out I have been on the search for a suitable (and maybe less expensive??) back up. Well folks, this is not it. I read in one of the other reviews that this product is not for protein sensitive. I am not sure what that means but that might be me. Here&#x27;s the thing, I applied it liberally to my very damp hair and proceeded to flat twist and air dry overnight. My hair is normally very soft, has \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; and bounce to it. I love a nice sheen as well. This product failed in all categories. My hair did not feel moisturized. It felt like hay with oil on top. As if I coated a heavy oil over dry hair without putting a penetrating oil like coconut oil on first.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to do my hair once per week. I style it, leave it up for the week and take down for a day or two before co-washing again. My style did not even last 2 days!! My hair looked dull, unkept, frizzy and dry. I looked like one of those children whose mother can&#x27;t be bothered to properly attend to the child&#x27;s hair. It was that bad. I was embarrassed that my hair looked unprofessional after taking my time to style it. I do not recommend this product if  you have any remote affection for the qhemet A&amp;O HC, you will be sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but don&#x27;t use too much or it will appear white. The asking price is ridiculous. This same jar  costs $10 at Target or Walmart</li>
            <li> Oh, so loving this product!  This cream is luxurious.  After much research, and trial and error, I decided to try this (partly because of all the positive reviews).  Well, this product delivers!  I am a naturally curly, type 3b, 3c hair and this cream really works on it.  It has a slight hold, very thick, but light on the hair.  I used Miss Jessies curly buttercreme (the minty smelling black label) and it is very heavy.  Also it has no-no ingredients in it (petolatem, mineral oil....yuck), not to mention, very expensive.....Well move over Queen Jess, there&#x27;s a new sheriff in town!  Shea Moisture smoothie has none of that junk, all good-for-hair ingredients, smells heavenly and defines my curls like no other.  It is similar to their curl &amp; style milk, but thicker.  My hair is very dry and this hydrates my thirsty hair, but is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a wonderful product, I would definitely recommend.  Leaves my hair, soft, shiny and hydrated....not to mention awesome smelling.  If you have fine hair like me and type 3 in nature, I would say definitely give this a try.  I will be purchasing again, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s.  it does cost about $10 at target or walgreens, etc.  Try there first.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and knew from the reviews that it was divisive. You either loved it or hated it. I followed the directions and used small amounts on large sections of hair. I did a twist out and I used it for my wash and go. Both times my hair was fluffy, light, moisturized and the style lasted for days. The first time I used it for my twist I did not apply Gel and my hair was frizzy due to the summer weather. The second time I did a twist out, I used the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Gel Soufflé and the style held for two days and was perfect for a defined puff the following day. For the wash and go, I used it with the Gel Soufflé and with the African Black Soap Leave-in Balancing Conditioner. This product is like magic. It is best to know your hair needs and to understand your technique. The product enhances what you do, if you know your hair, you should know how to use the product for best. (4a, low porosity, fine/dense hair).    Update:  After using all summer, I wanted to say that as my technique improved I was able to wear styles for 4-5 days. My hair stayed moisturized that whole time. Now, I was having scalp dryness, but that can be handled with the ABS Spray. I loved how my hair kept feeling moist and soft as each day wore on with the style.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me.  It was sticky and greasy and too thick. Once it dried it flaked badly.  I tried it several times with and without using other products, with and without blowdrying and every time there was some degree of horror that led to me rinsing it out before I could leave the house. I eventually gave it to my sister who doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same problems with it. She says its ok for moisturizing, but not great for styling so I gave it two stars.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have 4a 4b tight coil hair. It also tends to be dry. This product is a very good moisturizer. Doesnt take much, you have to rub it in really good unless its at bedtime (covered with a silk bonnet) because it will leave a white film. Theres one thing that has me puzzled though. this product is price from 42.99 down to 23.15 on Amazon. You can purchase this at Wal Mart, Targets or Walgreen for 9.99 all day Everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for &#x27;my&#x27; hair, I have 3c hair been natural for 10 years, and this is the only product that keeps my hair moisturized without having to constantly reapply everyday. The smell is amazing and it&#x27;s light, as for hold out of 10 I&#x27;d give it a 3, but that&#x27;s not a problem I just mix it with Eco Styler Olive Oil Gel. But for the price they are selling here....NO THANKS you can get this product at Targer for $9.99.</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter for my hair and body for 3 years now and I love this shea moisture product. I have found some hair smooties that work a little better, but this a good product.</li>
            <li> I just recently decided to wear my hair natural. My hair is thick and Curley and is cut very short. I found this product in Target which us great because of the price it cost for shipment through Amazon. I love the Curl Enhancing. I use this product along with raw coconut. My hair feels so moist and my curls more defined and it smell good too. Great product.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus has a great smell</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus kit because of all the rave reviews it recieved.    While I love the shampoo and conditioner, the Curl Enhancing Smoothie was the product I was most excited about trying out. However it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. I love the smell (it smells like pina colada), but that&#x27;s about it.    I have 4B hair and I thought this would be perfect for it, but it&#x27;s not. While the Smoothie did leave my hair soft and managable, the curls definitely weren&#x27;t defined. Maybe it&#x27;s because my afro&#x27;s too short, or perhaps it&#x27;s because I bleached my hair last month and that may have an effect on it.    After using the Smoothie, I decided to look at YouTube videos and find out how other women were using the Smoothie to define their natural hair.    I watched a video where a woman said that before she put the Smoothie in her hair, first she used an alcohol-free hair gel THEN applied the Smoothie on top of it. She also made sure to tell her audience that her hair was DRY when she did this. I made the mistake of putting the Smoothie in my hair immediately after I washed it, so that was probably the reason why it didn&#x27;t work the way I wanted it to.    So the following afternoon when my hair was bone dry, I used an alcohol-free hair gel, THEN applied the Smoothie on top of it, and my curls began to stand out. It&#x27;s unfortunate that I have to use more than one product in order to get the Smoothie to work.    It smells delicious and it does soften my hair, but I&#x27;m not too fond of the fact that I have to use multiple products in order for the Smoothie to work. Instead, I&#x27;m going to try the Shea Butter Restorative kit for my dry, chemicially-dyed hair instead.    If that works, THEN I&#x27;ll return to the Coconut &amp; Hibisicus products.</li>
            <li> I have tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s, Kinky Curly, Keracare Natural hair line and more. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on hair products trying to find the best one for my hair. I decided to try Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie when I was at Target oneday because I was short on money and it was the least expensive. It was the best decision I have ever made. I have not used anything else since. I am SOLD!!! I have told everyone about it. I love this product because it does not way down my hair, it does not make my curls hard. When I let my hair air dry I have the most defined and shiny curls. It smells good too. If your looking for something that defines your natural curls without making your hair hard; you have to try Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie. You will not be sorry.     [[ASIN:B0038TVH3Y Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Hold Smoothie - 12 oz.]]</li>
            <li> My 4b/4c hair seems like it wants to like this product but after day 2-3, it get dry and crunchy...I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s disagreeing with my eco styler or what.  Verdict is still out on this one.</li>
            <li> Ok... This product is awesome, but why should you pay $22.99 for it when you could go to walgreens, walgreens.com, target, or target.com and get it for $9.99. Walgreens even has free shipping on orders $25 and up.  I&#x27;m not sure if they ship internationally but it&#x27;s worth looking into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again! Great product! Very moisturizing and great for twist outs and braid outs (I have 4a, kinky hair with normal porosity, and medium coarse strands). But buy it from somewhere else that&#x27;s cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> I had a solid hair routine that involved Mixed Chicks shampoo, deep conditioner and leave in, which worked, but my hair still felt dry after using it. Then, I decided to do a little experimenting. I bought a bottle of this stuff and my Mixed Chicks products have been left on the side of the tub wondering if they&#x27;ll ever get back in rotation. Honestly, I don&#x27;t think they will. I believe I&#x27;ve built something solid with Shea Moisture, moisture being the key word for why I think we&#x27;ll go the distance. Mixed Chicks and I had a good thing while it lasted, but I&#x27;m definitely moving on. This stuff smells better and makes my hair soft and moisturized with water for 2-3 days in the middle of the most humid weather. And even more importantly the price tag in comparison with my old product line just can&#x27;t compare, so I&#x27;ve taken my savings and bought some new shoes...it&#x27;s a win, win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly would have given this product five stars, but it does have a tendency even with a light handed application to leave a white film, but it fades away, so I&#x27;m fine with that since I use it at night and by the morning it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best natural hair moisturizers out there it makes ur hair nice and moisturized soft to the touch just the greatest product a must have for naturals.</li>
            <li> I love Shea Moisture products, I have 4a-c hair. However, these products are 9.99 in Walgreens, Walmart and CVS. This is way over priced.</li>
            <li> If you have or are trying to get 360 waves this is the perfect moisturizer for most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works perfect for me, I&#x27;ve been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for like three years now man; anyways from my perspective it&#x27;s got a great smell (which females love lol,) keeps your hair moisturized most, if not all day &amp; provides a good hold while keeping frizz to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I bought this last month and yes it works! But to the point... This is only $9.99 in target and walgreen, why its so expensive here is beyond me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days, and it&#x27;s been great.  I have dark brown, S-wavy hair that was a little too fluffy and had a lot of volume.  This product sleeks down my hair so it looks shiny and tame.  It also holds my curls a little bit, but I don&#x27;t think anyone should buy it with that in mind.  Basically, it enhances my curls; it doesn&#x27;t shape and keep them like a gel would.</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing!  Been using this product going on a week, I use it as a moisturizer for my waves.  Quality ingredients so, it doesn&#x27;t take much.  The first time I used it I was hooked. If your thinking about getting it, you&#x27;ll def be pleased.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Hold Smoothie is an excellent product. However, for best results use the entire Coconut &amp; Hibiscus product line: shampoo, milk conditioner, Curl enhancing smoothie, Souffle and light hold spray.&lt;br /&gt;*Also, if you see this product for sale more than $12.99 DO NOT BUY* This product can be purchased directly at retail for no more than $10.99 to $12.99. Most sell for $9.99 to $11.99 in-store or online. $20.29 is a RIP OFF by private individuals and companies not affiliated with Shea Moisture or Sundial products.&lt;br /&gt;All in all the product is absolutely AWESOME and works moisture miracles on my 4c hair type! I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s light, smells great, and helps me keep my curls.  I can expand the number of days between twisting  my hair.  A great buy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally very thick and wavy hair, and in humidity, I discovered it would get increasingly curly.  So I started my search for something that would definitely enhance these natural waves, especially since I hate straightening my hair all the time, but don&#x27;t like the natural wave I have.  My mother discouraged me, saying I would never find anything to turn my waves into curls, but this product does it beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is my hair super wavy after using this (thus the title of \\&quot;crazy lion curls\\&quot;), but it also smells wonderful and stays very soft and pliable.  Works well with wet or dry hair. I love the sweet smell of it as well.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!  Works especially well on second or third day hair, and doesn&#x27;t make it look oily at all.</li>
            <li> I Bought this for my Girl Friend she is &amp;#34;a mixed chick&amp;#34; with Curly poofy hair. One night she only tried the Curl enhancing Smoothie to wake up with baby soft hair and her curls &amp;#34;co-operated&amp;#34; with her when she was doing her hair. she loved this and its smells amazing.! ladies i would recommend this if your hair is Mixed with the &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;very Curly&amp;#34; aspect of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( Gent&#x27;s if your lady is having issues with her hair get her this Gift it will not disappoint. )</li>
            <li> This product helps to make my hair easier to manage. It smells nice and i get complements everytime i put it on for the way it makes my hair shine and for the way it make my hair smell.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Does not suit my hair type. I am a mixed chick.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. This product left me with bouncy, moisturized curls and easy to manage hair. It held my natural curls perfectly and I dare you to try this product. It is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Good Product. Still testing it out in my Type 3c hair. I am using this and an oil base moisturizer to keep in the moisture.</li>
            <li> I think I just discovered hair nirvana. I picked this up at Target when I was on vacation and ran out of my regular product which is only available online. This product is very light, but extremely moisturizing. It defines my 3 a, b curls and gives them so much bounce and volume!  So far I have been able to get about 3 days of wear with my wash and go, but it has been very humid and I don&#x27;t like frizz. This is my new product.</li>
            <li> Love love loooooooove! Works great in my hair (curly) ! Def recommend</li>
            <li> Great Great! My daughter is of West Indian decent and this product is fantastic, it provides moisture without the oil like residue that the olive oil would leave in some clothing. It also really brings out the natural curls in her hair making them more defined! We will continue to groom her hair with this product for a long time to come. A small amount of this product goes a long way so it is worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought the product to use for my twist outs since it seemed like I was always left with an undesireable frizzy mess. I applied it on dry hair and then proceeded to twist. I left the twist on over night and when I woke up I unraveled them. My hair was very soft, but when I separated my hair it just became a big frizz ball. My hair was so soft that it didnt even hold the curl. I hate wasting products so I will probably use this when i wear my hair in a bun.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. It holds curs without feeling stiff. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have thick 4c hair. I put this product in and it felt great....soon dried up and flaked....then my ends started splitting something serious....threw it away after seeing other reviews of the same thing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product i have 360 waves n it leaves my hair soft n shining</li>
            <li> Gave me great curls but I got a horrible acne reaction from a single use. I have clear skin after I went minimal with body and hair products 2 years ago. The acne showed up the next day after using this for the first time on freshly washed hair worn out. I washed the product out of my hair the next day but it took me a week to clear up the acne.</li>
            <li> Good product for my coarse hair (I have 4b type hair but it has a coil to it not really a z pattern), my normally dry and brittle hair is now soft and manageable. I use it with the Johnson and Johnson no more tangles spray (to detangle ofcourse) and leave my hair alone. It worked well on my hair when it was damp but I imagine it would work ok on dry hair as well but it would just be a lot more work to coat through dry hair. The consistency of the product is creamy which I usually dont like (I prefer oils and butters) but overall I am happy.</li>
            <li> I am a wave &amp; curly junkie guy and have tried practically every product on the market. Shea Coconut Curl Smoothie actually worked pretty good in creating waves &amp; curls (once you work with it) i only gave it 2 stars because it takes way too long to absorb.  First of all it has a paste like consistency and when i tied down my hair for about a half hour my hair still had a past residue so i had to wet it some more to get it to shine and then i had to tie it back down for about another 15 minutes That takes waaaay toooo much time to get my doo together before going to work each morning.&lt;br /&gt;I think i&#x27;ll skip on Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curling pudding because it&#x27;s waaaaay to pricey and I&#x27;m afraid that it may give me HORRIBLE  results like Kinky Curly Custard  which is also waaaay pricey, smells like a sweet shoppe and once you touch your waves after they dry it turns into a bunch of white flakes!....&lt;br /&gt;Update Bioinfusion has a curling pomade that does EXACTLY what I was hoping Curl Smoothie would do It goes on white &amp; pasty like Smoothie but it absorbs MUCH quicker and creates a SUPERB wave &amp; curl pattern....It smells a little Strong when applied but the smell  disappears after it  dries.  I did not see Bioinfusions Curl Pomade on Amazon to rate it  but you can find it at any Walgreens!.. Also a little goes a LOOOOOOOONG way!</li>
            <li> This stuff caused me severe scalp inflammation and itching. Including the Shampoo and Conditioner. Find something else. You have been warned!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. My daughter is 3 and she has mixed hair, very curly!! I have tried so many different natural products and methods, but this one did it for me. After washing her hair, I combed her hair out and put some in her hair while scrunching the curls. Her hair was absolutely gorg and the curls were so perfect.  Her hair was not hard at all, the curls were defined and soft! But I would order this online from Walgreans. If you order I think 25 plus, you get free shipping. They are only 9.99 and they go on sale sometimes for 7.99. That&#x27;s how much I bought them for. I buy the whole line, shampoo, conditioner and body wash!!</li>
            <li> Update (10/3/2015): My recipe (below) is for short hair (e.g. no longer than 2 inches). My hair is now 9 inches long and I have a completely different hair recipe (e.g. different products).   I&#x27;ve had a perm on my hair for 36 years. I thought my real hair was nappy, unruly, dry, frizzy, and unmanageable. But, my hair started thinning and I decided to get a BC.  After the chop, my hair was dull, dry, had no pattern of curls. But, I washed my hair with Design Essentials Organic Cleanse Deep Cleansing Shampoo and Moisture Retention Conditioning Shampoo, and conditioned it with Stimulations Moisturizing Creme. Then, I applied Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner (about 50 cent piece worth). Right afterwards, I evenly distributed two 50 cent pieces worth of Shea Moisturizer Smoothie. I rubbed it between my hands and smoothed it from the front of my hair line to the back. Then, I massaged it in. Afterwards, I smoothed it back with my hands and let it air dry. Within seconds, my curls became more defined as it dried. For the first 5 minutes, my hair had a light layer of white coating. BUT, my hair drank it up. So, within those 5 minutes, the white coating was gone.  My hair is ROCKIN!! I NEVER EVER EVER thought I could have curly hair. I didn&#x27;t think it was possible.  My hair regimen includes, spraying on a light amount of Roots of Nature, Mango Oil &amp; Cupuacu Butter, Curl Reviving Spray and then applying Shea Moisturizer. Then, I take my fingers and massage my hair in a circular fasion and then let it dry. I do not brush or comb it. If I don&#x27;t use Shea Moisturizer my hair looks like a rug. It will not go into curls/coils.  This product is not a gel or holding formula. It is a thick moisturizer, that makes your hair shrink into curls. It drys lightly firm, with a good sheen.  I DEFINITELY recommend people with dry, dull, hard to curl hair use this. I am amazed at how my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I almost bought this product again because of the rave reviews on youtube. But it looked familiar and so I asked my daughter if we had already tried it. She said, \\&quot;yes, remember it ruined my hair.\\&quot; It just layed on her hair and left residue all over and left in sticky clumps. I thought mayebe she used to much, so we did a small section with less and it was the same thing. I read in another review that some hair has a protein issue that makes this product unsuitable. One star because it was a terrible product for us.</li>
            <li> My hair is a tight kinky curly hair grade without a lot of the kinky. Being mixed my hair has both a fine texture but tighter curls. Most of the time products do not really bother me if they are a little thick or heavy but this product was worth none of my money. It feels like putting honey in your hair-but honey does a better job. I would not recommend this product or brand. Grainier Fruits at the drug store is better if it is a real emergency.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Target. I really thought I was going to enjoy using it after reading other reviews on different sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- This product smells good&lt;br /&gt;- No bad chemicals&lt;br /&gt;- fair trade&lt;br /&gt;- cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;- organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- For ME this product made my hair feel sticky (I have wavy lower back length hair so even though it says to use a dime-sized amount, I used a nickle-sized amount.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what letter/number my hair is. I always thought I had thick hair but I&#x27;ve had a hair dresser tell me my hair is thin so... I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WON&#x27;T be re-purchasing this product. Maybe I&#x27;ll try it as a moisturizing rinse or I&#x27;ll probably just give it to my Mom or sister.</li>
            <li> This is a great curl enhancer and holder. I have very curly hair but live in a dry climate so am always looking for something to hold the curls throughout the day. This smoothie does the job without being heavy and sticky. It only takes a little bit, so the tub will last for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! Be warned though it is marked up by over double the price you can settle for elsewhere. That is the reason for the two stars. The bright side: a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All else equal this product is a 5 star wonder! I thought this product would be too heavy for my soft, thick wavy brunette long hair, but wrong I was! It truly enhances the curl, which is something worth mentioning as my locks go straight, curly and every other look within that spectrum. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I fell in love with a curl-enhancing product, if ever.  I don&#x27;t recommend using with wet or damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: part of the profits go to a philanthropic cause!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the CVS recently and only came here to read the reviews and recommend it to a colleague. I am a white latina with wavy thin hair. I like to use my hair natural wavy (not style it straight) because of my thin hair and with this cream I only apply it in the morning after my shower and it does its magic on its own. I don&#x27;t have to apply anything else. With other creams my hair would look dull after it dried up, but with this one it still looks fine, wet and shiny. I apply some argan oil after lunchtime and after going to the gym to revive it a bit, but it really doesn&#x27;t need much more. And it smells so good! I saw the leave in conditioner at the CVS today too since I&#x27;m a swimmer and I&#x27;m always looking for new products to take care of my hair. I might give a try to that one too soon.</li>
            <li> There are 3 heads of curly hair in our house so we use A LOT of product.  This is the only thing that leaves me frizzless!  I like to use this with it&#x27;s a 10 spray.  Great product for curles!  Leaves them soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local store as an alternative to the more expensive alternative, which I have also tried. I must say that I have been pleased with the results of this products and it provides moisture and curl definition to my hair. It does not leave my hair hard at all. A little goes a long way as well. This product is a must have for those looking for a moisturizer and curl defining creme that does not make the hair hard and does not burn a hole in your wallet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to 3 years. I shaved my hair 3 years ago to start my natural journey. I found this product at target and decided to try mainly because of the ingredients. Seriously this is THE best hair product that I have ever invested in. I really cant go without it. My hair at this point is probably about a 3b-4a hair type. I believe this product is responsible for how awesome my hair looks. I get compliments all the time on my natural hair. I was worried what my natural hair  would look as it grew. But this product was a life saver. Why? because it is the best moisturizer ever. It leaves your hair really soft and hydrated. This is what my hair needs in order to achieve its max curl.I would not say that this product \\&quot;curls\\&quot; your hair. But with continued use your hair will be healthy enough to form an awesome curl patterns. Its really good for twistouts,super soft but well defined. I also refresh with this too. I would not over use because of the amount of silk protien in this product. Every other day will do you just fine. Really this product, shea butter and olive oil is all I really use on my hair. Also keep in mind this product is concentrated. So a little goes a long way. So if you have dry hair like me this is product for you. No regrets!</li>
            <li> I really had high expectations of this product...I felt like owning this would be something of a rite of passage along my natural hair journey, but alas, I&#x27;m shocked that this simply did not work!  Actually, I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash this stuff out of my hair!  It produced a nasty build up that I could actually see...after I rubbed this in, it looked like there was dirt in my hair.  I&#x27;m going to pass this on to my daughter.  Hopefully, it works for her so I wouldn&#x27;t have completely wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Awesomeness. I love this product. IT NEVER DISAPPOINTS!! It keeps your hair moisturized for DAYS.</li>
            <li> This product is not a hold for curls. However, it is wonderful as a moisturizer. I have natural  4C hair, and I love this stuff. After I wash or co-wash, I spray my hair with  my leave-in mixture, then apply this curl smoothie and it works great and smells wonderful. I use it sparingly, so it has lasted over two months.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite moisturizer. It makes my hair feel so healthy and soft. I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage just after one use and that&#x27;s a big deal for me because I&#x27;m trying to grow out my hair. I got it for a lit cheaper at my local walgreens store though. Only ten bucks :) Some people say that the scent is too strong but I don&#x27;t think so; I like it. There is one ingredient that isn&#x27;t natural which is caprylyl glycol. I read that it&#x27;s just used to preserve the natural ingredients in the product and won&#x27;t cause any harm to hair. I have really thick and curly texturized hair and my hair loves this stuff. Give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product for those would like to go natural, it really works on hydrating and control those frizzy curls. It also smells amazing my husband is in love with it. He to uses that product.Recommend this for anybody and even their kids with everything being all natural. Purchase and see the different.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with the volumizing shampoo and the curl conditioner. It all works wonders, the end product is beautiful natural looking frizzless hair. I just know the price this is being sold for here is too expensive target and many other stores have this along with the other Shea moisture products for 10$</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel hard.  I&#x27;m not sure it moisturizes my hair very well alone, but when mixed with oils it seems to work better.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair.  At first, I like how my hair felt moisturized after a dryer set.  But then, in the Atlanta humidity, all my curls went straight and frizzy in minutes.  I tried rolling it up again overnight, with no luck.  My hair never dried.  I haven&#x27;t had this much trouble with a hair product in decades.  It just wasn&#x27;t made for relaxed hair and humidity.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This product definitely moisturized my hair and held the formation of my natural curls perfectly.  Be conservative in using this product, it an be greasy.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning to natural hair and after reading so many great reviews and being recommended by many to try this I decided to purchase. Now I have this full jar collecting dust on my counter! The first time I tried using it I used it as a leave in. My hair reacted horribly, It left my hair dry, dry, dry DRY and super frizzy. It felt brittle to the touch. But I thought it was because I used it wrong, I thought Maybe I used too much product. So I tried to use it again as a styler the next wash day for a braid out, using only a little. Again my hair was a frizzy dry mess. There was slight hold but my hair looked and felt dry. It wasn&#x27;t smooth or soft to the touch, just dry. I really really REALLY tried to like this product but It was, sadly, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am American/Caucasian with thick, curly, and frizzy hair... more frizzy really than anything. Before purchasing this product, I was worried because it seemed like this product was mainly for African American type hair. However, it is awesome! Previously I would use cheaper brand gel or mousse, but these would always cause my hair to either be frizzy, or crunchy with a wet look. I really just needed something to get rid of the frizz and help my curls shape up and stay for the day, and this does the trick. I simply take a few scoops with my finger (very small scoops) and work it through slightly damp hair. The frizz is gone, and my hair has a nice healthy curl that stays all day. The great part is that this tub is going to last me forever, and it only cost me $10 from a local store- I&#x27;d say that is much better than buying cheapo mouse every week or so. Also, it takes me like 5 seconds to do my hair in the morning, and that is a definite win!</li>
            <li> I stopped using relaxers recently and my natural hair was becoming extremely course, my roots looked frizzy and not maintained. A friend told me about the product stating she liked to put this product on her hair when wet because it gave her nice wavy curls. Looking at how nice her look with the product I went out and brought it. I LOVE this product! I controls my roots, my hair feels moistured and the smell is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan now</li>
            <li> After having such a positive experience with Miss Jessie&#x27;s Buttercream, I thought I&#x27;d try this due to it being much cheaper in price and this product contains more \\&quot;natural ingredients\\&quot;. Welp... I&#x27;ll be going back to Miss Jessie&#x27;s because this product left a build-up of white flakes... I guess similar to dandruff or something. I returned it ASAP. I&#x27;m not sure why I had this issue.. I washed and conditioned my hair before applying, so I know it can&#x27;t be anything else. Anyway... unless you&#x27;re going for that \\&quot;dandruff look\\&quot;... I&#x27;d stay away.</li>
            <li> Amazing! was skeptical but it works great. I have very soft curls that have been limp and non existant for awhile but  this defined them and had a light hold which for me kill 2 birds with  stone. don&#x27;t need gel or hairspray and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy  or crunchy. Brush my hair after the shower, twisht and drain the water out - towel soak a little then briskly apply a SMALL amount to my ends, raking it in but not coating my hair with it. within 5 min my curls had returned !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! limp waves back to my curly spirals. LOVE IT . Also don&#x27;t bother buying off AMAzon and pay shipping. Target and walgreens carry this product. Target ran out but on the walgreens website u can find out what nearest walgreens has it. Got the smoothie and the mousse for the price of just the smoothie on amazon &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this!  I use this all the time after washing my hair to add some moisture to my hair before twisting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also shake up a little curl enhancing smoothie with some aloe, olive oil, and water in a spray bottle and use it as a hair moisturizing spray in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product. I am new to the natural hair biz (3b almost shoulder length hair) and am still trying to find the right potion of products for keeping my hair moisturized and healthy. This product is great though, it really gets those curls going. I just think i need a better leave-in conditioner than what I am using now (Garnier Fructis Leave-In Conditioning Creme) to help provide more moisture as it can make my hair kind of crunchy as it dries through out the day. But I have no doubt that it will work even better once I get the right conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it states with friendly natural hair ingredients. I am following the Curly Girl Method (CGM)I co wash with As I Am, I use 2 conditioners which are CGM compatible. I then add a little coconut or apricot oil to my wet hair, then I spritz Shea moisture volumizing spray and finally I finger comb in  a little bit of a very light gel.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walgreens...there it cost only $9.99&lt;br /&gt;its excellent for those who want to go natural. It helps define&lt;br /&gt;your natural curls. also a good moisturizer. I just ordered the volumizing&lt;br /&gt;conditioner and thickening shampoo...also the hold&amp;shine moisture mist.&lt;br /&gt;Just got it today so I have not used it yet. I odered them from Walgreens&lt;br /&gt;website. Each was $9.99!!!!:)</li>
            <li> This product is great as a moisturizer or a mix in my deep conditioner and smells great. It down not curl my 4C coarse texure hair though but otherwise i still like the product. I can use for other things.</li>
            <li> Not for europien curly hair.</li>
            <li> I started using this two years ago. This product never fails me!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! When used as a leave in conditioner, it made my hair smell amazing, kept frizz at minimum, and defined my curls and made them shiny without making them hard or crunchy. Its made with natural ingredients and it works better than any chemical based products i&#x27;v tried and keeps your hair nice and moisturized. Would definitely recommend to anyone with thick, curly hair!</li>
            <li> I am updating my review because I figured out how best to use this product on my 4c hair. I previously gave it four stars but it is definitely five star worthy. I was having hard hair issues when my hair air dried. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to soften it. So, I used a little of this on my finger tips while two strand twisting my partially dried hair. My hair became completely soft. And the style was smooth and sleek. I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my daughter&#x27;s finer 4b hair and her curls were very pronounced and soft. Her dry hair issues subsided really quickly. I buy it at Walgreens or Target for a really good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend it for loose curls and wave patterns but not really for kinky, coarse hair unless you are using it specifically as a styling balm. Also, I like to mix my own pomades and leave-in using shea butter. I have found that this smoothie helps keep the oils and moisturizers held together in my mixes. Plus, it smells great and gets rid of the strong shea butter smell. Did I say that I love this stuff? It is just great for styling, softening, sealing, moisturizing, and overall hair health.</li>
            <li> I am not in love but I can appreciate this product. The natural hair community raves about this product so much that i felt that i had to try it, even though it cost $17. I live in the Caribbean and it is not sold in my country, so i had no choice to order it. This product smells really nice, it is thick and moisturizes my hair. However i found a similar product locally which is the Cantu Coconut Curling Creme, which is cheaper, it smells exceptionally good, moisturizes and curls my hair.</li>
            <li> Again, great product.  Arrived in new condition.  Does wonders with my hair as expected.  I have recommended this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Okay, I love Shea moisture products, I use the Curl Enhancing smoothie, along with the Shea Moisture curl souffle and these products keep my hair moist all day and makes my curls pop. I also tried the Deep Masque conditioner and the curl souffle together and they kept my hair moist and curly all day too.. Remember a little goes a long way with these products, you will not have to use that much.</li>
            <li> I actually like it but in all honesty if you use way too much it can become hard on your hair. I love all of shea moisture products, they&#x27;re just pricey but its worth it</li>
            <li> I wish i did not even have to give the one star, but that&#x27;s the only way i could apply to what i want to write.. I never got the item and my damn money is gone and the suppler wont even respond to my msgs.</li>
            <li> I use this product after co-washing and apply smoothie to soaking wet hair. I then apply Taliah Waajid Curl Sealer and sit under dryer for 10 mins and I&#x27;m done. My curls come out nice and it works for me. I have tried many products and these are the only two that work for me so far.</li>
            <li> I tried this one time and have not used it since. I would like to try it again, but it was so thick and heavy like putting glue on my hair that I dont have the patience to deal with it.lol However, the positive side is that it truly moisturized my 2c/3b afro american hair and held my wavy pattern. I will probably use this in the near future, but for now i will look for something that gives moisture without all the mess.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS VERY GOOD ON DRY HAIR BUT IT DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAIR, THE SMELL IS NICE AND IT IT IS VERY CREAMY. I LIKE IT I USE AFTER A CO-WASH USING THE SHEA MOISTURE LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER. I LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and unruly hair, the Curl Enhancing Smoothie  left my hair perfectly moisturized and manageable.  My only question is: Why in the world are people paying $18.95 for a 12 oz when it&#x27;s available at Target for $9.99? (Walgreens and Walmart carry it as well)</li>
            <li> I had originally bought this product for my daughter, who has thick curly hair. As soon as I applied it to her hair, I noticed her curls instantly became moisturized and less frizzy. I&#x27;m a fan of the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: I&#x27;m not sure why Amazon has a price listed as $21.99. I bought it at Target for $9.99.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used in a very long time. I have very thick, curly hair. Because it was made for women in Africa and I am not, I took a chance with this although had bought the coconut spray and loved it. The reviews recommended using just a little and I took the advice. I rub it between my hands and crunch it on my hair. It has a wonderful effect on my hair and I can dry it or let it air dry. Smells wonderful and has a nice texture with lots of moisture. Excellent product. Because I use just a little, I am guessing it will last a while so it is a very good value for the money. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am not able to fully rate this product.  Haven&#x27;t had a chance to fully use.  Upon completion of the product, I will come back and rate it.  I went off someone&#x27;s recommendation of the product to make this purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dry lately so this is exactly what I need.  It has just the right amount of oil and moisture to make my hair feel healthy again.  It&#x27;s the perfect compliment to my nightly regimen and my styling regimen.  The most important thing is that it&#x27;s wheat, corn, and soy free.  I have major allergies and have had to replace almost all of my products.  So it&#x27;s nice to find a good one that works for my hair and won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> All my life I searched for a descent hair product. I finally found it with Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie. Now my curls pop instead of just a big ball of frizz on top of my head. Also, my hair is softer and silkier to the touch. This is an excellent product. My hair is naturally a mess of thick kinky frizzy tight curls. Now those curls are more defined and much smoother. I highly recommend this product applied to wet hair.  Work it through the hair. I usually then use a big comb to get knots out. It is also great if I don&#x27;t have time to do all that to just pull my curls out a bit on my dry high hair for a bit of a messier natural look.</li>
            <li> I use this product on and off but always find myself going back to it. The marketing for this product seems so off. I first tried it as a deep conditioner and it&#x27;s useless. Used it as a styler by itself in my wash n gos and my hair did not last. Used it as a styler for my twist outs and it was my favorite way of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I used it as my moisturizer for my wash n gos before using kinky curly curling custard and this is now my holy grail product. KCCC gives the best definition and hold but my hair always felt to hard. The curl enhancing smoothie underneath it is golden! Lasting moisture and softness and it&#x27;s a great wash n go refresher with a spritz of water and some of this smoothed on top. Use it as a moisturizer for your wash n gos and you&#x27;ll fall in love too.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair creme ever to preserve permanents.  My curl lasts way beyond the usual 2 to 3 months.  I&#x27;ve told my hair stylist about it too</li>
            <li> I GET IT ON TIMES GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE I REALLY LOVE IT, GOOD PERFOMANCE, EXCELLENT JOB , SEE YOU NEXT TIMES OK BYE</li>
            <li> My husband uses the SM Coconut and Hibiscus shampoo and conditioner and loves them.  They have done wonders for his coarse, curly, long hair.  He uses this smoothie product to enhance and define his curls.  It takes only a tiny bit to give the curls shape and bounce.  He sometimes uses the smoothie with the styling milk, especially if it&#x27;s a really humid day.  They both fight frizz really well and keep his hair soft and silky.  I would recommend this product for anyone with curly hair who&#x27;s struggling with dryness and frizz or are simply trying to get their wayward hair under control.  The shampoo and conditioner really help, of course, and the styling products are simply the icing on the cake.  Moreover, SM products smell really good and are sulfate, paraben and cruelty free.  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I just started using this. I&#x27;ve tried many curl creams. If you figure out the right amount it is really effective. My curls are soft and my hair is less dry. I will say I think all curly products depend on the combinations and amounts you use. I use this with deva one condition. For curly  girls you all know each day is different with our hair and you have to keep experimenting</li>
            <li> So this is 15.99 when its only like 11.99 at Target...C&#x27;mon Amazon...Besides that I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I am a natural 4b girl and this stuff has been great.  The smell is wonderful and I feel like I get great shine and curl definition. I normally put this in right after a co-wash and then, add a pure shea butter pending on the style I&#x27;m going to work that day.  If I&#x27;m not doing twists or anything special, I just leave it with this and a spray of water and a natural oil for the day.  I love that it&#x27;s cheap, you get a lot of it, and it has all natural ingredients.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> OMG!!  I love the Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Hold Smoothie - 12 oz.  Fantastic scent, perfect weight, adds the right amount of shine and just really works.  Light enough to use multiple times a day if necessary.</li>
            <li> I wish it would add curls to my hair but due to the fact scurls I added didn&#x27;t come out right and straightened my hair instead it doesn&#x27;t really put too much curls in my hair but it does keep hair very moist and soft. Also I love this product because of the presentation of the bottle and the fact that it has silk proteins to add strength to hair.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product because of the price (i bought it at a store and it was very reasonable) but it left a coating on my hair that had it looking very dull and dry, and it felt like something was on my hair. it smelled nice and looked lucious in the jar, but it didn&#x27;t help my hair, maybe 4b or c type, i don&#x27;t know. but i gave it to somebody because i didn&#x27;t want it to waste. try it, it might work for you.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I am a recent &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; and I have tried a few products. This has been the only product that has moisturized and held my curls well. My hair is soft and not frizzy all day long. The cream is thicker than other products that I have used so it gives my curls and twists some weight, and works great for my 4b hair. I mix it with the Shea Moisturizer Leave-in conditioner when twisting. It actually does curl define, and hold. A little goes a long way.  I love the strong coconut, tropical smell. I won&#x27;t be trying any other products. My search is complete! I highly recommend this product, especially for 4b/c textures. This product is half the cost at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this. I always am on the look out for good hair products for my relaxed hair, which is coarse and does not like relaxers.  Also, for my daughter&#x27;s thick natural (but soft at the roots) hair. And I avoid products with mineral oil, petrolatum etc. etc. After reading the reviews, I thought I found a winner. No! Ick! This thing is so sickeningly sweet, I could not bear to use it much. It has a creamy, thick consistency. The packaging is good.  When I did use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair, it left a film/ residue that I did not like. I even tried a bit in my son&#x27;s hair since his hair is more curly than his sister&#x27;s.  But it was too sweet smelling and thick and I felt I was doing the poor child an injustice!  If I use this in my hair, it would compete with my  perfume (a big no no!). I am sensitive to some scents and this is one of those scents my nose cannot stand. It remains there, on my dresser..hidden away and forgotten. I may give it away to a friend. I do not recommend and I definitely will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing cream and it smells like pineapples and coconut! :P A little goes along way and it holds its moisture for a couple days!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT STYLING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. 3c-4a hair and it leaves my curls defined and moisturized NOT crunchy or greasy. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot so it lasts a while too. This is a must have, it replaced my Redken Curl Boucle and the Carol&#x27;s Daughter curl milk that i used to use, both of which had downsides (Redken: products that weren&#x27;t so bueno; Carol&#x27;s daughter: left my hair looking and feeling a little greasy).</li>
            <li> Calms my frizzy damaged hair and turns it into silky smooth waves and loose curls</li>
            <li> l was skeptical about trying this, even though the reviews were good. Everything I tried either weighed my hair down, made it crunchy, was too greasy, not enough moisture OR just didn&#x27;t work period. This stuff is amazing &amp; smells really good! Great ingredients and it really holds the moisture in your hair, and is never sticky. If that happens, you used too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mixed, natural 5 yrs and have 3 different textures in my hair...3c, 4b, 4a. It&#x27;s also very thick. I have a very difficult time finding hair products that work for me. I section my hair, apply a dime size amount to each section, concentrating on the ends. Then I seal it with virgin coconut oil. Tie my hair up and go to bed. In the morning, my hair is shiny....manageable, healthy and well hydrated. It hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was a kid. I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my hair curly and I don&#x27;t use it for that reason. I use it as a hair dressing cream and it makes twist outs so beautiful. For something so affordable, it puts the more expensive products to shame.  This may not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth it to try. I hope they never stop making it. The sulfate free shampoo is fantastic as well. My ends aren&#x27;t dry any more and no more breakage. My hair has grown 5 inches, since I started using Shea Moisture curl enhancing smoothie--two months ago. You don&#x27;t need a lot of products, just a couple that your hair really loves. Keep it simple! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells great while taming frizz. This product also doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy at all, so that&#x27;s a plus too. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST THING FOR MY CURLS, IT GIVES ME FABULOUS, MOISTURIZE AND SHINY CURLS DAY AFTER DAY. I LOVE THE FRAGANCE</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for African American women who are going natural/are natural. The product smells heavenly and the texture is very smooth. The product does everything that it is supposed to and it isn&#x27;t harsh on your hair! I give this 10 stars!</li>
            <li> Great product, but no need to buy it on Amazon when you can get it at Target for $9.99.  It&#x27;s light, smooth, not greasy and works well on my two strand twist out.  check it out for yourself.</li>
            <li> Love love love !! Defines my curls ! Very great smelling product that actually works!! I&#x27;m In love so all my natural sister buy this product !</li>
            <li> Makes your hair pretty oily, a little goes a long way, smells amazing though</li>
            <li> Great product. It is $12.99 in stores everywhere!</li>
            <li> Be careful with this brand, even though they state they are natural and contains no glycols. This product does contain glycols which they try to hide in the ingredient list by listing it with natural components. Please look carefully at the ingredients and make sure you are not spending more money for this product which doesn&#x27;t contain all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product let my hair roasted, hard and ripped, when I was washing the hair in the shower the hair fallen down.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Hey ladies!!! My hair absolutely loves LOVES LOVESSSSS this shampoo.  It literally feels like my hair drinks it up and it keeps my hair moisturuzed and full.  I have no complaints. Great products.  Hear me rave about this and some other shea moisture products i purchased on my youtube beauty channel search me on youtube @diamondrosaaye&lt;br /&gt;Make sure u guys subscribe too ! Ive got lots to talk about in hair and beauty!(: come get to know me (: !</li>
            <li> Nice but be careful and don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> One of my staple products since I big chopped four years ago and it still has a place on my shelf.  This product provides needed moisture to dry hair and allows curls to clump nicely.</li>
            <li> Incredible quality! Ingredients better than similar products.</li>
            <li> i recommend this for people like me, with coarse and frizzy hair. smells good, very moisturizing, and a little goes a long way because it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> Good product but hella sticky and smells like pinã colada</li>
            <li> I love it, and the smell is great.  I use this after a wash on my two strand twists.</li>
            <li> This product is a Godsend! I&#x27;ve been searching for a styling product that will not only give me curl definition but also control frizz. The Curl Enhancing Smoothie does both for my 3a/3b hair. I actually use it for 2nd &amp; 3rd day hair styling. On days when I wash my hair, I use the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Milk followed by Kinky Curly Curling Custard.    [[ASIN:B00449Q6I8 Kinky Curly Curl Custard Gel, 8 oz]].   On the 2nd day, I wet my hair down, then scrunch the Smoothie into my curls, then style as usual. I only need a small amount, a little goes a long way.  I love the definition it gives my curls without the crunchiness left behind by gels. And it smells wonderful! My hair is soft, smooth &amp; not weighed down at all. It&#x27;s also great for taming individual frizzies. Just moisten the curl with a little bit of water, then smooth a tiny amount of the smoothie down the hair shaft. Twist or spiral the curl, then let dry.</li>
            <li> It works alright! I like that it can be used on dry hair but i don&#x27;t like the smell or texture</li>
            <li> My daughter has really curly hair.  She loves to wear it long but we were having trouble finding a product that would enhance her curls and not look frizzy.  We are very impressed with Shea Moisture because this product gives her bouncy curls from the top to the bottom with no frizz.</li>
            <li> This is a good product overall. It give great moisture, good curl definition, and I like the fact that it is organic and completely made of natural ingredients. My only complaint with this product is that there is a LOT of shrinkage which I can&#x27;t stand and it does make your hair greasy if you put too much in your hair so I use it with a light hand (about a dime size). A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a thicker version of the curl milk, I would suggest using it if you are lacking extreme moisture in your hair, but using the curl milk first.</li>
            <li> This product softens curls for me but it doesn&#x27;t stretch them. It smells great. I also use it when I roller set my hair. It works well.</li>
            <li> No other curly product compares! i love it so much, it defines my curls, makes my hair super soft and shiny and smells heavenly</li>
            <li> This works great on my thick curly white girl hair.</li>
            <li> This product is $10 at your local Target.  Nonetheless, I love it...Great moisturizer, great smell, great texture, great for twisting, etc!  I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other produce! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Can I rave about how much I absolutely love this product for a little bit?! I LOVE IT and so does my hair. I recently did the big chop after transitioning for a year and this product has been a staple in my twists and wash n go&#x27;s. The smell is absolutely wonderful and not overpowering at all. What I love the most is that it is truly moisturizing for my dry hair, and gives great hold, especially when I just wash my hair and leave. My hair dries and holds in perfect little coils and curls for a bout 4 days before they turn to frizz. For extra hold I apply this under eco styler gel. In the morning, I spritz my hair with some water and lightly apply this to my hair to revive the curls. This also works well for blow drying hair, one week I decided to straighten my hair so I applied this with a heat protectant before blow drying and my hair was very soft and moisturized. Next on the list is using this as a deep conditioner. As you can see it has multiple uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cherry on the sundae is the great ingredients this product has, no parabens, no cones, no sulfates. It has shea butter, coconut oil and neem oil, all great things for our hair. Highly recommended. Oh and please don&#x27;t pay $20 for this, you can pick it up for $9.99 at target, walgreens and other retailers (they also have BOGO deals as well)</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure how well I like this product yet.  I was excited to try as I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product but when I tried it my scalp itched like crazy! I know it was the smoothie because it is the only new thing that I have put in my hair over the past few days and I just washed my hair 2 days ago and all was fine until I put this smoothie in my hair.  I have 4a type hair and usually co-wash once a week and I&#x27;ve never experienced an itchy scalp issue like this, it was so bad that I had to wash my hair again and it&#x27;s only day 3!  I was wondering if maybe I&#x27;m allergic to something in it (some suggested the coconut) but I&#x27;ve used coconut oil and have never had any problems.  However, I&#x27;ve been reading some other reviews and some say that it should NOT go on the scalp only on the hair so it may be my fault that I&#x27;ve had this type of reaction.  Also, one of my girlfriends also said she experienced the same thing when she applied to her scalp but not when she applied to just her hair so I&#x27;m going to try it again and apply to my hair only and see how that works...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE NOTE: I found this at Duane Reade for $11...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;Tried this product again and did NOT apply to scalp just hair midway down to ends and I did not experience any itchiness.  I still think the product is just okay not great so I will keep and use it till it&#x27;s gone but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase again...</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. It smeels wonderful. Thick and creamy. Lasts for a long time. A little bit goes a long way. I find that when i finger comb it through small sections of my hair it defines my hair even more. Curl enhancing smoothie is definently one of my staples. I use it for my twist and braid outs. I also put it on after i apply my Giovanni leave-in conditioner and this also defines my curls. Usually i cringe at products that are ten or more but its worth it. Can&#x27;t wait to go out and try more of Shea Moistures products. :)</li>
            <li> I have natural, thick, 4b hair and thought this product would work well. I was sorely disappointed! The product smells good, but it made my hair look dull, didn&#x27;t enhance the curl, and my hair felt a little dry. I gave it a 2 becauseof the nice smell, but as for styling properties and the price, it only rates a 1.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my hair. It just sat on top of it and did not penetrate my hair follicles. I tried quite a few different techniques to make it work before I threw in the towel but no matter how bad I wanted it to work, it did not. Sigh...the trial and error search still continues....</li>
            <li> Probably going to buy this stuff as long as they make it.  It really helped bring out the natural curl in my hair, and it holds without making it look 80s crunchy.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be too heavy, greasy, and nothing that I expected! I don&#x27;t know what else to say here :(</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t figured out the full potential of it yet but so far it&#x27;s great. May need to purchase something else to accompany it.</li>
            <li> I like this Shea Moisture hair product. This smoothie really tamed my frizzy hair. It&#x27;s got good hold and yet leaves my hair soft. The only issue I have with it is the strong scent of coconut. Too sweet and too strong! I will use it as a mask and then wash it off, but I won&#x27;t leave it on as I usually do with other hair products, just because of the smell. Oh, by the way, I got it at Walgreens for $8.99!</li>
            <li> I love its smell and for styling it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  You only have to use a small amount.  I would say a quarter coin would be the amount to use.  I have long thick hair, 5 inches below my shoulders and that is all I need.  It has a delicate scent, not over powering at all.  Easy to spread out over all my hair.  You can reactivate it between shampoos with water.</li>
            <li> I use this product to assist in adding shine, reducing frizz, and adding body/life to my curls. It does not provide good hold, because that was not what this product was intended for, so for hold I use Quidad curl defining souffl&amp;eacute;, but use this product to add softness to my curls~and it works GRRRRREAT</li>
