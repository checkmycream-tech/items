            <li>darn amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>If you like very strong musk in your perfume or a more rose floral note, you probably won&#x27;t like this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great choice for daytime wear, although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for special occasions as it doesn&#x27;t have that sexy edge that makes fragrances appropriate for nights out.</li>
            <li>This was at a great price and exactly what my daughter wanted</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and came in excellent condition!!</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>glad I order this.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and although it arrived in a timely manner and boxed safely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering some more veerryy soon &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>this is a good it smells great the bottle last longer than i would think because of the size</li>
            <li>She absolutely loved it, and I have to say that it smells pretty gosh</li>
            <li>SCENT WAS VERY SWEET SMELLING</li>
            <li>Shipped safely and was packaged securely.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li>so I really cannot rate the product itself, however, arrived well packaged and in time to give to a good friend&#x27;s daughter for her Sweet 16.</li>
            <li>My sister is a huge fan of Couture Couture, so I decided for Christmas</li>
            <li>It was the real deal, smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes you buy perfume to find it is a cheap version.  </li>
            <li>Now, I can enjoy it as often as I please.</li>
            <li>thanks girls for coming up with an amazing perfume to mimic the juicy line, even though i feel this smells a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is light and full of floral notes with some citrus thrown in.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this the first time I tried it in a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also pleased that Juicy Couture offers this an Eau de Parfum since it has more staying power than than Eau de Toilette.</li>
            <li>Young people love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I have always loved Juicy Couture, and this product was no different.</li>
            <li>My roomate has always used it and whenever she puts it on I always loved the smell and finally decided that it was time to get myself one.</li>
            <li>While I couldn&#x27;t pick out the mandarin notes, the berry element to this fragrance was very evident.</li>
            <li>this is my new favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>Box the perfume came in was damaged &amp; looked very old!!!!</li>
            <li>Smells just like juicy and in fact, listen here, all you haters can be quiet because i feel this might even be better than juicy!</li>
            <li>Smell is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Would definetly recommend to anyone interesting in smelling sexy and pretty but not loud.</li>
            <li>I love Juicy couture, The only thing I had a problem with is the size of the bottle</li>
            <li>Make sure it is sprayed on clothes though so it last.</li>
            <li>do still love the perfume, but it may last a bit longer if you spray it on your clothes rather than just your wrists/neck.</li>
            <li>the scent is not too strong, fruity, sharp, sweet, and overall lovely smelling.</li>
            <li>I bought a very small sample without being able to smell the perfume, and am glad I took a chance.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not usually girly, but this perfume is fun</li>
            <li>I have purchased this perfume before from a department store and it had a much stronger scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not musky at all, which I really like.</li>
            <li>Really sucky.</li>
            <li>but i had it seems like forever because you dont have  to use much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many questions with this one as the fragrance is unlike any other I&#x27;ve smelled before.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to last the day and that make it worth the price.</li>
            <li>I noticed the floral notes, in particular the honeysuckle, but as it settled on my skin, the fruity notes took over.</li>
            <li>For my Mom, she loves it, she bought more, it is a casual, fresh youthful scent, for me not too sweet.</li>
            <li>This scent can be worn day or night, and most fragrance purists would say this is a summer scent, I wear it year round.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I initially thought because of the fruity notes that this fragrance would be most appropriate for summertime, I also have found myself wearing it quite frequently in the colder months, for the simple fact that it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and modern, without being too heavy on the floral.</li>
            <li>but, it is the same except for the high price.</li>

            <li> Will buy it again hands down again in a bigger size &amp; tell friends</li>
            <li> Small, not to expensive I guess, and fit in the stocking, plus the wife likes it and its for her...</li>
            <li> OTHER SCENTS HAVE IT BEAT.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too heavy, lasts long without being overbearing, and people around me usually compliment me on it...</li>
            <li> It lasted me less then probably 10 days.</li>
            <li> As for the amber and sandalwood, I didn&#x27;t notice them at all, but I did pick up on the slight candy finish of vanilla and caramel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that I can go without reapplying for about 4-5 hours whereas with EDT formulations typically give me 3 hours at the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I bought it and the store stuff must be a little bit stronger because it stays longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at this low price this could be real</li>
            <li> So Left me a lil&#x27; questionable about the product.</li>
            <li> One of the very few fragrances that works with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> This was way to expensive for something that was so small.</li>
            <li> you could probably pull off this scent in both a casual or fancy situation.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the size for the amount paid, will shop else</li>

            <li> Nice smelling perfume. Purchased as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this perfume before from a department store and it had a much stronger scent. While it does smell like the actual perfume, it does seem to have been diluted quite a bit. Also, the bottle was wet on the outside when I received it. I&#x27;ll stick to buying perfume at the department store.</li>

            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loved it</li>

I&#x27;ve wanted Juicy for a while, glad I order this. Now, I can enjoy it as often as I please. Thank you for the low price!!!</li>

            <li> Great product.. Arrived in timely manner</li>
            <li> My sister is a huge fan of Couture Couture, so I decided for Christmas I&#x27;d get her the viva la juicy to change it up a bit. She LOVES it more than couture couture!</li>
            <li> For my Mom, she loves it, she bought more, it is a casual, fresh youthful scent, for me not too sweet.</li>

            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom. She was very pleased! My dad had wanted her to wear this scent after he smelled it on a lady at his work. The gift made them both very happy :)</li>
            <li> When I initially sprayed on Viva La Juicy I noticed the floral notes, in particular the honeysuckle, but as it settled on my skin, the fruity notes took over. While I couldn&#x27;t pick out the mandarin notes, the berry element to this fragrance was very evident. As for the amber and sandalwood, I didn&#x27;t notice them at all, but I did pick up on the slight candy finish of vanilla and caramel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I initially thought because of the fruity notes that this fragrance would be most appropriate for summertime, I also have found myself wearing it quite frequently in the colder months, for the simple fact that it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I have found that some of the fragrances I used to wear that were heavier on the patchouli and sandalwood don&#x27;t work as well for me anymore since they give me headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also pleased that Juicy Couture offers this an Eau de Parfum since it has more staying power than than Eau de Toilette. I find that I can go without reapplying for about 4-5 hours whereas with EDT formulations typically give me 3 hours at the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really am happy that my husband selected this one. It&#x27;s fresh and modern, without being too heavy on the floral. It&#x27;s a great choice for daytime wear, although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for special occasions as it doesn&#x27;t have that sexy edge that makes fragrances appropriate for nights out.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a christmas gift, and i guess it gets alot of rave reviews! Young people love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great travel size of my favorite perfume. I ordered a bigger perfume before, so then I have one for home and one for travel.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!! My roomate has always used it and whenever she puts it on I always loved the smell and finally decided that it was time to get myself one. I do not wear perfume a lot so I got the .5 oz size and it is perfect for me. I just wear it when I go out to eat or to a party or on days I feel like I want to smell good. Love it and will be definitley buying more!! Shipping was super fast and came in excellent condition!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!!! Everytime I wear it I get compliments! Isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering. Thank goodness. I recommend it 100%.</li>
