            <li>I just received this root lift in the mail and tried to use it, absolutely ZERO product came out!</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have found that does not weigh now my hair.  </li>

            <li>This is a nice rootlift spray for my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>Have tried many other products, but always return to this.  </li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product for fine, thin hair that is lacking in body.  </li>
            <li>Wont live without this!</li>
            <li>Great on dry hair to give an extra lift, uses low dryer settings to get nice results without heated rollers that ten to be hard on your head and hair.  </li>

            <li>I love this root lifter because I only need a little and it makes my hair look and feel thicker</li>
            <li>I had the same thing happen with the mousse whip when the product was still half full, and had to throw it away!</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair with lots of cowlicks and it lies flat on my head making it look like I&#x27;m missing part of my skull!  </li>
            <li>I used it twice and found my hair lifted for a short time,then it went flat and was very silky,unmanageable!</li>
            <li>Not too stiff and really works!  </li>

            <li> I use a lot of gold well products, but I&#x27;m completely disappointed and irritated with these nozzle bottles, and the mousse as well! This is the second product that&#x27;s giving me issues with the nozzle! I just received this root lift in the mail and tried to use it, absolutely ZERO product came out! it foams a bit at the tip but it doesn&#x27;t spray! Is there something I&#x27;m missing or are other people having the same issues with their bottles? I had the same thing happen with the mousse whip when the product was still half full, and had to throw it away! Such a waste of money. I tried the whole running nozzle under hot water, and removing the top and running the little straw under hot water, nothing worked! Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it. Ugh :(</li>
