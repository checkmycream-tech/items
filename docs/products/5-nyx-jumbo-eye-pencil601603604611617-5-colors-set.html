            <li>love t love it love it love, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many Jumbo Eye Pencils, one thing I&#x27;ve noticed about these, is they need an eye primer.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>there is a seller on here that sells authentic nyx pencils way better than this.</li>
            <li>you could not ask for better.</li>
            <li>Love these creamy crayons.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love Nix and a</li>
            <li>I want to buy many products.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>The products seem good and shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>Pencils go on nice, work them in right away.</li>
            <li>they are easy to work with and effortless results are always guaranteed.</li>
            <li>Cheap and break off tips easily.  </li>
            <li>bright colors, long lasting, and perfect under shadows!!</li>
            <li>They go on beautifully, lost a long time and do not leave &amp;#34;crease&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>its really good for a quick morning routine before going to work, doesn&#x27;t take any time, and i dont seem to be making any of my frequent mistakes with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is so much hype surrounding these products that I thought they would be better.</li>
            <li>Came very fast as well!</li>
            <li>My new favorite eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>they are totally worth the price</li>
            <li>But they apply nicely and last.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>Definitely need a powder on top to set them.</li>
            <li>I think the Rimmel shadow sticks are of higher quality.</li>
            <li>and NYX was the choice I had with a few others but came to be my superior decision.</li>
            <li>/&gt;these 5 colors are perfect for each occasion, whether it is casual or glamorous.</li>
            <li>Way to much shimmer.</li>
            <li>i highly highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>They are ok but still crease just like other shadows do.  </li>
            <li>If you like NYX these pencils make a nice starter set then added a dark blue and purple.  </li>
            <li>great color and easy for shadow, or to use as an eye base.</li>
            <li>so they will last for a while ;)</li>
            <li>I just wished they had the complete set of colors.</li>
            <li>I like the colors so far.</li>
            <li>Awesome for a shadow base</li>
            <li>Bought them for an eye shadow base, not primer.. &amp; they work perfect for that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had the chance to use the other colours, but the white is lovely and makes a great eyeshadow base.</li>
            <li>and they still look brand new after using them daily!  </li>
            <li>they just really work well together in complementing each other if 2 are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use them more as a base to make other shadows pop more.</li>
            <li>The colors Black Bean (601) and Milk (604) are matte, while the rest are very metallic.</li>

            <li> the only problem i had is only 2 were wrapped with seal but fot the other 3 you could tell they were not tampered with in any way.</li>
            <li> the colors are not highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> only downside is that they are a little too creamy.</li>
            <li> The black one I use as eyeliner applied with a thin brush for a more subtle look.  </li>
            <li> I have tested other eye pencils that weren&#x27;t this greasy.</li>
            <li> Do you have a Jumbo Dark Brown?</li>
            <li> So useful and they can make a subtle or dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected!!!!</li>
            <li> Hard to sharpen and the color did not stay on.</li>
            <li> Very Greasy and ends up all over your under eyes... very disappointed.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> these are the colors that you need. however if you are not a nutral color lover and are more into the brights then this is not for you. they are totally worth the price</li>
            <li> Eyeliners work great! They go on easier than my regular pencil liners. Colors come out great! I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Every NYX girl must have these basic staples in her makeup collection. I just wished they had the complete set of colors. I have no complaints about these, they look and feel just like the originals and you can&#x27;t find a better price for the set.</li>
            <li> If you like NYX these pencils make a nice starter set then added a dark blue and purple.  Pencils go on nice, work them in right away.</li>
            <li> Great texture and color pay off. Definitely recommend them as bases for eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> Love NYX and love these pencil. Works as a great primer for me. Loving milk as an in corner highlight and highlight for brown bone. Lovely product Definatly buying more</li>
            <li> Awesome for a shadow base and it brings alot of product. I use all the time when creating a Smokey eye :)</li>
            <li> before buying it i went online to look for reviews. the colors are great on my skin considering im very tan. they seem more like a highlighter: they make me look &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34;. my only problem is after wearing it for a while they clump up on the my eyes&#x27; creases.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist we are always looking for a boom in eye makeup! These pencils in conjunction with eye shadow Are the best look out there! Again NYX an five star product</li>
            <li> Nothing good to say about these products. Cheap and break off tips easily.  Hard to sharpen and the color did not stay on.</li>
            <li> I like the colors so far. Wish they weren&#x27;t as greasy though. But they apply nicely and last. I use the silver every day and i haven&#x27;t had to sharpen it yet! so they will last for a while ;)</li>
            <li> The pigment of these is really good however I find that even with a primer they crease a lot. Definitely need a powder on top to set them. There is so much hype surrounding these products that I thought they would be better. I think the Rimmel shadow sticks are of higher quality.</li>
            <li> The 5 colors are beautiful.  I use the white as a concealer and highlighter.  The black one I use as eyeliner applied with a thin brush for a more subtle look.  They go on beautifully, lost a long time and do not leave &amp;#34;crease&amp;#34; lines.  I will definitely purchase again, but I have had these for a bit and they still look brand new after using them daily!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> How did i survive without these magical pencils? they have a lot of uses and i just simply love them. I will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> love t love it love it love, but what i don&#x27;t like about it that it&#x27;s expire after 6 months</li>
            <li> Way to much shimmer. My mistake probably.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many Jumbo Eye Pencils, one thing I&#x27;ve noticed about these, is they need an eye primer. They&#x27;re not as convenient as I&#x27;d like them to be, but very good color. The colors Black Bean (601) and Milk (604) are matte, while the rest are very metallic.</li>
            <li> Love all five colors!</li>
            <li> great! great color and easy for shadow, or to use as an eye base. i highly highly recommend these! the only problem i had is only 2 were wrapped with seal but fot the other 3 you could tell they were not tampered with in any way. if they get more colors i will def buy!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just as I expected!!!!</li>
            <li> Love these pencils - colors are great and they go on smoothly.  Would recommend to all.  Great product to use.</li>
            <li> I love these. They&#x27;re terrific, can use for your waterline, shadow, and or inner eyes to brighten your eyes. So useful and they can make a subtle or dramatic look. Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> These are awesome and a great price.</li>
            <li> the colors are not highly pigmented. there is a seller on here that sells authentic nyx pencils way better than this. i forget her name other wise i wouldnt have bought this.</li>
            <li> They are ok but still crease just like other shadows do.  I use them more as a base to make other shadows pop more.</li>
            <li> The products seem good and shipped really fast. My concern is that only one pencil was shipped sealed. The products didn&#x27;t look used, but why were the seals removed? I hope I don&#x27;t get an infection!!!!</li>
            <li> These are the best eye pencils ever!! you could not ask for better. bright colors, long lasting, and perfect under shadows!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE my jumbo pencils, these colors are beautiful, they came just wrapped in ubble paper, but thankfully nothing happended to them. They are easy to use and again, the colors are amazing, planning on getting more of these!</li>
            <li> My new favorite eye shadow.  Love these creamy crayons.  Like the lighter ones best.  Darker ones need blending with finger or brush.</li>
            <li> Very Greasy and ends up all over your under eyes... very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had the chance to use the other colours, but the white is lovely and makes a great eyeshadow base. You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price! Came very fast as well!</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product I did a lot of research as to who I should buy eye pencils from and NYX was the choice I had with a few others but came to be my superior decision. Why? Well, looking on YouTube for reviews and tutorials I realized that NYX has very bright and long-lasting colors with almost a majority of their make up. Thank youuuuu!</li>
            <li> I love these. they are easy to work with and effortless results are always guaranteed. its really good for a quick morning routine before going to work, doesn&#x27;t take any time, and i dont seem to be making any of my frequent mistakes with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these 5 colors are perfect for each occasion, whether it is casual or glamorous. they just really work well together in complementing each other if 2 are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only downside is that they are a little too creamy. I have tested other eye pencils that weren&#x27;t this greasy. wish these would follow.</li>
            <li> Amazing all items. I love Nix and a I want to buy many products.  Congratilation!  Do you have a Jumbo Dark Brown?</li>
            <li> Bought them for an eye shadow base, not primer.. &amp; they work perfect for that so I&#x27;m satisfied. Dont expect to use them as a base without priming your eyes first tho :)</li>
            <li> These pencils are ok, they meet the purpose until I find the best, I like to use as a highlighter as these make my already pigment shadow appear to bright</li>
