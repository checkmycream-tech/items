            <li>I&#x27;ve passed this on as a gift many a time. :)</li>
            <li>I constantly stare at my nails when I wear this! :D</li>
            <li>I use this color on my toes and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I got this for St Patrick&#x27;s Day, and have received many compliments from both friends and work customers.</li>
            <li>I love this color I think of emerald city on the wizard of oz every time I look at my nails.</li>
            <li>On top of that they are cruelty-free, which is the most important thing to me.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it and the color looks very cool.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone looking for a beautiful bright green color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly shiny and wears well, better than other China Glaze polishes I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It is the best green polish that I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>The green is the perfect shade.</li>
            <li>The glitter is very apparent on your nail, and shimmers brightly indoors and out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivered safe and fast!</li>
            <li>Really cool looking.</li>
            <li>The micro glitter in this China Glaze color, Running in Circles, is super sparkly and the color is drop dead gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Super transparent.</li>
            <li>A little darker than picture but beautiful any way</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a beautiful green color and works perfect for the irish holiday.</li>
            <li>And the color is a beautiful grassy green with a shimmer/glass</li>
            <li>I was looking for a green holo on level with the beautiful reds, blues, and purples that Opi puts out and just couldn&#x27;t find one by that brand.  </li>
            <li>The color is exactly like it looks, I was worried it might be to &amp;#34;christmas-y&amp;#34; but not at all!</li>
            <li>Looks great in the sun and wear time is about average!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, dries fast, and wears like iron.</li>
            <li>It is a great green for Christmas, and holds up well with a topcoat, never chipped or peeled on me.  </li>
            <li>If you like green polish, this is a great one to have.</li>
            <li>I wanted to order the Fresh Frog of Bel Aire from OPI</li>
            <li>This polish is bright emerald green filled with micro-glitter.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re beautifully pigmented, and this rich, vibrant green is no exception.</li>
            <li>Nice opaque coverage with only two coats and very shiny.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most gorgeous emerald green glitter, the second I applied it, it went straight to being my favorite polish.</li>
            <li>This nail color is so pretty and glittery.</li>
            <li>Would most definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li>The color is exactly how it looks in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Love It, and I am more an acid/granny smith green lover!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t fully describe it, but I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at my nails the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li>The formula is great, it&#x27;s long lasting (had it on my fingers for about 2 weeks before it started noticeably chipping).</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase from China Glaze</li>
            <li>and I will definitely make more.</li>
            <li>The perfect shade of green packed with green glitter.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t what I expected but extremely pleased nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is my monitor, but it seems a tad bit darker in real life, as opposed to how I see it on my monitor.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>It looks like this green will be nice for stamping, so</li>
            <li>Would also be nice for Christmas, or any Halloween costume or outfit involving green.</li>
            <li>Way more vibrant that I expected</li>
            <li>I have worn it several times since my purchase and the compliments are worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>unlike most green-sparkle nail polishes out there that are jst clear nail polish with green glitter, this one actually gives nice pigmentation with 1-2 coats and lasts a long time with no chipping (lasted me a week perfectly without a top or base coat)</li>
            <li>Such a pretty color!</li>
            <li>Been wanting this color when it came out in the collection for a while, and love that Amazon had it at a little bit of a discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Generally I try to stick with Opi polish, but this green was exactly what I was looking for and stunning on the nail.</li>
            <li>Beautiful shimmery green that all green fanatics should get!</li>
            <li>WOW is this one sparkley!</li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised at how pretty and rich this green is!  </li>
            <li>I got this polish based on reviews from other buyers and all I can say is they were right!</li>
            <li>Bright green with green microglitter.</li>
            <li>I recently learned China Glaze is one of the go-to polishes for nail stamping, being thick, not too-fast drying, and of a nice quality.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like this brand, not thick enough.</li>
            <li>My favorite China Glaze polish prior to trying this one was Ruby Pumps and, let me tell you, this color has the same glittery greatness, but just in green.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true shamrock green with a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this polish and can hardly wait until the summer to wear it on my toes at the beach!</li>
            <li>Running Circles is super glittery and shamrock green.</li>
            <li>very pretty SHIMMERING green.</li>
            <li>Very pretty green.  </li>
            <li>Needs clear base coat for easy removal, two coats polish, and top coat (Seche Vite).</li>
            <li>Rarely do I find a shade I do not LOVE, and they did not disappoint here.</li>

            <li> Rarely do I find a shade I do not LOVE, and they did not disappoint here.</li>
            <li> I have three other bottles of green sparkly fingernail polish sitting right next to it that do not compare.  </li>

            <li> i like that it pops compared to just a flat green.</li>
            <li> Its insane how gorgeous it is.</li>
            <li> I applied 3 thin coats at which point it was completely opaque.  </li>

            <li> This is a dark sparkly green.</li>
            <li> This green shimmer polish almost dries to a foil finish.  </li>
            <li> (if you want a brighter, cheerier green for Xmas).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the type of green that works well for any season, and the sparkle...</li>
            <li> It stands up well to chipping, which I appreciate, having a job that is tough on my nails.</li>
            <li> If you like green you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Texture isn&#x27;t too bad on the nail.</li>
            <li> but it got terrible reviews</li>

            <li> I just received my bottle of Running in Circles and it is gorgeous! Nice opaque coverage with only two coats and very shiny. I have three other bottles of green sparkly fingernail polish sitting right next to it that do not compare.  I wanted to order the Fresh Frog of Bel Aire from OPI but it got terrible reviews so I ordered this one. Glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is such a happy color of nail polish, one of my favorites now!  It also lasts for awhile on my toe nails.</li>
            <li> color is great but bottle brush is so flimsy</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and the color looks very cool. Arrived on time and in great shape.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color! Great for St Patricks Day</li>
            <li> A little darker than picture but beautiful any way</li>
            <li> This nail color is so pretty and glittery. It reminds me of a mermaid. 😊</li>
            <li> unlike most green-sparkle nail polishes out there that are jst clear nail polish with green glitter, this one actually gives nice pigmentation with 1-2 coats and lasts a long time with no chipping (lasted me a week perfectly without a top or base coat)</li>
            <li> im simply in lobe with china glaze. very pretty SHIMMERING green. i like that it pops compared to just a flat green. will prbly use this mostly around christmas.</li>
            <li> This green shimmer polish almost dries to a foil finish.  It&#x27;s incredibly shiny and wears well, better than other China Glaze polishes I have tried.  I could not stop staring when wearing this out in the sunshine.  Would be gorgeous for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Oh my, this is one heck of a nail polish! The perfect shade of green packed with green glitter. It went on opaque with 2 coats. I don&#x27;t know what else to say about this polish other than, buy it now!</li>
            <li> This is a dark sparkly green. Really cool looking. If it works well with nail stamping I&#x27;m going to use it over China Glaze&#x27;s Re-Fresh Mint for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day designs. I recently learned China Glaze is one of the go-to polishes for nail stamping, being thick, not too-fast drying, and of a nice quality. On top of that they are cruelty-free, which is the most important thing to me. If you have an issue with silk or keratin, they do use that in some of their treatments such as Seche Rebuild and China Glaze Nail Strengthener. It looks like this green will be nice for stamping, so I&#x27;ll try to remember to leave an update when I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised at how pretty and rich this green is!  Bought it for St Patrick&#x27;s day but it&#x27;s become a favorite for all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of China Glaze polishes. They&#x27;re beautifully pigmented, and this rich, vibrant green is no exception. It coats well with 2 coats, no streaking, and no visible nail line. It stands up well to chipping, which I appreciate, having a job that is tough on my nails. All in all, I&#x27;d definitely recommend! I&#x27;ve passed this on as a gift many a time. :)</li>
            <li> One of the best colors I have ever bought. Its insane how gorgeous it is. I constantly stare at my nails when I wear this! :D</li>
            <li> Awesome color!  I wore it as a french tip and received compliments everywhere I went!  Would most definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Bright green with green microglitter. Wasn&#x27;t what I expected but extremely pleased nonetheless. If you like green you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> WOW is this one sparkley! Its awesome! The color is exactly like it looks, I was worried it might be to &amp;#34;christmas-y&amp;#34; but not at all! I painted my 3 years olds and mine to match, she couldnt be happier and neither could I!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Awesome color!&lt;br /&gt;-Lots of sparkles&lt;br /&gt;-Not holiday specific&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;NONE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this nail polish! It is the best green polish that I&#x27;ve ever seen. I think it is especially good for winter time.</li>
            <li> I got this polish based on reviews from other buyers and all I can say is they were right! This color is spectacular! I have worn it several times since my purchase and the compliments are worth the purchase! I am in love with this polish and can hardly wait until the summer to wear it on my toes at the beach!</li>
            <li> This is by far the most gorgeous emerald green glitter, the second I applied it, it went straight to being my favorite polish.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my monitor, but it seems a tad bit darker in real life, as opposed to how I see it on my monitor. In any case, it is a great color with metallic-esque sparkles. Also, I like the way China Glaze polishes go on the nail.</li>
            <li> The micro glitter in this China Glaze color, Running in Circles, is super sparkly and the color is drop dead gorgeous! It goes on smoothly, dries fast, and wears like iron. I had excellent coverage with two coats of color. Perfect for the holidays!</li>
            <li> I use this color on my toes and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.  The color is exactly how it looks in the bottle.  My favorite China Glaze polish prior to trying this one was Ruby Pumps and, let me tell you, this color has the same glittery greatness, but just in green.  I can&#x27;t stop staring at my toes, especially in the sunlight.  I will definitely purchase this color again when I run out.</li>
            <li> great product.  fast shipping</li>
            <li> Been wanting this color when it came out in the collection for a while, and love that Amazon had it at a little bit of a discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivered safe and fast! And the color is a beautiful grassy green with a shimmer/glass fleck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for St. Patricks!</li>
            <li> I bought this color in hopes it would help with my nail art st patrick designs. It&#x27;s such a beautiful green color and works perfect for the irish holiday. I can&#x27;t wait for christmas because I know it will look great with China Glaze Ruby Pumps. I recommend this to anyone looking for a beautiful bright green color.</li>
            <li> Running Circles is super glittery and shamrock green. Way more vibrant that I expected and I love it.</li>
            <li> Picture matches product. Very pretty green.  It&#x27;s a true shamrock green with a hint of shimmer. It&#x27;s perfect and gets compliments</li>
            <li> Beautiful shimmery green that all green fanatics should get! It really is a beautiful color! Texture isn&#x27;t too bad on the nail. Looks great in the sun and wear time is about average! Would recommenced!</li>
            <li> This polish is simply amazing!!! I constantly look at my hands when I wear this and I get compliments  on it as well.</li>
            <li> China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish.  Rarely do I find a shade I do not LOVE, and they did not disappoint here.</li>
            <li> Cute shade for Xmas or st patty day!</li>
            <li> I got this for St Patrick&#x27;s Day, and have received many compliments from both friends and work customers. The micro-glitter makes it glow, very attractive and not little-girl at all. Would also be nice for Christmas, or any Halloween costume or outfit involving green. Needs clear base coat for easy removal, two coats polish, and top coat (Seche Vite).</li>
            <li> This polish is bright emerald green filled with micro-glitter.  The glitter is very apparent on your nail, and shimmers brightly indoors and out.  It is a great green for Christmas, and holds up well with a topcoat, never chipped or peeled on me.  I applied 3 thin coats at which point it was completely opaque.  If you like green polish, this is a great one to have.</li>
            <li> I love this color I think of emerald city on the wizard of oz every time I look at my nails.</li>
            <li> Love It, and I am more an acid/granny smith green lover!  It&#x27;s a perfect color for St. Pat&#x27; s or even Christmas (if you want a brighter, cheerier green for Xmas).  Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this brand, not thick enough. Super transparent. I prefer the finger paints brand of this color.</li>
            <li> This polish is truly amazing. It&#x27;s the type of green that works well for any season, and the sparkle...I can&#x27;t fully describe it, but I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at my nails the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent color, it&#x27;s an amazing bright green with shimmer. I get tons of compliments when I wear it. The formula is great, it&#x27;s long lasting (had it on my fingers for about 2 weeks before it started noticeably chipping). This was my first purchase from China Glaze and I will definitely make more.</li>
            <li> This polish is just a great color. The green is the perfect shade. It is also very shiny, sometimes glitter can look dull.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a green holo on level with the beautiful reds, blues, and purples that Opi puts out and just couldn&#x27;t find one by that brand.  Generally I try to stick with Opi polish, but this green was exactly what I was looking for and stunning on the nail.</li>
