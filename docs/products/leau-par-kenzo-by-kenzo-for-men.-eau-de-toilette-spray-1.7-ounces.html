            <li>Maybe a good four hours at most.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and sweet, but just so perfect on a guy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though it is aquatic, I find this one very appealing and unique.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing and clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As women love shoes, I love fragrances.  </li>
            <li>This is on the top of my favorites list.  </li>
            <li>I love when my husband wears this scent.</li>
            <li>I love the branding and packaging.</li>
            <li>This is now my go to fragrance on most occasions.</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite colugne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing this perfume for many years..</li>
            <li>love it on my husband.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this scent, it is one of those smells you want to smell over and over again...</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great price for a high quality fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a very unique smelling fragrance and light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but very rich to smell.</li>
            <li>It has a unique smell and smooth and light.  </li>
            <li>I was struck by its unique fragrance, without being over bearing or offensive.</li>
            <li>It smells misty, sensuous, and clean.</li>
            <li>It smells quite fresh however also warm and gentle.</li>
            <li>The smell on this is so fresh and clean that I can&#x27;t describe it.  </li>
            <li>this one I like for the price...and the short lasting smell lol!</li>
            <li>Similar to Aqua Di Gio, this fragrance is great smelling, yet light for sensitive noses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fresh, I wear it when I feel like a crisp cool summer evening out.</li>
            <li>I love Kenzo perfume it arrived on time and new</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good fragrance, not mind blowing or anything out of the blue.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes it cost effective as well.</li>
            <li>It is light for everyday use and very-very sexy!</li>
            <li>This is and has been my favorite cologne ever since I discovered it on an international trip in 2010.</li>
            <li>I love it, I had this graham before, and I was looking for the same</li>
            <li>also at first it made me dizzy...</li>
            <li>good alternative to this one would be PI NEO by Givenchy (will be my next buy later on) or Chrome</li>
            <li>however, it&#x27;s strength is very mild and doesn&#x27;t last through the day.</li>
            <li>Has a very Citrusy smell and you can almost taste it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This is the only place I cab find it at a reasonable price and the clean, citrus tones will make people turn heads.</li>
            <li>Since there not too many reviews about this fragrance, I thought I might as well add mine in case other people were thinking of buying this.</li>
            <li>Others that are on the top of my list and are all different are:  the original Dolce and Gabanna, Desire, Blue Jean (the blue bottle), and Armani Code.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always felt that I need a variety of different colognes to rotate and use, but I realized that I should only need to have one hand-when it has gotten more complements</li>
            <li>My only qualm is that it sometimes feels that the smell fades away quickly.</li>
            <li>I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong</li>
            <li>I just love the smell waaw and  it last for long</li>
            <li>Bleah!&lt;br /&gt;I got another edition of the perfume, not least photo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear Kenzo, I get compliments left and right.  </li>
            <li>I hardly have any cologne under 85 dollars and most of them I don&#x27;t even use much...</li>
            <li>It seems just about right for a guy in early to mid 20s.&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat citrusy, but not feminine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>L&#x27;eau Par Kenzo was given to me in 1999 (when it first came out) as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy or light.</li>
            <li>My personal taste diverts me away from heavy, musky, &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scents and leads me towards fresh, unassuming, underestimated noses.</li>
            <li>fragrance not long  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s different than what you usually get for men, it&#x27;s fresh.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As women love shoes, I love fragrances.  This is on the top of my favorites list.  Everytime I wear Kenzo, I get compliments left and right.  Others that are on the top of my list and are all different are:  the original Dolce and Gabanna, Desire, Blue Jean (the blue bottle), and Armani Code.  I think that it is great to have a variety of fragrances to fit your feeling and mood.  Kenzo is one to add to your collection.</li>
            <li> Since there not too many reviews about this fragrance, I thought I might as well add mine in case other people were thinking of buying this. This is a pretty good fragrance, not mind blowing or anything out of the blue. It&#x27;s def an aquatic fragrance and should be worn during summer/spring weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it is aquatic, I find this one very appealing and unique. Has a very Citrusy smell and you can almost taste it. Though longevity is kinda weak. Maybe a good four hours at most. I don&#x27;t think you can overspray yourself with this cologne. It&#x27;s very refreshing and clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good alternative to this one would be PI NEO by Givenchy (will be my next buy later on) or Chrome Azzaro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very unique smelling fragrance and light so I use this as my work fragrance mostly or my casual going out during the day.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;eau Par Kenzo was given to me in 1999 (when it first came out) as a Christmas present. I was struck by its unique fragrance, without being over bearing or offensive.I&#x27;ve always felt that I need a variety of different colognes to rotate and use, but I realized that I should only need to have one hand-when it has gotten more complements that all of the other colognes that I&#x27;ve used.Definitely makes it cost effective as well. Be prepared to make the ladies turn their heads in delight.</li>
            <li> Thank you.good fragrance</li>
            <li> This is and has been my favorite cologne ever since I discovered it on an international trip in 2010. It&#x27;s the only cologne I ever buy anymore.</li>
            <li> I love when my husband wears this scent. It is light for everyday use and very-very sexy! Recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> To be short and simple, this scent was one of my favorites when I was living in Japan and the Kenzo name has quality. This is the only place I cab find it at a reasonable price and the clean, citrus tones will make people turn heads. It&#x27;s light and fresh, I wear it when I feel like a crisp cool summer evening out.</li>
            <li> I love Kenzo perfume it arrived on time and new I just love the smell waaw and  it last for long</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance by a great brand. It smells misty, sensuous, and clean. It&#x27;s also a great price for a high quality fragrance. I love the branding and packaging. Everything about this fragrance is perfect. My only qualm is that it sometimes feels that the smell fades away quickly. But that could just be me getting used to the smell. Not sure. Still like it a lot. This is now my go to fragrance on most occasions.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite colugne.  It has a unique smell and smooth and light.  I always get asked \\&quot;where did you get at and what is it?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This was a gift, but I will still refer to my friends and family, because this is a good product to have.</li>
            <li> I love it, I had this graham before, and I was looking for the same so I got it great stuff</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and it fit him perfectly. It smells quite fresh however also warm and gentle. Best perfume for him ever.&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t last longer than 10 hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or light. It seems just about right for a guy in early to mid 20s.&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat citrusy, but not feminine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it by both girls and guys.&lt;br /&gt;The cap is designed like shit though. Don&#x27;t try to lift it by the cap cuz it will fall.</li>
            <li> I always look for fragances that not all men uses and this is a 5 stars. It&#x27;s light but very rich to smell. I use to go to the offices and my female comrades likes this perfume a lot. I always search for this perfume.</li>
            <li> fragrance not long  last, very bad product  no recommend, to spensible for a bat fragrance sorry but is no good</li>
            <li> Great. Expensive shipping tax though</li>
            <li> The smell on this is so fresh and clean that I can&#x27;t describe it.  I think it has Something to do with  Yuzu lemons.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last too long maybe an hour but that one hour you get a ton of compliments.</li>
            <li> Great price, love the smell</li>
            <li> Producto adulterado, no es original !!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice perfume. The size of the bottle is larger than I expected for this price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely picky about scents I wear. This is quite literally the only cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn. My personal taste diverts me away from heavy, musky, &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scents and leads me towards fresh, unassuming, underestimated noses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this perfume for many years.. love it on my husband. It&#x27;s fresh and sweet, but just so perfect on a guy.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this scent, it is one of those smells you want to smell over and over again... however, it&#x27;s strength is very mild and doesn&#x27;t last through the day. Would have given five stars if not for that.</li>
            <li> I like it...it&#x27;s different than what you usually get for men, it&#x27;s fresh. However, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long...also at first it made me dizzy...but it&#x27;s a GREAT price for cologne...I hardly have any cologne under 85 dollars and most of them I don&#x27;t even use much...this one I like for the price...and the short lasting smell lol!</li>
            <li> Bleah!&lt;br /&gt;I got another edition of the perfume, not least photo.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed.I paid the $ 24 fee here in Romania</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. Love it and am happy I can still obtain it in the USA. Thanks. I appreciate it!</li>
            <li> I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong Amazon has always made me free and better; acquires another company uses Amazon are excellent, Amazon is always an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance, for example, I love the way all I can even give gende and love and is also author of Through Amazon, as well as any product I buy, is truly exquisite.</li>
