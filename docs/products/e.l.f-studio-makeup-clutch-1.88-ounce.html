            <li>Well, it&#x27;s ok....not a favorite.....</li>

            <li>I am so pleased with this item-love the choices of eye shadow-blush-and lip colors.</li>
            <li>needs more applicators.</li>
            <li>Eye shadow was okay.  </li>
            <li>i received this item in excellent condition however its extremely low pigmented.</li>
            <li>I can get better at Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>The rest are okay.</li>
            <li>Well...I saw this and said, ok, it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot</li>
            <li>cute, portable and inexpensive to the point where you can keep one at work, home, your car and give away  for gifts!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the lipgloss and eyeshadow shades.</li>
            <li>the lip gloss is lovely.</li>
            <li>Although it got damage in shipping this clutch is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love watching her putting on makeup like her Nana...</li>
            <li>the blush colors are also nice and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It may work better on a greasy skin.</li>
            <li>I really love this</li>
            <li>They are lightweight, not chalky, and you can layer more on if you want more of a pop.</li>
            <li>So compact and looks lovely.</li>
            <li>its a okay product for the price</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my eyes and i use the bronzer as well</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I ordered 8 of those makeup clutch for my sisters, they just love it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have any problems with shipping, product is good and worth the price i guess</li>
            <li>Her friends love it too.</li>
            <li>and I did enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY happy with E.L.F and will plan on using them in the future.</li>
            <li>Love the colors for the eyes and cheeks, plus the eye and lip primers.</li>
            <li>I would buy more of these makeup sets.</li>
            <li>I love the bronzer of all.</li>
            <li>The top contains the eyeshadows, and a lower tray slides out with blush, lip products and a face</li>
            <li>The brow products are lighter in the photo, and the blush more pinky than the peachy</li>
            <li>but I tried them and they are more like tints.</li>
            <li>Overall its a great deal for 6 bucks!!!!</li>
            <li>Its not the best make up, but it will do for days im short on time.  </li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>I use mostly the eyeshadow palettes.</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>It was brand new with beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>came right on time, and my daughter in law loved it</li>
            <li>Its definitely a great kit for a beginner like myself and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am super glad I bought this kit!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, super satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Lots of color options, its very economical, and the cute case makes it easy to store!</li>
            <li>Packaging was easy to get into and very secure for the product.</li>
            <li>It a great little package at a great price.</li>
            <li>i bougth this makeuo clutch thinkin i was gonna be a waste of money, but when my girlfriend tried it, she was so happy and mades me happy too,,,</li>
            <li>But, my kids enjoyed playing with the makeup and it washed off easily</li>
            <li>I love that it also included eyebrow makeup and a highlighter color because that is so easily overlooked by beginners.  </li>
            <li>Also a nice idea for a portable or desk makeup set for someone who has to make a quick transition from day/night makeup.</li>
            <li>she says its the best se came acrossfor such cheap price</li>
            <li>many, very pretty,colorful,light or bright, eye shadows.</li>
            <li>i have light brows and was able to use it.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive, and most importantly, durable.</li>
            <li>The case is very sturdy and the makeup itself is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>price was good and the colors are nice and seem to last OK.</li>
            <li>the blush looks very nice on anyones skin, and the eyeshadow is nice and lasts long without fading</li>
            <li>I was excited about my order because I know ELF makeup is pretty good</li>
            <li>Gave it as a gift to a teenage girl, who absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li>it is easily faded away in the face.</li>
            <li>It gets scratched easy but the good thing is that I got it early:)</li>
            <li>It will be easy to take along and have it when I need it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how they shipped it and how it breaks so easily</li>
            <li>cheaply made, i hope the content also is cheap, i didnt use it, gifted to some one else.</li>
            <li>You have all you need in one case that can slip easily into your purse.</li>
            <li>Could easily be thrown into a carry-on or purse.  </li>
            <li>ELF makes such great products that are cruelty free and work so well!</li>
            <li>Great bargain, and my wife has been pleased enough to again</li>
            <li>Unless you can keep this package in a drawer without transporting it where movement can break it easily, I would not recommend.</li>
            <li>This is good makeup for the price if you do not have high expectations for the pigment load.</li>
            <li>granddaughter liked it very much</li>
            <li>You need to layer many times to get the true color on.</li>
            <li>The dark colors i use as eyeliner with a damp eyeliner brush worked perfect.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love these so much</li>
            <li>The makeup in it is not bad i just wish that it was more durable.</li>
            <li>lipstick is fine</li>
            <li>I know that this clutch was pretty cheap for the amount of make-up contained in it, but this stuff is honestly the poorest quality.</li>
            <li>A great gift for a younger girl wanting to play with makeup, there is a good selection, and honestly the quality is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s fine..</li>
            <li>Either work fine, I just prefer the brushes.</li>
            <li>This came nicely packaged, ordered as a christmas present and very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love the E.L.F. products, super price and quality cosmetics.</li>
            <li>The blushes are super cute colors on my skin.</li>
            <li>The packaging is really sleek, compact, and cute!  </li>
            <li>Perfect little gift to give someone who loves makeup.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I needed some makeup to take with me while I&#x27;m away from home without having bunch of separate pieces and a huge makeup bag.</li>
            <li>eyeshadow colors are not depicted entirely accurately in the photo.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows and blushes are pretty good quality and have great pigmenting, though the bronzer is way too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t really use these, i have my own separate lipstick i use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I doubt if I&#x27;ll use the bronzer only because bronzer doesn&#x27;t look to great on me period.</li>
            <li>I wore the red and it looked great, like a stain.</li>
            <li>this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>we requested to be given as gift for some friends which was cheap, too.</li>
            <li>Great gifts for the tweens that are starting to experiment with make up.</li>
            <li>it doesnt really stay on my brows, but the powder is a nice brown color.</li>
            <li>This came in pieces, I think that&#x27;s why they sold it so cheap.</li>
            <li>This could be an excellent travel set, gift, or an everyday use set.</li>
            <li>Like a box of cheap street chalk...  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy nice colors and everything in one place.</li>
            <li>The light blush is just that... really light...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made by the brand E.L.F. and comes with three brushes, even though they are just the cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li>This is still a handy case of products that is put together very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have used better blush, but this blush was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Love the colors, very convinient, i can carry it in my purse, and it contains everything i need, eyeshadow,blush my favorite is the peach color, lip gloss, eyebrow color, etc</li>
            <li>good for people who like soft makeup, like me.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: the kit is super cute, compact and I use it every day for it&#x27;s amazing eyeshadows and blushes, but I suggest buying it directly from E.L.F. Cosmetics.</li>

            <li>I use it all the time and its super easy to store away</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite cosmetic must-have!</li>
            <li>She was beyond excited to get it on Christmas day.</li>
            <li>I love mine so much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i got a replacement within one day, when the original product dint arrive within the stipulated time</li>
            <li>awesome product, small compact and efficient...</li>
            <li>I am almost never disappointed with E.L.F products.</li>
            <li>and i returned the original without a problem.</li>
            <li>The color selection is phenomenol and fun to experiment with!</li>
            <li>When I saw this product, I was really excited to buy it</li>
            <li>I love elf products thanks for having them!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it arrived today..</li>
            <li>Perfect for a young girl just starting out!</li>
            <li>The size is nice because most kits are so big!</li>
            <li>Many shades of makeup to choose from and in an appropriate quantity so it doesn&#x27;t get old before it is used up.</li>
            <li>Now she&#x27;ll be able to feel more like a young lady making herself up like me...</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this palette is a good set for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Seems to be good quality, although we haven&#x27;t really used it much yet.</li>
            <li>n got soooo many positive reviews</li>
            <li>Nice little compact of color and shadings, Just the right size and the right selection for a great price and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Blush which is a great color for dark or light skin, brow powder AND gel,</li>
            <li>Fragile, but good for that price</li>
            <li>RECOMMENDED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would liked to upload the pictures directly to amazon</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a good value, but could have purchased something from a local store for this price.</li>
            <li>I love the shadows, very pigmented, and</li>
            <li>Quality of the product is just as good as my prior brand of choice!</li>
            <li>Not bad for the money.</li>
            <li>so if you really do want this, i would recommend checking bit lots first!!!</li>
            <li>The face shimmer is okay, though a bit too sheer to use as a cheekbone highlight; it would probably work better on the brow bone.</li>
            <li>My wife love this im thinking of getting her another similar set with a lil more make up.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with the quality of this makeup clutch, especially considering the low cost.</li>
            <li>I immediately called and they re-sent the clutch quickly with no fuss</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Arrived earlier then excepted so I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The colors have good pigment and stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li>She loved it she has beg me for something like this for a long time.</li>
            <li>Ther come of easy and look very prett ALL the colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an inexpensive makeup that doesn&#x27;t last very long, but looks nice and has a good variety.</li>
            <li>Great little starter kit</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really find that to be a huge drawback.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but Overall I liked it.</li>
            <li>but it was smaller which makes it handy.</li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s a handy makeup clutch</li>
            <li>This would have been a really cute gift for my 15 year old niece.</li>
            <li>Even though there are not a ton of colors, the choices that are in this clutch are ones I already use: natural tones mostly like browns, pinks, and blacks.</li>
            <li>I suggest getting the Healthy Glow Bronzers for a dollar ($1) directly from E.L.F.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty true to color.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 by mistake, but since it was such a nice mini makeup kit</li>
            <li>i love this purchse because i really didnt have to use much eye primer</li>
            <li>My wife said she liked it, though she said she would need some additional set of brushes to try out the different shades/blushes.</li>
            <li>I guess its worth it.</li>
            <li>Not only the eye shadows are cool but also the lip glosses are pretty nice.</li>
            <li>But for the money, your getting quite a bit of product and it&#x27;s nice to be able to try different colors than you normally use and know that you haven&#x27;t paid a fortune for it.&lt;br /&gt;I find that I have to use a bit more eyeshadow than I normally do with my other cosmetics that I own.</li>
            <li>the colors are good, although it takes a bit of experimenting to get the colors right on dark skin, since they dont apply true to what you may see.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t give you that super eye makeup finish but its good for everyday wear or a quick fix for a night out.</li>
            <li>I had purchased other E.L.F products before and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li>Just the right size to carry around.</li>
            <li>That said, the price is right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent &amp;#34;starter set&amp;#34; for a teen girl who&#x27;s getting used to wearing makeup and wants to experiment with different colors/styles and doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much money.</li>
            <li>Is very practical,good for teenager ,and very special for gift to somebody,just send to request,and arrived very fast,the colors in the box is pretty</li>
            <li>They go on easy and smooth but they won&#x27;t last for hours.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It has exactly what is useful and nothing more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for small item and attractive</li>
            <li>it had a few more brushes, overall it is great</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and the size is small enough to fit into your purse!</li>
            <li>The case itself is quite compact and can fit into a handbag or large purse without much bulk.</li>
            <li>Super light and easy to carry around and jammed packed with everything you need.</li>
            <li>It was what she wanted  to get thanks very much !</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The colors are very easy to blend, and with so many choices you can create a dramatic or natural look very easily.</li>
            <li>If anything, I would say this could be a good gift for a little girl (7-10) just getting into make-up or using it for play.</li>
            <li>Terrific little clutch and a great cruelty free option.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>this is my first time to use this brand.</li>
            <li>I love it, but the only problem is is that the bronzer feel to pieces</li>
            <li>Love all the different colors!</li>
            <li>but I find them pretty nonetheless.</li>
            <li>As with most sets not enough applicators, but the ones that came with it held up</li>
            <li>most likely will never use it but pass it on to the kiddies for them to play grownup.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always wanted to have many different colors and not spend a fortune on them.</li>
            <li>You do however need to be aware of handling this case.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>but they are really pretty in real life too!</li>
            <li>PRIME YOUR EYES FIRST.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more e.l.f. products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied although I wished there would be a red eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I wore foundation for the first time a year ago at my wedding.</li>
            <li>Makeup is so pretty but so complicated,especially for a beginner like myself.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>Next time im going to splurge for a better one.</li>
            <li>The blushes are pretty as well.</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, for the money, your not getting a super high quality product.</li>
            <li>the eyeshadows are bright but not long lasting even with eye primer on.</li>
            <li>while the other has a nice pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, nice convenient palate for traveling, but you will have to supplement with other products &amp; tools (for traveling).</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the eye shadows don&#x27;t last very long, but still a great product for the price!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lip colors are nice though I&#x27;ve only used two of them so far</li>
            <li>I love the many options that this little compact clutch offers.</li>
            <li>I saw the positive reviews on the e.l.f studio clutch and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>All around positive purchase.</li>
            <li>I still hoped for a better product, it is so dry, it does not stick.</li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant.</li>
            <li>True to image, many colors to choose from, and when applied their is no cheap look to the product.</li>
            <li>I actually got this item for free directly from EyesLipsFace.com when there was a special coupon for it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to be large</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s pretty good, but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase just because of the mixed powder/cream packaging and that the bronzer and brow products don&#x27;t even remotely go with my skin tone or brow color.</li>
            <li>Its is really compact enough the fit in your bag.</li>
            <li>just be very carefu not to drop it or anything</li>
            <li>Bought this clutch for an international trip and trying to pack lightly</li>
            <li>now i like it so much.</li>
            <li>The product looks really neat and everything</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fade fast</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>On the bottom it comes with a bronzer 2 blushes which btw are very pigmented</li>
            <li>dont really dig the gel</li>
            <li>Very compact.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for this, it reminds me of kids play make up.</li>
            <li>Really I would recommend this to all women who like to have on-the-go makeup.</li>
            <li>i even used it with my elf eyelid primer and that did not have much of an effect...</li>
            <li>Thanks for my Makeup clutch</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very satisfy.</li>
            <li>i dont really use blush, but for someone lighter in complexion the blush should work well.</li>
            <li>but this came  damaged i am really pissed</li>
            <li>and I got a box filled with powder, virtually none of which was in the actual &amp;#34;clutch&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I got this a year ago and it works very well.</li>
            <li>This product have everything you need apart from foundation and it&#x27;s sold at a very afforable price.</li>
            <li>I really like the lip gloss colors and the brushes.</li>
            <li>everything was whole when received.</li>
            <li>The pink one is for more dressy occasions.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use the one in this clutch as much.</li>
            <li>Very organised, I&#x27;m a fan of elf makeup although i can&#x27;t quite put on makeup myself.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This elf make up set is the real deal.</li>
            <li>The container really does resemble a clutch purse.</li>
            <li>I ended up really liking this set.</li>
            <li>i liked it but its a bit too heavy for me.</li>
            <li>This kit is good for my purse, the makeup is what I expected for ten bucks.  </li>
            <li>From the other comments, it appears someone in China needs to do a better packaging job.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is an okay kit.  </li>
            <li>The colors are so pretty and soft.</li>
            <li>The eye shadow is far from MAC quality or any big names, but it is good enough for someone who is new with makeup or for a young girl.</li>
            <li>She reports that it is small and easy to carry, has many different color options and the make-up stays on well.</li>
            <li>The color selection is great, but the drawer that holds the blushes is so hard to open.  </li>
            <li>It has everything you need for a  complete quick makeup look in emergency situations or on the go, (as long as you have the right tools as well).</li>
            <li>It has more than the typical.</li>
            <li>This is a decent palette for the price.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and I wish I had the propensity to go</li>
            <li>this helps to keep the eyeshadow on and also makes the colors vibrant.</li>
            <li>Plus, if you get it directly from E.L.F., they always have epic sales one right after the other.g to their brows.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i thought it would be a little cheap for the price I paid, but no its a grate buy!</li>
            <li>So this little compact is cute.</li>
            <li>Only buy this if you&#x27;re willing to take the risk!</li>
            <li>It looked like a cute little makeup set with mirror</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t been overly sticky like other glosses, haven&#x27;t melted away easily, and haven&#x27;t stained my lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are a great variety and the little lip glosses arent too much for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>It does look expensive and makes a great gift .</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 22 yr old daughter, and she really likes having everything in one case.  </li>
            <li>There are a few matte shades of shadow but most are glittery.</li>
            <li>This makeup is worth buying just because you can tell the difference when using different colors.</li>
            <li>She uses it everyday, and her friends love it also.</li>
            <li>The strip of white cream/gel/goop is useful too, to give your cheeks a dewy shimmer.</li>
            <li>The thing I liked the most besides its contents is the tough made of the box unlike other makeups I bought.</li>
            <li>a little more wild</li>
            <li>I took mine on a flight over seas, it broke on the way and the powder broke up leaving little pieces of powder everywhere and the top mirror broke off completely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how could i live without it.</li>
            <li>Guess that&#x27;s a good and bad feature because it makes it secure</li>
            <li>and when it finally arrived I expected more from it.</li>
            <li>very ADULT palette.</li>
            <li>The box was very very old and almost all the colors got collapsed.</li>
            <li>I think people with dark hues would enjoy this.</li>
            <li>, it is small, it is ok for travel or a night out</li>
            <li>It is a cute and small but still has a lot of makeup in it.</li>
            <li>It came completely cracked, powder everywhere, as I opened the clutch the button even popped off the front!</li>
            <li>I actually bought this for my kiddo who just got her first vanity for Christmas, but I may use this myself,too.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I find the colors too light, they don&#x27;t show and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this because the reviews were so good, but boy was I disappointed with the way it arrived to me.</li>
            <li>blend.&lt;br /&gt;The case is hard plastic and the top opens like an envelope to show eye shadows and the bottom slides out as a tray with blushes, primers and lip glosses.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 7 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>When I received it the blush was completely gone.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are okay, but everything else really sucks.</li>
            <li>This was a gift to a fifteen year old niece.  </li>
            <li>All I need is foundation, eyeliner, and this case, and I have a complete collection of makeup.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a 12 year old.  </li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>and this has completely replaced it.</li>
            <li>, I am really fond of the red.</li>
            <li>It has held up so far</li>
            <li>I bought the e.l.f makeup clutch for my 10 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I bought this to introduce my 14 year old niece to make-up.</li>
            <li>It is really up to your personal choice.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think this clutch offers a blond version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think this clutch offers a blond version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it and there is such a variety of colors.</li>
            <li>Young girls, what can I say, I guess we were there once.</li>
            <li>This was an item for my (12 yr old) daughter&#x27;s stocking, she was grinning ear to ear when she opened this gift.</li>
            <li>this was a total success even though i really only use this for the blushes/bronzer.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to take along with you anywhere as it is lightweight and small.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, so it&#x27;s easy to carry with you if you need to.</li>
            <li>Plus, if you get it directly from E.L.F., they always have epic sales one right after the other.</li>
            <li>the man broke the whole kit because he threw the box down so hard kind.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the brow products much; the cream was too dark and the powder came off really orange-toned.</li>
            <li>i have the same exact thing, except i bought mine at big lots for a cheaper price at $10</li>
            <li>the colors are pretty standard but varied to get several looks.</li>
            <li>It is small and will fit in a purse.  </li>
            <li>If you like soft red lips, it is great, you don&#x27;t even need lipstick unless you want a very dramatic red lip.  </li>
            <li>I dont like the colors as much as the last version of this product that was made prior to this one.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this was that the colors don&#x27;t really stay well with eyeshadow primer, I use a Urban Decay eye primer.</li>
            <li>and it was easy and small enough to pack.</li>
            <li>Seriously though, I only bought MAC makeup for MANY years</li>
            <li>Generally speaking, I like this product.</li>
            <li>Its very powdery and thus does not last long.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this for my young daughter to play with - just to get her out of my make up.</li>
            <li>The colors are very wearable and last as well as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I was always skeptical about these kind of all-in-one palettes, but I thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good idea to buy one for young girls just starting out with makeup, can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li>The only thing is u have to push down I little bit for it to stand out more ...love it</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really pop but that could be due to my browner lips.</li>
            <li>Ran to Ulta and grabbed a Smashbox compact for a little more money...don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li>The plastic outer container broke in my purse without any heavy usage and the blush broke into many little pieces.  </li>
            <li>bottom drawer with the comes out of alignment to easily and is hard to put back properly.</li>
            <li>(I ordered it when it was for 10$ - was lucky, the next price was increased to 18$ and then few days later to 25$)</li>
            <li>I have not used the bronzer because it is too dark for my skin tone, but I really like the eye shadow, eyebrow powder, and the lip gloss.</li>
            <li>The other ones I use too, for flirty days and party nights-- or just to go with particular outfits I have.</li>
            <li>every single box was ruined, I lost U$130 directly to the trash</li>
            <li>The base colors and variety are decent and fit the bill as far as that goes, however, the packaging is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>it is not long lasting.</li>
            <li>Idea was to have one kit to carry on vacation - this is too heavy and large.  </li>
            <li>quality...only complaint is that the clutch is kind of hard to open.</li>

            <li> I am so pleased with this item-love the choices of eye shadow-blush-and lip colors.</li>
            <li> needs more applicators.</li>
            <li> Eye shadow was okay.  </li>
            <li> i received this item in excellent condition however its extremely low pigmented.</li>
            <li> I can get better at Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> The rest are okay.</li>
            <li> Well...I saw this and said, ok, it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot</li>

            <li> Love the lipgloss and eyeshadow shades.</li>
            <li> the lip gloss is lovely.</li>
            <li> Although it got damage in shipping this clutch is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love watching her putting on makeup like her Nana...</li>
            <li> the blush colors are also nice and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It may work better on a greasy skin.</li>
            <li> I really love this</li>
            <li> They are lightweight, not chalky, and you can layer more on if you want more of a pop.</li>
            <li> So compact and looks lovely.</li>
            <li> its a okay product for the price</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my eyes and i use the bronzer as well</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered 8 of those makeup clutch for my sisters, they just love it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any problems with shipping, product is good and worth the price i guess</li>
            <li> Her friends love it too.</li>
            <li> and I did enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY happy with E.L.F and will plan on using them in the future.</li>
            <li> Love the colors for the eyes and cheeks, plus the eye and lip primers.</li>
            <li> I would buy more of these makeup sets.</li>
            <li> I love the bronzer of all.</li>
            <li> The top contains the eyeshadows, and a lower tray slides out with blush, lip products and a face</li>
            <li> The brow products are lighter in the photo, and the blush more pinky than the peachy</li>
            <li> but I tried them and they are more like tints.</li>
            <li> Overall its a great deal for 6 bucks!!!!</li>
            <li> Its not the best make up, but it will do for days im short on time.  </li>
            <li> They love it.</li>
            <li> I use mostly the eyeshadow palettes.</li>
            <li> love this product</li>
            <li> It was brand new with beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> came right on time, and my daughter in law loved it</li>
            <li> Its definitely a great kit for a beginner like myself and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am super glad I bought this kit!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, super satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Lots of color options, its very economical, and the cute case makes it easy to store!</li>
            <li> Packaging was easy to get into and very secure for the product.</li>
            <li> It a great little package at a great price.</li>
            <li> i bougth this makeuo clutch thinkin i was gonna be a waste of money, but when my girlfriend tried it, she was so happy and mades me happy too,,,</li>
            <li> But, my kids enjoyed playing with the makeup and it washed off easily</li>
            <li> I love that it also included eyebrow makeup and a highlighter color because that is so easily overlooked by beginners.  </li>
            <li> Also a nice idea for a portable or desk makeup set for someone who has to make a quick transition from day/night makeup.</li>
            <li> she says its the best se came acrossfor such cheap price</li>
            <li> many, very pretty,colorful,light or bright, eye shadows.</li>
            <li> i have light brows and was able to use it.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive, and most importantly, durable.</li>
            <li> The case is very sturdy and the makeup itself is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> price was good and the colors are nice and seem to last OK.</li>
            <li> the blush looks very nice on anyones skin, and the eyeshadow is nice and lasts long without fading</li>
            <li> I was excited about my order because I know ELF makeup is pretty good</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift to a teenage girl, who absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> it is easily faded away in the face.</li>
            <li> It gets scratched easy but the good thing is that I got it early:)</li>
            <li> It will be easy to take along and have it when I need it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how they shipped it and how it breaks so easily</li>
            <li> cheaply made, i hope the content also is cheap, i didnt use it, gifted to some one else.</li>
            <li> You have all you need in one case that can slip easily into your purse.</li>
            <li> Could easily be thrown into a carry-on or purse.  </li>
            <li> ELF makes such great products that are cruelty free and work so well!</li>
            <li> Great bargain, and my wife has been pleased enough to again</li>
            <li> Unless you can keep this package in a drawer without transporting it where movement can break it easily, I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is good makeup for the price if you do not have high expectations for the pigment load.</li>
            <li> granddaughter liked it very much</li>
            <li> You need to layer many times to get the true color on.</li>
            <li> The dark colors i use as eyeliner with a damp eyeliner brush worked perfect.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these so much</li>
            <li> The makeup in it is not bad i just wish that it was more durable.</li>
            <li> lipstick is fine</li>
            <li> I know that this clutch was pretty cheap for the amount of make-up contained in it, but this stuff is honestly the poorest quality.</li>
            <li> A great gift for a younger girl wanting to play with makeup, there is a good selection, and honestly the quality is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s fine..</li>
            <li> Either work fine, I just prefer the brushes.</li>
            <li> This came nicely packaged, ordered as a christmas present and very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love the E.L.F. products, super price and quality cosmetics.</li>
            <li> The blushes are super cute colors on my skin.</li>
            <li> The packaging is really sleek, compact, and cute!  </li>
            <li> Perfect little gift to give someone who loves makeup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I needed some makeup to take with me while I&#x27;m away from home without having bunch of separate pieces and a huge makeup bag.</li>
            <li> eyeshadow colors are not depicted entirely accurately in the photo.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows and blushes are pretty good quality and have great pigmenting, though the bronzer is way too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t really use these, i have my own separate lipstick i use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I doubt if I&#x27;ll use the bronzer only because bronzer doesn&#x27;t look to great on me period.</li>
            <li> I wore the red and it looked great, like a stain.</li>
            <li> this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> we requested to be given as gift for some friends which was cheap, too.</li>
            <li> Great gifts for the tweens that are starting to experiment with make up.</li>
            <li> it doesnt really stay on my brows, but the powder is a nice brown color.</li>
            <li> This came in pieces, I think that&#x27;s why they sold it so cheap.</li>
            <li> This could be an excellent travel set, gift, or an everyday use set.</li>
            <li> Like a box of cheap street chalk...  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy nice colors and everything in one place.</li>
            <li> The light blush is just that... really light...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made by the brand E.L.F. and comes with three brushes, even though they are just the cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li> This is still a handy case of products that is put together very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used better blush, but this blush was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, very convinient, i can carry it in my purse, and it contains everything i need, eyeshadow,blush my favorite is the peach color, lip gloss, eyebrow color, etc</li>
            <li> good for people who like soft makeup, like me.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: the kit is super cute, compact and I use it every day for it&#x27;s amazing eyeshadows and blushes, but I suggest buying it directly from E.L.F. Cosmetics.</li>

            <li> She was beyond excited to get it on Christmas day.</li>
            <li> I love mine so much!</li>

            <li> awesome product, small compact and efficient...</li>
            <li> I am almost never disappointed with E.L.F products.</li>
            <li> and i returned the original without a problem.</li>
            <li> The color selection is phenomenol and fun to experiment with!</li>
            <li> When I saw this product, I was really excited to buy it</li>
            <li> I love elf products thanks for having them!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it arrived today..</li>
            <li> Perfect for a young girl just starting out!</li>
            <li> The size is nice because most kits are so big!</li>
            <li> Many shades of makeup to choose from and in an appropriate quantity so it doesn&#x27;t get old before it is used up.</li>
            <li> Now she&#x27;ll be able to feel more like a young lady making herself up like me...</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this palette is a good set for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good quality, although we haven&#x27;t really used it much yet.</li>
            <li> n got soooo many positive reviews</li>
            <li> Nice little compact of color and shadings, Just the right size and the right selection for a great price and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Blush which is a great color for dark or light skin, brow powder AND gel,</li>
            <li> Fragile, but good for that price</li>
            <li> RECOMMENDED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would liked to upload the pictures directly to amazon</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a good value, but could have purchased something from a local store for this price.</li>
            <li> I love the shadows, very pigmented, and</li>
            <li> Quality of the product is just as good as my prior brand of choice!</li>
            <li> Not bad for the money.</li>
            <li> so if you really do want this, i would recommend checking bit lots first!!!</li>
            <li> The face shimmer is okay, though a bit too sheer to use as a cheekbone highlight; it would probably work better on the brow bone.</li>
            <li> My wife love this im thinking of getting her another similar set with a lil more make up.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the quality of this makeup clutch, especially considering the low cost.</li>
            <li> I immediately called and they re-sent the clutch quickly with no fuss</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Arrived earlier then excepted so I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The colors have good pigment and stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li> She loved it she has beg me for something like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Ther come of easy and look very prett ALL the colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive makeup that doesn&#x27;t last very long, but looks nice and has a good variety.</li>
            <li> Great little starter kit</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really find that to be a huge drawback.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but Overall I liked it.</li>
            <li> but it was smaller which makes it handy.</li>
            <li> overall it&#x27;s a handy makeup clutch</li>
            <li> This would have been a really cute gift for my 15 year old niece.</li>
            <li> Even though there are not a ton of colors, the choices that are in this clutch are ones I already use: natural tones mostly like browns, pinks, and blacks.</li>
            <li> I suggest getting the Healthy Glow Bronzers for a dollar ($1) directly from E.L.F.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty true to color.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 by mistake, but since it was such a nice mini makeup kit</li>
            <li> i love this purchse because i really didnt have to use much eye primer</li>
            <li> My wife said she liked it, though she said she would need some additional set of brushes to try out the different shades/blushes.</li>
            <li> I guess its worth it.</li>
            <li> Not only the eye shadows are cool but also the lip glosses are pretty nice.</li>
            <li> But for the money, your getting quite a bit of product and it&#x27;s nice to be able to try different colors than you normally use and know that you haven&#x27;t paid a fortune for it.&lt;br /&gt;I find that I have to use a bit more eyeshadow than I normally do with my other cosmetics that I own.</li>
            <li> the colors are good, although it takes a bit of experimenting to get the colors right on dark skin, since they dont apply true to what you may see.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t give you that super eye makeup finish but its good for everyday wear or a quick fix for a night out.</li>
            <li> I had purchased other E.L.F products before and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> Just the right size to carry around.</li>
            <li> That said, the price is right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent &amp;#34;starter set&amp;#34; for a teen girl who&#x27;s getting used to wearing makeup and wants to experiment with different colors/styles and doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much money.</li>
            <li> Is very practical,good for teenager ,and very special for gift to somebody,just send to request,and arrived very fast,the colors in the box is pretty</li>
            <li> They go on easy and smooth but they won&#x27;t last for hours.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It has exactly what is useful and nothing more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for small item and attractive</li>
            <li> it had a few more brushes, overall it is great</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and the size is small enough to fit into your purse!</li>
            <li> The case itself is quite compact and can fit into a handbag or large purse without much bulk.</li>
            <li> Super light and easy to carry around and jammed packed with everything you need.</li>
            <li> It was what she wanted  to get thanks very much !</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The colors are very easy to blend, and with so many choices you can create a dramatic or natural look very easily.</li>
            <li> If anything, I would say this could be a good gift for a little girl (7-10) just getting into make-up or using it for play.</li>
            <li> Terrific little clutch and a great cruelty free option.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> this is my first time to use this brand.</li>
            <li> I love it, but the only problem is is that the bronzer feel to pieces</li>
            <li> Love all the different colors!</li>
            <li> but I find them pretty nonetheless.</li>
            <li> As with most sets not enough applicators, but the ones that came with it held up</li>
            <li> most likely will never use it but pass it on to the kiddies for them to play grownup.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always wanted to have many different colors and not spend a fortune on them.</li>
            <li> You do however need to be aware of handling this case.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> but they are really pretty in real life too!</li>
            <li> PRIME YOUR EYES FIRST.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more e.l.f. products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied although I wished there would be a red eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I wore foundation for the first time a year ago at my wedding.</li>
            <li> Makeup is so pretty but so complicated,especially for a beginner like myself.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> Next time im going to splurge for a better one.</li>
            <li> The blushes are pretty as well.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, for the money, your not getting a super high quality product.</li>
            <li> the eyeshadows are bright but not long lasting even with eye primer on.</li>
            <li> while the other has a nice pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, nice convenient palate for traveling, but you will have to supplement with other products &amp; tools (for traveling).</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the eye shadows don&#x27;t last very long, but still a great product for the price!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lip colors are nice though I&#x27;ve only used two of them so far</li>
            <li> I love the many options that this little compact clutch offers.</li>
            <li> I saw the positive reviews on the e.l.f studio clutch and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> All around positive purchase.</li>
            <li> I still hoped for a better product, it is so dry, it does not stick.</li>
            <li> The colors are very vibrant.</li>
            <li> True to image, many colors to choose from, and when applied their is no cheap look to the product.</li>
            <li> I actually got this item for free directly from EyesLipsFace.com when there was a special coupon for it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be large</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s pretty good, but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase just because of the mixed powder/cream packaging and that the bronzer and brow products don&#x27;t even remotely go with my skin tone or brow color.</li>
            <li> Its is really compact enough the fit in your bag.</li>
            <li> just be very carefu not to drop it or anything</li>
            <li> Bought this clutch for an international trip and trying to pack lightly</li>
            <li> now i like it so much.</li>
            <li> The product looks really neat and everything</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fade fast</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> On the bottom it comes with a bronzer 2 blushes which btw are very pigmented</li>
            <li> dont really dig the gel</li>
            <li> Very compact.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this, it reminds me of kids play make up.</li>
            <li> Really I would recommend this to all women who like to have on-the-go makeup.</li>
            <li> i even used it with my elf eyelid primer and that did not have much of an effect...</li>
            <li> Thanks for my Makeup clutch</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very satisfy.</li>
            <li> i dont really use blush, but for someone lighter in complexion the blush should work well.</li>
            <li> but this came  damaged i am really pissed</li>
            <li> and I got a box filled with powder, virtually none of which was in the actual &amp;#34;clutch&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I got this a year ago and it works very well.</li>
            <li> This product have everything you need apart from foundation and it&#x27;s sold at a very afforable price.</li>
            <li> I really like the lip gloss colors and the brushes.</li>
            <li> everything was whole when received.</li>
            <li> The pink one is for more dressy occasions.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use the one in this clutch as much.</li>
            <li> Very organised, I&#x27;m a fan of elf makeup although i can&#x27;t quite put on makeup myself.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> This elf make up set is the real deal.</li>
            <li> The container really does resemble a clutch purse.</li>
            <li> I ended up really liking this set.</li>
            <li> i liked it but its a bit too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> This kit is good for my purse, the makeup is what I expected for ten bucks.  </li>
            <li> From the other comments, it appears someone in China needs to do a better packaging job.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is an okay kit.  </li>
            <li> The colors are so pretty and soft.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow is far from MAC quality or any big names, but it is good enough for someone who is new with makeup or for a young girl.</li>
            <li> She reports that it is small and easy to carry, has many different color options and the make-up stays on well.</li>
            <li> The color selection is great, but the drawer that holds the blushes is so hard to open.  </li>
            <li> It has everything you need for a  complete quick makeup look in emergency situations or on the go, (as long as you have the right tools as well).</li>
            <li> It has more than the typical.</li>
            <li> This is a decent palette for the price.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and I wish I had the propensity to go</li>
            <li> this helps to keep the eyeshadow on and also makes the colors vibrant.</li>
            <li> Plus, if you get it directly from E.L.F., they always have epic sales one right after the other.g to their brows.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i thought it would be a little cheap for the price I paid, but no its a grate buy!</li>
            <li> So this little compact is cute.</li>
            <li> Only buy this if you&#x27;re willing to take the risk!</li>
            <li> It looked like a cute little makeup set with mirror</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t been overly sticky like other glosses, haven&#x27;t melted away easily, and haven&#x27;t stained my lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are a great variety and the little lip glosses arent too much for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> It does look expensive and makes a great gift .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 22 yr old daughter, and she really likes having everything in one case.  </li>
            <li> There are a few matte shades of shadow but most are glittery.</li>
            <li> This makeup is worth buying just because you can tell the difference when using different colors.</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday, and her friends love it also.</li>
            <li> The strip of white cream/gel/goop is useful too, to give your cheeks a dewy shimmer.</li>
            <li> The thing I liked the most besides its contents is the tough made of the box unlike other makeups I bought.</li>
            <li> a little more wild</li>
            <li> I took mine on a flight over seas, it broke on the way and the powder broke up leaving little pieces of powder everywhere and the top mirror broke off completely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how could i live without it.</li>
            <li> Guess that&#x27;s a good and bad feature because it makes it secure</li>
            <li> and when it finally arrived I expected more from it.</li>
            <li> very ADULT palette.</li>
            <li> The box was very very old and almost all the colors got collapsed.</li>
            <li> I think people with dark hues would enjoy this.</li>
            <li> , it is small, it is ok for travel or a night out</li>
            <li> It is a cute and small but still has a lot of makeup in it.</li>
            <li> It came completely cracked, powder everywhere, as I opened the clutch the button even popped off the front!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my kiddo who just got her first vanity for Christmas, but I may use this myself,too.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I find the colors too light, they don&#x27;t show and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this because the reviews were so good, but boy was I disappointed with the way it arrived to me.</li>
            <li> blend.&lt;br /&gt;The case is hard plastic and the top opens like an envelope to show eye shadows and the bottom slides out as a tray with blushes, primers and lip glosses.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> When I received it the blush was completely gone.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are okay, but everything else really sucks.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to a fifteen year old niece.  </li>
            <li> All I need is foundation, eyeliner, and this case, and I have a complete collection of makeup.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a 12 year old.  </li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> and this has completely replaced it.</li>
            <li> , I am really fond of the red.</li>
            <li> It has held up so far</li>
            <li> I bought the e.l.f makeup clutch for my 10 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this to introduce my 14 year old niece to make-up.</li>
            <li> It is really up to your personal choice.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think this clutch offers a blond version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think this clutch offers a blond version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it and there is such a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Young girls, what can I say, I guess we were there once.</li>
            <li> This was an item for my (12 yr old) daughter&#x27;s stocking, she was grinning ear to ear when she opened this gift.</li>
            <li> this was a total success even though i really only use this for the blushes/bronzer.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to take along with you anywhere as it is lightweight and small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, so it&#x27;s easy to carry with you if you need to.</li>
            <li> Plus, if you get it directly from E.L.F., they always have epic sales one right after the other.</li>
            <li> the man broke the whole kit because he threw the box down so hard kind.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the brow products much; the cream was too dark and the powder came off really orange-toned.</li>
            <li> i have the same exact thing, except i bought mine at big lots for a cheaper price at $10</li>
            <li> the colors are pretty standard but varied to get several looks.</li>
            <li> It is small and will fit in a purse.  </li>
            <li> If you like soft red lips, it is great, you don&#x27;t even need lipstick unless you want a very dramatic red lip.  </li>
            <li> I dont like the colors as much as the last version of this product that was made prior to this one.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this was that the colors don&#x27;t really stay well with eyeshadow primer, I use a Urban Decay eye primer.</li>
            <li> and it was easy and small enough to pack.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, I only bought MAC makeup for MANY years</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, I like this product.</li>
            <li> Its very powdery and thus does not last long.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my young daughter to play with - just to get her out of my make up.</li>
            <li> The colors are very wearable and last as well as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I was always skeptical about these kind of all-in-one palettes, but I thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good idea to buy one for young girls just starting out with makeup, can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> The only thing is u have to push down I little bit for it to stand out more ...love it</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really pop but that could be due to my browner lips.</li>
            <li> Ran to Ulta and grabbed a Smashbox compact for a little more money...don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> The plastic outer container broke in my purse without any heavy usage and the blush broke into many little pieces.  </li>
            <li> bottom drawer with the comes out of alignment to easily and is hard to put back properly.</li>
            <li> (I ordered it when it was for 10$ - was lucky, the next price was increased to 18$ and then few days later to 25$)</li>
            <li> I have not used the bronzer because it is too dark for my skin tone, but I really like the eye shadow, eyebrow powder, and the lip gloss.</li>
            <li> The other ones I use too, for flirty days and party nights-- or just to go with particular outfits I have.</li>
            <li> every single box was ruined, I lost U$130 directly to the trash</li>
            <li> The base colors and variety are decent and fit the bill as far as that goes, however, the packaging is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> it is not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Idea was to have one kit to carry on vacation - this is too heavy and large.  </li>
            <li> quality...only complaint is that the clutch is kind of hard to open.</li>
            <li> The peachy one is for my light-hearted, casual days or summer.</li>
            <li> I have been watching videos, trying to learn how to apply make up like a professional but its so confusing trying to choose the right foundation and then learning about something called a concealer and other makeup.</li>
            <li> not sure if this is a shipping problem, or if the stuff was just that old, or if this is what normally happens when shipped via mail (doubt the shipping and mail idea, as the stuff i see in stores were never as dry as the stuff i just got)</li>
            <li> Very complete make up palette, shadows lasts all day, maybe need only a little touch up</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> last a long time however the lipglosses suck!</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was the brushes were  not really usable to apply the eye color.</li>
            <li> Entire bottom tray was crushed upon delivery.</li>
            <li> Only problem I have is the bottom tray gives a little fight to open.</li>
            <li> Nothing out of the ordinary as far as makeup goes.</li>
            <li> and after i went back and forth on my decision because of previous reviews, i decided to go with it.</li>
            <li> It was actually a couple dollars less than elf was selling it for.</li>
            <li> The shades that you actually get  are a little darker compared to what is pictured here to</li>
            <li> Love the lip glosses, blush is not to bad....</li>
            <li> The case was a lot classier than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not really on to wear blush or bronzer</li>
            <li> Eyeshadows are not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected.</li>
            <li> but when it arrived the case is only a few inches across.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> and I have never really worn make up.</li>
            <li> It has a minimal layer of gloss on the surface of each block of eye-shadow, but it really is not glossy under that minimal layer.</li>
            <li> and i mean everything was completely messed up.</li>
            <li> Inside the box bronzer was completely destroyed and broken and got mixed with other colors in box.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned it wouldnt hold up with all of my traveling as the first order arrived broken up and crushed.</li>
            <li> Big mess!</li>
            <li> It has everything I need for my daily face and a little glitz and glam for evening wear as well!</li>
            <li> Just got it in the mail the whole bottom half is broken and everywere</li>
            <li> but I do not like the other stuff that comes with it at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been sitting in a drawer with my other Elf products I ordered.  </li>
            <li> i get better pigmentation from my avon palette :(</li>
            <li> -The color shows up extremely well and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> Have not used the other shades.</li>
            <li> The bronzer powder went into every other element of the clutch.</li>
            <li> and I think you wouldn&#x27;t need to buy any other eyeshadow or blush pallets.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this.</li>
            <li> up won&#x27;t get loose and messy in your tote.</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s closed up it just looks like a little clutch.</li>
            <li> Blush is hard to apply/blend, it&#x27;s not powdery enough.</li>
            <li> I must admit, other views warned me!</li>
            <li> The black eyebrow gel is not that dark</li>
            <li> Less makeup to pack.  </li>
            <li> Serves the purpose of putting a little color on my face.  </li>
            <li> I like the eyebrow shadows, stayed all day with no gel, but a little too brown for my ash colored brows.</li>
            <li> The slide out part is very hard to open as well.</li>
            <li> I rated one star because the makeup is powdery and it comes with a huge crack on the cover, hate it.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> This has became my everyday makeup</li>
            <li> There are a few problems tho...</li>
            <li> The product arrived broken with powder spilled all over the inside of the box so the colors were all mixed together.</li>
            <li> she looked like a clown the roar few days of &amp;#34;practicing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Two of the eye shadow powders were broken and the powder was all over the inside &amp; outside of the case</li>
            <li> everything was so dried out that it had all fallen out of it&#x27;s holders (?)</li>
            <li> some shadows where missing</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are hit-and-miss in color and quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel that the case is a &#x27;little&#x27; difficult to open, so if you have arthritis, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to pull out the bottom drawer.  </li>
            <li> Its very cheap like and Horrible</li>
            <li> Its sad because even when I decided to return the product for another product, i received my money back</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person I gave it to has advised that this make-up clutch has been difficult to open and wound up breaking.  </li>
            <li> box is difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear bear minerals and mac</li>
            <li> the item was received damaged and I was not able to use it</li>
            <li> I was however unimpressed with the fact that once I opened the box, took the clutch out and opened it, there were 2 lipsticks missing!  </li>
            <li> I am not pleased with product.</li>
            <li> People are usually dying to know what color it is.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I like to have a small all-in-one makeup kit I can travel with.  </li>
            <li> i reccomend you buy it if your looking for a small inexpensive make up clutch</li>
            <li> Palette was very messy with colours.</li>
            <li> Not very good makeup.  </li>
            <li> about 99percent of eyeshadows need to have an eye primer applied to the base of the lid first.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so reliable and in my worst situations this is my go to make I strongly recommend this make after you use it</li>
            <li> I wanted to give to my daughter, but the first one was broken out on the bottome base, then I requested a replacement, and the second was worst than the first.  </li>
            <li> the whole thing was unusable and i was very disappointing</li>
            <li> I hardly ever use this.</li>
            <li> The colors are kid of dull and drab and not as &amp;#34;poppy&amp;#34; as they display it here and on the box.</li>
            <li> but the coral blush looked fake on my sister&#x27;s and my mother&#x27;s skin (pink).</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was packaging or product failure, but some of the compacts had broken and gotten powder all over the rest of the pigments.</li>
            <li> It has a bad quality and you can barely use the lipstick on it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about your make-up, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Not real happy about that at all!</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the lip gloss is under the powders so they get a sprinkling but not too badly.</li>
            <li> the item was not good.</li>
            <li> Too bad one of the eyes shadows came loose while in transit and exploded everywhere.</li>
            <li> I guess its just a very delicate item.</li>
            <li> All the eye shadow, the bronzer, the blush, everything had broken during the shipment and  was all over the box.</li>
            <li> The bronzer spilled all over the place and the bottom tray was broken.</li>
            <li> The colors are broken and some colors have 1/2 the quantity.</li>
            <li> am not happy with the product&lt;</li>
            <li> I bought 10 for christmas presents and now I am very dissapoint with this awful makeup e.l.f product.</li>
            <li> The bottom tray was broken.</li>
            <li> When I opened the drawer, the blush was broken into 1,000 pieces.  </li>
            <li> The sponge applicators included are really poor quality...</li>
            <li> All the colors are well pigmented and stay on for a long time if you base with a primer on your face and well moisturized</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t bad, but because of the placement of the lip glosses and the blush, I&#x27;m not able to use the lip gloss because of the blush&#x27;s powder falling all over it.</li>
            <li> i am usually a hugggee fan of elf but was disappointed with the pigmentation..</li>
            <li> lip glosses really failed.  </li>
            <li> the colors are not too crazy wish</li>
            <li> however the shadows were a bit disappointing..</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are fine,but I am afraid that latches are going to break too.</li>
            <li> I tried it on and even in cold weather, the color didn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> I usually like elf products, but I never got to try this one as it arrived in terrible shape.</li>
            <li> It is almost like they knew they did a bad job packaging the product.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is really bad.</li>
            <li> but I think a lack of ethics and professionalism send things in bad shape, I feel robbed to this acquisition.</li>
            <li> I feel like it is bad quality.</li>
            <li> the package everything I just upload the pictures of this bad product.  </li>
            <li> The packaging for this product was horrible and I was not happy about that.</li>
            <li> but when I received it I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed about this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> cant use any of the bottom items :(</li>
            <li> When I received the box, I was completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing :(</li>
            <li> Product was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The lip color is worthless.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t order this product, is very bad package itself (not amazon, not the store is the product), doesnt have any protection and the makeup dust mix with the others, the box,</li>
            <li> I am very very very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> this is the worst purchase I have made in my life, I do not refieron me the quality but the condition in which it I received.</li>
            <li> This was a horrible thing to order, by the time i got it, the blush was everywhere.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good colors and good price.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Terrific little clutch and a great cruelty free option. The only drawback is the lip gloss is under the powders so they get a sprinkling but not too badly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand daughter as a begiining kit and it was perfect and she has had somuch fun with it</li>
            <li> I love this travel makeup kit. I have traveled with it several times and it is all I needed on m y trip.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive make up solution.  Serves the purpose of putting a little color on my face.  The lip color is worthless.</li>
            <li> This is a decent palette for the price. The eyeshadows and blushes are pretty good quality and have great pigmenting, though the bronzer is way too dark for my skin tone. The face shimmer is okay, though a bit too sheer to use as a cheekbone highlight; it would probably work better on the brow bone. I didn&#x27;t like the brow products much; the cream was too dark and the powder came off really orange-toned. The lip glosses were actually wonderful, though as far as the packaging goes I wish they had a cover of some sort so that the powders wouldn&#x27;t get mixed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s pretty good, but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase just because of the mixed powder/cream packaging and that the bronzer and brow products don&#x27;t even remotely go with my skin tone or brow color.</li>
            <li> love this item. I like tall he colors and quality.</li>
            <li> The case was a lot classier than I expected. I LOVE everything in this kit. It has exactly what is useful and nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;The lip colors are great and so is the intensity of the shadow pigment.&lt;br /&gt;No touch up necessary all day and night and I didn&#x27;t even use a primer. I will be buying many of these as gifts for coworkers.&lt;br /&gt;A very ADULT palette. Perfect for any age and skin color.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit really, nice eyeshadow colors and quality, the blush and bronzer colors are really useful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really on to wear blush or bronzer but these are discrete enough to not feel like you have it on but they do look great if u use them right!:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick is fine but i didn&#x27;t really use these, i have my own separate lipstick i use.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am super glad I bought this kit! I use it all the time and its super easy to store away</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I paid for. I am not a person that knows a lot about makeup, but buying this makeup clutch has taught me a lot!</li>
            <li> This is good makeup for the price if you do not have high expectations for the pigment load. You need to layer many times to get the true color on. Being a make up artist I just bought this to test it out</li>
            <li> the item was not good. i dont like it. it is easily faded away in the face. it is not long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for 10 bucks but a brush would be nice for doing eyeliner with it but if u don&#x27;t plan on doing that u r good</li>
            <li> I was excited about my order because I know ELF makeup is pretty good but when I got this product everything and i mean everything was completely messed up. All the eye shadow, the bronzer, the blush, everything had broken during the shipment and  was all over the box. The packaging for this product was horrible and I was not happy about that. Its sad because even when I decided to return the product for another product, i received my money back but they didn&#x27;t want the product back. It is almost like they knew they did a bad job packaging the product.</li>
            <li> the man broke the whole kit because he threw the box down so hard kind. waste of money. SMH. just be very carefu not to drop it or anything but it is a very nice palete</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old daughter. It was perfect &amp;#34;first time&amp;#34;  makeup for her. She was beyond excited to get it on Christmas day.</li>
            <li> I has a lot of eyeshadow but I do not like the other stuff that comes with it at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I needed some makeup to take with me while I&#x27;m away from home without having bunch of separate pieces and a huge makeup bag. Love the colors!  I&#x27;m fair skinned and all the colors are useable. There are a few matte shades of shadow but most are glittery. I don&#x27;t find them to be to be too glittery though. The blushes are nice. I doubt if I&#x27;ll use the bronzer only because bronzer doesn&#x27;t look to great on me period. The lip colors are nice. I wore the red and it looked great, like a stain. It didn&#x27;t last long. but what gloss does?  I  even tried the face gloss to highlight my cheeks. It was really nice, not too sparkly. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  It a great little package at a great price. It was $5.00 cheaper here on Amazon compared to the e.l.f site. So I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my sweet girl who loves mommy&#x27;s make up! This way she has her own and I have my own! ;)</li>
            <li> this was for my daughter and she loves it. It was what she wanted  to get thanks very much !</li>
            <li> Bought this clutch for an international trip and trying to pack lightly this fit the bill. The colors are very wearable and last as well as the more expensive brands. The bronzer looks intimadating but works well with blending brush. The dark colors i use as eyeliner with a damp eyeliner brush worked perfect. The black eyebrow gel is not that dark i have light brows and was able to use it.  This has became my everyday makeup now i like it so much.</li>
            <li> yes this so beautiful looks like a clutch, but when expanded it is awesome!!!! this is my first time to use this brand.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup maybe a couple times a month so this is perfect! The colors are vibrant and I wish I had the propensity to go a little more wild sometimes..oh well, maybe one day.</li>
            <li> I like its design and colors although it&#x27;s not really same as the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it has another eye shadow colors to choose</li>
            <li> The product looks really neat and everything but it isnt at all durable. I took mine on a flight over seas, it broke on the way and the powder broke up leaving little pieces of powder everywhere and the top mirror broke off completely. The item was just sitting in my carry on bag nothing touched it. I guess its just a very delicate item. The makeup in it is not bad i just wish that it was more durable.</li>
            <li> we requested to be given as gift for some friends which was cheap, too. I was looking for small item and attractive</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING! I love mine so much! There are a few problems tho... For one, the blushes fall out a lot. Another on is they are kind of press powder, but brake when u touch them.</li>
            <li> I like it, used it once. Reliable. Didn&#x27;t fade fast, I went to a party and every time I thought I had to refresh it... I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This looked like a very nice palette but you do get what you pay for.  It&#x27;s been sitting in a drawer with my other Elf products I ordered.  I will eventually give these to teenagers who are starting out with makeup.</li>
            <li> The product arrived broken with powder spilled all over the inside of the box so the colors were all mixed together.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved this gift. Perfect for a young girl just starting out! The size is nice because most kits are so big!</li>
            <li> i liked it but its a bit too heavy for me. It gets scratched easy but the good thing is that I got it early:)</li>
            <li> I enjoy the colors but when I received the palette about 6 eye shadows were broken and the bronzer was ruined and so was the eyebrow gel. I like the palette and the picture and description was awesome but when I received it I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> so many colors to chose from, designed for any skin tone. the blush looks very nice on anyones skin, and the eyeshadow is nice and lasts long without fading</li>
            <li> Great little starter kit the colors are not too crazy wish it had a few more brushes, overall it is great I love having everything in one compact place.</li>
            <li> I am very very very disappointed in the product. When I received it the blush was completely gone. The bronzer spilled all over the place and the bottom tray was broken.The product needs to be packaged better.</li>
            <li> I love it, but the only problem is is that the bronzer feel to pieces and I didn&#x27;t drop it or anything</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these so much I bought 4! Great gifts for the tweens that are starting to experiment with make up.</li>
            <li> Has all the basics, just wish the colors were as bright as the picture.  They seem a bit more washed out.  But still a great deal.</li>
            <li> I know that this clutch was pretty cheap for the amount of make-up contained in it, but this stuff is honestly the poorest quality. If anything, I would say this could be a good gift for a little girl (7-10) just getting into make-up or using it for play. The eyeshadows are okay, but everything else really sucks. If you&#x27;re serious about your make-up, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> the product is very nice. looks very cute .&lt;br /&gt;worth the money&lt;br /&gt;i got a replacement within one day, when the original product dint arrive within the stipulated time</li>
            <li> Very good selection of colors, and it folds down perfect for on the go! came right on time, and my daughter in law loved it</li>
            <li> Very complete make up palette, shadows lasts all day, maybe need only a little touch up and they&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> for the amount of stuff I order from Amazon.com I wish that you could send a replacement and I could toss this one because it is totally unusable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend&#x27;s daughter for 24th birthday and she loved it. She said it is so handy to take everywhere with her and loves the variety inside.</li>
            <li> Many shades of makeup to choose from and in an appropriate quantity so it doesn&#x27;t get old before it is used up. Love all the different colors!</li>
            <li> Perfect gift 4 my granddaughter thanks she loves it and it fits in  her purse perfect for a 14 year old</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person I gave it to has advised that this make-up clutch has been difficult to open and wound up breaking.  She is however satisfied with the make-up itself.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to a fifteen year old niece.  It is small and will fit in a purse.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this as a gift. She reports that it is small and easy to carry, has many different color options and the make-up stays on well. It has make-up for different skin tones, so she can share with friends.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s ok....not a favorite.....but still good....It came on time and not messed up or broke....someone else might just love it!:)</li>
            <li> Nice little compact of color and shadings, Just the right size and the right selection for a great price and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> The shades that you actually get  are a little darker compared to what is pictured here to but I find them pretty nonetheless. I think people with dark hues would enjoy this. The products do not melt - I have this for a couple months now - and they do not &#x27;bleed&#x27; when on your face. The case itself is quite compact and can fit into a handbag or large purse without much bulk. There is also labelling to assist the novice. This product is definitely good quality and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.Easy to carry and has very good materials. The thing I liked the most besides its contents is the tough made of the box unlike other makeups I bought.</li>
            <li> Daughter likes it-- she looked like a clown the roar few days of &amp;#34;practicing&amp;#34;. But she got the hang if it. Good case, she likes it plenty.</li>
            <li> Got this for my teen who was just beginning to use makeup.  Nice collection of colors, seem to wash off easily and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the makeup staining their laundry.  As with most sets not enough applicators, but the ones that came with it held up</li>
            <li> True to image, many colors to choose from, and when applied their is no cheap look to the product. It&#x27;s great. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors in this case! i thought it would be a little cheap for the price I paid, but no its a grate buy! I love it!</li>
            <li> box is difficult to open.  bottom drawer with the comes out of alignment to easily and is hard to put back properly.</li>
            <li> My wife love this im thinking of getting her another similar set with a lil more make up. she says its the best se came acrossfor such cheap price</li>
            <li> This product works great I love it I use mostly the eye shadow the eye shadow never spreads or gets every were  . The only thing is u have to push down I little bit for it to stand out more ...love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I suspected when I ordered it - low grade makeup so I got what I paid for and most likely will never use it but pass it on to the kiddies for them to play grownup.</li>
            <li> Is very practical,good for teenager ,and very special for gift to somebody,just send to request,and arrived very fast,the colors in the box is pretty</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is really bad. The colors are broken and some colors have 1/2 the quantity. The outside of the box contains lot of color marks like a used one. Totally disappointed about this product.</li>
            <li> This product was a perfect. I would defiantly recommend this product to others. The price was a great steal as well.</li>
            <li> This makeup is worth buying just because you can tell the difference when using different colors. Will buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I love elf&#x27;s makeup it&#x27;s so reliable and in my worst situations this is my go to make I strongly recommend this make after you use it you&#x27;ll want more of elf&#x27;s makeup.</li>
            <li> Packaging was easy to get into and very secure for the product. Colors are amazing, consistency is great, arrived from Amazon fully intact. Will be using this as my go to makeup kit!</li>
            <li> e.l.f Studio, Makeup Clutch, 1.88-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;JA Cosmetics  LOW QUALITY</li>
            <li> Great all in one makeup case. All I need is foundation, eyeliner, and this case, and I have a complete collection of makeup. Great for at home or on trips. The variety of colors provide all my needs.</li>
            <li> So this little compact is cute.On the bottom it comes with a bronzer 2 blushes which btw are very pigmented some lip gloss and eyebrow powder/gel.i dont really dig the gel it doesnt really stay on my brows, but the powder is a nice brown color. i didnt get a chance to use the lip gloss because when i dipped my blush brush in the bronzer and blushes a lot of the powder got on the glosses.Now on top are a bunch of eyeshadows which are really pigmented and work great! this was a total success even though i really only use this for the blushes/bronzer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a 12 year old.  She is in hogs heaven!  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; makeup and she&#x27;s dared her mother to touch it!</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d change about it is get rid of the lip glosses. I don&#x27;t use them because they don&#x27;t show up, and the powder gets in them.</li>
            <li> awesome product, small compact and efficient... I usually wear bear minerals and mac however I am learning how to contour my face and this product is awesome... eyeshadows, blush and bronzer work great ...last a long time however the lipglosses suck! I really love the eyebrow shadow ...recommend it its cheaper here than in elf&#x27;s website</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my young daughter to play with - just to get her out of my make up. It was a perfect size. Very compact. She loves it.</li>
            <li> this is the worst purchase I have made in my life, I do not refieron me the quality but the condition in which it I received. This came in pieces, I think that&#x27;s why they sold it so cheap. but I think a lack of ethics and professionalism send things in bad shape, I feel robbed to this acquisition.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this item-love the choices of eye shadow-blush-and lip colors. It will be easy to take along and have it when I need it.</li>
            <li> Its very cheap like and Horrible I don&#x27;t like how they shipped it and how it breaks so easily wow</li>
            <li> This makeup clutch was great. It had great colors and was easy to use. The only issue I had was the brushes were  not really usable to apply the eye color.</li>
            <li> Got this set for mu niece....she absolutely loved it! She&#x27;s just into make up, and this was the perfect choice for her. Inexpensive, and most importantly, durable.</li>
            <li> i have the same exact thing, except i bought mine at big lots for a cheaper price at $10 so if you really do want this, i would recommend checking bit lots first!!!</li>
            <li> the item was received damaged and I was not able to use it&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy with the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0065ZC4XA B0065ZC4XA]]</li>
            <li> Bought this a couple yrs ago and I still use it today. The shadows are super bright and pigmented. Great for creating effects.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this, it reminds me of kids play make up. The slide out part is very hard to open as well.</li>
            <li> Great value for this kit. Eyeshadows are not very pigmented. Good idea to buy one for young girls just starting out with makeup, can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> This is great for overnight stays.  Less makeup to pack.  Everything I use except Mascara and eye/lip pencils.  Please note that it has White shimmer and brow powder and cream.  Those are pluses for me.</li>
            <li> Two of the eye shadow powders were broken and the powder was all over the inside &amp; outside of the case</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 set, but two fo them were damaged and again I ordered two. This time i got it in good condition. But there are no puff/brushes to apply the blushers/compact. I dont know how we can apply that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to gift this to my relatives. Hope they will like it.</li>
            <li> Fragile, but good for that price</li>
            <li> Not what i expected. It&#x27;s tiny and my kids only used it once and it broke. But, my kids enjoyed playing with the makeup and it washed off easily</li>
            <li> needs more applicators. it it a good buy, it is small, it is ok for travel or a night out</li>
            <li> I am almost never disappointed with E.L.F products. They produce wonderful makeup at an extremely cheap price. I use to carry around this big clunky on-the-go makeup bag that took up a lot of space in my purse and this has completely replaced it. It is a cute and small but still has a lot of makeup in it. It has everything you need for a  complete quick makeup look in emergency situations or on the go, (as long as you have the right tools as well). I love that it also included eyebrow makeup and a highlighter color because that is so easily overlooked by beginners.  The lip glosses have this wonderful color to them when applied, I am really fond of the red. If you like soft red lips, it is great, you don&#x27;t even need lipstick unless you want a very dramatic red lip.  The eyeshadows have a great color and opacity for the price and there is plenty of range in color.  Really I would recommend this to all women who like to have on-the-go makeup. Super light and easy to carry around and jammed packed with everything you need.</li>
            <li> Way too big for my purse.</li>
            <li> Eye shadow was okay.  Entire bottom tray was crushed upon delivery.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to take along with you anywhere as it is lightweight and small. It has everything you could want! The colors have good pigment and stay on for a long time. It&#x27;s the perfect makeup kit for a beginner or someone advanced to have in their collection! I love mine!</li>
            <li> I hardly ever use this. I feel like it is bad quality. When I do grab for it...it is to use the blush only.</li>
            <li> i received this item in excellent condition however its extremely low pigmented. i even used it with my elf eyelid primer and that did not have much of an effect... the bronzer and blush is excellent has a nice finish however the shadows were a bit disappointing.. i am usually a hugggee fan of elf but was disappointed with the pigmentation.. i get better pigmentation from my avon palette :(</li>
            <li> I think this PORDUCT IS AMAZING! I use it all the time . Thanks for my Makeup clutch I loved it !!! :)</li>
            <li> Just like the description. It&#x27;s an inexpensive makeup that doesn&#x27;t last very long, but looks nice and has a good variety.</li>
            <li> Not very good makeup.  I can get better at Wal-Mart.  The colors are very bright in the eyeshadow section.  The rest are okay.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my daughter!</li>
            <li> Good make up set. set nice pack that it comes in . Great colors! Great buy for any one. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very satisfy. I use eye shadow and like the different selections of colors.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow made my eyes itchy. I dont like the colors as much as the last version of this product that was made prior to this one. I like the eyebrown creme a lot though. Lipgloss too. Blush is hard to apply/blend, it&#x27;s not powdery enough.</li>
            <li> great item for gifting</li>
            <li> OH EM GEE!!!! I LOVE this palette! Can&#x27;t say it enough!! Seriously though, I only bought MAC makeup for MANY years and I&#x27;ve always wanted to have many different colors and not spend a fortune on them. Well...I saw this and said, ok, it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot and if I don&#x27;t like it, well, it&#x27;s not a big loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS-The color shows up extremely well and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;  -It&#x27;s cute, portable and inexpensive to the point where you can keep one at work, home, your car and give away  for gifts!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS- When you use the blush or bronzer, it gets into the lip gloss. (That&#x27;s the only flaw)&lt;br /&gt;But, for 10 bucks, so what?!</li>
            <li> This item I purchased for a gift.This is very beautiful looks like real clutch.The quality of this item,I do not know because it was a gift so I could not use it but Overall I liked it.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my cousins and they both loved it. The make quality is good since they got a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Love the lipgloss and eyeshadow shades. Have not used the other shades. Needed to buy lipgloss applicator/brush though. But an amazing product considering the price !</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my cousin sister and she lived it. The whole package is really good and makes a great travel makeup kit. It does look expensive and makes a great gift .</li>
            <li> This is actually a compact make up kit. I was expecting it to be abit larger but it was smaller which makes it handy.</li>
            <li> granddaughter liked it very much</li>
            <li> Love it colors are great really pleased!! The price is wonderful for the quality of makeup you receive</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this because the reviews were so good, but boy was I disappointed with the way it arrived to me. It was covered in brown powder because the bronzer had cracked into a dozen pieces. It looked like my makeup clutch had gone through a sandstorm. The bronzer powder went into every other element of the clutch. I guess I got unlucky, because if the product had arrived in good condition, it would have been wonderful. Only buy this if you&#x27;re willing to take the risk!</li>
            <li> cheaply made, i hope the content also is cheap, i didnt use it, gifted to some one else. you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> It arrived SHATTERED. There was eye shadow and blush everywhere. the whole thing was unusable and i was very disappointing</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t order this product, is very bad package itself (not amazon, not the store is the product), doesnt have any protection and the makeup dust mix with the others, the box, the package everything I just upload the pictures of this bad product.  I bought 10 for christmas presents and now I am very dissapoint with this awful makeup e.l.f product. every single box was ruined, I lost U$130 directly to the trash can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT RECOMMENDED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would liked to upload the pictures directly to amazon but I don&#x27;t have the option, so If you want to see the pictures go to: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andres</li>
            <li> i love this! The colors are beautiful and the size is small enough to fit into your purse! i love the lip glosses the most!</li>
            <li> This is a great palette, the eye shadows go on really well and stay on all day with a primer, and the blushes are really nice as well!</li>
            <li> the colors are good, although it takes a bit of experimenting to get the colors right on dark skin, since they dont apply true to what you may see. the lip gloss is lovely. i dont really use blush, but for someone lighter in complexion the blush should work well.</li>
            <li> This product has everything I need! It has a variety of eyeshadows, and two blushes and a bronzer, lip gloss, and eyebrow coloring too! The eyeshadows are great! Some are shimmer and the colors are good! Great product for a good price. Defiantly my favorite!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great makeup kit for the money you spend.  I was however unimpressed with the fact that once I opened the box, took the clutch out and opened it, there were 2 lipsticks missing!  Not real happy about that at all!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
            <li> Perfect little gift to give someone who loves makeup. The colors of the eyeshadows are just the right shade that they don&#x27;t make you look trampy and the blushes are very nice. Definitely would recommend</li>
            <li> This was a horrible thing to order, by the time i got it, the blush was everywhere. When i opened the blush drawer everything was shattered.</li>
            <li> Although it got damage in shipping this clutch is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the quality of this makeup clutch, especially considering the low cost. The eyeshadows were nicely pigmented with both matte &amp; shimmer finishes. I found the blushes, bronzers &amp; lip glosses to be of good quality as well. This could be an excellent travel set, gift, or an everyday use set. You do however need to be aware of handling this case. Some of the pressed bronzers and blushes can break if it is dropped. Nothing out of the ordinary as far as makeup goes. Overall, I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I usually like elf products, but I never got to try this one as it arrived in terrible shape. Not sure if it was packaging or product failure, but some of the compacts had broken and gotten powder all over the rest of the pigments. Very disappointing :( I did not contact the seller since it was only a couple of bucks so I can&#x27;t speak about their replacement policy or customer service.</li>
            <li> Colours look really nice and are bright on my skin. They feel nice as well. Its is really compact enough the fit in your bag. Only problem I have is the bottom tray gives a little fight to open. Guess that&#x27;s a good and bad feature because it makes it secure so it does open when traveling.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these, one for my granddaughter and one for me. I love watching her putting on makeup like her Nana... Now she&#x27;ll be able to feel more like a young lady making herself up like me... You have all you need in one case that can slip easily into your purse.</li>
            <li> this makeup clutch is  a good makeup kit to own. its compact to carry around- very nice looking and secured so make- up won&#x27;t get loose and messy in your tote. the colors are pretty standard but varied to get several looks. the eyeshadows are bright but not long lasting even with eye primer on. it won&#x27;t give you that super eye makeup finish but its good for everyday wear or a quick fix for a night out. the blush colors are also nice and goes on smoothly. the lip glosses i found to be wanting- didn&#x27;t really pop but that could be due to my browner lips. overall it&#x27;s a handy makeup clutch but if great makeup is what you are looking for this won&#x27;t be it. simply a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I must admit, other views warned me! I still hoped for a better product, it is so dry, it does not stick. It may work better on a greasy skin. It is not a shiny eye-shadow at all. It has a minimal layer of gloss on the surface of each block of eye-shadow, but it really is not glossy under that minimal layer. Besides, i did not find the collection of colors interesting at all! I must say, this was not for me.</li>
            <li> Nice makeup case, and I like that when it&#x27;s closed up it just looks like a little clutch. Seems to be good quality, although we haven&#x27;t really used it much yet. For the price, I think it&#x27;s an excellent deal.</li>
            <li> this item came smashed to piece i loved it n got soooo many positive reviews but this came  damaged i am really pissed</li>
            <li> it gorgeous, the eyeshadow colors are like they look in the picture and the blushes are really good. the only thing was that the lipglosses were a bit different from the picture but they are really pretty in real life too! i definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I was looking for a way to minimize my makeup bag for travel, this worked. Good color selection, and all in all  good makeup. I was a little concerned it wouldnt hold up with all of my traveling as the first order arrived broken up and crushed. I immediately called and they re-sent the clutch quickly with no fuss and i returned the original without a problem. It has held up so far and I have everything in one to pull out and freshen up during the day.</li>
            <li> I really love this and after i went back and forth on my decision because of previous reviews, i decided to go with it. It came unbroken and in one piece.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to pull out the bottom drawer.  Great selection of colors.</li>
            <li> I bought the e.l.f makeup clutch for my 10 year old daughter. She loves it. She uses it everyday, and her friends love it also. The makeup is good quality its a nice compact makeup kit.I would recommend it to adults and girls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a ball building up my makeup collection and thanks to E.L.F. and Amazon, I&#x27;m not having to spend a fortune to do it, and I&#x27;m getting good products!  The color selection is phenomenol and fun to experiment with!</li>
            <li> I love this makeup clutch! It has just about everything you need in the way of makeup in one thing. It&#x27;s small, so it&#x27;s easy to carry with you if you need to. I had to go out of town and it was easy and small enough to pack. The eye shadow gives you lots of choices to chose from so you can match it with the clothes you are wearing. And the blush you can chose your shade. The lip gloss you can chose what you want to wear.</li>
            <li> everything came as advertised, but no mention was made as to how it would arrive.  everything was so dried out that it had all fallen out of it&#x27;s holders (?) as it crumbled up and I got a box filled with powder, virtually none of which was in the actual &amp;#34;clutch&amp;#34;.  not sure if this is a shipping problem, or if the stuff was just that old, or if this is what normally happens when shipped via mail (doubt the shipping and mail idea, as the stuff i see in stores were never as dry as the stuff i just got)</li>
            <li> Great product! I got this a year ago and it works very well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this was that the colors don&#x27;t really stay well with eyeshadow primer, I use a Urban Decay eye primer. (THE BEST YOU CAN GET!)</li>
            <li> Palettes were cracked and all over the place when product was received</li>
            <li> Been hunting for an all in one makeup palette to tote around when on holiday. This product have everything you need apart from foundation and it&#x27;s sold at a very afforable price.</li>
            <li> I bought this to introduce my 14 year old niece to make-up. It came completely cracked, powder everywhere, as I opened the clutch the button even popped off the front! HORRIBLE. Like a box of cheap street chalk...  Ran to Ulta and grabbed a Smashbox compact for a little more money...don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Damaged, blue eye shadow all over everything. The bottom tray was broken. From the other comments, it appears someone in China needs to do a better packaging job. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I saw this product, I was really excited to buy it and when it finally arrived I expected more from it. The colors are kid of dull and drab and not as &amp;#34;poppy&amp;#34; as they display it here and on the box. Everything else was good though. I really like the lip gloss colors and the brushes. The blushes are really good too.</li>
            <li> This would have been a really cute gift for my 15 year old niece. Too bad one of the eyes shadows came loose while in transit and exploded everywhere. Be very careful with this. I had to return.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter for christtmas.  everything was whole when received. giving 4 stars because some of the eye shadows crumbled after one or two uses. otherwise she loves it. Uses it every day!</li>
            <li> purchased as a gift for my daughters friend...my daughter was SO jealous and had to have one also.  Love the E.L.F. products, super price and quality cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite cosmetic must-have! It has everything I need for my daily face and a little glitz and glam for evening wear as well!</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with product. Its very powdery and thus does not last long.  It also causes my skin itch.</li>
            <li> This is really cute! A great gift for a younger girl wanting to play with makeup, there is a good selection, and honestly the quality is better than I expected. My oldest is getting this for her 9th bday and I think she&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Palette was very messy with colours. Inside the box bronzer was completely destroyed and broken and got mixed with other colors in box. This just can not be used. Product was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I actually got this item for free directly from EyesLipsFace.com when there was a special coupon for it. I was always skeptical about these kind of all-in-one palettes, but I thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I love it! I use this every day, it is my go-to makeup. Even though there are not a ton of colors, the choices that are in this clutch are ones I already use: natural tones mostly like browns, pinks, and blacks. The other ones I use too, for flirty days and party nights-- or just to go with particular outfits I have. All eyeshadows in this palette are superb! I find that the shadow applier/sponge/brushes are great too, just the right sizes. Oh and I recommend using the E.L.F. eyelid primer ($1) before shadow application, to help give it colors that extra pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bronzer is alright for contouring, but not for an all-over hint of tan. I suggest getting the Healthy Glow Bronzers for a dollar ($1) directly from E.L.F. The blushes are super cute colors on my skin. The peachy one is for my light-hearted, casual days or summer. The pink one is for more dressy occasions. They are lightweight, not chalky, and you can layer more on if you want more of a pop. The strip of white cream/gel/goop is useful too, to give your cheeks a dewy shimmer. It&#x27;s also nice for eye corners or brow bone highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip glosses are great for gloss that comes in a palette. I prefer stand-alone glosses with wands and such-- but these get the job done. They&#x27;re pretty true to color. They haven&#x27;t been overly sticky like other glosses, haven&#x27;t melted away easily, and haven&#x27;t stained my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the eyebrow powder and gel-- I already use the E.L.F. studio eyebrow kit ($3) so I don&#x27;t use the one in this clutch as much. The colors might not be suited for everyone&#x27;s skin type and hair color. I think the powder is too light for me, but the gel is perfect. It is really up to your personal choice. I know some people who don&#x27;t do anything to their brows. But if you want to give them a try, go for it. I just don&#x27;t think this clutch offers a blond version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: the kit is super cute, compact and I use it every day for it&#x27;s amazing eyeshadows and blushes, but I suggest buying it directly from E.L.F. Cosmetics. I heard Amazon sells damaged makeup sometimes. Plus, if you get it directly from E.L.F., they always have epic sales one right after the other.g to their brows. But if you want to give them a try, go for it. I just don&#x27;t think this clutch offers a blond version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: the kit is super cute, compact and I use it every day for it&#x27;s amazing eyeshadows and blushes, but I suggest buying it directly from E.L.F.

            <li> I gave it as a gift and my sister in loved loved it. So compact and looks lovely. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup box for my sister in law . She liked it . its a okay product for the price</li>
            <li> I bought 2 by mistake, but since it was such a nice mini makeup kit I gave one to a friend. I really like it and there is such a variety of colors. The glosses and blushes are also very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Please measure this before ordering.  I was expecting this to be large but when it arrived the case is only a few inches across.  I thought I was getting a good value, but could have purchased something from a local store for this price.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift to a teenage girl, who absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, super satisfied with it. I don&#x27;t know how could i live without it. The colors are amazing, im inlove with this kit!</li>
            <li> PRIME YOUR EYES FIRST. i see alot of people complaining about how they can&#x27;t see the colors well when they apply it and they have to cake it on. well learn how to put on makeup please. about 99percent of eyeshadows need to have an eye primer applied to the base of the lid first. this helps to keep the eyeshadow on and also makes the colors vibrant. i love this purchse because i really didnt have to use much eye primer anyway. i&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my eyes and i use the bronzer as well even though im black/brown. gives my skin a nice glow to it :3 and looks wonderful in photos.</li>
            <li> This is a very good value at around $10. It&#x27;s an excellent &amp;#34;starter set&amp;#34; for a teen girl who&#x27;s getting used to wearing makeup and wants to experiment with different colors/styles and doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much money. The case is very sturdy and the makeup itself is good quality for the price. Also a nice idea for a portable or desk makeup set for someone who has to make a quick transition from day/night makeup.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got me this for christmas this year and i love it. The eyeshadows are a great variety and the little lip glosses arent too much for everyday wear. I love elf products thanks for having them!</li>
            <li> This colors are alright, but not like my last one which made my eye pops. I find the colors too light, they don&#x27;t show and don&#x27;t last long. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my bag for a touch up kit at work. It&#x27;s perfect. Very sturdy nice colors and everything in one place.</li>
            <li> I ordered 8 of those makeup clutch for my sisters, they just love it. Didn&#x27;t have any problems with shipping, product is good and worth the price i guess (I ordered it when it was for 10$ - was lucky, the next price was increased to 18$ and then few days later to 25$)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece and she loves it! Her friends love it too. She&#x27;s in beauty school and is in training for the industry.</li>
            <li> The color selection is great, but the drawer that holds the blushes is so hard to open.  When I opened the drawer, the blush was broken into 1,000 pieces.  Big mess!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my kiddo who just got her first vanity for Christmas, but I may use this myself,too.&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality...only complaint is that the clutch is kind of hard to open.</li>
            <li> She loved it she has beg me for something like this for a long time. she said she really liked it and that its has everything you would need</li>
            <li> Great assortment. I bought this as a gift for my daughter, she loved it, however I had to show her not to go oveerboard with the make-up. Young girls, what can I say, I guess we were there once.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves product</li>
            <li> Just got it in the mail the whole bottom half is broken and everywere cant use any of the bottom items :(</li>
            <li> When i got it the blush and powder was everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;When i opened the blush drawer and the powder drawer was shattered.&lt;br /&gt;Also some shadows where missing</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but I think it&#x27;s fine.. The reason I gave 3 star is because some of the particles of like the blush mixed with face shimmer and lip gloss...</li>
            <li> My wife said she liked it, though she said she would need some additional set of brushes to try out the different shades/blushes.</li>
            <li> I just bought a month and the brushes are all broke. It has a bad quality and you can barely use the lipstick on it. The eye shadows are fine,but I am afraid that latches are going to break too. The color can stay a while and I did not get alergic to.</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping, Item is as described, great transaction!! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it a big hit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this palate to travel with during the holidays.  The packaging is really sleek, compact, and cute!  Could easily be thrown into a carry-on or purse.  I LOVE ELF&#x27;s bronzer and was happy that that was included in the palate.  The eyebrow kit was nice as I haven&#x27;t used ELF&#x27;s eyebrow product before and I did enjoyed it.  The light blush is just that... really light... while the other has a nice pigmentation.  The eyeshadows are hit-and-miss in color and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip glosses really failed.  Z-E-R-O pigmentation.  The sponge applicators included are really poor quality... so plan on tossing &amp; replacing these with your own brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, nice convenient palate for traveling, but you will have to supplement with other products &amp; tools (for traveling).</li>
            <li> Wow! It&#x27;s way more than what I was expecting! The colors go on perfectly, AND lasts all day! Very, very, very happy. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more e.l.f. products. I&#x27;m just loving it!</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, I like this product. I feel that the case is a &#x27;little&#x27; difficult to open, so if you have arthritis, etc. this might not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, for the money, your not getting a super high quality product. But for the money, your getting quite a bit of product and it&#x27;s nice to be able to try different colors than you normally use and know that you haven&#x27;t paid a fortune for it.&lt;br /&gt;I find that I have to use a bit more eyeshadow than I normally do with my other cosmetics that I own. But I don&#x27;t really find that to be a huge drawback.&lt;br /&gt;The lip colors are nice though I&#x27;ve only used two of them so far so I can&#x27;t comment on all of them. They go on easy and smooth but they won&#x27;t last for hours.&lt;br /&gt;For the money, I think all in all this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> This was an item for my (12 yr old) daughter&#x27;s stocking, she was grinning ear to ear when she opened this gift.</li>
            <li> The clutch had everything in it.  The quality was good.  It has a nice variety of colors and is compact for carrying in a purse and for traveling.</li>
            <li> Idea was to have one kit to carry on vacation - this is too heavy and large.  I will keep it at work for touch-ups. price was good and the colors are nice and seem to last OK.</li>
            <li> I had purchased other E.L.F products before and this one is just as good. I can take this with me when I travel and have almost everything I need. Blush which is a great color for dark or light skin, brow powder AND gel, LOTS of great eye colors to pick from and a nice assortment of lip glosses. All the colors are well pigmented and stay on for a long time if you base with a primer on your face and well moisturized (but that can be said for almost all make up). I am VERY happy with E.L.F and will plan on using them in the future.</li>
            <li> Very organised, I&#x27;m a fan of elf makeup although i can&#x27;t quite put on makeup myself. Not quite good yet!!!</li>
            <li> I rated one star because the makeup is powdery and it comes with a huge crack on the cover, hate it.</li>
            <li> a good product, i love  it!</li>
            <li> I really like it. Arrived earlier then excepted so I am very pleased. Just the right size to carry around.</li>
            <li> I love it! It has more than the typical. It has lipgloss colors, face shimmer, eyeshadow and blush and brushes. The colors are very lasting. I tried it on and even in cold weather, the color didn&#x27;t fade. It&#x27;s worth the price! It&#x27;s a clutch that can be used to travel. I&#x27;m satisfied although I wished there would be a red eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the money. I like the colors they are nice. I guess its worth it. There are enough colors to match alot of my outfits</li>
            <li> Love the colors for the eyes and cheeks, plus the eye and lip primers. The Lip colors are great alone or in a blend.&lt;br /&gt;The case is hard plastic and the top opens like an envelope to show eye shadows and the bottom slides out as a tray with blushes, primers and lip glosses. It comes with sponge brushes, though I have a set of bristle brushes I use I got from the store that I prefer. Either work fine, I just prefer the brushes. The colors are very easy to blend, and with so many choices you can create a dramatic or natural look very easily.I would buy this product again, especilly at $16 dollars.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s a great set fully worth the price. I would buy more of these makeup sets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 and I have never really worn make up. I wore foundation for the first time a year ago at my wedding. Makeup is so pretty but so complicated,especially for a beginner like myself. I have been watching videos, trying to learn how to apply make up like a professional but its so confusing trying to choose the right foundation and then learning about something called a concealer and other makeup. I saw the positive reviews on the e.l.f studio clutch and decided to buy it. I was so excited when it arrived today.. The colors are so pretty and soft. Its the perfect size palette for my purse and the price was reasonable. Its definitely a great kit for a beginner like myself and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Why amazon is selling this kind of product, I dont understand. The box was very very old and almost all the colors got collapsed. When I received the box, I was completely disappointed. Never recommend anyone to buy this product. Going to return the same.</li>
            <li> This came nicely packaged, ordered as a christmas present and very pleased with it. Would definently recommend buying this again.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like it does in the picture. It&#x27;s made by the brand E.L.F. and comes with three brushes, even though they are just the cheap brushes.  The product isn&#x27;t bad, but because of the placement of the lip glosses and the blush, I&#x27;m not able to use the lip gloss because of the blush&#x27;s powder falling all over it.</li>
            <li> This elf make up set is the real deal. It was actually a couple dollars less than elf was selling it for. It was brand new with beautiful colors. I love the bronzer of all. People are usually dying to know what color it is.</li>
            <li> This makeup kit is perfect...it&#x27;s compact and includes all of the necessities, while still providing variety. It&#x27;s great for traveling.</li>
            <li> The container really does resemble a clutch purse. The top contains the eyeshadows, and a lower tray slides out with blush, lip products and a face highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadow colors are not depicted entirely accurately in the photo. What looked like in the photo to be a row of pinks, then purple looking shades are actually peachy orange shades and reddish browns.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the neutrals are darker than they appeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking even on the box in my hand I see the difference. The brow products are lighter in the photo, and the blush more pinky than the peachy they actually are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the colors were not totally what I had in mind. That said, the price is right. These are still products that work as well as pricey brands. This is still a handy case of products that is put together very nicely.&lt;br /&gt; I find the blush powder to be very sheer and flattering,with the ability to build up color,  and the shadow to be the same. Both feel silky and smooth.The lipsticks are sheer and glossy. I like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $10, I can just say my suggestion is this product is an excellent value, and a great buy. t&#x27;s definitely not an &#x27;everything&#x27; travel case. The reason is no liners, mascaras, concealer, foundation. But for eyes, lips and cheeks, it will do the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not about the product, but about the purchase experience. Very fast shipping. No damage to the product. All around positive purchase.</li>
            <li> ELF makes such great products that are cruelty free and work so well! I love the shadows, very pigmented, and the blush works well, not too shinny on my skin (yellow) but the coral blush looked fake on my sister&#x27;s and my mother&#x27;s skin (pink). I like the eyebrow shadows, stayed all day with no gel, but a little too brown for my ash colored brows. I did not use the lip colors but I tried them and they are more like tints. Overall its a great deal for 6 bucks!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 22 yr old daughter, and she really likes having everything in one case.  Recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the lip glosses, blush is not to bad.... Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the eye shadows don&#x27;t last very long, but still a great product for the price!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mAke up clutch by Elf! Easy to carry and has beautiful colors :) fits perfectly in my purse.</li>
            <li> This kit is good for my purse, the makeup is what I expected for ten bucks.  Its not the best make up, but it will do for days im short on time.  One thing I wish it had is a blush brush.  I have to carry my own bc there isnt one.  Other than that this is an okay kit.  Next time im going to splurge for a better one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sisters&#x27; birthday (they are twins). They love it. Good quality at a great price. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, very convinient, i can carry it in my purse, and it contains everything i need, eyeshadow,blush my favorite is the peach color, lip gloss, eyebrow color, etc</li>
            <li> I basically bought it for travel purposes. Not only the eye shadows are cool but also the lip glosses are pretty nice. Over all a great buy for the money!</li>
            <li> I love the many options that this little compact clutch offers. I use mostly the eyeshadow palettes. The colors are very vibrant. The blushes are pretty as well. The handles that it came with were flimsy and fell off but I don&#x27;t mind. Overall, you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Great bargain, and my wife has been pleased enough to again</li>
            <li> I had never purchased an e.l.f. product before so I decided to buy this makeup clutch to test the brand. If it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d learn my lesson. I ended up really liking this set. I have not used the bronzer because it is too dark for my skin tone, but I really like the eye shadow, eyebrow powder, and the lip gloss. I have used better blush, but this blush was worth the price. The eye shadow is far from MAC quality or any big names, but it is good enough for someone who is new with makeup or for a young girl. Overall, I think this palette is a good set for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> good for people who like soft makeup, like me. so im happy with the cost and the makeup. love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as I like to have a small all-in-one makeup kit I can travel with.  The base colors and variety are decent and fit the bill as far as that goes, however, the packaging is very flimsy.  The plastic outer container broke in my purse without any heavy usage and the blush broke into many little pieces.  Unless you can keep this package in a drawer without transporting it where movement can break it easily, I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This E.L.F make up kit is perfect. It comes w/  many, very pretty,colorful,light or bright, eye shadows. Ther come of easy and look very prett ALL the colors. It also comes with bronzer, blush, lip gloss, brushes,ect. VERY NICE KIT. i reccomend you buy it if your looking for a small inexpensive make up clutch</li>
            <li> Lots of color options, its very economical, and the cute case makes it easy to store! Quality of the product is just as good as my prior brand of choice!</li>
            <li> Very good price and nice quality</li>
            <li> Great for on the go glam. Upgrade when your money gets righteous. Nice for your teenager to touch up while learning how to decorate that face!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. The colors are amazing and I think you wouldn&#x27;t need to buy any other eyeshadow or blush pallets. Its got everything!!&lt;br /&gt;Just love this product and I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a makeup kit.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> i bougth this makeuo clutch thinkin i was gonna be a waste of money, but when my girlfriend tried it, she was so happy and mades me happy too,,,</li>
            <li> It looked like a cute little makeup set with mirror I wanted to give to my daughter, but the first one was broken out on the bottome base, then I requested a replacement, and the second was worst than the first.  Got a refund, but they said they would take this product off the website...did they?</li>
