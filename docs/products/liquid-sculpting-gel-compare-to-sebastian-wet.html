            <li>good stuff</li>
            <li>I have used this before and does just a good of job as Sebastian did.  </li>
            <li>Price is great, better on line price.</li>

            <li>my unruly hair nice and tame..gives me a nice undried look...</li>
            <li>While much more liquidy in application then</li>
            <li>Perfect for my extra curly hair.</li>
            <li>i use this on top of a leave in conditioner(the conditioner GV)&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li>This dupe is the best and you save major bucks vs the original.  </li>
            <li>Great, simple lightweight styling gel.  </li>
            <li>I used Sebastian Wet for years and it worked great without any build up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would say for my medium long hair i use about a good quarter or two sized squirts..</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it claimed to be just like Sebastian Wet, a product I loved and used for years.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice and has a different feel.  </li>
            <li>Have you noticed white flakes or any kind of residues.</li>
            <li>Super fast, super well packed shipping.</li>
            <li>I received my hair gel right on time.  </li>
            <li>Thank&#x27;s very much</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s exactly like it.</li>
            <li>Like the title says, it feels and works about the same as Sebastian Wet, but it does not smell great.</li>
            <li>I tried GVP Sculpting Gel after using Sebastian Wet for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>my husband&#x27;s straight hair in place</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but not like the Sebastian Wet (now discontinued)</li>
            <li>more like Wet, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>really..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve tried to replace Sebastian Wet with, and I have tried dozens of products.  </li>
            <li>I am convinced and the smell is subtle and most fitting for an adult&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>I then came across the only other good review substitute solution:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light, sweet scent that goes away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>If you find it too strong, just add some more water or use a little less.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look as nice as it did with Wet, and the smell is definitely not the same.</li>
            <li>While I can deal with the hold which is slightly different but still very similar to Wet, as an adult I couldn&#x27;t deal with the GVP hair product fragrance which smells strongly like fruity teenager bubble gum.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and has a little bit stronger hold.</li>
            <li>As many other of you who have finally run out of their stockpile of Sebastian Wet</li>
            <li>use only GVP Sculpting Gel now and spend less than half the money for it.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li>The GVP product is slightly thinner in consistency and requires a little more for each application, but not nearly enough to justify the overpriced Sebastian product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> The Sebastian Wet is over $12 for an 8 oz bottle now.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it as a Wet replacement anytime.</li>
            <li> I had been using wet for 15 years and why it went from $9.99 to $42.00 a bottle</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, I used WET since 1990 every day.</li>
            <li> Works just like Wet did.</li>
            <li> To: Sebastian Wet]]  </li>
            <li> I want to ask those who are using this instead of Wet, does it leave residue in your hair?</li>
            <li> Sebastian Wet]]</li>
            <li> I will not purchase again, still searching for a replacement to Wet.</li>
            <li> I would give it is the smell as other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> It has a terrible odor  to it and does not work as good  as WET at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the shipping costs to return them.</li>
            <li> Have always used Sebastian Wet - not easy to find.</li>
            <li> Like many others I used Sebastian Wet for years until it was discontinued - a real disappointment.  </li>
            <li> i start to mess around and loosen it...</li>
            <li> It does smell a little like bubblegum.</li>
            <li> Put a few squirts of perfume or cologne in the bottle, shake, and you have just increased its value by a billion dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This GVP product is thin and watery, leaves my hair hard.</li>
            <li> Too bad Wet is a jillion dollars now.</li>
            <li> For that reason I would not buy anymore; I&#x27;m sorry I bought 4 to save on shipping.</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells bad at all.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed to find out that the product &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; was discontinued</li>
            <li> This GVP is crap.</li>

            <li> I was so disappointed to find out that the product &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; was discontinued so I thought I would give this a try.  I love it!  I&#x27;m getting another bottle just in case this company decides to discontinue it as well.  I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> Like the title says, it feels and works about the same as Sebastian Wet, but it does not smell great. For that reason I would not buy anymore; I&#x27;m sorry I bought 4 to save on shipping. Oh well. It&#x27;s not worth the shipping costs to return them.</li>
            <li> I tried GVP Sculpting Gel after using Sebastian Wet for more than 10 years. The Sebastian Wet is over $12 for an 8 oz bottle now.  Too expensive. The GVP product is slightly thinner in consistency and requires a little more for each application, but not nearly enough to justify the overpriced Sebastian product.&lt;br /&gt;I use only GVP Sculpting Gel now and spend less than half the money for it.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> This dupe is the best and you save major bucks vs the original.  It holds my curls shiny and bouncy and my husband&#x27;s straight hair in place all nice n with a sheen.  This is about my 4th bottle in 7 yes.  Lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> Good product just like they said it would be.I would recommend it as a Wet replacement anytime.It&#x27;s great.Thank&#x27;s very much</li>
            <li> As many other of you who have finally run out of their stockpile of Sebastian Wet, I saw mixed reviews for this only off-the-shelf claimed substitute from GVP.  I bought one and gave it a try.  While I can deal with the hold which is slightly different but still very similar to Wet, as an adult I couldn&#x27;t deal with the GVP hair product fragrance which smells strongly like fruity teenager bubble gum.  I then came across the only other good review substitute solution:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BBBMPD4U3PT/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;sort_by&#x3D;MostRecentReview&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher Johnson hits the mark with his below formula:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matrix Biolage Gelle and mix it 50%-50% with water.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002CMLHAQ B002CMLHAQ]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resulting solution is very similar to \\&quot;Wet.\\&quot; While much more liquidy in application then \\&quot;Wet\\&quot;, it still works by just putting a dab in your hands, spreading across your palms, and working into hair.  It dries quickly and has a little bit stronger hold. If you find it too strong, just add some more water or use a little less.  Biolage Gelle comes is a variety of sizes so buy the smallest if you don&#x27;t believe Christopher and I.  I am convinced and the smell is subtle and most fitting for an adult&#x27;s use.  Hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> Very happy, better than the name brand. Will continue to order this product in the future. Should offer a two pack.</li>
            <li> It has a terrible odor  to it and does not work as good  as WET at all.  I had been using wet for 15 years and why it went from $9.99 to $42.00 a bottle I don&#x27;t know.  That is the only reason I quit using WET.  This GVP is crap.</li>
            <li> I just did a review on the Sabastian Stylix which is the official replacement for WET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I used WET since 1990 every day. This is the backup plan now.</li>
            <li> Super fast, super well packed shipping. Nice guy, great transaction. Will buy again. I don&#x27;t think it smells bad at all. Works just like Wet did. Too bad Wet is a jillion dollars now. Don&#x27;t like the smell?  Put a few squirts of perfume or cologne in the bottle, shake, and you have just increased its value by a billion dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Price is great, better on line price. Shipping on time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it claimed to be just like Sebastian Wet, a product I loved and used for years. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s exactly like it. My hair doesn&#x27;t look as nice as it did with Wet, and the smell is definitely not the same. But it&#x27;s a little better than some of the expensive products I have tried so I&#x27;ll probably keep using it.</li>
            <li> Like many others I used Sebastian Wet for years until it was discontinued - a real disappointment.  This is the generic replacement and it is \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice and has a different feel.  I haven&#x27;t found another substitute and will continue to us this until I do.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my extra curly hair.</li>
            <li> Running low on my last bottles of Sebastian Wet so I decided to give this product a try.  It is very similar.  The only knock I would give it is the smell as other reviewers have mentioned.  It does smell a little like bubblegum.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0041TF6SW GVP Liquid Sculpting Gel Compare To: Sebastian Wet]]  Have always used Sebastian Wet - not easy to find. Trying this in place of and seems to work good. Great  ship time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but not like the Sebastian Wet (now discontinued) it professes to be like.  If you&#x27;re like me and still looking for&lt;br /&gt;something more like Wet, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> i use this on top of a leave in conditioner(the conditioner GV)&lt;br /&gt;makes my unruly hair nice and tame..gives me a nice undried look...&lt;br /&gt;unless i start to mess around and loosen it...good stuff really..&lt;br /&gt;i would say for my medium long hair i use about a good quarter or two sized squirts..&lt;br /&gt;have&#x27;nt noticed white flakes</li>
            <li> I want to ask those who are using this instead of Wet, does it leave residue in your hair? Have you noticed white flakes or any kind of residues. Thanks[[ASIN:B0041TF6SW GVP Liquid Sculpting Gel Compare To: Sebastian Wet]]</li>
            <li> This GVP product is thin and watery, leaves my hair hard. I used Sebastian Wet for years and it worked great without any build up. Sebastian Wet added volume and softness to my natural hair. I will not purchase again, still searching for a replacement to Wet.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for my hair.</li>
            <li> I received my hair gel right on time.  I have used this before and does just a good of job as Sebastian did.  It is a good replacement since Sebastian has stopped makeing this gel!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff.  It&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve tried to replace Sebastian Wet with, and I have tried dozens of products.  Great, simple lightweight styling gel.  Light, sweet scent that goes away in a few minutes.</li>
