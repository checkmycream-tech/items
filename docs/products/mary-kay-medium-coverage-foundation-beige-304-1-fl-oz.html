            <li>They are reasonable and very good products all of them.</li>
            <li>I love the consistence of this product.</li>
            <li>And I have tried many foundations over the years.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the foundation.</li>
            <li>i love Mary Kay products.  </li>
            <li>I love this Mary Kay foundation.</li>
            <li>This was packed and shipped safely and on time.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>It was for my precious mother in law who lives with us.</li>
            <li>This foundation is very light and easy to blend in with your makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love that I can buy my Mary Kay at such a great price online...</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t clog the pores.</li>
            <li>It always goes on really smooth and even and has never irritated or bothered my skin in any way.</li>
            <li>i like t because it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>but was way too light, I would try it again if I had a sample of colors</li>
            <li>thanks for offering at such a good price!</li>
            <li>I tried the full coverage and it made me look clown like.  </li>
            <li>This made me believe that the makeup was an older product, although it seems to be okay.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>The medium coverage has just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>After buying foundations at different stores for many years, I was glad to get back to this.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, the color was what I expected, formula nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li>Thanks but the color is not what I am used to.</li>
            <li>I really like their 3-1 cleanser.</li>
            <li>it makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest better packaging just in case this is a gift but other than that</li>
            <li>no matter what the &amp;#34;latest &amp; greatest&amp;#34; new thing is...</li>
            <li>This one is very natural.</li>
            <li>I like the foundation because it takes very little to blend in with my complexion, and I have used it for more the 15 years.  </li>
            <li>got it fixed</li>
            <li>This is the only foundation I use because you only need a tiny bit and it looks natural if you match your skin tone the right way.</li>
            <li>It had the older Mary Kay brand pink cap rather than the silver cap pictured.</li>
