            <li>Works ok with my thinner hair.</li>
            <li>Love the product but who ever shipped it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really shiny and fairly lightweight.</li>
            <li>Since TIGI products are usually consistently good, I really think it was ruined during shipping.  </li>

            <li>Made my hair really greasy and flat.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair shiny, soft and gives just enough separation for ultimate sassyness.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my hair, except weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>I have long and wavy all-over-the-place hair and this product really helps tame my frizz after I blow dry it straight.</li>

            <li> My stylist recommend this product to me and I am in love! It does have gloss in it which is great. The bottle states use 2 to 3 pumps but that is just too much. I use 1 pump and get great looking hair!  I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since I stated using it.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and manageable but still has some body. My favorite new product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! I love everything about it: smell, texture, and the result.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I suggest using it with other Bed Head items like their shampoo and conditioner. Otherwise it can make your hair feel weird. This makes my hair shiny, soft and gives just enough separation for ultimate sassyness.</li>

            <li> Love it...it was 22.00 elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This product is great for styling your hair. It smells delicious!</li>

            <li> Makes my thick hair fuller with great shine!</li>
            <li> did not like this at all! It did not add body and my hair felt dry .</li>
            <li> This product might volumize...but I will never know because the smell is so atrocious (like really bad candy cologne) I absolutely can&#x27;t have it anywhere around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a trend with this company wanting their products to smell like candy (RIP bed head manipulator).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as a volumizer for me.  Made my hair really greasy and flat.  Normally I love TIGI products.  This is the first one that I was completely unhappy with. It took a long time to arrive (several weeks) and it was shipped during sub-zero weather.  I suspected it may have been damaged by the weather because I&#x27;ve had hand lotions and other products change consistency after being shipped in the cold luggage/cargo compartments of airlines.  I tried to return it, but they wouldn&#x27;t take it back.  Told me to contact the manufacturer!  I won&#x27;t do business with this vendor again and I won&#x27;t risk buying this product again, just in case the next one produces the same bad results.  Since TIGI products are usually consistently good, I really think it was ruined during shipping.  Frustrated that the vendor refused to refund my money.</li>
            <li> this stuff does what is says it will do...makes my hair very easy to comb thru and smells great!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Works ok with my thinner hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product but who ever shipped it the lid was not tight and it leaked out some. And I can not get the lid to unscrew and pop up.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have thin hair and it definitely made a difference.  Not a &amp;#34;clubber&amp;#34; so the UV glow is pointless but it does add a bit of shine.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair but I have a lot of it. Its also color treated. This product is awesome. Hands down.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this on my hair and I had to have it!  It is amazing!!!!</li>
