            <li> wife loves this stuff - keep the triple packs coming!</li>
            <li> Great product, great service. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Smells heavenly!</li>
            <li> as advertised,great product!</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent and colors water a bit nucely</li>
            <li> I am giving this three stars because of the prompt service.  Took a bath with this and my women parts did not like this at all.  I ended up with a really nasty rash down there.  I read the ingredients and notice that this stuff has way to many fragrances for me.  I usually buy something similar at the Whole Food Market that cost more and thought that this would be comparable.  It is not.  Back to the Whole Food Market I go.</li>
            <li> Great gift! Wonderful surprise. Really enjoyed using it in her bath.</li>
            <li> This product does the job.  I put the 2 capfuls in the water and soaked for about 20 minutes and the pain in my legs went away and didn&#x27;t return. It really works.</li>
            <li> Actually, my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Probably the best bath salts I&#x27;ve ever bought. The smell is FANTASTIC and they work wonders!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!! Love the fragrance not too powerful....</li>
            <li> Use to purchase this a Walgreens, they quit carrying it.  I love lavender and this product when I take baths after a long day working outside.  I will be back to purchase more of this .......... I wish stores would carry the lavender.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foot soaking therapy.  Smells great, is relaxing and soothing and softens the skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> I love this product, so relaxing.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!!! works well!!!</li>
            <li> I placed two separate orders for these bath salts to use in favors for a baby shower.  They smell amazing and I am sure will be enjoyed by all.  Just wanted to note, though, that both orders were not filled with the &amp;#34;Restless Nights Relief&amp;#34; bath salts which contain lavender, chamomile and passion flower.  I received a very similar product called &amp;#34;Aches + Pains Nighttime Relief&amp;#34; (same color salts) but contain lavender, chamomile and menthol.  Not sure why there&#x27;s a difference, but am a little surprised.  Anyway, bottom line, I am satisfied with the bath salts or the reason I bought them.</li>
            <li> Perfectly relaxing scent, love how my skin feels n smells after a relaxing bath</li>
