            <li>This product is really great.</li>
            <li>I Love it!!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fabulous!!!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant to me.  </li>
            <li>I apply a good moisturizer over it and then my make-up.</li>
            <li>Ended up being good</li>
            <li>But my dermatologist says that this is one of the best products available for aging skin.</li>
            <li>He was originally with Cellex, which is also excellent, then he opened Skinceuticals.  </li>
            <li>These products are excellent and really deliver results!!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my skincuticals purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased also with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I thought I give it a try, as I had read many great reviews on the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been my favorite for 1 year !</li>
            <li>the results are even better!</li>
            <li>my skin never looked better!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a product that works!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for those of us who are in our years of beginning to show signs of aging.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing what this can do for your skin - spots, acne, lines, everything improved.</li>
            <li>i have heard and read amazing comments and reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li>it tingles nicely when put on and gives the impression of a protective product.</li>
            <li>I use this every morning after I rinse my face either from the shower or just luke warm water after rising for the morning.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice alternative to a cream moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so I feel it&#x27;s better to spend the money on something that is effective vs. wasting money on a bunch of cheaper products that don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is one very important thing I do which no one else has mentioned on here.</li>
            <li>I put this serum on very lightly as it does spread well and absorbs well also.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>And the price is much better than you find at a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I do not believe this vendor was selling an authentic product.</li>
            <li>I love this Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>but at $100 per oz. is over the top.  </li>
            <li>Better options are out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Skinceuticals CE Ferulic for four years now and truly believe that it has magic powers.</li>
            <li>Not a day goes by that someone doesn&#x27;t comment on my skin. :)</li>
            <li>and I meant way more color than the one I bought from this sellers.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that is does feel smoother and definitely more even.  </li>
            <li>My siblings have more wrinkles than I do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this with Obagi products for a year, and my skin is much more youthful.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to be able to order it online.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Prompt  delivery in a safe cardboard box.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better, brighter, or healthier.</li>
            <li>so glad I went out on a limb and tried this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and more even</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great sale.  </li>
            <li>Put it on with fingers, not in palm of hand for better absorption into face.</li>
            <li>Makes me look much better even though I am in my 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, more toned.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years, every day, and it continues to be my favorite antioxidant serum for day.</li>
            <li>love luv it</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>i really love this serum..</li>
            <li>This was a brilliant breakthrough by Dr Sheldon Pinnell, recently deceased, of Duke University many years ago.  </li>
            <li>amazing product, worth every penny</li>
            <li>Said it&#x27;s the most important process a woman can use on her face.  </li>
            <li>Gave me full credit after I sent them picture, but would rather have received the product!</li>
            <li>This means that the refrigeration is preventing oxidation of the product and allowing it to stay effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly, \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; product is still effective but I really think that the clearer the product is, the better.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Testing has been done for years on it and it is now a proven fact that it decreases wrinkles dramatically, softens fine lines . . .  </li>
            <li>When hunting for Vit C serum, I happened onto skinceuticals and know their products are fantastic....</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last two months with great results.  </li>
            <li>great product- use daily in a routine with B5 hydrating  Gel.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, for price like this with free shipping, if I did place this order, I must click the free shipping option.</li>
            <li>Great product and have used for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li>Skincare companies have us by the hair roots charging over the top prices for a product that may or may not be better than a much cheaper option...such as this one.  </li>
            <li>I really just don&#x27;t want to be that aware of how my skin feels unless it feels really good.  </li>
            <li>The product is awesome as usual, I&#x27;ve been using it since 8 years ago</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>It was like water and absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li>Does an excellent job on keeping your face soft as a baby all day long.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s really brilliant.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure I was really seeing a difference and not just fooling myself.  </li>
            <li>The vendor was quick to answer my questions and crediting my account.</li>
            <li>It soaks into my skin quickly and then I can put on my moisturizer and/or sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Although more expensive, it&#x27;s best to buy from a salon when they have a sale.  </li>
            <li>If I by something new on Amazon I want to be sure it is NEW.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first hing I put on my face after a shower every day!</li>
            <li>Fantastic skin care product that really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone, especially mature women who need to protect their skin from free radicals, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so powerful</li>
            <li>When I order it, I make sure it is almost completely clear (if not then return it).</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Keeps skin fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li>FRESH Skinceutical product (no yellowing in the CE Ferulic), promptly shipped.</li>
            <li>Might be a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Really powerful.</li>
            <li>And this time, the photo proves it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s a big deal to you, just don&#x27;t use it on important days or before a date :)</li>
            <li>It came in packaging that was torn, used and appeared to not be original and makes me wonder if it is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 years, beginning right after fraxel treatments for my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed some laugh lines around my mouth for the first time.  </li>
            <li>First of all, for anti-oxidant serum, I tend to look for fresh ones from official website.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and reduces sun damage and fine lines.</li>
            <li>(My particular vendor - OTA - sent me fresh product quickly, and I&#x27;ll review them elsewhere for that.)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the first problem I have</li>
            <li>that is a great product for my face and mixing it this way would make it easier to get an even application of ce feulic while avoiding the icky skin coloring.</li>
            <li>Platinum skincare is a much cheaper way to get this serum and is ALWAYS fresh and theraputic strength.  </li>
            <li>also use 30 SPF or more daily after any day cream !&lt;</li>
            <li>but I just want to post this so someone might be able to answer me correctly what&#x27;s is going on or this seller just mixed with water and resell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and alive.  </li>
            <li>It has the exact ingredients in it for anti-aging.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for several years and love how it keeps my skin clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product  has been  a  staple in my daily skin care and  has kept my skin  nourished and healthy for  years.</li>
            <li>i am willing to make.</li>
            <li>After reading comments about ordering this item on line and the concern that it would be old product I took the risk and was happy to find the color was clear not yellow.</li>
            <li>Better than most big brand names that cost multiple times more and one bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Although it may work with very well with all skin types I&#x27;d recommend checking with your dermatologist first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and it keeps my skin healthy looking and from getting large pores as I get older.</li>
            <li>will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>I started to notice diminished fine lines around my eyes about 2 weeks after beginning daily use of this product.</li>
            <li>Should be a very light yellow almost clear.</li>
            <li>and I promise if results are fabulous, I&#x27;ll come back to this review and say it.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely order from this site again...</li>
            <li>Thanks in part to this vitamin C product introduced to me by my dermatologist 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>can really go through this-</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates and nourishes your skin.  </li>
            <li>Over time this stuff really does improve the texture of your skin over time.</li>
            <li>and I really like using it.</li>
            <li>but perhaps I have prevented my skin to look old and prudish!!!</li>
            <li>Other&#x27;s may not be able to tolerate it well and get inflammation.</li>
            <li>Had some concerns based on other reviews, but am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It hydrates my skin better than other lotions</li>
            <li>It is the most stable form of Vit C and remain active in the skin.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this vitamin C serum to ward off fine lines and dry aging skin.</li>
            <li>(I think she&#x27;s in her late 30&#x27;s) found out that I&#x27;m going to be 50 soon and asked me how I look so good since I&#x27;m so old!</li>
            <li>The color of this product goes from clear into light yellow, then into amber and brown when it is expired.  </li>
            <li>(the high price is often an issue), but the truth is, it works...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and my skin looks so much better than before.</li>
            <li>I can send this back and get a fresh one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normal to turn brownish after a while.  </li>
            <li>The only Con I have is that it is an open bottle with a dropper, so it can be easily knocked over.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the products on my \\&quot;can&#x27;t live</li>
            <li>Even after a year of being refigerated, it only turns light yellow.</li>
            <li>Ok, my aesthetician talked me into buying this bottle for a little over $140!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same quality as the one in dermatologist office.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the past five years and feel that it is helping to keep my skin more youthful</li>
            <li>When I received my replacement, it was crystal clear.</li>
            <li>I love the sun and this baby seems to reverse or at least protect me.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>You never no how old the product is.&lt;br /&gt;why does Amazone allow this from a respected company or retailer.</li>
            <li>This and retin A are really the gold standard in skin care.</li>
            <li>would like an answer because the different is too much.</li>
            <li>or it is old.  </li>
            <li>Not for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53 years old.</li>
            <li>I was surprised as I payed over $100.00 for it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this until much later and my estatician has since told me that buying them online is not safe since it will most likely be expired and stored in a hot warehouse.  </li>
            <li>it is old.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for any age person because it makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>And I do remember reading some reviews about Amazon selling old serum.</li>
            <li>and I have notice a marked improvement in tone and texture on my face and decolletage since I began using it months ago.</li>
            <li>I apply over my entire face daily and, not only has the hyper-pigmentation completely disappeared, but I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement in the smoothness of my skin and the disappearance of fine lines near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those with similar skin.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about spending this much money on one product, but it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li>serum absorbs very fast and instantly has a tightening effect on your skin; skin stays moist and plump all day long.</li>
            <li>this new(?) product comes without the carton box, but only wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li>My cheeks were so dry in the winters while my t-zone was very oily.  </li>
            <li>When you buy this directly from Skinceuticles, it is completely transparent and not yellow.</li>
            <li>After using my first for just a few weeks I had a friend ask me what I was doing differently as my face looked so much clearer and fresher.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll have to pay full price next time, but at least I&#x27;ll get the real thing.</li>
            <li>The price tag takes a little getting used to, but it is SO worth it.</li>
            <li>This product not only faded my freckles, but also helped reduce crows feet near my eyes and increased the brilliance of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Yellow being old product and should not be used.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t figure out which is the better product, Obagi (which generally is not a cheap line) is over half the price of CE Ferulic.</li>
            <li>It may sting slightly the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>The serum I received from Amazon was old and deep yellow.</li>
            <li>but my husband is 50 and we were looking at an old picture from a couple of months ago and his skin looks ten years younger.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and a little goes a long way so the price evens out over time.</li>
            <li>This product is a must have for sun-damaged, mature skin that is not sensitive, you will notice a difference the very next morning after one use, your face will look illuminated and renewed.</li>
            <li>and I really do not have a very sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>and after using the CE Ferulic daily for about a week or two, I can already see how much smoother my skin is and less splotchy.  </li>
            <li>Have been using for several years and do not have one single wrinkle on the old face.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> But my dermatologist says that this is one of the best products available for aging skin.</li>
            <li> He was originally with Cellex, which is also excellent, then he opened Skinceuticals.  </li>
            <li> These products are excellent and really deliver results!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my skincuticals purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased also with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I thought I give it a try, as I had read many great reviews on the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been my favorite for 1 year !</li>
            <li> the results are even better!</li>
            <li> my skin never looked better!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a product that works!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for those of us who are in our years of beginning to show signs of aging.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing what this can do for your skin - spots, acne, lines, everything improved.</li>
            <li> i have heard and read amazing comments and reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li> it tingles nicely when put on and gives the impression of a protective product.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning after I rinse my face either from the shower or just luke warm water after rising for the morning.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative to a cream moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so I feel it&#x27;s better to spend the money on something that is effective vs. wasting money on a bunch of cheaper products that don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one very important thing I do which no one else has mentioned on here.</li>
            <li> I put this serum on very lightly as it does spread well and absorbs well also.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> And the price is much better than you find at a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this vendor was selling an authentic product.</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> but at $100 per oz. is over the top.  </li>
            <li> Better options are out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Skinceuticals CE Ferulic for four years now and truly believe that it has magic powers.</li>
            <li> Not a day goes by that someone doesn&#x27;t comment on my skin. :)</li>
            <li> and I meant way more color than the one I bought from this sellers.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that is does feel smoother and definitely more even.  </li>
            <li> My siblings have more wrinkles than I do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with Obagi products for a year, and my skin is much more youthful.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to be able to order it online.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Prompt  delivery in a safe cardboard box.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better, brighter, or healthier.</li>
            <li> so glad I went out on a limb and tried this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and more even</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great sale.  </li>
            <li> Put it on with fingers, not in palm of hand for better absorption into face.</li>
            <li> Makes me look much better even though I am in my 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, more toned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years, every day, and it continues to be my favorite antioxidant serum for day.</li>
            <li> love luv it</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> i really love this serum..</li>
            <li> This was a brilliant breakthrough by Dr Sheldon Pinnell, recently deceased, of Duke University many years ago.  </li>
            <li> amazing product, worth every penny</li>
            <li> Said it&#x27;s the most important process a woman can use on her face.  </li>
            <li> Gave me full credit after I sent them picture, but would rather have received the product!</li>
            <li> This means that the refrigeration is preventing oxidation of the product and allowing it to stay effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly, \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; product is still effective but I really think that the clearer the product is, the better.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Testing has been done for years on it and it is now a proven fact that it decreases wrinkles dramatically, softens fine lines . . .  </li>
            <li> When hunting for Vit C serum, I happened onto skinceuticals and know their products are fantastic....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last two months with great results.  </li>
            <li> great product- use daily in a routine with B5 hydrating  Gel.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, for price like this with free shipping, if I did place this order, I must click the free shipping option.</li>
            <li> Great product and have used for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li> Skincare companies have us by the hair roots charging over the top prices for a product that may or may not be better than a much cheaper option...such as this one.  </li>
            <li> I really just don&#x27;t want to be that aware of how my skin feels unless it feels really good.  </li>
            <li> The product is awesome as usual, I&#x27;ve been using it since 8 years ago</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It was like water and absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job on keeping your face soft as a baby all day long.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s really brilliant.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure I was really seeing a difference and not just fooling myself.  </li>
            <li> The vendor was quick to answer my questions and crediting my account.</li>
            <li> It soaks into my skin quickly and then I can put on my moisturizer and/or sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Although more expensive, it&#x27;s best to buy from a salon when they have a sale.  </li>
            <li> If I by something new on Amazon I want to be sure it is NEW.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first hing I put on my face after a shower every day!</li>
            <li> Fantastic skin care product that really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone, especially mature women who need to protect their skin from free radicals, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so powerful</li>
            <li> When I order it, I make sure it is almost completely clear (if not then return it).</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Keeps skin fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li> FRESH Skinceutical product (no yellowing in the CE Ferulic), promptly shipped.</li>
            <li> Might be a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Really powerful.</li>
            <li> And this time, the photo proves it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s a big deal to you, just don&#x27;t use it on important days or before a date :)</li>
            <li> It came in packaging that was torn, used and appeared to not be original and makes me wonder if it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 years, beginning right after fraxel treatments for my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed some laugh lines around my mouth for the first time.  </li>
            <li> First of all, for anti-oxidant serum, I tend to look for fresh ones from official website.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft and reduces sun damage and fine lines.</li>
            <li> (My particular vendor - OTA - sent me fresh product quickly, and I&#x27;ll review them elsewhere for that.)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the first problem I have</li>
            <li> that is a great product for my face and mixing it this way would make it easier to get an even application of ce feulic while avoiding the icky skin coloring.</li>
            <li> Platinum skincare is a much cheaper way to get this serum and is ALWAYS fresh and theraputic strength.  </li>
            <li> also use 30 SPF or more daily after any day cream !&lt;</li>
            <li> but I just want to post this so someone might be able to answer me correctly what&#x27;s is going on or this seller just mixed with water and resell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin looks smooth and alive.  </li>
            <li> It has the exact ingredients in it for anti-aging.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for several years and love how it keeps my skin clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product  has been  a  staple in my daily skin care and  has kept my skin  nourished and healthy for  years.</li>
            <li> i am willing to make.</li>
            <li> After reading comments about ordering this item on line and the concern that it would be old product I took the risk and was happy to find the color was clear not yellow.</li>
            <li> Better than most big brand names that cost multiple times more and one bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Although it may work with very well with all skin types I&#x27;d recommend checking with your dermatologist first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and it keeps my skin healthy looking and from getting large pores as I get older.</li>
            <li> will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I started to notice diminished fine lines around my eyes about 2 weeks after beginning daily use of this product.</li>
            <li> Should be a very light yellow almost clear.</li>
            <li> and I promise if results are fabulous, I&#x27;ll come back to this review and say it.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely order from this site again...</li>
            <li> Thanks in part to this vitamin C product introduced to me by my dermatologist 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> can really go through this-</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> It gently exfoliates and nourishes your skin.  </li>
            <li> Over time this stuff really does improve the texture of your skin over time.</li>
            <li> and I really like using it.</li>
            <li> but perhaps I have prevented my skin to look old and prudish!!!</li>
            <li> Other&#x27;s may not be able to tolerate it well and get inflammation.</li>
            <li> Had some concerns based on other reviews, but am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It hydrates my skin better than other lotions</li>
            <li> It is the most stable form of Vit C and remain active in the skin.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this vitamin C serum to ward off fine lines and dry aging skin.</li>
            <li> (I think she&#x27;s in her late 30&#x27;s) found out that I&#x27;m going to be 50 soon and asked me how I look so good since I&#x27;m so old!</li>
            <li> The color of this product goes from clear into light yellow, then into amber and brown when it is expired.  </li>
            <li> (the high price is often an issue), but the truth is, it works...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and my skin looks so much better than before.</li>
            <li> I can send this back and get a fresh one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s normal to turn brownish after a while.  </li>
            <li> The only Con I have is that it is an open bottle with a dropper, so it can be easily knocked over.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the products on my \\&quot;can&#x27;t live</li>
            <li> Even after a year of being refigerated, it only turns light yellow.</li>
            <li> Ok, my aesthetician talked me into buying this bottle for a little over $140!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the same quality as the one in dermatologist office.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past five years and feel that it is helping to keep my skin more youthful</li>
            <li> When I received my replacement, it was crystal clear.</li>
            <li> I love the sun and this baby seems to reverse or at least protect me.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> You never no how old the product is.&lt;br /&gt;why does Amazone allow this from a respected company or retailer.</li>
            <li> This and retin A are really the gold standard in skin care.</li>
            <li> would like an answer because the different is too much.</li>
            <li> or it is old.  </li>
            <li> Not for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 years old.</li>
            <li> I was surprised as I payed over $100.00 for it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this until much later and my estatician has since told me that buying them online is not safe since it will most likely be expired and stored in a hot warehouse.  </li>
            <li> it is old.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for any age person because it makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> And I do remember reading some reviews about Amazon selling old serum.</li>
            <li> and I have notice a marked improvement in tone and texture on my face and decolletage since I began using it months ago.</li>
            <li> I apply over my entire face daily and, not only has the hyper-pigmentation completely disappeared, but I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement in the smoothness of my skin and the disappearance of fine lines near my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those with similar skin.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about spending this much money on one product, but it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> serum absorbs very fast and instantly has a tightening effect on your skin; skin stays moist and plump all day long.</li>
            <li> this new(?) product comes without the carton box, but only wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li> My cheeks were so dry in the winters while my t-zone was very oily.  </li>
            <li> When you buy this directly from Skinceuticles, it is completely transparent and not yellow.</li>
            <li> After using my first for just a few weeks I had a friend ask me what I was doing differently as my face looked so much clearer and fresher.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to pay full price next time, but at least I&#x27;ll get the real thing.</li>
            <li> The price tag takes a little getting used to, but it is SO worth it.</li>
            <li> This product not only faded my freckles, but also helped reduce crows feet near my eyes and increased the brilliance of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Yellow being old product and should not be used.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t figure out which is the better product, Obagi (which generally is not a cheap line) is over half the price of CE Ferulic.</li>
            <li> It may sting slightly the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> The serum I received from Amazon was old and deep yellow.</li>
            <li> but my husband is 50 and we were looking at an old picture from a couple of months ago and his skin looks ten years younger.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and a little goes a long way so the price evens out over time.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for sun-damaged, mature skin that is not sensitive, you will notice a difference the very next morning after one use, your face will look illuminated and renewed.</li>
            <li> and I really do not have a very sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> and after using the CE Ferulic daily for about a week or two, I can already see how much smoother my skin is and less splotchy.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for several years and do not have one single wrinkle on the old face.  </li>
            <li> Even my mother says my face hasn&#x27;t changed much in the past 15 years even though I&#x27;m in my mid 40s now.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to judge exactly what this product does,</li>
            <li> Flat out, it works.  </li>
            <li> - I was out in the sun one day for a long time and in the morning I put this on and had some left and wiped it on my shoulders - at the end of the day I had finger outlines on my shoulders and despite all the sunscreen applications throughout the day</li>
            <li> Yes, it is more expensive, but at least you get a new product.</li>
            <li> This is so weird, I don&#x27;t remember placing this order, I haven&#x27;t received my stuff, and if I placed the order, why didn&#x27;t I click the free shipping bottom?</li>
            <li> \\&quot;blooms\\&quot; after I drink red wine and some other alcohols.  </li>
            <li> if i do to try it again, i think i would use it at half dosing (just 2 or 3 drops) admixed along with skinceutical&#x27;s daily moisture cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a little over two years now, and have discontinued use for short periods of time.</li>
            <li> And though a bit pricey, a little dab will do, so the bottle lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> but I tried it anyway because I can generally get past it.  </li>
            <li> Simply wash, apply a few drops of this and apply some sunscreen</li>
            <li> I have very ruddy, rosacea-like skin (broken capillaries)</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but probably worth it if it fits in your budget.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for a few years.</li>
            <li> I am 52 and NOT ready for age spots.  </li>
            <li> Well, it took just a few days for me to actually think I was seeing a bit of fading.  </li>
            <li> As expected and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to get a response when I finally did they blamed the post office and offered a full refund.</li>
            <li> A little drop goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> i purchased this along with other skinceutical products.</li>
            <li> Question for other reviewers - did anybody select this product over Obagi&#x27;s L-ASCORBIC ACID product?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and won&#x27;t trade it for any other.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other prescription products and they did nothing.  </li>
            <li> I tried other serum..</li>
            <li> the extra sun protection and the benefits of the C and E far outweight the faint smell.</li>
            <li> was not fresh and well on</li>
            <li> The color of the product was already dark amber when I got it.  </li>
            <li> I started using CE Ferulic over 20 years ago because my dermatologist suggested it would fade my freckles which would help dark spots on my face from darkening and/or become pre-cancerous spots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about cosmetic products with a high price, but I have been using this for 6 months and won&#x27;t be without it!  </li>
            <li> I  would not recommend this product to anyone, save your money, not worth it.....</li>
            <li> Too bad, I like skinceuticals overall, but just not going to hand over that much money for 1 oz.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer with less breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Received my order in less than 3 days.</li>
            <li> The price is much less than purchasing the product from my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> In terms of delivery, the package arrived in less time than estimated when I placed the order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it takes less drops to cover your face and neck than the instructions say also.</li>
            <li> yes, it does make my face smell like cooked chicken (i read one review where the woman said it made her face smell like hot dog water,</li>
            <li> As a long time Dermatologist the array of Vit C products must be quite confusing to all of you.  </li>
            <li> My skin does not feel hydrated from this product -- in fact, it feels a little tight.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this from my skin care specialist&#x27;s office but tried purchasing it online due to a discounted price.  </li>
            <li> Very fussy and cynical when it comes to skincare.</li>
            <li> They suggest that you put 4-5 drops on, wait a few minutes before applying moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s reduced the appearance of a few deeper forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li> You will never regret you buy it although it is not cheap.</li>
            <li> L-Ascorbic acid, as contained in this product, and a few others, is what you want.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what happened.</li>
            <li> I usually order from Skinceuticals</li>
            <li> I am not sure how 4 drops can cover your face because as soon as I touch it to my skin, it is gone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s expired.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the smell, combined with the heavy, weird sort of feeling that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product a few days ago and found out what&#x27;s wrong with</li>
            <li> For the first time I was very disappointed in the skinceutical  c and e bottle I received.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for 10 yrs no great improvement in skin</li>
            <li> Came broken in pieces.</li>
            <li> Very poor service and is poor reflection on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Weird.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately it gives a sort of a jaundice color at recommended dosing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s expensive, yest</li>
            <li> A call to the manufacturer revealed that it is either a fake</li>
            <li> Its expensive but a splurge</li>
            <li> and I am sooo disappointed  </li>
            <li> Was very frustrated.</li>
            <li> When I stop using, my skin looks horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for those of us who are in our years of beginning to show signs of aging. And though a bit pricey, a little dab will do, so the bottle lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s really brilliant. I love the sun and this baby seems to reverse or at least protect me. People still think I&#x27;m about ten years younger than I am.... antioxidants are the future!</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened. It took close to three weeks to get my delivery. Was very frustrated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for over a year and I am very happy with it. I usually order from Skinceuticals but I wanted to save some money. The serum I received from Amazon was old and deep yellow. When you buy this directly from Skinceuticles, it is completely transparent and not yellow. Yes, it is more expensive, but at least you get a new product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only 3 days but my opinion is formed.  Even if continued use brings miraculous results, I doubt I would buy this again.  The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant to me.  They suggest that you put 4-5 drops on, wait a few minutes before applying moisturizer.  I did that.  The smell lingers...all day.  That&#x27;s the first problem I have and I really do not have a very sensitive nose.  But it&#x27;s the smell, combined with the heavy, weird sort of feeling that comes with it.  I really just don&#x27;t want to be that aware of how my skin feels unless it feels really good.  I&#x27;ve also noticed some laugh lines around my mouth for the first time.  Coincidence?  Weird.  Regarding smell.  I did read reviews that talked about this but I tried it anyway because I can generally get past it.  Not this one.  This may be for some people but I&#x27;ll keep looking.  I will continue to use it a bit longer...mainly because of the price and you know...the miracle...and I promise if results are fabulous, I&#x27;ll come back to this review and say it.  (My particular vendor - OTA - sent me fresh product quickly, and I&#x27;ll review them elsewhere for that.)</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and my skin looks so much better than before. Simply wash, apply a few drops of this and apply some sunscreen and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> I have used this for some time and I love it.  And the price is much better than you find at a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> i purchased this along with other skinceutical products. it tingles nicely when put on and gives the impression of a protective product. unfortunately it gives a sort of a jaundice color at recommended dosing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after finishing the bottle i noticed no difference. for the price i am hesitant to make another purchase. if i do to try it again, i think i would use it at half dosing (just 2 or 3 drops) admixed along with skinceutical&#x27;s daily moisture cream. that is a great product for my face and mixing it this way would make it easier to get an even application of ce feulic while avoiding the icky skin coloring.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the speed at which my products arrived... I would absolutely order from this site again... Of course I have ordered this product over and over again, and will never stop using it but it&#x27;s always nice when it also arrives with lightening speed!!!</li>
            <li> The expiration date is blacked out.  Is this product expired or to be expired soon?  Amazon did not give me an answer.  Product was returned.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my skincuticals purchase. I am very pleased also with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JV</li>
            <li> The product is awesome as usual, I&#x27;ve been using it since 8 years ago and I love it. I am really satisfied of my purchase, however I think the shipping was outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> Question for other reviewers - did anybody select this product over Obagi&#x27;s L-ASCORBIC ACID product? Can&#x27;t figure out which is the better product, Obagi (which generally is not a cheap line) is over half the price of CE Ferulic.</li>
            <li> I never write product reviews but I feel compelled to because Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is the only product that has had a noticeable effect on my problem skin.  I have used it on and off over the years (the high price is often an issue), but the truth is, it works...so I feel it&#x27;s better to spend the money on something that is effective vs. wasting money on a bunch of cheaper products that don&#x27;t work.  I have very ruddy, rosacea-like skin (broken capillaries) and after using the CE Ferulic daily for about a week or two, I can already see how much smoother my skin is and less splotchy.  I would buy this in bulk if I could!</li>
            <li> C E Ferulic&#x27;s immediate effects will vary from person to person. Some people may experience immediate brightening, toning and improvement in their skin texture. Other&#x27;s may not be able to tolerate it well and get inflammation. I recommend using it only once every two days if you&#x27;re having issues with inflammation (it&#x27;s what I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for EVERYBODY, this product will decelerate aging on the skin. It&#x27;s so powerful and I look forward to 20 years from now when I look younger than all my friends. HAH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one very important thing I do which no one else has mentioned on here. Since it takes me about a year to finish a bottle of C E Ferulic, I keep it refrigerated. When I order it, I make sure it is almost completely clear (if not then return it). Even after a year of being refigerated, it only turns light yellow. This means that the refrigeration is preventing oxidation of the product and allowing it to stay effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly, \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; product is still effective but I really think that the clearer the product is, the better. My dermatologist even recommended that I return a bottle to a vendor one time because he thought the product looked oxidized. When I received my replacement, it was crystal clear.</li>
            <li> The product I ordered was delivered to me without the  packaging and  wrapped in newspaper. I do not believe this vendor was selling an authentic product. I sent the product back. The vendor was quick to answer my questions and crediting my account.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have to begin your day. I have been using it for 2 years, beginning right after fraxel treatments for my face. My skin is protected and it maintains the results of the lazer work.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C serum.  It makes my skin feel so soft.  I think it brightens my skin as well.  It is expensive but I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> When hunting for Vit C serum, I happened onto skinceuticals and know their products are fantastic....but at $100 per oz. is over the top.  Platinum skincare is a much cheaper way to get this serum and is ALWAYS fresh and theraputic strength.  Skincare companies have us by the hair roots charging over the top prices for a product that may or may not be better than a much cheaper option...such as this one.  I say \\&quot;no thanks\\&quot; to this product and this price.  Too bad, I like skinceuticals overall, but just not going to hand over that much money for 1 oz. of product that will last about a month.  Better options are out there.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals CE Ferulic&lt;br /&gt;Many times this new(?) product comes without the carton box, but only wrapped in plastic. You never no how old the product is.&lt;br /&gt;why does Amazone allow this from a respected company or retailer. If I by something new on Amazon I want to be sure it is NEW.&lt;br /&gt;Why doesn&#x27;t it show an experation date?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Skinceuticals CE Ferulic for four years now and truly believe that it has magic powers. My dermatologist recommended this vitamin C serum to ward off fine lines and dry aging skin. I&#x27;ve used this product once a day religiously and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. Not a day goes by that someone doesn&#x27;t comment on my skin. :)</li>
            <li> Using Skinceutical CE Ferulic and Retin-A makes my skin feel great and look good.&lt;br /&gt;I also use 30 SPF or more daily after any day cream !&lt;br /&gt;This has been my favorite for 1 year !</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My skin texture has improved ever since I started using the product. This and retin A are really the gold standard in skin care.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last two months with great results.  My skin is clearer with less breakouts.  A little drop goes a long way.  Received my order in less than 3 days. Great company to deal with.</li>
            <li> This product is advertised as preventative care and I hope it does just that. I have been using for a little over two years now, and have discontinued use for short periods of time. When I stop using, my skin looks horrible. I have acne scars in some places, and I believe this product has helped some of them disappear. I also was developing wrinkles at 20, and I believe this product has helped stop and even reduce the appearance of frownlines. Its hard to judge exactly what this product does, but my skin is aweful without it!</li>
            <li> I use this product during the day with the B5 Hydrating Gel.  My skin looks amazing!! In the evening, I use another Skinceuticals serum for evening with the B5 Gel. These products are excellent and really deliver results!!</li>
            <li> For the first time I was very disappointed in the skinceutical  c and e bottle I received.  I use this product faithfully with great results.  The product  I received with this order was not fresh and well on it\\&quot;s way to expiration.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product a few days ago and found out what&#x27;s wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I bought from here is seem not concentrated because I went to see skin doctor and he gave me examples for this product. The one doctor gave me is orange color and I meant way more color than the one I bought from this sellers. and also the thickness of the serum too. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I just want to post this so someone might be able to answer me correctly what&#x27;s is going on or this seller just mixed with water and resell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like an answer because the different is too much.</li>
            <li> Fantastic skin care product that really makes a difference.  It is expensive, but probably worth it if it fits in your budget.</li>
            <li> amazing product, worth every penny + you don&#x27;t need to apply a lot. serum absorbs very fast and instantly has a tightening effect on your skin; skin stays moist and plump all day long. will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> Thanks in part to this vitamin C product introduced to me by my dermatologist 2 years ago.  This is one of the products on my \\&quot;can&#x27;t live without\\&quot; list.  Yes it&#x27;s expensive, yest it&#x27;s worth it.  There are no creams/products that are miracle workers but this one comes close.  Vitamin C is a proven collagen builder.</li>
            <li> My cheeks were so dry in the winters while my t-zone was very oily.  This is my second bottle that I&#x27;ve purchased.  After using my first for just a few weeks I had a friend ask me what I was doing differently as my face looked so much clearer and fresher.  I have to admit that is does feel smoother and definitely more even.  Even my mother says my face hasn&#x27;t changed much in the past 15 years even though I&#x27;m in my mid 40s now.  My siblings have more wrinkles than I do.  I highly recommend this product for those with similar skin.  Although it may work with very well with all skin types I&#x27;d recommend checking with your dermatologist first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with Obagi products for a year, and my skin is much more youthful. I was pleased to be able to order it online.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my skin doctor.  It gives your facial skin instance moisiture and soaks in immediately.  Does an excellent job on keeping your face soft as a baby all day long.  Worth every penny and a little goes a long way so the price evens out over time.</li>
            <li> This is the best product around for keeping your skin looking great and glowing.  It&#x27;s made such a difference in the way my skin looks and feels.  The price is much less than purchasing the product from my dermatologist.  In terms of delivery, the package arrived in less time than estimated when I placed the order.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! I started to notice diminished fine lines around my eyes about 2 weeks after beginning daily use of this product. Combined with Skinceuticals Phloretin CF the results are even better!</li>
            <li> This product arrived a different color from the sample that my dermatologist gave me.  A call to the manufacturer revealed that it is either a fake or it is old.  The color of this product goes from clear into light yellow, then into amber and brown when it is expired.  The color of the product was already dark amber when I got it.  I returned it and hope to see my credit this week.  I&#x27;m furious.  And because the product was not purchased from one of their &amp;#34;certified dealers&amp;#34;, the company would not look up the number on the bottom of the box to tell me when it was manufactured.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to pay full price next time, but at least I&#x27;ll get the real thing.</li>
            <li> Prompt  delivery in a safe cardboard box. The product CE Ferrulic takes away wrinkles and sends vitamins and antioxidants into your pours .......I Love it!!</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for sun-damaged, mature skin that is not sensitive, you will notice a difference the very next morning after one use, your face will look illuminated and renewed. Not for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I started using CE Ferulic over 20 years ago because my dermatologist suggested it would fade my freckles which would help dark spots on my face from darkening and/or become pre-cancerous spots.  I also know to wear a hat whenever I am in the sun. This product not only faded my freckles, but also helped reduce crows feet near my eyes and increased the brilliance of my skin tone. For the product work best, you cannot let any sun on your face-it will diminish the great results this product can produce.I use this every morning after I rinse my face either from the shower or just luke warm water after rising for the morning.  I put this serum on very lightly as it does spread well and absorbs well also. You only need 4-5 drops, use it sparingly. I let it sink into my facial skin for 5 minutes and than apply my daily facial cream.  It may sting slightly the first time you use it.  That means it is healing-it is topical vitamin C.  There is nothing I do not like about this product.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Best anti-aging serum.  My skin looks smooth and alive.  I apply a good moisturizer over it and then my make-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and won&#x27;t trade it for any other.  Keeps skin fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li> I know. I know. The price tag takes a little getting used to, but it is SO worth it. My skin has never looked better, brighter, or healthier. I was worried about spending this much money on one product, but it lasts quite a long time. I&#x27;ve found it takes less drops to cover your face and neck than the instructions say also. I&#x27;ve started getting compliments on my skin...I&#x27;m so glad I went out on a limb and tried this product. I&#x27;ll never stop using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It soaks into my skin quickly and then I can put on my moisturizer and/or sunscreen. I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for a few years. Recently, a younger woman I know (I think she&#x27;s in her late 30&#x27;s) found out that I&#x27;m going to be 50 soon and asked me how I look so good since I&#x27;m so old! I took it as a compliment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for almost a year after someone in a dermatologist office recommended it. My skin is smoother and more even and I think it&#x27;s reduced the appearance of a few deeper forehead wrinkles. It&#x27;s a bit sticky and takes some getting used to (I put it on when my face is damp), but I will continue to use this every day because I believe it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> Flat out, it works.  A bottle lasts about a year if I use it on my face, chest and hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about cosmetic products with a high price, but I have been using this for 6 months and won&#x27;t be without it!  I have very fair skin and have rosacae that \\&quot;blooms\\&quot; after I drink red wine and some other alcohols.  I started using this every morning and it clears any redness in a matter of minutes.  I have tried other prescription products and they did nothing.  This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> FRESH Skinceutical product (no yellowing in the CE Ferulic), promptly shipped. Would do business with this dealer again.</li>
            <li> Have been using for several years and do not have one single wrinkle on the old face.  However, I use the Skinceuticals AGE face cream and eye cream also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and it keeps my skin healthy looking and from getting large pores as I get older. I&#x27;m 53 years old.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used for about 9 months now.  It makes my skin very soft and reduces sun damage and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I saved some money buying online. It&#x27;s exactly the same quality as the one in dermatologist office. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon has placed my sister and I on Retina plus Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.  The Dr &amp; RN&#x27;s swear by it and so do we.  It has the exact ingredients in it for anti-aging.  Testing has been done for years on it and it is now a proven fact that it decreases wrinkles dramatically, softens fine lines . . .  I bought 3 bottles!  Thanks for the great sale.  B.D.</li>
            <li> great product- use daily in a routine with B5 hydrating  Gel. you will like the results. I found amazon to be the best price</li>
            <li> Amazing what this can do for your skin - spots, acne, lines, everything improved. Put it on with fingers, not in palm of hand for better absorption into face. - I was out in the sun one day for a long time and in the morning I put this on and had some left and wiped it on my shoulders - at the end of the day I had finger outlines on my shoulders and despite all the sunscreen applications throughout the day, I was fried: except for my face and those finger prints on my shoulder. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I tried to reach the company to ask a question regarding their product I wished to order several different days at different working hours.  No one responded (automated answering machine telling me to call back).  Also, my email was returned by server stating it wasn&#x27;t possible to deliver to their website email address.  Is this company still in business?  If so, are there any humans working for it?</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is a great product. Might be a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Best thing I have found for my skin.  Makes me look much better even though I am in my 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years and love how it keeps my skin clear and smooth.  It is a must in my daily routine!</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e been using this product for about 6 months now, I have not seen any changes at all. When I got the package there was no expiration date on the box or the bottle. I was surprised as I payed over $100.00 for it. So why didn&#x27;t I return it, I thought I give it a try, as I had read many great reviews on the product. I  would not recommend this product to anyone, save your money, not worth it.....</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. It makes my face brilliant and reduces the darkness as well. Really powerful. Will continue to use it. You will never regret you buy it although it is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I placed an order with Queen Bee Supply on February 9th and today March 15th I still have not received my shipment. It was very difficult to get a response when I finally did they blamed the post office and offered a full refund. It is now one week later and I have not received a refund and no further response. Very poor service and is poor reflection on Amazon. Will be filing a claim with the BBB and disputing payment with my bank.</li>
            <li> I think it is working. My skin is smoother, more toned.  Also using NIA24 products in conjunction with CE Ferulic, so it may be the combination but I like what I see.</li>
            <li> Started using this 9 months ago&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> Better than most big brand names that cost multiple times more and one bottle goes a long way. Amazon&#x27;s price point makes this a sweeter deal!</li>
            <li> This serum comes from Skinceuticals with an expiration on the bottom of the box.  Mine was purposely blurred out.  I didn&#x27;t realize this until much later and my estatician has since told me that buying them online is not safe since it will most likely be expired and stored in a hot warehouse.  Although more expensive, it&#x27;s best to buy from a salon when they have a sale.  You can tell it&#x27;s expired if the serum is a darker yellow.  Should be a very light yellow almost clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years, every day, and it continues to be my favorite antioxidant serum for day. It has changed my skin texture and brightness and it is moisturizing. I store the bottle  in my refridgerator. love luv it</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 or 4 years and I like it. I use it after the toner and before the moisturizer/sunscreen. It&#x27;s not going to change your life, no cosmetic will do that but I don&#x27;t have flaking or tiny bumps either.</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinceuticals CE Ferulic for over a year and I can definitely see a difference in the tone and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> love this product. I&#x27;ve been using for about 4 weeks and results are excellent. Looking forward to what longer use will bring!</li>
            <li> I just bought the sample bottles thru Amazon and put it on. The consistency is like water and it evaporates immediately into my skin--- I am not sure how 4 drops can cover your face because as soon as I touch it to my skin, it is gone. My skin does not feel hydrated from this product -- in fact, it feels a little tight. can you help?</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone, especially mature women who need to protect their skin from free radicals, etc. It&#x27;s the first hing I put on my face after a shower every day!</li>
            <li> I had read an article once about this product but was reluctant to try because of the price, but finally decided to put foward the money along with .5 retonol cream. What a miracle! I am only 32 but my husband is 50 and we were looking at an old picture from a couple of months ago and his skin looks ten years younger. For me I get always get complements on my completion, I can tell you that I noticed a difference within a week when using the two product together. I will continue to use this combination from now on out.</li>
            <li> I read that if you get this product and the serum is yellowed it is old.  My recent order that I received  was very yellow and I am sooo disappointed  because I have  always  trusted  Amazon. Is there anyway  I can send this back and get a fresh one.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> i really love this serum.. I slather this on my face and neck..layer it&lt;br /&gt;I can really go through this- my skin never looked better! I tried other serum..&lt;br /&gt;Some are too greasy..  Not this one..</li>
            <li> Ok, my aesthetician talked me into buying this bottle for a little over $140!  But the over-the-counter stuff I had tried did not seem to be doing anything to even reduce my age spots.  I am 52 and NOT ready for age spots.  I brought it home and started using it nightly, as I promised her I would.  Well, it took just a few days for me to actually think I was seeing a bit of fading.  I wanted to make sure I was really seeing a difference and not just fooling myself.  So I took a photo of a spot on my husband&#x27;s arm, and started using it on him every night as well.  He saw a difference in several days as well.  And this time, the photo proves it.  I think the newer spots were the easiest to see disappearing.  I am still using it on a couple of stubborn ones, but they are definitely lighter!  I have not refrigerated mine; have had it for about 3 months and can tell no difference in the product.  The only Con I have is that it is an open bottle with a dropper, so it can be easily knocked over.  I was sucking the liquid gold back up off the counter with the dropper! LOL  I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a product that works!</li>
            <li> Been using it for 10 yrs no great improvement in skin but perhaps I have prevented my skin to look old and prudish!!!</li>
            <li> When I went to have Ultherapy on my face...the assistant at the doctor&#x27;s office recommended this product.  Said it&#x27;s the most important process a woman can use on her face.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months...and I do like it.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for about 4 years now. yes, it does make my face smell like cooked chicken (i read one review where the woman said it made her face smell like hot dog water, haha) but it&#x27;s worth it. the extra sun protection and the benefits of the C and E far outweight the faint smell. if it&#x27;s a big deal to you, just don&#x27;t use it on important days or before a date :)</li>
            <li> Very fussy and cynical when it comes to skincare. Believe that retin a works and also believe in this product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  It gently exfoliates and nourishes your skin.  I recommend it for any age person because it makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> First of all, for anti-oxidant serum, I tend to look for fresh ones from official website. And I do remember reading some reviews about Amazon selling old serum. I still haven&#x27;t received my item. I think it&#x27;s lost but it said delivered. Furthermore, for price like this with free shipping, if I did place this order, I must click the free shipping option. This is so weird, I don&#x27;t remember placing this order, I haven&#x27;t received my stuff, and if I placed the order, why didn&#x27;t I click the free shipping bottom?</li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended this product to help with hyper-pigmentation where I had a mole removed by my lip.  I apply over my entire face daily and, not only has the hyper-pigmentation completely disappeared, but I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement in the smoothness of my skin and the disappearance of fine lines near my eyes.  Even though it&#x27;s pricy, I&#x27;ll continue to buy - it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Came broken in pieces. Gave me full credit after I sent them picture, but would rather have received the product!</li>
            <li> This product  has been  a  staple in my daily skin care and  has kept my skin  nourished and healthy for  years.</li>
            <li> Over time this stuff really does improve the texture of your skin over time. Its expensive but a splurge i am willing to make.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this from my skin care specialist&#x27;s office but tried purchasing it online due to a discounted price.  It came in packaging that was torn, used and appeared to not be original and makes me wonder if it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> After reading comments about ordering this item on line and the concern that it would be old product I took the risk and was happy to find the color was clear not yellow. Yellow being old product and should not be used. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past five years and feel that it is helping to keep my skin more youthful</li>
            <li> Had some concerns based on other reviews, but am completely satisfied.  It came in the box, sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and I really like using it.</li>
            <li> As a long time Dermatologist the array of Vit C products must be quite confusing to all of you.  L-Ascorbic acid, as contained in this product, and a few others, is what you want.  It is the most stable form of Vit C and remain active in the skin.  The price differences you see reflect this.  This was a brilliant breakthrough by Dr Sheldon Pinnell, recently deceased, of Duke University many years ago.  He was originally with Cellex, which is also excellent, then he opened Skinceuticals.  It&#x27;s normal to turn brownish after a while.  It doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s expired.  Treat yourself to the best.</li>
            <li> Great product and have used for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li> Ended up being good but udidn&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;It arriving without the box</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s a necessity that I&#x27;ve  used for years!</li>
            <li> i have heard and read amazing comments and reviews about this product.  i am giving it a try.  hope my rating will be excellent!</li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative to a cream moisturizer. It was like water and absorbed very quickly. I preferred to use this a night time. But my dermatologist says that this is one of the best products available for aging skin.</li>
            <li> As expected and prompt shipping. This product is really great. It hydrates my skin better than other lotions and I have notice a marked improvement in tone and texture on my face and decolletage since I began using it months ago.</li>
