    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and it is truly amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff I have ever used.</li>
            <li>One of the best (and smallest) invesments I have ever done</li>
            <li>THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT  ...</li>
            <li>I love this treatment!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell very good but that helps to keep from biting them.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>I have tears of joy as I gaze at my nails.  </li>
            <li>This is a great supplement to help your nails grow.</li>
            <li>Within an almost two week time frame, nails improved greatly.</li>
            <li>This nail formula is great.</li>
            <li>I used to use Nail Magic, but it quit being effective and my nails started peeling a great deal.</li>
            <li>My nails are strong and look great.  </li>
            <li>For me personally, amazing results.</li>
            <li>Honestly this stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li>and it did just that to my own nails, but also hardened the cuticles (which I can nip weekly).</li>
            <li>My nails are in a lot better shape</li>
            <li>and my dad is pleased with the product too.</li>
            <li>Many times products say it works but don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>You can also rub it into your nails or if you leave without touching it, it soaks into your nail and disappears within a minute or two.</li>
            <li>It literally makes your nail grow strong and im sure having a healthy diet and vitamins adds to the effectiveness of it</li>
            <li>Therefore they get dry easy and my nails just dont look great!!!</li>
            <li>I use it every other day I&#x27;ve heard every day is best.</li>
            <li>My nails do not break off easily</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more than worth</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more than worth the price.</li>
            <li>Far superior to the SH product.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re beautiful; it&#x27;s been so long.  </li>
            <li>Thank you... for a product that Really Works!!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, dries quickly and it works.  </li>
            <li>I thought at first that it was going to be more like a polish</li>
            <li>and im pleased to say it really does.</li>
            <li>Also, since the product soaks into the nails rather than being a polish on top, it cannot really be used if you have polished nails.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty strong will-power</li>
            <li>The remaining nails are still strong, I&#x27;ve been opening up cans with them for the first time</li>
            <li>EVER!with them for the first time EVER!</li>
            <li>To hep mine out a bit, I dice some fresh garlic and put into the bottle.</li>
            <li>Once I got the desired length I honestly have cut back to applying once or twice a day or so but will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It stated that you brush this on and it soaks right into the nail.</li>
            <li>You brush it on and it soaks right into the nail.</li>
            <li>I tried the Sally Hansen stuff, but it just leaves a plasticy film on the nail that peels right off if it gets scuffed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to use it faithfully,&lt;br /&gt;it will probably work for you.</li>
            <li>But I now have very long nails that are very strong.</li>
            <li>Not sure it has done any good for me.</li>
            <li>and I can easily peel off the polish that was put on only a day ago.</li>
            <li>(Pack of 4) Could not see any real difference</li>
            <li>Nutra Nail 5 to 7 day growth formula really worked for  me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>When they started growing so fast</li>
            <li>I had extremely brittle and soft nails after biting them for most of my life, one month after I stopped biting my nails</li>
            <li>Place on top of nail and under the nail a couple of times a day and takes a little over a minute to do all my nails(I keep it at work and paint nails at</li>
            <li>Goes on clear and dries fast with no shiny finish.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it daily my nails didn&#x27;t seem to be growing too fast and they still were breaking/cracking.  </li>
            <li>I recently started a low carb diet and (I&#x27;m assuming due to the high protien) a nice side effect has been nails that grow very fast.</li>
            <li>Then, if you stop for a while, the nails go right back to being a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nails are now hard and healthy, they are growing fast.</li>
            <li>It could also be helpful to people who are attempting to regrow their nails after biting and/or have naturally brittle nails.</li>
            <li>Wow, I never thought that I could get my nails to grow stronger again.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>However once my nails had grown out completely (the nail that had started from the cuticle after I started using nutra nail had grown to the tip)</li>
            <li>I noticed considerable strength and flexibility.  </li>
            <li>This actually works very well.</li>
            <li>Also, the formula is opaque, meaning you won&#x27;t get a shiny nail when it dries, totally natural.</li>
            <li>I put it on before I do my nail designs or before I go to get my nails done professionally.</li>
            <li>In just a few days I have noticed my nails are much less flaky and dry and pretty supple with a natural healthy nail shine (not glossy like nail polish.</li>
            <li>They broke off, split and in general would barely grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m attaching a picture of my current progress to show how it&#x27;s worked for me so far.</li>
            <li>When my nails become brittle or fragile from all that I do to it, I take a break and just let my nails go natural for about a month or so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strange to get used to having nails since I haven&#x27;t really had any for most of my life (in my late 20s)</li>
            <li>Even using it twice every day for a month, my first bottle only went down to under the halfway mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> but WOW never has any other product worked.</li>
            <li> and I actually have to trim them if they are too long.  </li>
            <li> It goes a long ways too.  </li>
            <li> A bottle goes a long way though.</li>
            <li> but instead I do my usual OLD habit when trying to grow them out to where I just sort of slide my nail over my teeth and just not bite them.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve not bitten them (although had a few close calls!)</li>
            <li> I finally just cut them down to the finger tips.  </li>
            <li> 2 nails have fallen victim to mouthicide!</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t see any difference after using it for an entire week, waste of money.</li>
            <li> The absolute worse.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say that this stuff is miracle growth stuff because you have to keep in mind that your old THIN nails have to grow out, too, and I can still flex mine downwards in the middle of the nail.</li>
            <li> My nails were so thin just reaching in my pocket tore the nail past the quick.  </li>
            <li> My nails have been a mess for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have never had an luck getting my nails to grow or strengthen with any other product.  </li>
            <li> (I blame will-power partially, too!).</li>
            <li> I based my decision on customer reviews and the fact that the formula sinks down into the nail.  </li>
            <li> I actually would put this on 4 to 5 times a day as my nails were very weak, very thin and tore off easily.</li>
            <li> I noticed harder nails in a little over a week.</li>
            <li> and I could basically clip my nails with my other nails!</li>
            <li> so there is no oily mess to deal with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a little miracle in a bottle for your nails.</li>
            <li> doing everyday task, opening a door, reaching for a dish in the cupboard, just the simplest thing</li>
            <li> I can tell within a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> SOME white showing they&#x27;d be SO thin that they could flex</li>
            <li> I have been using vitamins for 30 years, but when I reached 50, my nails really started to look bad.  </li>
            <li> I used it just as described but there was no more of a change than if I had done nothing at all.</li>
            <li> to use it every single day without fail.  </li>
            <li> tried the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails</li>
            <li> My hands are in water alot (swim and surf at least 3-4 times a week)</li>
            <li> After wanting to stop biting my nails off and on the past 10+ years, thin nails encouraged me to continue biting them</li>
            <li> The cuticle remover is not much good.</li>
            <li> It felt like my fingers were useless when I tried to pick up a coin or some small object.  </li>
            <li> However, when that happens, my nails are weak, they chip, break off, enamel layers peel off, and even opening a can</li>
            <li> I do still spread it on my cuticles and sides of my nails and behind the nails that are longer when I am wearing polish.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been thin and kinda peely.</li>
            <li> Not paper thin but definitely thin!</li>
            <li> Was not impressed...</li>
            <li> That is difficult for me, because I like to wear polish.</li>
            <li> Looked up reviews after a fellow college classmate (who had fake nails) asked me why I bite my nails.</li>
            <li> Sad news,</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is struggling to regrow they nails after wearing artificial and/or acrylic nails tips for some years.</li>
            <li> em a try.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. period. I used it just as described but there was no more of a change than if I had done nothing at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  My nails were so thin just reaching in my pocket tore the nail past the quick.  I can see a difference after just two weeks.  My aunt told me this works and im pleased to say it really does.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of cooking and baking so my hands are always in water. Therefore they get dry easy and my nails just dont look great!!! I never wear nail polish because it chips and cracks off to quickly.&lt;br /&gt;My Dad was over, one day, and he mentioned that his nails chip and break constantly he wished he could find something that he could put on them so that they didnt break all the time. He big concern was that a nail hardener would leave a shine on his nails and he didnt want that at all.&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product was looking for something to help him out as well as myself. It stated that you brush this on and it soaks right into the nail. Well, the product arrived and I gave two bottles to my dad and kept two for myself. I have to say it does what it says!!!! You brush it on and it soaks right into the nail. It doesnt leave a shine. My nails are in a lot better shape and my dad is pleased with the product too.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I tried the Sally Hansen stuff, but it just leaves a plasticy film on the nail that peels right off if it gets scuffed. This stuff actually soaks into the nail. Far superior to the SH product.</li>
            <li> I have been using vitamins for 30 years, but when I reached 50, my nails really started to look bad.  They broke off, split and in general would barely grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just doing everyday task, opening a door, reaching for a dish in the cupboard, just the simplest thing and there goes another nail.  I finally just cut them down to the finger tips.  It felt like my fingers were useless when I tried to pick up a coin or some small object.  I missed my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Nutra Nails 3 (THREE) weeks ago and started to use it on my fingers and toes and what a transformation.  I apply it 2, sometimes 3 times a day. It is easy to use, dries quickly and it works.  You receive 4 bottles, so I have a bottle on the kitchen table, one next to my TV chair, another on my nightstand and a back-up bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be a regular customer.  Thank you...Thank you... Thank you... for a product that Really Works!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you!  I have tears of joy as I gaze at my nails.  They&#x27;re beautiful; it&#x27;s been so long.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is struggling to regrow they nails after wearing artificial and/or acrylic nails tips for some years. It could also be helpful to people who are attempting to regrow their nails after biting and/or have naturally brittle nails. I fall into the post-acrylic and brittle nails categories, and this is my go-to for optimal nail health. It is an opaque nail protein coat so there is no oily mess to deal with. I recommend &amp;#34;painting&amp;#34; this on nails after they have cleaned and/or after you wash your hands. To hep mine out a bit, I dice some fresh garlic and put into the bottle. (Garlic helps with nail growth as well.)</li>
            <li> Wow, I never thought that I could get my nails to grow stronger again.&lt;br /&gt;This product actually works!!!&lt;br /&gt;Give em a try.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says it will. I have never had an luck getting my nails to grow or strengthen with any other product.  It goes a long ways too.  It&#x27;s like a little miracle in a bottle for your nails.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed...Nutra Nail 5 to 7 Day Growth Calcium Formula (13 ml), 0.45-OunceBottles (Pack of 4) Could not see any real difference neither could my friends or daughter who I gave one to!~</li>
            <li> To use the nail product you must remove your fingernail polish. That is difficult for me, because I like to wear polish. Not sure it has done any good for me. The cuticle remover is not much good.</li>
            <li> Nutra Nail 5 to 7 day growth formula really worked for  me. I could not get my nails to grow trying lots of different things. I actually would put this on 4 to 5 times a day as my nails were very weak, very thin and tore off easily. It doesn&#x27;t smell very good but that helps to keep from biting them. Apply this EVERY day and rub it in to your nail and cuticle.  It will take several weeks. But I now have very long nails that are very strong. Once I got the desired length I honestly have cut back to applying once or twice a day or so but will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this treatment!!! It literally makes your nail grow strong and im sure having a healthy diet and vitamins adds to the effectiveness of it but WOW never has any other product worked. Results seen within a week  I use it every other day I&#x27;ve heard every day is best. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and it is truly amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I had extremely brittle and soft nails after biting them for most of my life, one month after I stopped biting my nails I started to use this product. My nails are now hard and healthy, they are growing fast. This is a great supplement to help your nails grow. Goes on clear and dries fast with no shiny finish. Would recommend that people get this product if you are looking for something to help with nail growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nutra Nail for about 4 months now and I can see noticeable growth in my nails.  When I first started using it daily my nails didn&#x27;t seem to be growing too fast and they still were breaking/cracking.  However once my nails had grown out completely (the nail that had started from the cuticle after I started using nutra nail had grown to the tip) I noticed considerable strength and flexibility.  My nails do not break off easily and I actually have to trim them if they are too long.  Please note that, despite the name, nails will not grow in 5-7 days.  I have used it almost daily for 4 months.  Also, since the product soaks into the nails rather than being a polish on top, it cannot really be used if you have polished nails.  I do still spread it on my cuticles and sides of my nails and behind the nails that are longer when I am wearing polish.</li>
            <li> Honestly this stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all, I didn&#x27;t see any difference after using it for an entire week, waste of money.</li>
            <li> My nails have been a mess for a long time. I have no idea why. They chip, split, peel.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used everything on them but nothing has helped.  This stuff helps.  You really&lt;br /&gt;have to use it every single day without fail.  It takes a couple of weeks for the results&lt;br /&gt;to show up. Then, if you stop for a while, the nails go right back to being a mess.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that works at all.  If you&#x27;re willing to use it faithfully,&lt;br /&gt;it will probably work for you.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used. Many times products say it works but don&#x27;t. This actually works very well. Your nails will grow and be stronger. I can tell within a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> After wanting to stop biting my nails off and on the past 10+ years, thin nails encouraged me to continue biting them (I blame will-power partially, too!). When I WOULD grow them out enough to where there was SOME white showing they&#x27;d be SO thin that they could flex and I could basically clip my nails with my other nails! Not paper thin but definitely thin! Looked up reviews after a fellow college classmate (who had fake nails) asked me why I bite my nails. I thought about it that evening and thought MAYBE I can figure out a way to make them thicker to help promote my NOT biting them! I have pretty strong will-power although almost bit off both ring finger nails with some finals we had recently! It was definitely a close call but instead I do my usual OLD habit when trying to grow them out to where I just sort of slide my nail over my teeth and just not bite them. So far I&#x27;ve not bitten them (although had a few close calls!) in about a week and I have been using this liquid stuff for a week now. I won&#x27;t say that this stuff is miracle growth stuff because you have to keep in mind that your old THIN nails have to grow out, too, and I can still flex mine downwards in the middle of the nail. I&#x27;ve been putting this stuff on 2-3 times a day and it&#x27;s sort of like a liquid lotion for your nails. I thought at first that it was going to be more like a polish but it goes away shortly after you rub it in and doesn&#x27;t leave ANY greasy or oily residue! I&#x27;m attaching a picture of my current progress to show how it&#x27;s worked for me so far. It&#x27;s a little strange to get used to having nails since I haven&#x27;t really had any for most of my life (in my late 20s) so it takes some getting used to! Considering treating myself to a manicure if I keep growing them out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update: 12/9/2012: Sad news, 2 nails have fallen victim to mouthicide! With finals coming up I&#x27;m hoping the others aren&#x27;t going to be victims as well!** The remaining nails are still strong, I&#x27;ve been opening up cans with them for the first time EVER!with them for the first time EVER!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product! My hands are in water alot (swim and surf at least 3-4 times a week) and I go through phases of adding acrylic nails or doing nail polish designs. When my nails become brittle or fragile from all that I do to it, I take a break and just let my nails go natural for about a month or so. However, when that happens, my nails are weak, they chip, break off, enamel layers peel off, and even opening a can tab is like a Las Vegas gamble: chances are possible I&#x27;m gonna lose my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails but since my hands are in the water alot, the Sally Hansen chips off constantly and I can easily peel off the polish that was put on only a day ago. A friend of mine bought the Nutra Nail 5-7 (Pack of 4) about two months ago and gave me one of the bottles to try. I never gave it back! And I bought a 4-pack for myself after using the bottle she gave me for only two weeks. For me personally, amazing results. Within an almost two week time frame, nails improved greatly. No chipping, peeling, cracking at all. I noticed harder nails in a little over a week. A bottle goes a long way though. Even using it twice every day for a month, my first bottle only went down to under the halfway mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use NN5-7: Place on top of nail and under the nail a couple of times a day and takes a little over a minute to do all my nails(I keep it at work and paint nails at work - NO NAIL POLISH SMELL or lingering odor!). Also, the formula is opaque, meaning you won&#x27;t get a shiny nail when it dries, totally natural. Men with brittle nails can use it without getting embarrassed with glossy nails. You can also rub it into your nails or if you leave without touching it, it soaks into your nail and disappears within a minute or two. I haven&#x27;t changed my nail routine with the exception of using Nutra Nail as part of my regimen. I put it on before I do my nail designs or before I go to get my nails done professionally. One of the best (and smallest) invesments I have ever done that&#x27;s more than worth the price.t (and smallest) invesments I have ever done that&#x27;s more than worth the price.</li>
            <li> With daily massaging this under the nail and inside the cuticles, nails will grow noticeably. Also, just as it says on the package, its a calcium formula that helps the nails to also be stronger and it did just that to my own nails, but also hardened the cuticles (which I can nip weekly).</li>
            <li> The Nail growth has helped my nails from splitting.  I use it twice a day and it is doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I bought Nutra Nail 5 to 7 Day Growth Formula about a month ago.  I based my decision on customer reviews and the fact that the formula sinks down into the nail.  All my nails were peeling all the time.  Now I only have signs of peeling on two nails and even those are going away.  My nails are strong and look great.  I use it several times a day and carry it with me to work, too.  I used to use Nail Magic, but it quit being effective and my nails started peeling a great deal.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT  ... SELECT THE ONE THEY MANUFACTURE THAT IS NECESSARY FOR YOUR NAIL PROBLEM .. IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> The absolute worse.  Does not help nails grow at all.  I used religiously for several weeks.  There was NO growth at all.</li>
            <li> I recently started a low carb diet and (I&#x27;m assuming due to the high protien) a nice side effect has been nails that grow very fast. My nails have always been thin and kinda peely. When they started growing so fast I decided to try and find a way to make them healthier so they might actually stick around. This nail formula is great. In just a few days I have noticed my nails are much less flaky and dry and pretty supple with a natural healthy nail shine (not glossy like nail polish. I don&#x27;t know if this product makes nails grow faster as mine have been anyway, but it def. makes them healthier and stronger!</li>
