    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I figured unrefined Shea butter is the best to way to improve the skin texture   and stretch marks on your skin.    </li>

            <li>Also great for sunburns.</li>
            <li>Great for skin but not for my type of hair or scalp.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of trying another brand that has great reviews</li>
            <li>Great consistency, melts on contact, smoother than any unrefined karité butters I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>and it works great.  </li>

            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>great quality, not at all like the beauty store brands.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt more awesome.</li>
            <li>very very happy  :)</li>
            <li>This shea butter is good stuff.   </li>
            <li>But the smell is tolerable, and it doesn&#x27;t outweigh the good this butter does.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how good this stuff is.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the product is good quality.</li>
            <li>It does provide a good amount of moisture but aside from that</li>
            <li>I loved this.  </li>
            <li>I heard nothing but good reviews on shea butter</li>
            <li>(which IMHO is a good thing) but that smell goes away soon after application (almost immedialtely in fact..</li>
            <li>I have used it as a pre conditioner on my hair and loved the way my hair was so shiny and silky after shampooing.</li>
            <li>This is good quality Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>Received it and loved it.</li>
            <li>I have been using on surgical scarring and my doctor is AMAZED at how good the incision scar looks.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and have skin that tends to break out easily</li>
            <li>I rarely break out now, and everyone tells me how great my skin looks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most amazing thing is, my skin tone is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Because my skin and hair love this shea butter!  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more this week!</li>
            <li>I need more!</li>
            <li>Shea butter is amazing stuff, but I would not recommend this one.  </li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell and it&#x27;s amazing for the skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin nice.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I also apply it in the morning just because my skin feels so nice afterward.  </li>
            <li>What a nice surprise.     </li>
            <li>I use it on my hands, face and neck every morning and night and am thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>Sort of my own fault too</li>
            <li>Great Karité Butter, smells great, naturally, without any perfumes; the perfect fresh nut smell.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try making my own body butter,  </li>
            <li>Nice Shea butter,I will buy it again</li>
            <li>The best Shea butter ever better than what they sell at whole foods..</li>
            <li>I mainly chose this brand of shea butter because the company makes sure that consumers will get the best quality of shea butter (100% Certified Premium Grade A).  </li>
            <li>, this seller is fantastic - item arrived in perfect condition (I was nervous, living in Arizona and trying to order shea butter in the summer heat), and fast.</li>
            <li>If you warm it in your hand for just a second it goes on wonderfully</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled that it tightens the neck skin, reduces puffy eyes and erases fine lines.</li>
            <li>my mom told me her tummy area looks better after using this but for the hips and thigh area, I think it takes more time.    </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many skin lotions in the store</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I selected this choice of shea butter</li>
            <li>I hope yu get the same satisfaction as I have frm using the product best of luck</li>
            <li>Get this Shea Butter and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>and I find many uses for it.</li>
            <li>There are so many uses for this product, but let me just add the ones that I found to be imprortant for me.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I have had chronic eczema on my hand (for many years).</li>
            <li>Thank u:)</li>
            <li>I bought it as it is certified organic, as you just don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting from many brands.</li>
            <li>Thanks AAA for making a great product.</li>
            <li>Love this Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Works better for my eczema than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>After letting it soak in for a minute, I apply the acne treatment lotion on top.</li>
            <li>Very versatile product, great quality.</li>
            <li>Will buy this again:)</li>
            <li>but it was stinky and didn&#x27;t seem authentic.  </li>
            <li>I am not going to say not to buy from this seller however, the product seemed authentic and was recieved in no time at all.</li>
            <li>When I need more, I will re-order from this seller.</li>
            <li>So glad I took a chance and tried this.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I was so impressed, that I started using the residue that was left on my eyelashes and over my hair to help with frizzies.  </li>
            <li>There are SO many uses for</li>
            <li>Will keep looking for a better product</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>We love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shea butter, smells earthy to me.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I went with this brand and product.  </li>
            <li>If I apply too much I apply a very warm cloth and wipe some of the creme off.  </li>
            <li>The jar packaging is nice and the smell is non-offensive and dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to microwave it to get it to spread more easily.</li>
            <li>Lovely, strong fingernails for the 1st time in my life.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter is the best stuff for dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know the quality of the shea butter is great, but WOW does it stink!  </li>
            <li>for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an avid shea butter user and this is by far one of the best that I have used.</li>
            <li>This was the best $10.00 spent!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy if you just stick it under a hair dryer for 20 seconds and melt it then put it on.</li>
            <li>I bought this to experiment with my own body butter recipe, but so far I have just used it on its own.</li>
            <li>The lavender isn&#x27;t too strong for me.</li>
            <li>There is good news however, the smell dissipates pretty quickly (about a minute or so)</li>
            <li>This is the best smelling shea butter thus far... it does not have the loud smokey, charred smell of most shea butters.</li>
            <li>but once you dig some out and rub it rub it in your palms it is fine.</li>
            <li>After rubbing it in my palms, it becomes pliable and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Then I smooth it over my legs.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I am trying to lower the number of chemicals that I put on my skin, and also because it is salicylate free, and I am on the guauifenisen protocol for FMS.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I use it on my feet at nights for smooth moist feet in the morning.</li>
            <li>Plastic bag never bothered me because I use this primarily to make lip balm.</li>
            <li>is the perfect remedy for a harsh winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Forget your designer lotions and moisturizers filled with dozens of chemicals .</li>
            <li>However, I love how the product helps me live with the problem much more easily.</li>
            <li>It is very effective -- a tiny amount is all that&#x27;s needed per treatment.</li>
            <li>It seems to help mild rashes heal more quickly too.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews of this shea butter and the strong smell, I was very hesitant to try it.  </li>
            <li>It is rich and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>But before applying make sure you rub it in to your palm first .</li>
            <li>I have had both the original and the lavender.</li>
            <li>Love the nutty smell (not disturbing at all).</li>
            <li>I am using it on top of Aloe Vera Gel right now to relieve a heat rash on top of my foot - very soothing.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on clean feet and then wear socks to bed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry skin and scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased about 3 or 4 different kinds of Shea&#x27;s butters, but this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>I have used it to relieve mild to moderate skin and scalp irritations with great success.  </li>
            <li>It melts perfectly and combines with the other ingredients very well.  </li>
            <li>The Shea Butter does have a sweet smell</li>
            <li>It does have a unique smell, but it&#x27;s not really unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>This product would be good if you could actually use it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for [...] bucks.</li>
            <li>I would say it reminds me of a campfire smell - not a bad smell, just</li>
            <li>It works even though my hair is very straight and fine....</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it if it is more pure and certified so.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great like other Shea butter products.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it serves a lot of other great uses.</li>
            <li>and I know I will order and use it many more times as long as it is available on amazon.</li>
            <li>This shea butter has one of the smoother textures and it absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>The product absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>It became tremendously itchy after 24 hours each time.</li>
            <li>I like east African shea butter a lot better because its more of a liquid form</li>
            <li>Scent is mild and I&#x27;ve never noticed any shells or particles.</li>
            <li>The scrub was super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>When I have a mild rash or skin irritation, I rub in some shea butter and get immediate relief.  </li>
            <li>I like how its thick, but goes on smooth, and refined shea butter is the best yu get real results frm it.</li>
            <li>This is smooth and for those who want that and are willing to pay for it, go for it.  </li>
            <li>The odor goes away quickly when it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li>Better than the expensive (and very good)</li>
            <li>Only expect this product to make your skin comfortable and look better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a more natural way to care for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s not gritty at all and has a smooth consistency to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reminds me of freshly turned earth in the spring.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than coconut oil for a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because it does as well a job as many other lotions, however, while I can also use this product in my hair, it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not the right product for everyone.</li>
            <li>If you believe in the merit of this product and company and what they do go for it, but I need to watch my wallet right now and will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li>Something didn&#x27;t seem quite right about this product.</li>
            <li>Applied right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It is accepted by the ASBI and has the symbol right on the jar.  </li>
            <li>and it melts right in.  </li>
            <li>The after affect is the best becus ur skin be so soft, and all yu need 2 apply is a small amount</li>
            <li>I is a great product I melted it first to make my salt dead seat scrub</li>
            <li>particular unrefined and certified Shea Butter is fantastic.</li>
            <li>From the color, the scent, the feel of this product I am certain that this product is a true shea butter, and not kpangnan butter.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure shea butter!</li>
            <li>In fact it equalizes so effectively that I don&#x27;t have dry spots on my face anymore.    </li>
            <li>The Shea butter is a great product, but I feel you can get the same results with any regular lotion.</li>
            <li>Fingernails and hands are really abused, but look magazine photo worthy now.  </li>
            <li>while I loved it, I wanted to look for something else that might be less refined or closer to the source.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say, I&#x27;ve not had a single rash or blemish in the 6 months I&#x27;ve been using this.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when I get close to running out.  </li>
            <li>The product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It also has a funny smell to it, but goes away in like 10min.</li>
            <li>First time I have bought Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel funny about using it.</li>
            <li>unrefined shea better should be yellow which is not with the one I received</li>
            <li>It was exactly  as advertised certified organic.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy for the first 30 minutes or so, but not overly so.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot of it, but it works really well!  </li>
            <li>Works better than cocoa butter we think, especially since cocoa butter has a tendency to get rubbed off by clothing.</li>
            <li>first, I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It is a great sealent to keep the moisture in your hair, to really get my hair decently moist i also use black jamaican castor as a scalp oil (for thickness) &amp;&amp; sealent which i do every 2-3 days depending on dryness</li>
            <li>I could have paid the same price and gotten more than 4 oz.</li>
            <li>This jar is denser than the first one purchased.  </li>
            <li>First one was fluffier.  </li>
            <li>I just put  what I have mixed in another container and mix more in as needed.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Unlike the cheaper unrefined Shea Butters that I tried from the local health food store, this product is much smoother, not grainy, very easy to soften in your palm, and it has a much milder aroma.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I need to, I add a little water in my hand and smooth that over my legs afterward so it thins out more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect overnight magic; it took about 6 weeks of regular use to see a real difference.</li>
            <li>It smells like what shea butter smells like, and if you are looking for natural and effective, the last thing you should be hung up on is scent.</li>
            <li>I first tried L&#x27;Occitane pure shea butter,</li>
            <li>natural scent is not bad - despite some reviews.</li>
            <li>so i was really looking for a good moisturizer that will last on their skin at least for more than 2 hrs</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin - you could not do better than this certified Shea Butter product</li>
            <li>As pure shea butters go, AAA shea butter is a bit on the greasy side</li>
            <li>Feels oily at first, but soaks right in at skin temperature and feels soft and silky with no oily residue.</li>
            <li>And it is solid in the jar, but it softens quickly in the palm of your hand like butter and is absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Good product especially for Expecting moms with dry skin.</li>
            <li>recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li>Shea butter melts nicely between my fingers before applying to my fine thin tresses.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shea butter because of it&#x27;s high quality and also because my lotion bar recipe call for exactly 4 oz. of shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I did a little research and found that shea butter is a really great thing and an excellent base for this project.  </li>
            <li>I previously bought 1 pound os raw shea butter (excellent quality) for $12.</li>
            <li>only problem when I use it on my face is that to make it glide smoothly on your skin without stretching it, you need to scoop quite a bit, but then when you put it all on your face, it&#x27;s too much and feels kinda greasy</li>
            <li>oh well, i put quite a lot and spread it easily and then wait a few moments for it to absorb and then blot the rest of it with a clean towel or napkin</li>
            <li>but I really like the Shea butter, and I still using it for every night before go to sleep.</li>
            <li>I purchased this from Whole Foods in my area.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s a reasonable approximation.  </li>
            <li>It has a consistency much like play doa - almost clay like, though a tad smoother and lighter.  </li>
            <li>(Once the shea butter melts into your skin you don&#x27;t smell it as much.)  </li>
            <li>The shea butter moistures very well.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is very emollient</li>
            <li>BUT you really get what you pay</li>
            <li>I am very prone to razor</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell too much</li>
            <li>Get real.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to reorder.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just recently got into eating really really healthy and using all natural products.   </li>
            <li>It goes on somewhat heavy but absorbs nicely into my skin after awhile.  </li>
            <li>I do believe you have to correct the cause from within possibly due to not drinking enough water, not taking in healthy oils such as organic coconut oil, flax seed, or olive oil, or some kind of vitamin deficiency.  </li>
            <li>It helps a great deal and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li>Since I have started using shea butter I have noticed that the wrinkles that were on my face (at the corner of my eyes) have disappeared, and generally my complexion is much better overall.</li>
            <li>Main differences are that this one has grittier texture, doesn&#x27;t melt as easily, is yellow as opposed to white and has a very strong musky smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this high quality shea butter.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin smooth and moisturize all day long.</li>
            <li>on the contrary, if you scoop less, you won&#x27;t be able to apply it on your face so smoothly, cuz the consistency is kinda thick and doesn&#x27;t spread that easy...</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell about new stretch marks or prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less like a cream and more like a wax.  </li>
            <li>There is another shea butter from Nature and Herb that has one more ounce and is half the price</li>
            <li>I have been using shea butter for my face mainly.  </li>
            <li>My order arrived quickly, it came with brochure, order slip, AAA Shea Butter business card (which lists the 21 uses of their shea butter on the back of the card).    </li>
            <li>will order more of the same in the future..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this product mainly on my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shea butter.</li>
            <li>but the price is way too high..</li>
            <li>I bought to uspe as a moisturizer instead of the high dollar ones at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>My sister purchased high dollar creams but it didnt work .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for years &amp; highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It has nothing to do with the manufacturer or seller (I got it very quickly in the mail) but due to the inherent nature of shea butter.    </li>
            <li>Be aware that the sent of this cream is a little bizarre, but the scent disappears after about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too hard and It has a nice smell, too.  </li>
            <li>I later discovered Now Foods has a pure shea butter without no smell and smooth texture which I still use regularly.</li>
            <li>It has a light smokey &amp; nutty smell, which is to be expected.</li>
            <li>I wish I wld have bought a larger size its well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I bought this shea butter because it&#x27;s winter and the company I normally order from is sold out.</li>
            <li>After about a week the cut was healed and the skin on my palm is now normal.</li>
            <li>It is definitely 100% authentic and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>so I was in need of a natural alternative that would give the same thick moisturizing cover but good absorbency (because who wants to be greasy?).</li>
            <li>I have extremely severe eczema all over so its important that I have something with a lot of moisture to pamper my skin.</li>
            <li>you would need to really stretch the skin trying to rub it in, or maybe only by slightly patting it on you&#x27;d be able to let it sink in gradually...</li>
            <li>I am a highly-allergic person who cannot handle harsh products, and on top of that, I also suffer from autoimmune diseases including painful psoriasis (which if you are familiar with psoriasis, dry skin equals misery, and the more moisturized you are, the better you fare).</li>
            <li>In the morning, even on very hot days, I put a layer on, let it soak in &amp; then rub off the excess with a dry towel.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural &amp; it helps a lot!</li>
            <li>I have found that it moisturizes better than other products (such as leading day creams with sunscreens) without leaving my face oily &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>This particular product has a very nutty smell, a solid texture, and needs warming before it spreads.</li>
            <li>WOW... didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I ordered this, but based on being chemical-free and having such a high rating, I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>The scent is very very mild, absolutely in no way \\&quot;rancid\\&quot; as one reviewer stated, and disappears (as shea scent should) very shortly after application.</li>
            <li>I personally could care less, if it makes me feel better, and it does.</li>
            <li>It works better when it&#x27;s warmed up, but if you&#x27;re lazy like me and don&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of microwaving it, you can just as easily rub a small ball of it between your hands it and becomes soft and pliable and easy</li>
            <li>The scent takes a little getting used to, it kind of smells like the dried licorice root used in Chinese medicines, but it fades quickly after applying.</li>
            <li>Next time I am looking for pure shea butter</li>
            <li>not too much but just little amount of Shea butter definitely make  my hair shiny and smooth.     </li>
            <li>about the stretch marks, my stretch marks are old stretch marks</li>
            <li>In the morning my feet are as soft as can be.  </li>
            <li>but my feet will be really soft in the winter.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I like that it is soft</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how ALL unrefined natural shea butter should smell.</li>
            <li>I have a hyper sensitive nose</li>
            <li>There is no smell as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>I use it daily, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>but I developed a rash so quit using it.</li>
            <li>Have used it two days now and psoriasis is actually fading and calming down, which in my book, is pretty miraculous and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Shea Butter is not real hard like another brand I have purchased</li>
            <li>I bought and reviewed Shea on Amazon that looks and behaves like this special super secret Shea</li>
            <li>Then I put a little warm tap water in the palm of my other hand and rub the Shea Butter around in it for a moment.</li>
            <li>Love how it becomes creamy after just a few seconds of rubbing it in my hands... and boy, does it moisturize!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll sometimes mix it with a small amount of another lotion, something with a fragrance, and it easily covers any smell of the shea itself.</li>
            <li>Does have a rich, buttery, nutty smell which disappears after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>My understanding is that kpangnan butter is not necessarily a bad product at all, however it is not true shea butter.    </li>
            <li>but it is fine for coverage on small areas.</li>
            <li>I still have 2/3 of the jar left after a month of steady use.</li>
            <li>It is also terrific for taming my blonde, wavy hair frizzies in hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li>The texture is rich until it melts into your fingers due to the low melting point of shea butter.</li>
            <li>I normally heat it on a low setting for about 20-45 seconds, so it&#x27;s easier to rub on.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t smell like somebody pumped it full of harsh fragrances and perfumes.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty weird and not exactly pleasant when first applied, but it fades away, and I&#x27;m happy enough with the results that I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to get out of the container and applying it to your skin takes a lot of effort as it doesn&#x27;t rub in easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some reviews complaining of the smell of the product, it&#x27;s not overly powerful, but it is slightly nutty.  </li>
            <li>No other variables, it is this product.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for my face, and it dried it out and made me break out, but i love mixing it with my other oils.</li>
            <li>Works very well on very very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Its lightly scented and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>If making a shea butter whip for your natural tresses or body you may want to buy larger quantity.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Or sometimes i put the container under the tap and run hot water till the butter melts down a bit.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it right after shaping my eyebrows, on my hair and scalp, my skin, or even if I just popped a zit and just washed the area, and when I wake up the next morning there will not be a scab or dark spot in the area where the zit was popped.</li>
            <li>It is thick, rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>I looked long and hard at many different products offered here on Amazon and read up on a lot of different sites to find \\&quot;true\\&quot; shea butter.      </li>
            <li>I scoop up a little on my finger, drawing my finger backwards through it (nail side first)</li>
            <li>I let a little bit melt in my palm first, and it smooths on no problem.</li>
            <li>For more even distribution of this moisturizer a small portion can be slightly heated to assist application.</li>
            <li>I scoop out a tiny bit, rub it briskly between my palms to warm it up, then apply a very thin layer to my face.</li>
            <li>It happens every so often (bout every few months, usually on hot days) on my chin area.</li>
            <li>My doctors kept recommending thick cream-based lotions that were full of chemical/unrecognizable ingredients</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry place, I thought I would try this shea butter</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s not a broken down manufacturer&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>This butter has a different texture and a  little funny smell, which could put some people off (Though its not overpowering).</li>
            <li>It helps with the dry crapey look of old age.</li>
            <li>As I have pretty dry skin, I like that it lasts after 1 hand-washing, but like other products, it doesn&#x27;t last longer than maybe 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Although the product may be fine the container which it came in was broken.</li>
            <li>You need very little of it to put on the skin, so this small container will work for many months to help you.</li>

            <li> Otherwise, the product is good quality.</li>

            <li> I need more!</li>
            <li> Shea butter is amazing stuff, but I would not recommend this one.  </li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell and it&#x27;s amazing for the skin.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin nice.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I also apply it in the morning just because my skin feels so nice afterward.  </li>
            <li> What a nice surprise.     </li>
            <li> I use it on my hands, face and neck every morning and night and am thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> Sort of my own fault too</li>
            <li> Great Karité Butter, smells great, naturally, without any perfumes; the perfect fresh nut smell.  </li>

            <li> Nice Shea butter,I will buy it again</li>
            <li> The best Shea butter ever better than what they sell at whole foods..</li>
            <li> I mainly chose this brand of shea butter because the company makes sure that consumers will get the best quality of shea butter (100% Certified Premium Grade A).  </li>
            <li> , this seller is fantastic - item arrived in perfect condition (I was nervous, living in Arizona and trying to order shea butter in the summer heat), and fast.</li>
            <li> If you warm it in your hand for just a second it goes on wonderfully</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled that it tightens the neck skin, reduces puffy eyes and erases fine lines.</li>
            <li> my mom told me her tummy area looks better after using this but for the hips and thigh area, I think it takes more time.    </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many skin lotions in the store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I selected this choice of shea butter</li>
            <li> I hope yu get the same satisfaction as I have frm using the product best of luck</li>
            <li> Get this Shea Butter and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> and I find many uses for it.</li>
            <li> There are so many uses for this product, but let me just add the ones that I found to be imprortant for me.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have had chronic eczema on my hand (for many years).</li>
            <li> Thank u:)</li>
            <li> I bought it as it is certified organic, as you just don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting from many brands.</li>
            <li> Thanks AAA for making a great product.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Works better for my eczema than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> After letting it soak in for a minute, I apply the acne treatment lotion on top.</li>
            <li> Very versatile product, great quality.</li>
            <li> Will buy this again:)</li>
            <li> but it was stinky and didn&#x27;t seem authentic.  </li>
            <li> I am not going to say not to buy from this seller however, the product seemed authentic and was recieved in no time at all.</li>
            <li> When I need more, I will re-order from this seller.</li>
            <li> So glad I took a chance and tried this.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I was so impressed, that I started using the residue that was left on my eyelashes and over my hair to help with frizzies.  </li>
            <li> There are SO many uses for</li>
            <li> Will keep looking for a better product</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shea butter, smells earthy to me.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I went with this brand and product.  </li>
            <li> If I apply too much I apply a very warm cloth and wipe some of the creme off.  </li>
            <li> The jar packaging is nice and the smell is non-offensive and dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to microwave it to get it to spread more easily.</li>
            <li> Lovely, strong fingernails for the 1st time in my life.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter is the best stuff for dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know the quality of the shea butter is great, but WOW does it stink!  </li>
            <li> for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an avid shea butter user and this is by far one of the best that I have used.</li>
            <li> This was the best $10.00 spent!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy if you just stick it under a hair dryer for 20 seconds and melt it then put it on.</li>
            <li> I bought this to experiment with my own body butter recipe, but so far I have just used it on its own.</li>
            <li> The lavender isn&#x27;t too strong for me.</li>
            <li> There is good news however, the smell dissipates pretty quickly (about a minute or so)</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling shea butter thus far... it does not have the loud smokey, charred smell of most shea butters.</li>
            <li> but once you dig some out and rub it rub it in your palms it is fine.</li>
            <li> After rubbing it in my palms, it becomes pliable and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Then I smooth it over my legs.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I am trying to lower the number of chemicals that I put on my skin, and also because it is salicylate free, and I am on the guauifenisen protocol for FMS.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet at nights for smooth moist feet in the morning.</li>
            <li> Plastic bag never bothered me because I use this primarily to make lip balm.</li>
            <li> is the perfect remedy for a harsh winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Forget your designer lotions and moisturizers filled with dozens of chemicals .</li>
            <li> However, I love how the product helps me live with the problem much more easily.</li>
            <li> It is very effective -- a tiny amount is all that&#x27;s needed per treatment.</li>
            <li> It seems to help mild rashes heal more quickly too.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews of this shea butter and the strong smell, I was very hesitant to try it.  </li>
            <li> It is rich and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> But before applying make sure you rub it in to your palm first .</li>
            <li> I have had both the original and the lavender.</li>
            <li> Love the nutty smell (not disturbing at all).</li>
            <li> I am using it on top of Aloe Vera Gel right now to relieve a heat rash on top of my foot - very soothing.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on clean feet and then wear socks to bed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for dry skin and scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased about 3 or 4 different kinds of Shea&#x27;s butters, but this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li> I have used it to relieve mild to moderate skin and scalp irritations with great success.  </li>
            <li> It melts perfectly and combines with the other ingredients very well.  </li>
            <li> The Shea Butter does have a sweet smell</li>
            <li> It does have a unique smell, but it&#x27;s not really unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> This product would be good if you could actually use it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for [...] bucks.</li>
            <li> I would say it reminds me of a campfire smell - not a bad smell, just</li>
            <li> It works even though my hair is very straight and fine....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it if it is more pure and certified so.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great like other Shea butter products.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it serves a lot of other great uses.</li>
            <li> and I know I will order and use it many more times as long as it is available on amazon.</li>
            <li> This shea butter has one of the smoother textures and it absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> The product absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> It became tremendously itchy after 24 hours each time.</li>
            <li> I like east African shea butter a lot better because its more of a liquid form</li>
            <li> Scent is mild and I&#x27;ve never noticed any shells or particles.</li>
            <li> The scrub was super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> When I have a mild rash or skin irritation, I rub in some shea butter and get immediate relief.  </li>
            <li> I like how its thick, but goes on smooth, and refined shea butter is the best yu get real results frm it.</li>
            <li> This is smooth and for those who want that and are willing to pay for it, go for it.  </li>
            <li> The odor goes away quickly when it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li> Better than the expensive (and very good)</li>
            <li> Only expect this product to make your skin comfortable and look better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a more natural way to care for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s not gritty at all and has a smooth consistency to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reminds me of freshly turned earth in the spring.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than coconut oil for a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because it does as well a job as many other lotions, however, while I can also use this product in my hair, it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not the right product for everyone.</li>
            <li> If you believe in the merit of this product and company and what they do go for it, but I need to watch my wallet right now and will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Something didn&#x27;t seem quite right about this product.</li>
            <li> Applied right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It is accepted by the ASBI and has the symbol right on the jar.  </li>
            <li> and it melts right in.  </li>
            <li> The after affect is the best becus ur skin be so soft, and all yu need 2 apply is a small amount</li>
            <li> I is a great product I melted it first to make my salt dead seat scrub</li>
            <li> particular unrefined and certified Shea Butter is fantastic.</li>
            <li> From the color, the scent, the feel of this product I am certain that this product is a true shea butter, and not kpangnan butter.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure shea butter!</li>
            <li> In fact it equalizes so effectively that I don&#x27;t have dry spots on my face anymore.    </li>
            <li> The Shea butter is a great product, but I feel you can get the same results with any regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Fingernails and hands are really abused, but look magazine photo worthy now.  </li>
            <li> while I loved it, I wanted to look for something else that might be less refined or closer to the source.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say, I&#x27;ve not had a single rash or blemish in the 6 months I&#x27;ve been using this.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when I get close to running out.  </li>
            <li> The product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It also has a funny smell to it, but goes away in like 10min.</li>
            <li> First time I have bought Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> It makes me feel funny about using it.</li>
            <li> unrefined shea better should be yellow which is not with the one I received</li>
            <li> It was exactly  as advertised certified organic.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy for the first 30 minutes or so, but not overly so.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of it, but it works really well!  </li>
            <li> Works better than cocoa butter we think, especially since cocoa butter has a tendency to get rubbed off by clothing.</li>
            <li> first, I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It is a great sealent to keep the moisture in your hair, to really get my hair decently moist i also use black jamaican castor as a scalp oil (for thickness) &amp;&amp; sealent which i do every 2-3 days depending on dryness</li>
            <li> I could have paid the same price and gotten more than 4 oz.</li>
            <li> This jar is denser than the first one purchased.  </li>
            <li> First one was fluffier.  </li>
            <li> I just put  what I have mixed in another container and mix more in as needed.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Unlike the cheaper unrefined Shea Butters that I tried from the local health food store, this product is much smoother, not grainy, very easy to soften in your palm, and it has a much milder aroma.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I need to, I add a little water in my hand and smooth that over my legs afterward so it thins out more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect overnight magic; it took about 6 weeks of regular use to see a real difference.</li>
            <li> It smells like what shea butter smells like, and if you are looking for natural and effective, the last thing you should be hung up on is scent.</li>
            <li> I first tried L&#x27;Occitane pure shea butter,</li>
            <li> natural scent is not bad - despite some reviews.</li>
            <li> so i was really looking for a good moisturizer that will last on their skin at least for more than 2 hrs</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin - you could not do better than this certified Shea Butter product</li>
            <li> As pure shea butters go, AAA shea butter is a bit on the greasy side</li>
            <li> Feels oily at first, but soaks right in at skin temperature and feels soft and silky with no oily residue.</li>
            <li> And it is solid in the jar, but it softens quickly in the palm of your hand like butter and is absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Good product especially for Expecting moms with dry skin.</li>
            <li> recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> Shea butter melts nicely between my fingers before applying to my fine thin tresses.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter because of it&#x27;s high quality and also because my lotion bar recipe call for exactly 4 oz. of shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I did a little research and found that shea butter is a really great thing and an excellent base for this project.  </li>
            <li> I previously bought 1 pound os raw shea butter (excellent quality) for $12.</li>
            <li> only problem when I use it on my face is that to make it glide smoothly on your skin without stretching it, you need to scoop quite a bit, but then when you put it all on your face, it&#x27;s too much and feels kinda greasy</li>
            <li> oh well, i put quite a lot and spread it easily and then wait a few moments for it to absorb and then blot the rest of it with a clean towel or napkin</li>
            <li> but I really like the Shea butter, and I still using it for every night before go to sleep.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Whole Foods in my area.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> and I think that&#x27;s a reasonable approximation.  </li>
            <li> It has a consistency much like play doa - almost clay like, though a tad smoother and lighter.  </li>
            <li> (Once the shea butter melts into your skin you don&#x27;t smell it as much.)  </li>
            <li> The shea butter moistures very well.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is very emollient</li>
            <li> BUT you really get what you pay</li>
            <li> I am very prone to razor</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell too much</li>
            <li> Get real.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to reorder.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just recently got into eating really really healthy and using all natural products.   </li>
            <li> It goes on somewhat heavy but absorbs nicely into my skin after awhile.  </li>
            <li> I do believe you have to correct the cause from within possibly due to not drinking enough water, not taking in healthy oils such as organic coconut oil, flax seed, or olive oil, or some kind of vitamin deficiency.  </li>
            <li> It helps a great deal and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Since I have started using shea butter I have noticed that the wrinkles that were on my face (at the corner of my eyes) have disappeared, and generally my complexion is much better overall.</li>
            <li> Main differences are that this one has grittier texture, doesn&#x27;t melt as easily, is yellow as opposed to white and has a very strong musky smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this high quality shea butter.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin smooth and moisturize all day long.</li>
            <li> on the contrary, if you scoop less, you won&#x27;t be able to apply it on your face so smoothly, cuz the consistency is kinda thick and doesn&#x27;t spread that easy...</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really tell about new stretch marks or prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less like a cream and more like a wax.  </li>
            <li> There is another shea butter from Nature and Herb that has one more ounce and is half the price</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter for my face mainly.  </li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly, it came with brochure, order slip, AAA Shea Butter business card (which lists the 21 uses of their shea butter on the back of the card).    </li>
            <li> will order more of the same in the future..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product mainly on my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shea butter.</li>
            <li> but the price is way too high..</li>
            <li> I bought to uspe as a moisturizer instead of the high dollar ones at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> My sister purchased high dollar creams but it didnt work .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for years &amp; highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It has nothing to do with the manufacturer or seller (I got it very quickly in the mail) but due to the inherent nature of shea butter.    </li>
            <li> Be aware that the sent of this cream is a little bizarre, but the scent disappears after about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hard and It has a nice smell, too.  </li>
            <li> I later discovered Now Foods has a pure shea butter without no smell and smooth texture which I still use regularly.</li>
            <li> It has a light smokey &amp; nutty smell, which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I wish I wld have bought a larger size its well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter because it&#x27;s winter and the company I normally order from is sold out.</li>
            <li> After about a week the cut was healed and the skin on my palm is now normal.</li>
            <li> It is definitely 100% authentic and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so I was in need of a natural alternative that would give the same thick moisturizing cover but good absorbency (because who wants to be greasy?).</li>
            <li> I have extremely severe eczema all over so its important that I have something with a lot of moisture to pamper my skin.</li>
            <li> you would need to really stretch the skin trying to rub it in, or maybe only by slightly patting it on you&#x27;d be able to let it sink in gradually...</li>
            <li> I am a highly-allergic person who cannot handle harsh products, and on top of that, I also suffer from autoimmune diseases including painful psoriasis (which if you are familiar with psoriasis, dry skin equals misery, and the more moisturized you are, the better you fare).</li>
            <li> In the morning, even on very hot days, I put a layer on, let it soak in &amp; then rub off the excess with a dry towel.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural &amp; it helps a lot!</li>
            <li> I have found that it moisturizes better than other products (such as leading day creams with sunscreens) without leaving my face oily &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> This particular product has a very nutty smell, a solid texture, and needs warming before it spreads.</li>
            <li> WOW... didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I ordered this, but based on being chemical-free and having such a high rating, I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> The scent is very very mild, absolutely in no way \\&quot;rancid\\&quot; as one reviewer stated, and disappears (as shea scent should) very shortly after application.</li>
            <li> I personally could care less, if it makes me feel better, and it does.</li>
            <li> It works better when it&#x27;s warmed up, but if you&#x27;re lazy like me and don&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of microwaving it, you can just as easily rub a small ball of it between your hands it and becomes soft and pliable and easy</li>
            <li> The scent takes a little getting used to, it kind of smells like the dried licorice root used in Chinese medicines, but it fades quickly after applying.</li>
            <li> Next time I am looking for pure shea butter</li>
            <li> not too much but just little amount of Shea butter definitely make  my hair shiny and smooth.     </li>
            <li> about the stretch marks, my stretch marks are old stretch marks</li>
            <li> In the morning my feet are as soft as can be.  </li>
            <li> but my feet will be really soft in the winter.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I like that it is soft</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how ALL unrefined natural shea butter should smell.</li>
            <li> I have a hyper sensitive nose</li>
            <li> There is no smell as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> but I developed a rash so quit using it.</li>
            <li> Have used it two days now and psoriasis is actually fading and calming down, which in my book, is pretty miraculous and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter is not real hard like another brand I have purchased</li>
            <li> I bought and reviewed Shea on Amazon that looks and behaves like this special super secret Shea</li>
            <li> Then I put a little warm tap water in the palm of my other hand and rub the Shea Butter around in it for a moment.</li>
            <li> Love how it becomes creamy after just a few seconds of rubbing it in my hands... and boy, does it moisturize!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll sometimes mix it with a small amount of another lotion, something with a fragrance, and it easily covers any smell of the shea itself.</li>
            <li> Does have a rich, buttery, nutty smell which disappears after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> My understanding is that kpangnan butter is not necessarily a bad product at all, however it is not true shea butter.    </li>
            <li> but it is fine for coverage on small areas.</li>
            <li> I still have 2/3 of the jar left after a month of steady use.</li>
            <li> It is also terrific for taming my blonde, wavy hair frizzies in hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li> The texture is rich until it melts into your fingers due to the low melting point of shea butter.</li>
            <li> I normally heat it on a low setting for about 20-45 seconds, so it&#x27;s easier to rub on.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t smell like somebody pumped it full of harsh fragrances and perfumes.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty weird and not exactly pleasant when first applied, but it fades away, and I&#x27;m happy enough with the results that I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to get out of the container and applying it to your skin takes a lot of effort as it doesn&#x27;t rub in easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some reviews complaining of the smell of the product, it&#x27;s not overly powerful, but it is slightly nutty.  </li>
            <li> No other variables, it is this product.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for my face, and it dried it out and made me break out, but i love mixing it with my other oils.</li>
            <li> Works very well on very very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Its lightly scented and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> If making a shea butter whip for your natural tresses or body you may want to buy larger quantity.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or sometimes i put the container under the tap and run hot water till the butter melts down a bit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it right after shaping my eyebrows, on my hair and scalp, my skin, or even if I just popped a zit and just washed the area, and when I wake up the next morning there will not be a scab or dark spot in the area where the zit was popped.</li>
            <li> It is thick, rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li> I looked long and hard at many different products offered here on Amazon and read up on a lot of different sites to find \\&quot;true\\&quot; shea butter.      </li>
            <li> I scoop up a little on my finger, drawing my finger backwards through it (nail side first)</li>
            <li> I let a little bit melt in my palm first, and it smooths on no problem.</li>
            <li> For more even distribution of this moisturizer a small portion can be slightly heated to assist application.</li>
            <li> I scoop out a tiny bit, rub it briskly between my palms to warm it up, then apply a very thin layer to my face.</li>
            <li> It happens every so often (bout every few months, usually on hot days) on my chin area.</li>
            <li> My doctors kept recommending thick cream-based lotions that were full of chemical/unrecognizable ingredients</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry place, I thought I would try this shea butter</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s not a broken down manufacturer&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> This butter has a different texture and a  little funny smell, which could put some people off (Though its not overpowering).</li>
            <li> It helps with the dry crapey look of old age.</li>
            <li> As I have pretty dry skin, I like that it lasts after 1 hand-washing, but like other products, it doesn&#x27;t last longer than maybe 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Although the product may be fine the container which it came in was broken.</li>
            <li> You need very little of it to put on the skin, so this small container will work for many months to help you.</li>
            <li> Being a diabetic in my 60s, dry and flaky skin is a major problem for me.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s a bit thick right out of the tub.  </li>
            <li> As far as its effectiveness, it has really helped my serious dry-skin problem.</li>
            <li> I recently stared using tiny amounts in my hair after coloring, really works - but use small amounts to avoid greasiness.</li>
            <li> If you can put up with the smell for a few moments then I highly recommend this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin, so I usually wear this all over my body after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> I have issues with dry skin, and my dermatologist said I have eczema and psoriasis and has prescribed me nearly every medicated lotion under the sun with no real result, or</li>
            <li> But we do think it works well and sooths dry skin, especially since its unrefined and possibly has some of its healing properties intact.</li>
            <li> I had an open cut that would not close-also itching and redness-a complete mess.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used Aquaphor (not sure on the spelling) than you understand what a very greasy product is.  </li>
            <li> got this shea butter for about a third of what I had paid in the past and it is exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> Using my method of application, is is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone seeking relief from dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed coarse dry hair.</li>
            <li> The shea butter only needs to be applied once a day to keep my dry skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> My 5 yr old nephew licked his upper lip raw.</li>
            <li> I bought another one to try, the one that was not as hard as this one, and I do not like it as much as I like this one.</li>
            <li> Within one week of receiving it, the skin on my hands was soft and elastic and looked at least ten years younger.  </li>
            <li> For the price of 10.00, I expected the container to be larger.  </li>
            <li> The treatment lotion alone never accomplished this; it&#x27;s definitely the combination of the two that has cleared up my skin.    </li>
            <li> The tub should last a very long time, as it only takes a little to do a big job!</li>
            <li> , it smells a funny, even a little \\&quot;bad\\&quot; as in raw and unrefined</li>
            <li> This is not a \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The skin on my hands was too dry and scaly for words, and for years, nothing I tried made any difference until I tried this.  </li>
            <li> This shea butter worked well on my sons &amp; my dry skin &amp; eczema.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my face and body to keep it from getting dry in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it is a miracle moisturizer for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations, the only down side to this was the price.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are right about it being a little hard</li>
            <li> I use a hair blow dryer to soften the shea butter ever so slightly before applying; only takes about 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> After using this nightly on my neck (upward strokes), my slightly sagging &amp; crapey look is definitely improving!  </li>
            <li> My hair has been getting very dry and thinning out.</li>
            <li> It does clog my pours a little, so I need to find a deep cleanser for that.</li>
            <li> I tested a little on the back of my hands as soon I could</li>
            <li> It is hard, but as soon as you take your fingers and rub it the butter will be soft as your body temperature warms it up.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other similar products, you get less for your money.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I expected, but perhaps when you get 100% Shea Butter unrefined and certified</li>
            <li> There was a depression in the center of the butter as if something was pressed into it.</li>
            <li> but not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Smell is not too alarming yet</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with it causing breakouts, and when I need an extra boost, I will use a few drops of jojoba oil before applying this.</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer on my face at bedtime - and for daytime I have a separate glass jar in which I&#x27;ve mixed a little foundation that was too dark for me into some of this shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I put this shea butter on his chapped raw skin twice and by the next day it was completley healed!</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have a little bit of an odd smell, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering and isn&#x27;t noticeable after a short time.  </li>
            <li> I add a few drops of essential oils to my mix to tone down the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other products you might want to check out is NaturOli.com</li>
            <li> like I would with other lotions or creams.</li>
            <li> and I still have the same small 4 oz tub of the shea I purchased about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any of the other benefits.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Started with every other day.</li>
            <li> I also use on hands and as a cuticle cream (usually as a reinforcement after traditional cuticle oil).</li>
            <li> and it is not grainy like the other one I purchased.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is what I expected, it is a bit thick though, almost similar to grease.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is dry and hard, it is not soft or liquidize like some other shea butters and this is what I like.</li>
            <li> I also use Argon oil as an after shower conditioner VERY  LITTLE, rub it into wet hair and towel dry and you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> Shea butter in the raw form is firm, similar to the pomade wax that people use for hair styling.  </li>
            <li> --- it&#x27;s almost rock solid hard.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a  long way &amp; no strong odor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Shea Butter from my local Whole Foods store, I only got an ounce and it was very expensive!</li>
            <li> It is also not very smooth.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my skin.</li>
            <li> It is true that it is a little difficult to use since it is fairly hard in the container.</li>
            <li> You put a small amount (a little goes a long way) in the palm of your hand and rub your hands together and the shea butter softens and melts</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to reapply every half hour</li>
            <li> and they had to melt it on the stove, or had a odd color.   </li>
            <li> My Shea butter was delivered to my apartment in below zero temps and needless to say it was frozen solid when I got home hours later.</li>
            <li> I have been using jojoba oil and jamician black castor oil and had no adverse effects from them.</li>
            <li> My skin feel softer and less brittle.</li>
            <li> The texture is very thick but the product can still be used alone or mixed with other oils.</li>
            <li> This unrefined version of shea is a little grainy which I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say other than I like it.</li>
            <li> I keep a little tin for travel as well.</li>
            <li> I also gave a little to my husband.  </li>
            <li> I do mix a little liquid coconut oil in to make it even softer and easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> At the beach I use a heavy duty sun protectant.  </li>
            <li> This method makes it easier to apply and you don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, if you want moisture use coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I recommend shea butter for night use hence this is a heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> You can also melt the butter by putting some in a container and micro waving for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bear the smell and although it pains me to waste anything, I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> Obtained for very dry skin due to DM and poor circulatory problems.</li>
            <li> Not true!  </li>
            <li> However, $10 (plus shipping) is a little expensive for only 4 oz., which the amount was not advertized.</li>
            <li> I prefer the raw, unfinished stuff.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the treatment lotion from drying out and irritating my skin, and I&#x27;ve noticed that the dark spots from previous acne breakouts have faded.</li>
            <li> well, it seems like little fade my stretch marks but hard to tell.</li>
            <li> My DARK spots from acne scars are fading and I am serious.</li>
            <li> No matter what I try, it is still hard to spread and leaves a heavy waxed feeling.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not too bad, and I don&#x27;t really care because the product is so multi-functional.</li>
            <li> I really like this shea butter, and don&#x27;t understand what people are saying about the bad odor.  </li>
            <li> Oh, by the way, I use it on my neck also, but I&#x27;m careful to keep it thin</li>
            <li> I sought an alternative to the expensive so-called \\&quot;diabetic creams\\&quot; that are only marginally effective.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and since i started using this - no more bumps.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this happened because I use a sheabutter/oil mixture on my legs for softness and discoloration  and that never broke me out.</li>
            <li> &gt;.&gt;</li>
            <li> I should have compared prices before i was anxious to buy..</li>
            <li> really* hard to use</li>
            <li> This product is way too hard to spread.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was suppose to be unrefined; however, it is too creamy to be unrefined and did not seem to have the desired effect on my hair and skin as the shea butter that is hard and rock-like in appearance.</li>
            <li> It gave me soft skin, but at the end of the week my pores were badly clogged.</li>
            <li> After some disappointing purchases, I finally sought out one that is certified as being of the highest quality and purity.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The end result is that you don&#x27;t have it too thick and therefore too greasy.  </li>
            <li> Serious Gardener and horse person.  </li>
            <li> Living in a cold state, the heat is on all winter and skin becomes very dry.  </li>
            <li> Hard as a rock not sure if something is wrong with the one I got</li>
            <li> I read reviews of other brands of shea butter that had mold, bad smells, hard as a rock</li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed that I did not purchase the larger portion of this product.</li>
            <li> and it was very hard to spread.</li>
            <li> The shea butter inside the broken container was not level as one would expect a product of this nature to be.</li>
            <li> He suffers from sever patches of dry skin on his legs in the winter that itch so badly he scratches til they bleed.  </li>
            <li> Somewhere between 6-9 bucks for an ounce is outrageous in my personal opinion</li>
            <li> No after-smell or oily residue or weird glitteriness.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product.  </li>
            <li> Just too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I mean it smells REALLY bad.</li>
            <li> Bad after smell and difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> I use this on my litle girl, who suffers from eczema.</li>
            <li> I wish someone had told me that the raw stuff smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> Ankles, elbows, even those impossible cracks on your heels that look like a satelite image of the fjords in the netherlands...</li>
            <li> If I skip applying it for over 24 hours, my skin starts to look bad again.  </li>
            <li> the smell mite be the smell of (plastic) but it doesn&#x27;t bother me its not as bad, and if yu want yu can add oils and scents to the shea butter.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so greasy or smells so bad</li>
            <li> It was too bad</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> the smell is just too awful.  </li>
            <li> It was also terribly itchy.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel coated and just nasty.</li>
            <li> This smells awful!</li>
            <li> I planned on using it for my body and hair, but I won&#x27;t be using it for anything because the smell is so awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Looked molded when I received it.</li>
            <li> It gave me soft skin, but at the end of the week my pores were badly clogged. Do not use on your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove my stretch marks. I read a lot of review and article about   how to remove stretch marks and I figured unrefined Shea butter is the best to way to improve the skin texture   and stretch marks on your skin.    I&#x27;ve been using this for a month. well, definitely my skin texture got improved. especially my thigh and hip area.  I have pretty dry skin, so I usually wear this all over my body after taking a shower. and it keeps my skin smooth and moisturize all day long. I also use this for my hair. not too much but just little amount of Shea butter definitely make  my hair shiny and smooth.     about the stretch marks, my stretch marks are old stretch marks so I can&#x27;t really tell about new stretch marks or prevent stretch marks. well, it seems like little fade my stretch marks but hard to tell. my mom told me her tummy area looks better after using this but for the hips and thigh area, I think it takes more time.    but I really like the Shea butter, and I still using it for every night before go to sleep.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin nice.  I just recently got into eating really really healthy and using all natural products.   Only thing i have to say is that i wish i would have started all this stuff sooner.  This shea butter is good stuff.   Other products you might want to check out is NaturOli.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this high quality shea butter.  The jar packaging is nice and the smell is non-offensive and dissipates quickly.  I use it mainly on clean feet and then wear socks to bed.  In the morning my feet are as soft as can be.  I use a hair blow dryer to soften the shea butter ever so slightly before applying; only takes about 10 seconds.  I highly recommend this shea butter.</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter for my face mainly.  It is rich and lasts all day.  I don&#x27;t wear make up just mascara &amp; liner.  I like the cost and that it seems to protect my skin.  I think it&#x27;s protecting my skin from aging.  Even though it doesn&#x27;t have protection against the sun&#x27;s rays I also use it all summer for day to day wear.  At the beach I use a heavy duty sun protectant.  This unrefined version of shea is a little grainy which I don&#x27;t like but it&#x27;s worth it if it is more pure and certified so.  After rubbing it in my palms, it becomes pliable and smooth.  If I apply too much I apply a very warm cloth and wipe some of the creme off.  All in all I like the product; I have used it for about two years.  It can also be used from head to toe for skin softening and care.</li>
            <li> I looked long and hard at many different products offered here on Amazon and read up on a lot of different sites to find \\&quot;true\\&quot; shea butter.      I read on several sites that what is often sold as shea butter is in fact kpangnan butter.  Reading the descriptions of the two products, I think that this is happening with some sellers here on Amazon, judging from the look of some of the products.    My understanding is that kpangnan butter is not necessarily a bad product at all, however it is not true shea butter.    From the color, the scent, the feel of this product I am certain that this product is a true shea butter, and not kpangnan butter.    The scent is very very mild, absolutely in no way \\&quot;rancid\\&quot; as one reviewer stated, and disappears (as shea scent should) very shortly after application.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Whole Foods in my area. It&#x27;s great for dry skin and scalp.  I use this on my litle girl, who suffers from eczema. It helps a great deal and a little does go a long way. The smell is not the greatest, but what do you expect??!!! It&#x27;s shea butter. Plus, it&#x27;s not a broken down manufacturer&#x27;s product. It&#x27;s pure shea butter! It works for my family and I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I know the quality of the shea butter is great, but WOW does it stink!  I can only use it on my feet,in socks b/c the smell is just too awful.  Plus, it&#x27;s *really* hard to use --- it&#x27;s almost rock solid hard.  Not really what I expected, but perhaps when you get 100% Shea Butter unrefined and certified grade A...this is just what it is.  yuck...but my feet will be really soft in the winter.  :)</li>
            <li> got this shea butter for about a third of what I had paid in the past and it is exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> For some reason when I submitted a review on this through my order list, Amazon had it titled as \\&quot;Cocoa Butter\\&quot; for my review. It is Shea Butter that I purchased, so I&#x27;m leaving a review here since this is the correct product and the correct Seller.  Anyway, it is great. It is true that it is a little difficult to use since it is fairly hard in the container. However, here is what I do. I scoop up a little on my finger, drawing my finger backwards through it (nail side first) so it doesn&#x27;t get under my nail. Then I put a little warm tap water in the palm of my other hand and rub the Shea Butter around in it for a moment. Then I smooth it over my legs. If I need to, I add a little water in my hand and smooth that over my legs afterward so it thins out more. This method makes it easier to apply and you don&#x27;t waste it. The end result is that you don&#x27;t have it too thick and therefore too greasy.  Even if I go to bed within 15 minutes of applying it to my legs, it doesn&#x27;t make my sheets greasy.  As far as its effectiveness, it has really helped my serious dry-skin problem. I&#x27;m almost 64 and because of this shea butter, I no longer have the alligator or line wrinkles that I had before. I just apply it at night. Sometimes I also apply it in the morning just because my skin feels so nice afterward.  I&#x27;ve tried so many skin lotions in the store and they simply didn&#x27;t work. I even tried organic coconut oil. That didn&#x27;t work either. This is a wonderful product.  Yes, it does have a little bit of an odd smell, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering and isn&#x27;t noticeable after a short time.  Using my method of application, is is long lasting. I still have 2/3 of the jar left after a month of steady use. I will definitely buy more when I get close to running out.  Oh, by the way, I use it on my neck also, but I&#x27;m careful to keep it thin so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my skin. It helps with the dry crapey look of old age. Update:  After using this nightly on my neck (upward strokes), my slightly sagging &amp; crapey look is definitely improving!  This is not a \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for dry skin.  I do believe you have to correct the cause from within possibly due to not drinking enough water, not taking in healthy oils such as organic coconut oil, flax seed, or olive oil, or some kind of vitamin deficiency.  I haven&#x27;t figured it out yet.  Only expect this product to make your skin comfortable and look better.  If I skip applying it for over 24 hours, my skin starts to look bad again.  However, I love how the product helps me live with the problem much more easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great like other Shea butter products. It is also not very smooth. However it works great. It makes my hair really soft. I wear my hair natural &amp; it helps a lot!</li>
            <li> This is great, my skin is like butter it just melts in my hand as a rub the shea butter. I&#x27;m so glad I selected this choice of shea butter I wish I wld have bought a larger size its well worth the money. I knw for sum the smell mite be the smell of (plastic) but it doesn&#x27;t bother me its not as bad, and if yu want yu can add oils and scents to the shea butter. I like how its thick, but goes on smooth, and refined shea butter is the best yu get real results frm it. I apply it on my feet, and face and my daughters scars. The after affect is the best becus ur skin be so soft, and all yu need 2 apply is a small amount and it does wonders. I hope yu get the same satisfaction as I have frm using the product best of luck</li>
            <li> The product works pretty well. The consistency is what I expected, it is a bit thick though, almost similar to grease. As I have pretty dry skin, I like that it lasts after 1 hand-washing, but like other products, it doesn&#x27;t last longer than maybe 8 hours. It also has a funny smell to it, but goes away in like 10min. I give it 4 stars because it does as well a job as many other lotions, however, while I can also use this product in my hair, it&#x27;s better. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This product is way too hard to spread. I&#x27;ve tried everything after reading several tips on these reviews. No matter what I try, it is still hard to spread and leaves a heavy waxed feeling. Want to return this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter because it&#x27;s winter and the company I normally order from is sold out. I have extremely severe eczema all over so its important that I have something with a lot of moisture to pamper my skin. This shea butter is very moisturizing and I don&#x27;t have to reapply every half hour like I would with other lotions or creams. I definitely recommend this product to anyone seeking relief from dry skin. A warning, though, if you have a very good sense of smell, it might smell like plastic. But the smell is tolerable, and it doesn&#x27;t outweigh the good this butter does.</li>
            <li> This is shea butter - just shea butter.  I wish someone had told me that the raw stuff smells horrible.  Another reviewer mentioned that it smells a bit like plastic and I think that&#x27;s a reasonable approximation.  There is good news however, the smell dissipates pretty quickly (about a minute or so) once you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It works incredibly well when it comes to moisturizing.  Ankles, elbows, even those impossible cracks on your heels that look like a satelite image of the fjords in the netherlands... it&#x27;ll work there too.  If you can put up with the smell for a few moments then I highly recommend this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - The consistency: It&#x27;s a bit thick right out of the tub.  It has a consistency much like play doa - almost clay like, though a tad smoother and lighter.  It&#x27;s less like a cream and more like a wax.  It does however, sink in and melt away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I mainly chose this brand of shea butter because the company makes sure that consumers will get the best quality of shea butter (100% Certified Premium Grade A).  I read reviews of other brands of shea butter that had mold, bad smells, hard as a rock and they had to melt it on the stove, or had a odd color.   Well, AAA Shea Butter is the leader of the rest.    The Shea Butter does have a sweet smell and I do like it. (Once the shea butter melts into your skin you don&#x27;t smell it as much.)  The shea butter is a medium consistency.  You put a small amount (a little goes a long way) in the palm of your hand and rub your hands together and the shea butter softens and melts then you apply to skin or hair.  The shea butter moistures very well.  I use the shea butter on my face, body and hair.  There are several benefits of using shea butter which was on a brochure included with my order.    Amazon said that it takes 2 - 3 additional days for shipping from this company....Not true!  2 days after I placed my order, I had my shea butter in my mail box!  What a nice surprise.     My order arrived quickly, it came with brochure, order slip, AAA Shea Butter business card (which lists the 21 uses of their shea butter on the back of the card).    This was the best $10.00 spent!  The only problem is that I should have purchased the 1 lb. instead of the 4 oz.  Because my skin and hair love this shea butter!  I will be ordering more this week!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how good this stuff is. My DARK spots from acne scars are fading and I am serious. Fading after only 2 weeks use once or twice a day, everyone can see the difference, unbelieveable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 or 3 months now. On my face, neck, hands, feet, lips, bikini line, wherever. It is great stuff! I bought it because I am trying to lower the number of chemicals that I put on my skin, and also because it is salicylate free, and I am on the guauifenisen protocol for FMS.    Since I have started using shea butter I have noticed that the wrinkles that were on my face (at the corner of my eyes) have disappeared, and generally my complexion is much better overall. I use it 24-7. In the morning, even on very hot days, I put a layer on, let it soak in &amp; then rub off the excess with a dry towel. I have found that it moisturizes better than other products (such as leading day creams with sunscreens) without leaving my face oily &amp; shiny. In fact it equalizes so effectively that I don&#x27;t have dry spots on my face anymore.    It does clog my pours a little, so I need to find a deep cleanser for that. But it&#x27;s not too bad, and I don&#x27;t really care because the product is so multi-functional. I gave it a 4-star review instead of 5 because of that. It has nothing to do with the manufacturer or seller (I got it very quickly in the mail) but due to the inherent nature of shea butter.    This particular product has a very nutty smell, a solid texture, and needs warming before it spreads. I have gotten used to the smell, and quite like it now.</li>
            <li> I tried it for my face, and it dried it out and made me break out, but i love mixing it with my other oils. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t praise this product hightly enough.  The skin on my hands was too dry and scaly for words, and for years, nothing I tried made any difference until I tried this.  Within one week of receiving it, the skin on my hands was soft and elastic and looked at least ten years younger.  I use it on my hands, face and neck every morning and night and am thrilled with the results.  It does have a unique smell, but it&#x27;s not really unpleasant.  And it is solid in the jar, but it softens quickly in the palm of your hand like butter and is absorbed into the skin.  My home will never be without it again.</li>
            <li> Being a diabetic in my 60s, dry and flaky skin is a major problem for me. I sought an alternative to the expensive so-called \\&quot;diabetic creams\\&quot; that are only marginally effective.&lt;br /&gt;My research indicated that not all Shea Butters are of the same quality. After some disappointing purchases, I finally sought out one that is certified as being of the highest quality and purity.&lt;br /&gt;This particular unrefined and certified Shea Butter is fantastic. Unlike the cheaper unrefined Shea Butters that I tried from the local health food store, this product is much smoother, not grainy, very easy to soften in your palm, and it has a much milder aroma.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is oily on my skin, I found noticeable improvements in my skin almost immediately. I am now using it every morning with excellent moisturizing and healing results.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product very highly. If you have dry skin - you could not do better than this certified Shea Butter product</li>
            <li> First time I have bought Shea Butter.  Melted with almond oil and fractionated coconut oil to make a lotion.  Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say other than I like it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased about 3 or 4 different kinds of Shea&#x27;s butters, but this one is the best by far. I like that it is soft and I can use on my hair and body. My husband and my two daughter&#x27;s use as well. Living on the east cost your body goes through a lot. Get this Shea Butter and you will be glad you did. I plan to buy another</li>
            <li> My daughter and I were experimenting making homemade lipgloss. I used this brand because it&#x27;s the best I can find. It is very emollient and I find many uses for it. I use it on my feet at nights for smooth moist feet in the morning. Will definitely buy again,</li>
            <li> I purchased this Shea Butter from my local Whole Foods store, I only got an ounce and it was very expensive! Somewhere between 6-9 bucks for an ounce is outrageous in my personal opinion BUT you really get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an avid shea butter user and this is by far one of the best that I have used. The texture is very thick but the product can still be used alone or mixed with other oils. This shea butter has one of the smoother textures and it absorbs quickly into the skin. It has a light smokey &amp; nutty smell, which is to be expected. That&#x27;s how ALL unrefined natural shea butter should smell. The odor goes away quickly when it&#x27;s absorbed. I used this shea butter during pregnancy to reduce stretch marks, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> There are so many uses for this product, but let me just add the ones that I found to be imprortant for me. This is GREAT for soothing skin after shaving. I am very prone to razor burn/rash and since i started using this - no more bumps. Also great for sunburns. I recently stared using tiny amounts in my hair after coloring, really works - but use small amounts to avoid greasiness. For the face, I let it absorb for awhile and then wipe off any excess.</li>
            <li> Although the product may be fine the container which it came in was broken. The shea butter inside the broken container was not level as one would expect a product of this nature to be. There was a depression in the center of the butter as if something was pressed into it. It makes me feel funny about using it.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product. A little goes a  long way &amp; no strong odor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was suppose to be unrefined; however, it is too creamy to be unrefined and did not seem to have the desired effect on my hair and skin as the shea butter that is hard and rock-like in appearance. I would not recommend this product as an all day moisturizer but it is fine for coverage on small areas.</li>
            <li> I have had chronic eczema on my hand (for many years). This winter I tried everything, including cortisone cream, to heal my cracked palm. I had an open cut that would not close-also itching and redness-a complete mess. I used the Grade A Shea Butter and noticed almost immediate relief. After about a week the cut was healed and the skin on my palm is now normal. I use it every night and I have had no recurrence of any of the symptoms. Be aware that the sent of this cream is a little bizarre, but the scent disappears after about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> My Shea butter was delivered to my apartment in below zero temps and needless to say it was frozen solid when I got home hours later. It&#x27;s thawed now and boy-oh-boy it&#x27;s good stuff! I tested a little on the back of my hands as soon I could and it agrees with my skin  nor im</li>
            <li> Shea butter is amazing stuff, but I would not recommend this one.  As pure shea butters go, AAA shea butter is a bit on the greasy side - its doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin well - and it smells like plastic.  Next time I am looking for pure shea butter I will definitely try a different brand.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the reviews. The product is solid-like in the container but melts on rubbing between the palms. The product absorbs quickly into the skin. I then proceeded to apply this product to my scalp. After about 2 days of application, the smell of my hair became a bit offensive. It was also terribly itchy. Maybe it is not the best for hair. Great for skin but not for my type of hair or scalp. It became tremendously itchy after 24 hours each time. I have type 4a hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you..it was delivered on time as described..but I think that unrefined shea better should be yellow which is not with the one I received otherwise every thing is excellent! Thank u:)</li>
            <li> This shea butter worked well on my sons &amp; my dry skin &amp; eczema.  I melted some at a low temp and added essential oils of lavender, frankincense &amp; geranium and it seemed to help our skin.  I need more!</li>
            <li> I really like this shea butter, and don&#x27;t understand what people are saying about the bad odor.  It has an earthy smell, but that is what it is suppose to smell like!  It is hard, but as soon as you take your fingers and rub it the butter will be soft as your body temperature warms it up.  It goes on very smooth. The tub should last a very long time, as it only takes a little to do a big job! I bought it as it is certified organic, as you just don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting from many brands. Thanks AAA for making a great product.</li>
            <li> The best Shea butter ever better than what they sell at whole foods.. I used it for my face I felt it was one of the best face product i have ever use.  It was exactly  as advertised certified organic.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter. Works better for my eczema than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> For the price of 10.00, I expected the container to be larger.  Compared to other similar products, you get less for your money.  Otherwise, the product is good quality.</li>
            <li> I read a lot about different moisturizers before deciding to buy the unrefined shea butter. I have issues with dry skin, and my dermatologist said I have eczema and psoriasis and has prescribed me nearly every medicated lotion under the sun with no real result, or it&#x27;s so greasy or smells so bad I can&#x27;t stand it!    This stuff has turned out to be the best thing ever for my skin, and the fact that you don&#x27;t have to slather it on is great.  I was going through numerous bottles of lotion trying to keep my skin hydrated and I still have the same small 4 oz tub of the shea I purchased about a month ago.  I normally heat it on a low setting for about 20-45 seconds, so it&#x27;s easier to rub on.  It is a bit greasy for the first 30 minutes or so, but not overly so.  If you&#x27;ve ever used Aquaphor (not sure on the spelling) than you understand what a very greasy product is.  I can apply this and sit on the couch and not worry about it rubbing off all over it and discoloring the furniture!  I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin.  I&#x27;ve seen some reviews complaining of the smell of the product, it&#x27;s not overly powerful, but it is slightly nutty.  I&#x27;ll sometimes mix it with a small amount of another lotion, something with a fragrance, and it easily covers any smell of the shea itself.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell too much and it was very hard to spread. I like east African shea butter a lot better because its more of a liquid form and I don&#x27;t have to microwave it to get it to spread more easily. It does provide a good amount of moisture but aside from that I didn&#x27;t see any of the other benefits. I put it on my face and it made my face break out so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 30, but have combination/oily skin and am still prone to acne breakouts. I use this shea butter every evening underneath a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide lotion. It&#x27;s fantastic! It keeps the treatment lotion from drying out and irritating my skin, and I&#x27;ve noticed that the dark spots from previous acne breakouts have faded. I rarely break out now, and everyone tells me how great my skin looks! The treatment lotion alone never accomplished this; it&#x27;s definitely the combination of the two that has cleared up my skin.    The scent takes a little getting used to, it kind of smells like the dried licorice root used in Chinese medicines, but it fades quickly after applying. I scoop out a tiny bit, rub it briskly between my palms to warm it up, then apply a very thin layer to my face. After letting it soak in for a minute, I apply the acne treatment lotion on top. Don&#x27;t expect overnight magic; it took about 6 weeks of regular use to see a real difference. It takes time for the existing lesions to heal and your skin to regenerate itself fully.    You really only need a tiny amount; this 4oz jar lasted me for an entire year! Not bad for [...] bucks.</li>
            <li> I bought this to experiment with my own body butter recipe, but so far I have just used it on its own. It is thick, rich and creamy.  Feels oily at first, but soaks right in at skin temperature and feels soft and silky with no oily residue. Does have a rich, buttery, nutty smell which disappears after a few minutes.  I have used it to relieve mild to moderate skin and scalp irritations with great success.  I am using it on top of Aloe Vera Gel right now to relieve a heat rash on top of my foot - very soothing. I have used it as a nail cuticle cream and to soften my computer jockey elbow callous. It is also terrific for taming my blonde, wavy hair frizzies in hot, humid weather. Very versatile product, great quality. Will buy this again:)</li>
            <li> The Shea butter is a great product, but I feel you can get the same results with any regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I loved this.  I made the mistake of trying another brand that has great reviews but it was stinky and didn&#x27;t seem authentic.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell and it&#x27;s amazing for the skin.  I can&#x27;t wait to work through the 3 pack so I&#x27;m going to bite the bullet and order this.  One of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed coarse dry hair. I heard nothing but good reviews on shea butter so I had to try it. Well let me just say that my hair does not like shea butter. It made my hair feel coated and just nasty. I tried it for apporximately two weeks and couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. My skin had even started to break out everywhere my hair touched it. I am not sure why this happened because I use a sheabutter/oil mixture on my legs for softness and discoloration  and that never broke me out. I am not going to say not to buy from this seller however, the product seemed authentic and was recieved in no time at all. It&#x27;s just not the right product for everyone. Good Luck and Bleesings!  P.S. I have been using jojoba oil and jamician black castor oil and had no adverse effects from them. If you&#x27;re like me and couldn&#x27;t use the shea butter give them a try.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to other reviewers. This product would be good if you could actually use it. It&#x27;s so hard to get out of the container and applying it to your skin takes a lot of effort as it doesn&#x27;t rub in easily. I may try scooping it out and melting in the microwave or something; haven&#x27;t decided yet. Don&#x27;t waste your money, if you want moisture use coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Hard as a rock not sure if something is wrong with the one I got but not really what I was looking for. Sort of my own fault too but def was expecting an actual cream.</li>
            <li> Very nice product! I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller before and now this does come in jar pictured instead of plastic bag. Plastic bag never bothered me because I use this primarily to make lip balm. Scent is mild and I&#x27;ve never noticed any shells or particles. When I need more, I will re-order from this seller.</li>
            <li> Great Karité Butter, smells great, naturally, without any perfumes; the perfect fresh nut smell.  Great consistency, melts on contact, smoother than any unrefined karité butters I&#x27;ve tried.  Better than the expensive (and very good) Shea Butter from L&#x27;Occitane.</li>
            <li> WOW... didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I ordered this, but based on being chemical-free and having such a high rating, I decided to go for it. I am a highly-allergic person who cannot handle harsh products, and on top of that, I also suffer from autoimmune diseases including painful psoriasis (which if you are familiar with psoriasis, dry skin equals misery, and the more moisturized you are, the better you fare). My doctors kept recommending thick cream-based lotions that were full of chemical/unrecognizable ingredients so I was in need of a natural alternative that would give the same thick moisturizing cover but good absorbency (because who wants to be greasy?). So glad I took a chance and tried this. I will continue to order again and again. Have used it two days now and psoriasis is actually fading and calming down, which in my book, is pretty miraculous and worth the money. This will definitely stay in my \\&quot;arsenal\\&quot; of products to rebuild my health. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to the people who say \\&quot;it stinks\\&quot;, I disagree. It just doesn&#x27;t smell like somebody pumped it full of harsh fragrances and perfumes. It smells like what shea butter smells like, and if you are looking for natural and effective, the last thing you should be hung up on is scent. I personally could care less, if it makes me feel better, and it does. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this seller is fantastic - item arrived in perfect condition (I was nervous, living in Arizona and trying to order shea butter in the summer heat), and fast. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use it right after shaping my eyebrows, on my hair and scalp, my skin, or even if I just popped a zit and just washed the area, and when I wake up the next morning there will not be a scab or dark spot in the area where the zit was popped. It happens every so often (bout every few months, usually on hot days) on my chin area. Anyway, it serves a lot of other great uses. It is definitely 100% authentic and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry place, I thought I would try this shea butter and it works great.  It came in the jar shown, after reading another review I was concerned it might come in a block, no jar, not so.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is great.. but the price is way too high.. There is another shea butter from Nature and Herb that has one more ounce and is half the price &gt;.&gt; I should have compared prices before i was anxious to buy..</li>
            <li> I bought and reviewed Shea on Amazon that looks and behaves like this special super secret Shea and i have to say this really is grossly over priced for the amount that you get. I wish I knew then what I know now. I paid $15 for 2 ounces of this product not realizing if I looked up ivory Shea butter I could pay $18 for 16 or so ounces of a similar product. It&#x27;s the same color and consistency and is also raw/unrefined just like this product. If you believe in the merit of this product and company and what they do go for it, but I need to watch my wallet right now and will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling shea butter thus far... it does not have the loud smokey, charred smell of most shea butters. The texture is rich until it melts into your fingers due to the low melting point of shea butter. This goes on very shinny but absorbs to a lustrous glow after a few minutes. I recommend shea butter for night use hence this is a heavy moisturizer. If you have dryer skin this may suit for daytime use. For more even distribution of this moisturizer a small portion can be slightly heated to assist application. AAA butter guaranteed quality and it is what they delivered. I am somewhat disappointed that I did not purchase the larger portion of this product. I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> The product itself is of excellent quality. However, $10 (plus shipping) is a little expensive for only 4 oz., which the amount was not advertized. I thought just putting a pic of the container was misleading, because I thought the jar shown would be larger. I previously bought 1 pound os raw shea butter (excellent quality) for $12. So I definately felt cheated.</li>
            <li> great product especially if you have eczema .all my 3 kids has eczema so i was really looking for a good moisturizer that will last on their skin at least for more than 2 hrs and this is the answer. But before applying make sure you rub it in to your palm first . Best result if applied after bath.</li>
            <li> I have had this jar over a year.  I don&#x27;t use a lot of it, but it works really well!  I made some foot cream out of this, and it has helped me with my itchy feet!  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Good product especially for Expecting moms with dry skin. Works better than cocoa butter we think, especially since cocoa butter has a tendency to get rubbed off by clothing. This butter has a different texture and a  little funny smell, which could put some people off (Though its not overpowering). But we do think it works well and sooths dry skin, especially since its unrefined and possibly has some of its healing properties intact.</li>
            <li> I deleted my 1st review of this shea butter because I gave it only 1 star. I&#x27;ve been using my 2nd order of this shea butter and I know I will order and use it many more times as long as it is available on amazon. This is a great product.  I like it. It helps not only with such skin problems as dryness but it stops itching as well. Yes, it is dry and hard, it is not soft or liquidize like some other shea butters and this is what I like. You need very little of it to put on the skin, so this small container will work for many months to help you. I bought another one to try, the one that was not as hard as this one, and I do not like it as much as I like this one. Great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the purest form of shea butter and I am on my second order.  If you warm it in your hand for just a second it goes on wonderfully and I like the nutty fragrance.  I feel great about using it.</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my bathroom. I use it on my hair to keep away frizz. It works even though my hair is very straight and fine....a little product goes a long way. I also use it on my face and body to keep it from getting dry in the wintertime. I have had both the original and the lavender. I like them both. The lavender isn&#x27;t too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Shea butter melts nicely between my fingers before applying to my fine thin tresses.  If making a shea butter whip for your natural tresses or body you may want to buy larger quantity.  Smell is not too alarming yet I add a few drops of essential oils to my mix to tone down the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LMR - Georgia</li>
            <li> I used this product to make a exfoliating body scrub. The scrub was super moisturizing. I is a great product I melted it first to make my salt dead seat scrub</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews of this shea butter and the strong smell, I was very hesitant to try it.  I have a hyper sensitive nose and I knew it would annoy me to no end if I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I didn&#x27;t.  But as I continued to use it, the smell wasn&#x27;t as noticeable.  I would say it reminds me of a campfire smell - not a bad smell, just different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto the actual product.  Shea butter in the raw form is firm, similar to the pomade wax that people use for hair styling.  It works better when it&#x27;s warmed up, but if you&#x27;re lazy like me and don&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of microwaving it, you can just as easily rub a small ball of it between your hands it and becomes soft and pliable and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most amazing thing is, my skin tone is beautiful.  Living in a cold state, the heat is on all winter and skin becomes very dry.  The shea butter only needs to be applied once a day to keep my dry skin moisturized.  And in the summer, it&#x27;s the perfect thing to put on after a day at the beach or pool.  I am very fair skinned and have skin that tends to break out easily and I can honestly say, I&#x27;ve not had a single rash or blemish in the 6 months I&#x27;ve been using this.  My skin tone is brighter and healthier looking.  I also used it to rub into a scar and you can&#x27;t even see the scar any longer.  When I have a mild rash or skin irritation, I rub in some shea butter and get immediate relief.  It seems to help mild rashes heal more quickly too.  I was so impressed, that I started using the residue that was left on my eyelashes and over my hair to help with frizzies.  There are SO many uses for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a more natural way to care for your skin.  The 4 oz tub has lasted me 6 months and that is with my husband using it every day as well.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I returned the product. Bad after smell and difficult to spread. Just didn&#x27;t like to overall. Will keep looking for a better product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I was looking for. It is very effective -- a tiny amount is all that&#x27;s needed per treatment. Be careful not to use too much at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it smells a funny, even a little \\&quot;bad\\&quot; as in raw and unrefined (which IMHO is a good thing) but that smell goes away soon after application (almost immedialtely in fact..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order more of the same in the future..</li>
            <li> Hell yes, shea butter! You dopes with your Jergens and St. Ives. Get real. Get buttery. My skin has never felt more awesome. A bit of a production but it&#x27;s easy if you just stick it under a hair dryer for 20 seconds and melt it then put it on. No after-smell or oily residue or weird glitteriness. This stuff is amazing and lasts forever. SHEA BUTTER, SHEA BUTTER, SHEA BUTTER (join in, now)!</li>
            <li> I can feel and see the supreme quality... Love the nutty smell (not disturbing at all). Love how it becomes creamy after just a few seconds of rubbing it in my hands... and boy, does it moisturize!! Love that it&#x27;s not gritty at all and has a smooth consistency to it.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem when I use it on my face is that to make it glide smoothly on your skin without stretching it, you need to scoop quite a bit, but then when you put it all on your face, it&#x27;s too much and feels kinda greasy (I have a combination/acne prone skin)... on the contrary, if you scoop less, you won&#x27;t be able to apply it on your face so smoothly, cuz the consistency is kinda thick and doesn&#x27;t spread that easy... you would need to really stretch the skin trying to rub it in, or maybe only by slightly patting it on you&#x27;d be able to let it sink in gradually... oh well, i put quite a lot and spread it easily and then wait a few moments for it to absorb and then blot the rest of it with a clean towel or napkin and it feels great on my face!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well on very very dry skin. My skin feel softer and less brittle. Started with every other day.</li>
            <li> for those purchasing this for moisture, look for almond or jojoba oil. This is the topping. It is a great sealent to keep the moisture in your hair, to really get my hair decently moist i also use black jamaican castor as a scalp oil (for thickness) &amp;&amp; sealent which i do every 2-3 days depending on dryness</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am getting ready to reorder. I use it every single day. very very happy  :)</li>
            <li> This smells awful! I am very disappointed in this product. I mean it smells REALLY bad. I put some on my hands and about 10 minutes later I kept asking myself \\&quot;what is that smell?\\&quot; I though I had touched something rotten and then I realized it was the shea butter! I planned on using it for my body and hair, but I won&#x27;t be using it for anything because the smell is so awful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product mainly on my hair. My hair has been getting very dry and thinning out. Since starting using it i can see my hair come to life. You however need to rub it between your hands to melt it. Or sometimes i put the container under the tap and run hot water till the butter melts down a bit. Totally recommend it tho.</li>
            <li> Something didn&#x27;t seem quite right about this product. I didn&#x27;t feel like it was actually Shea butter. I could have paid the same price and gotten more than 4 oz. Note to future self; do your research.</li>
            <li> Using 1 year.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things.  Lovely, strong fingernails for the 1st time in my life.  No other variables, it is this product.  Serious Gardener and horse person.  Fingernails and hands are really abused, but look magazine photo worthy now.  Wrinkles on forearms gone.  Again, no variables.  Am starting to use on face.  Will report results after 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the scent.  Reminds me of freshly turned earth in the spring.  This jar is denser than the first one purchased.  First one was fluffier.  Doesn&#x27;t matter to me.  Just a note to others that consistency varies.</li>
            <li> It was recommended I use shea butter for a healing tattoo. It worked great and I use it for softer skin on my feet, on my legs after shaving and as a healing agent.</li>
            <li> This is my secind time purchasing this product. I bought to uspe as a moisturizer instead of the high dollar ones at the pharmacy. My 5 yr old nephew licked his upper lip raw. My sister purchased high dollar creams but it didnt work . I put this shea butter on his chapped raw skin twice and by the next day it was completley healed! I use it as a skin cream and I am thrilled that it tightens the neck skin, reduces puffy eyes and erases fine lines. I swear by this cream and just placed another order. Its lightly scented and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency.  It&#x27;s not too hard and It has a nice smell, too.  I like it better than coconut oil for a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product.  Just too expensive.  I bought this by accident as I thought I had purchased the 32 oz size which retails for about $10.  I prefer the raw, unfinished stuff.  This is smooth and for those who want that and are willing to pay for it, go for it.  I will return to my cheaper, bumpier product and use the difference to fund my IRA.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff. The other reviews are right about it being a little hard but once you dig some out and rub it rub it in your palms it is fine. There is no smell as far as I am concerned. I have used it as a pre conditioner on my hair and loved the way my hair was so shiny and silky after shampooing. I also use Argon oil as an after shower conditioner VERY  LITTLE, rub it into wet hair and towel dry and you will be amazed. You can also melt the butter by putting some in a container and micro waving for a few seconds. Then you can even add a scent. Oh, and it is a miracle moisturizer for winter dry skin. Applied right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is the best stuff for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect remedy for a harsh winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The natural scent is not bad - despite some reviews.</li>
            <li> This is good quality Shea Butter.  It goes on somewhat heavy but absorbs nicely into my skin after awhile.  I use it daily, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have acne so use Retin-A &amp; BHA regularly. I need something that keeps my skin from peeling, and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that does the trick. I have had no problems with it causing breakouts, and when I need an extra boost, I will use a few drops of jojoba oil before applying this. I let a little bit melt in my palm first, and it smooths on no problem. I keep a little tin for travel as well. I also use on hands and as a cuticle cream (usually as a reinforcement after traditional cuticle oil). It smells pretty weird and not exactly pleasant when first applied, but it fades away, and I&#x27;m happy enough with the results that I don&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;ve been using for years &amp; highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Obtained for very dry skin due to DM and poor circulatory problems. Seems to work somewhat but I developed a rash so quit using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter because of it&#x27;s high quality and also because my lotion bar recipe call for exactly 4 oz. of shea butter.  It melts perfectly and combines with the other ingredients very well.  I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
            <li> Received it and loved it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try making my own body butter,  I did a little research and found that shea butter is a really great thing and an excellent base for this project.  I now use it from face to foot instead of all the seperate moisturizers, lotions oils, and butters.  With that in mind this 4 oz tub has lasted over a month.  I also gave a little to my husband.  He suffers from sever patches of dry skin on his legs in the winter that itch so badly he scratches til they bleed.  He uses this every time it starts to itch and that is the end of that.</li>
            <li> Shea butter lives up to its hype. I have been using on surgical scarring and my doctor is AMAZED at how good the incision scar looks. I mixed mine with coconut oil. Great stuff. Forget your designer lotions and moisturizers filled with dozens of chemicals . This stuff beats them all.</li>
            <li> Looking for a solution to combat winter skin I first tried L&#x27;Occitane pure shea butter, while I loved it, I wanted to look for something else that might be less refined or closer to the source. Trying out this one at a 1/4 of the price I thought I hit the jackpot. Main differences are that this one has grittier texture, doesn&#x27;t melt as easily, is yellow as opposed to white and has a very strong musky smell. I couldn&#x27;t bear the smell and although it pains me to waste anything, I had to throw it out. I later discovered Now Foods has a pure shea butter without no smell and smooth texture which I still use regularly.</li>
            <li> great quality, not at all like the beauty store brands.</li>
            <li> It is accepted by the ASBI and has the symbol right on the jar.  I do mix a little liquid coconut oil in to make it even softer and easier to apply.  I just put  what I have mixed in another container and mix more in as needed.&lt;br /&gt;This Shea Butter is not real hard like another brand I have purchased and it is not grainy like the other one I purchased.  Makes my skin feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> Nice Shea butter,I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shea butter, smells earthy to me.  I use it as a moisturizer on my face at bedtime - and for daytime I have a separate glass jar in which I&#x27;ve mixed a little foundation that was too dark for me into some of this shea butter.  It feels like you&#x27;re putting clay on your face, but the heat of your skin softens it up and it melts right in.  I love that I&#x27;m not putting a bunch of weird chemicals on my face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter because it was certified.  I am glad I went with this brand and product.  Works great and lasted a while!</li>
            <li> Met my expectations, the only down side to this was the price. It was pricey given the size of the container.</li>
            <li> I thought it would come in a jar, but didn&#x27;t mind when it came in a sealed plastic pouch. What I could&#x27;t get over was the smell. It was too bad I had to throw it away.</li>
