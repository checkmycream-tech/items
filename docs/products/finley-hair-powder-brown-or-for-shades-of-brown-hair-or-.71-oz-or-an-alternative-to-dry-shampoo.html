    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The powder is invisible in my med-dark brown hair and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>This product is the best hair powder that you can get!</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage and staying power.</li>
            <li>I started using this product when I was blond &amp; loved it!</li>
            <li>This was a great product.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Baby powder works fairly well</li>
            <li>It smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job of absorbing oil when you haven&#x27;t washed your hair.</li>
            <li>I have found a product I like better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better for oily hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily hair and haven&#x27;t had good luck with the aerosolized products, they just seem to make my hair more oily (and I have tried plenty).</li>
            <li>The BB product is a spray like hairspray so it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It does color your fingers if you have the darker colors, but it comes off easy with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>I used a make-up brush to try to smooth it out</li>
            <li>It smells nice and completely disappears.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend for daily use but its good in a pinch or 1,2 a week.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use gloves and just muss my hair until all the oil is absorbed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised this product isn&#x27;t reviewed more positively!</li>
            <li>It gives great scalp coverage for thin hair, doesn&#x27;t rub off easy.</li>
            <li>I think regular baby powder is more effective but then of course you have to deal with the white factor.</li>
            <li>quick, easy to use once you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;- best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found for thin, oily hair</li>
            <li>I made this mistake the first time I used this powder</li>
            <li>First of all, this arrived and</li>
            <li>so it might not be great for thick hair, but I can&#x27;t recommend it enough for thin hair, its great!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The size was accurately stated, so I should have known, but the picture makes it look much bigger.</li>
            <li>This product does add some grit / thickness to your hair (even when using very sparingly like you should)</li>
            <li>and then I moved up to a $15 Sephora brand that worked really well,</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>so I just sprinkle it on and use the hairbrush, rubbing it back and forth until the hair is the right consistency and all the oil disappears.</li>
            <li>if a little too much comes out, I have to spot clean my scalp (and believe me, I use it sparingly).</li>
            <li>I have never been able to go without washing my hair daily unless I just put up with a greasy look, now I can actually go 3 days and my hair actually looks like I just washed it!</li>
            <li>Also if your hair is dark brown you may find the brown is too light.  </li>
            <li>slight clean scent&lt;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, especially for women/men with oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve written a review for this before, but I just have to say that this stuff works much better than any dry shampoo or other hair powder that I have tried, and I have tried about 8 different products.</li>
            <li>It is a dry shampoo and comes in spray form, much like hair spray.  </li>
            <li>but it never quite looks as clean and since I have dark brown hair it makes me look grey.</li>
            <li>So, I have to be careful not to touch my hair too much.  </li>
            <li>I went from natural blonde, to dark/ reddish brown, so I got the &#x27;brown hair&#x27; color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>careful with application though, as it can get REALLY</li>
            <li>easy to control where it goes, so it works well for what I use it for, I have thinning hair and it helps conceal that, but it is dull and seems to pull moisture out of my hair, so I do not use it daily.</li>
            <li>It leaves too much residue in the hair you need to get out some other way.  </li>
            <li>this by far makes your hair have extra volume and gives it a boost on the second day.</li>
            <li>But the brown powder, while it works just as well, is pretty messy &amp;</li>
            <li>The trick is to use the bottle tilted half way and tap to get a little bit to come out on the roots (not the scalp/part), then use a fine comb to distribute it.  </li>
            <li>The previous reviewer is correct:  don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>This time around the &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; was very medium brown, last time was dark brown --</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very dark, and it really sticks to your skin and fingers.</li>

            <li> Be careful not to use too much - just a sprinkle or 2 on your part - or hair will feel dry and look dull.</li>
            <li> Search \\&quot; Batiste Dry Shampoo.\\</li>
            <li> Also works as a dry shampoo..</li>
            <li> but it just made a bigger mess.</li>
            <li> but you only need a little.  </li>
            <li> I would  recommend using gloves and carefully sprinkle on</li>
            <li> Used it the other day and by the end of the day</li>
            <li> I am only 2/3 of the way through the bottle over 6 months after buying, and I use it at least 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t want to touch your hair, and if you do your fingers will be dark brown (in my case).  </li>
            <li> Stays put and doesn&#x27;t flake down on clothes, forehead, etc.</li>
            <li> so I had to buy black instead.</li>
            <li> I may get the black and try that.</li>
            <li> The brown color is very dark, way too dark for my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> While this hair powder does camouflage a little greying at the roots and helps fluff hair up a bit between shampoos, it is very messy.  </li>
            <li> If you touch your head, yes you will get the colored powder on your hands a little bit</li>
            <li> I just received this a few weeks ago and have tried it a few times.  </li>
            <li> it everyday</li>
            <li> /&gt;- if you get it on your scalp its a little hard to run off&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes hair look a little dull but bearable.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy Bumble Bumble spray to cover my grays.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how small the bottle was.</li>
            <li> Now that I know the bottle is so small</li>
            <li> It is also hard to apply, you need a small stiff brush to get it distributed by the roots.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained that the bottle is small, and it is</li>
            <li> Kinda feels icky once it&#x27;s on the hair, but if you&#x27;re trying to grow your hair out and not heat style</li>
            <li> color blends in well (at least for brown hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thickens your roots so probably not great for thick hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really not a great deal</li>
            <li> Its a miracle worker for thin hair that gets greasy</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does a great job of absorbing oil when you haven&#x27;t washed your hair. The powder is invisible in my med-dark brown hair and it smells wonderful. Be careful not to use too much - just a sprinkle or 2 on your part - or hair will feel dry and look dull.</li>
            <li> I just received this a few weeks ago and have tried it a few times.  It works well when your hair is oily!  I normally have to wash my hair every day because it gets oily half way through day 2.  But  now, I can sprinkle a bit of this powder on and I can go 2 days without washing!  It blends well with my medium-brown hair.  It smells nice.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is that if I run my fingers through my hair or scratch my scalp, I get brown powder under my fingernails.  So, I have to be careful not to touch my hair too much.  The previous reviewer is correct:  don&#x27;t use too much.  I made this mistake the first time I used this powder and it was \\&quot;everywhere!\\&quot;  I highly recommend this, especially for women/men with oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have found a product I like better. It is a dry shampoo and comes in spray form, much like hair spray.  I LOVE this dry shampoo.  Amazon sells it.  Search \\&quot; Batiste Dry Shampoo.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s even better for oily hair.  It lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t rub off or get under my nails.  see, for example, [...]</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve written a review for this before, but I just have to say that this stuff works much better than any dry shampoo or other hair powder that I have tried, and I have tried about 8 different products. One bottle lasted a year or longer. It smells nice and completely disappears. The only thing is that it will get under your fingernails and on your hands so I just sprinkle it on and use the hairbrush, rubbing it back and forth until the hair is the right consistency and all the oil disappears. Sometimes I use gloves and just muss my hair until all the oil is absorbed. I have auburn colored hair and the brown just disappears. You can&#x27;t see it. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I usually buy Bumble Bumble spray to cover my grays. I couldn&#x27;t get it in a short period so I decided to try this brand. It is cheaper and works the same way but I will never get it again. It goes on like a salt shaker. Which was a disaster. It came out in one big clump. I used a make-up brush to try to smooth it out but it just made a bigger mess. The BB product is a spray like hairspray so it is easy to apply. I will pay extra and get it.</li>
            <li> First of all, this arrived and I couldn&#x27;t believe how small the bottle was. The size was accurately stated, so I should have known, but the picture makes it look much bigger. Second, the product is just alright. I think regular baby powder is more effective but then of course you have to deal with the white factor. Now that I know the bottle is so small and it&#x27;s really not a great deal, I&#x27;ll try another brand next time.</li>
            <li> Works well. Kinda feels icky once it&#x27;s on the hair, but if you&#x27;re trying to grow your hair out and not heat style it everyday this stuff is mandatory.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised this product isn&#x27;t reviewed more positively! I have very oily hair and haven&#x27;t had good luck with the aerosolized products, they just seem to make my hair more oily (and I have tried plenty). Baby powder works fairly well but it never quite looks as clean and since I have dark brown hair it makes me look grey. This product does add some grit / thickness to your hair (even when using very sparingly like you should) so it might not be great for thick hair, but I can&#x27;t recommend it enough for thin hair, its great! I have never been able to go without washing my hair daily unless I just put up with a greasy look, now I can actually go 3 days and my hair actually looks like I just washed it! The trick is to use the bottle tilted half way and tap to get a little bit to come out on the roots (not the scalp/part), then use a fine comb to distribute it.  If you touch your head, yes you will get the colored powder on your hands a little bit but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it coming off on shirts or anything. Some people have complained that the bottle is small, and it is but you only need a little.  I am only 2/3 of the way through the bottle over 6 months after buying, and I use it at least 3-4 times a week. Its a miracle worker for thin hair that gets greasy easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- quick, easy to use once you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;- best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found for thin, oily hair&lt;br /&gt;- slight clean scent&lt;br /&gt;- hair looks like it was just washed!&lt;br /&gt;- color blends in well (at least for brown hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- if you get it on your scalp its a little hard to run off&lt;br /&gt;- can&#x27;t run fingers through your hair without getting brown stuff under your nails&lt;br /&gt;- thickens your roots so probably not great for thick hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend and I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> This time around the &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; was very medium brown, last time was dark brown -- so I had to buy black instead.</li>
            <li> easy to control where it goes, so it works well for what I use it for, I have thinning hair and it helps conceal that, but it is dull and seems to pull moisture out of my hair, so I do not use it daily.</li>
            <li> I went from natural blonde, to dark/ reddish brown, so I got the &#x27;brown hair&#x27; color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with baby powder (in the gym locker room for days that I don&#x27;t wash my hair since it&#x27;s really long) and then I moved up to a $15 Sephora brand that worked really well, but those are all white powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to save money and match my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with application though, as it can get REALLY messy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels a lot dirtier AFTER application, so I would call this \\&quot;Hair Texturizing Powder\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> While this hair powder does camouflage a little greying at the roots and helps fluff hair up a bit between shampoos, it is very messy.  It does smell nice, but it makes hair feel really dirty. You won&#x27;t want to touch your hair, and if you do your fingers will be dark brown (in my case).  Used it the other day and by the end of the day it was all over my forehead.  Thankfully I have bangs so it was not noticeable.  It is also hard to apply, you need a small stiff brush to get it distributed by the roots.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very dark, and it really sticks to your skin and fingers. I would  recommend using gloves and carefully sprinkle on hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to find something easier</li>
            <li> It gives great scalp coverage for thin hair, doesn&#x27;t rub off easy. Makes hair look a little dull but bearable.  Also works as a dry shampoo..</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I was blond &amp; loved it! But the brown powder, while it works just as well, is pretty messy &amp; if a little too much comes out, I have to spot clean my scalp (and believe me, I use it sparingly). I would opt for the blond version, even if you are a brunette--I finished my blond bottle on my brown hair &amp; had no problems w/ the color showing.</li>
            <li> This was a great product. The only issue I had with it was that you must put it on your fingers- than your hair, if you just shake it on your hair your scalp will turn the color of the power (in my case, it was brown). The bottle also lasts forever!</li>
            <li> This product is the best hair powder that you can get! I have tried multiple brands and this by far makes your hair have extra volume and gives it a boost on the second day. It does color your fingers if you have the darker colors, but it comes off easy with soap and water.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend for daily use but its good in a pinch or 1,2 a week.  It leaves too much residue in the hair you need to get out some other way.  Also if your hair is dark brown you may find the brown is too light.  I may get the black and try that.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage and staying power. Stays put and doesn&#x27;t flake down on clothes, forehead, etc.</li>
            <li> This covered up some gray roots, not all. The brown color is very dark, way too dark for my medium brown hair. I could never get it fully rubbed into my hair. For the entire day I had obvious black powder visible along the part of my hair and hairline. It just kept flaking off.</li>
            <li> Works great. A little messy to apply at first but stay for a long time until you wash your hair.</li>
