            <li>HAD HOPED BY THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT THAT \\&quot;60X\\&quot; WOULD GIVE A GREAT TAN...  </li>
            <li>I use this product about once a week and it works great.</li>
            <li>The seller is great, my product shipped when they said they would.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion to use.</li>
            <li>I work at a tanning salon, we carry the millennium lotions and they are a great product.</li>
            <li>Great price.  </li>
            <li>Great tanning lotion</li>
            <li>Gives your skin a great bronze color along with enhancing your tanning visit.  </li>
            <li>Smells great too.</li>
            <li>Smells great, works well.</li>
            <li>Works great, no orange color.  </li>
            <li>It works great in the sun or in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>make sure you wash your hands after you use this stuff!!</li>
            <li>, the smell is very nice though, and it does go on nicley.</li>
            <li>My color comes out amazing!</li>
            <li>It smells good going on, but doesn&#x27;t smell that great after you tan.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice lotion!</li>
            <li>I am very fair complected and now have a great tan (worked well even the very first time)!!  </li>
            <li>strong bronzers, but all in all a great buy!</li>
            <li>Also it smells good and doesnt smell after you tan either.</li>
            <li>Glides on ,&amp; has good scent, not fruity or coco-nutty.</li>
            <li>Good price, but</li>
            <li>it smelled so good, and when I told her it was tan lotion, and I had just tanned</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, glides on smooth not sticky or tacky and seems to work wonders too.</li>
            <li>I tan before work and Like something that smells good after I Tan</li>
            <li>and it works good if you use a good amount of lotion.</li>
            <li>So while the product is good, I am still on the search for my miracle tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I feels good and smells good too.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a good tanning product.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but does not do a good job bronzing.</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a cheap lotion that is, in my opinion, one of the best ones...</li>
            <li>It also smells good.</li>
            <li>but I also don&#x27;t have anything good to say about it.</li>
            <li>good lotion, and good price</li>
            <li>Smells good though.</li>
            <li>and I told them to recommend this tanning lotion to people who need a good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Im fair skinned</li>
            <li>I got a good deal on it, however.</li>
            <li>This lotion is a great quality lotion and leaves your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice use of bronzers helps you to get a good tan</li>
            <li>Excellent lotion, you can see results right away.</li>
            <li>This is some CHEAP tanning lotion!!  </li>
            <li>The color is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is AMAZING for the price.  </li>
            <li>a nice bronze look not orange at all.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x60;t leave you greasy &amp; you get nice color.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and doesn&#x27;t discolor at all with the bronzers.</li>
            <li>I have troubles with turning orange after using a tanning lotion with bronzer, but this one is a nice brown glow.</li>
            <li>With so many products out there you never know what&#x27;s a good one for you until you try.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not over powering.</li>
            <li>just make sure u apply a good amount and get it on even.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion goes on the skin nicely - easy to rub in - smells good -</li>
            <li>This is the best tanning lotion that I have used so far!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this lotion after reading good things about it.  </li>

            <li>I get the most compliments after leaving the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m glad i did</li>
            <li>i love this lotion it gives you</li>
            <li>Hope this helps ! :)</li>
            <li>I love the built-in bronzers and I saw IMMEDIATE results.</li>

            <li>you have that &#x27;burnt&#x27; smell but this lotion is so great, it really doesnt matter.</li>
            <li>At this point I would not purchase again - rather try another product that might work better.</li>
            <li>Goes on silky smooth!</li>
            <li>I just love this lotion   </li>
            <li>The smell is ok...</li>
            <li>When you go tanning you will get a deeper more bronze tan with this product.</li>
            <li>smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Millennium Tanning lotions are my favorite</li>
            <li>I love it because I would tan</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to buy this every time because I love it</li>
            <li>Spend more and get more out of your tan.  </li>
            <li>This is just okay.</li>
            <li>I really love this lotion I&#x27;ve used a lot of diffrent lotion that have givein me some color but not a lot when I came across this product</li>
            <li>This is more of a bronzer, and i think it would work better if you were tanning in the sun.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it. :)</li>
            <li>The lotion smells pretty good too..</li>
            <li>So as long as you get it on perfectly evenly you&#x27;re set.</li>
            <li>my skin hasnt seen sun in months, and im am pretty fair skinned.</li>
            <li>This is my 4th buy of Black Night and the lotion produces a beautiful tan; nice warm brown glow without an orange appearance.  </li>
            <li>Definately worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I ordered the product on amazon for an amazing price and it gave me the same great results as the sample packs; I purchased at the salon.</li>
            <li>Black night has a very good smell, goes on nice and smooth, but in my personal opnion it isnt the greatest lotion to get you darker.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my skin feels and how the lotion absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think this product is as good as it is built up to be.</li>
            <li>It does go on very silky and that I loved.</li>
            <li>Get this, I got a couple right away!!</li>
            <li>I bough this tanning lotion from Amazon and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and this lotion helps me achieve a healthy natural looking glow.</li>
            <li>I definitely have tried way better lotions and you can get them for a great price online.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, this is hands down best tanning lotion I have used.</li>
            <li>I was using Worship by Designer Skin and quickly fell out of love with that lotion</li>
            <li>The smell is not overwhellming and i have never got tan so quick!</li>
            <li>I am not seeing a huge difference by using this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Also not to mention, I purchased this on sale w/ free shipping</li>
            <li>This lotion truelly gives a great dark color and smells pretty good, except afterwards</li>
            <li>This lotion has really given me a nice color.  </li>
            <li>feels great, and I got darker after only 1 visit!!!</li>
            <li>It will also stain your clothes if you&#x27;re wearing anything that&#x27;s light in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin silky smooth, smells</li>
            <li>gotten a lot of comments from my local tanning salon on the smell and how great it tans.</li>
            <li>its smooth going on and you dont feel like you have a layer of nastiness on you after youre done tanning.</li>
            <li>i recommend, works great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It has a lite tropical smell and a light application.</li>
            <li>This product is cheap but gives you an orange tint.</li>
            <li>Okay before I say anything further I want to say that some people have good experiences with this lotion.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice, smells clean, leaves your skin silky soft and doesn&#x27;t give you that feared carrot orange glow :)  </li>
            <li>It is very GOOOD Lotion!!!</li>
            <li>and I was excited when I got this one because of all of the fantastic reviews.</li>
            <li>I originally tried this product at Boca Tanning(sample packs)</li>
            <li>I was super excited about getting this stuff, because of the price.</li>
            <li>Prevents me from using too much--it is such a good lotion you don&#x27;t need to slather it on.  </li>
            <li>but i think everbody has a different sense of what smells good.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion, even the owner of the Tanning Salon that I tan at asked me about it</li>
            <li>It leave your skin silky smooth, smells great and produces a super dark tan.  </li>
            <li>The lotion was delivered very quickly and is very affordable (spending 50 bucks on lotion is just not plausable for me!).  </li>
            <li>Also the 50x which is super cheap right now.</li>
            <li>lol oh, and be careful!</li>
            <li>the only problem that i have with this lotion is that if you don&#x27;t make sure that you thoroughly rub it in and make sure that it is even, you will get the orange streaks...</li>
            <li>an older brand that I know more about and therefore can trust.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who needs a quick tan (for an event or something).</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t getting adequate color.</li>
            <li>This one does a super job of moisturizing my skin as well.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.....</li>
            <li>In LOVE so far, can&#x27;t wait to use it again!!</li>
            <li>I moisterize first with a cheap lotion i don&#x27;t like any more_*(I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>great n&#x27; gets me dark.  </li>
            <li>Black night 60x is great product.  </li>
            <li>Millenium tanning Black Night was a great choice.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and my skin tends to get dry and it hasn&#x27;t with this lotion.</li>
            <li>and i am very noticeably darker!!</li>
            <li>This product is well worth getting.</li>
            <li>, I only bought this to have a nice tan for Hawaii.(though</li>
            <li>It is fantastic you don&#x27;t have to use that much as it just glides on your body like silk, and it really smells nice, leaves your skin feeling so soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll just glide on and you&#x27;ll look super tan first time using.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>The product will lose its effectiveness after a few months so its best to use it quickly instead of making it go further like I try to do.</li>
            <li>If you tan fairly easily this may work fine for you, I on the other hand and pretty light skinned and need some help.</li>
            <li>the smell is kind of strange</li>
            <li>And seems to help achieve a nice kinda dark tan rather quickly.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s had the same problem and that it seemed the lotion had very cheap bronzers.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m a little fair skinned</li>
            <li>From the first time I put it on...</li>
            <li>First off I do not tan</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived!  </li>
            <li>It works really well!  </li>
            <li>I also have gotten better color from lotions that are around the same price.</li>
            <li>It is way better then the last bronzer I had.  </li>
            <li>After my first tanning session I was seeing a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I think that is outstanding when I only tan for 12 min.  </li>
            <li>this works pretty well</li>
            <li>This  is not a product that I would be willing to purchase again.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t like it, its more of a self tanner.</li>
            <li>ive been using it for a couple of weeks now and it works a lot better than my last lotion.</li>
            <li>When I began to switch up my routine and alternate this with another one I got a better tan.</li>
            <li>It does contain some either heavy duty bronzers or self tanner in it because after I tanned that evening I just looked really good and brown.</li>
            <li>At the salons you can pay 100 dollars or more for lotions that work the same if not worse.</li>
            <li>im shorter on money these days and decided to do some research on some cheaper lotions, and when i came across this lotion and seen a lot of the positive reviews, i figured why not?</li>
            <li>I definitely felt more heat in my skin just like when using Black Storm, so I know its doing its job getting me darker, but honestly at this point I can&#x27;t tell much difference.  </li>
            <li>I tried a few different ones at the salon, but by far this product gave me the best results.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion does what it says it giving you a nice bronze dark tan.</li>
            <li>I got the lotion VERY quickly using standard shipping...</li>
            <li>The product was in good condition, however, this is not a very good product.</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t seem to keep going after a certain point</li>
            <li>I have just started tanning, and after the third time i notest orange in between my fingers and a huge orange streak on my arm.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery....</li>
            <li>it seems to moisturize really well though</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t feel like it really made THAT much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I want to have a real tan that will stay, and with this stuff, it didn&#x27;t do that for me.</li>
            <li>I started noticing that my coloring was very orange and after a couple weeks use It started rubbing off in places.</li>
            <li>Like it was shielding me from real color?</li>
            <li>This method prevents me from unnessarily using too much.</li>
            <li>and works really well.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really boost anything.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>this lotion really works..</li>
            <li>and I have a whole lot of Belgian in me.</li>
            <li>It may be a whole lot of bronzer layered on</li>
            <li>my tanning salons mark up lotions so much.</li>
            <li>The scent of the lotion is subtle and pleasant to smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as soft as my last lotion, but it sure gets me darker faster.  </li>
            <li>it does not really irrate my skin, makes it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and wow they were right.  </li>
            <li>The first few times I used it I felt as if I had gotten darker, but now it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much more then mosturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion is hands down my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>I got this for 12$ when it was on sale and since this is a high end lotion it doesnt stain your skin as much so</li>
            <li>The spray tan is supposed to even out and blend imperfections such as light areas, and tanning prior to the spray (without using an enhancing lotion,) is supposed to open up your pores and let it do it a better job.  </li>
            <li>so it takes a while to get me tan , but within the first two visits i already saw a major difference !!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned person, and usually, it takes me a couple of weeks of tanning 4 days a wk (or more) to get a good base tan.  </li>
            <li>It got me so dark on the first time I used it I will get this again !!!</li>
            <li>Black alot better,</li>
            <li>(I still feel like I need a shower after I tan, but I&#x27;ve experienced worse smelling lotions by far)</li>
            <li>if your looking for a quick acting bronzer this one is not for you...  </li>
            <li>When I did I was pretty white under it all, even after a month of consistent tanning.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t particularly like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this tanning product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying Black Storm next, in hopes it will smell better!</li>
            <li>My legs don&#x27;t tan very well and this fixed that as well.</li>
            <li>it doesnt smell that good in the bottle, and it smells even worse after you&#x27;ve tanned with it.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t alternate it with other lotions it will gradually turn you orange instead of giving you a nice brown natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Everyone notes how easily you get dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, so I&#x27;m not going to jump the gun and give it a five,yet, but it really helped my tan!!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but a more tropical scent would be nice.</li>
            <li>So first off, it&#x27;s white</li>
            <li>Same great product, only I thought the shipping was a bit slow (a week).</li>
            <li>You can see a big difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>get Australian Golds First Blush.</li>
            <li>I like it &amp; it makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>This is for someone who wants more of a subtle color.</li>
            <li>typical bronzer lightly enhances your tan; it doesn&#x27;t actually turn your skin a tan color after the first use.</li>
            <li>The smell was nothing special, as I said not bad but not good..</li>
            <li>the smell is nice and not overwhelming, so i can go on my lunchbreaks at work and not come back smelling like burnt skin.</li>
            <li>I have used so many different brands and NOTHING compares to Black Night.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this solar addict lotion by Australian Gold after the fourth time i used the Black Night lotion, and after two uses i had amazing results.</li>
            <li>It does a ok job on tanning; however, it will turn your hands orange no matter how hard you try to wipe it off when you are done applying it onto your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly the bronzer in this lotion</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have what would be classified as sensitive skin</li>
            <li>fast shipping totally recommended.</li>
            <li>I can only darken my skin so much</li>
            <li>but it looks natural.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll be completely evened out after that.</li>
            <li>Ok, so it works, I was really dark after the first few times I tried it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think they were working as expected and felt kind of pale</li>
            <li>Low price, decent tan.  </li>
            <li>Moved up to a high pressure bed and used this lotion at the same visit.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I noticed people either love or hate this lotion.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical ordering this, as I&#x27;ve always used Australian Gold products, but had read good reviews on this site about it.  </li>
            <li>As other reviews mentioned the smell is also very yummy!</li>
            <li>its not a very dark bronzer which alot of people look for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already pretty dark, but for the price I&#x27;d say you can&#x27;t beat something like this.  </li>
            <li>Just because they are cheaper than Designer Skin products doesn&#x27;t mean they are any less effective.  </li>
            <li>I have been so much darker before with other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of this, I highly recommend careful application.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used many other tanning products so its hard for me to compare this one, but it seems to work</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews before purchasing, I was really thinking that this lotion was going to get me extremely dark.</li>
            <li>Much like other self-tanners, this stuff will make your skin blotchy and orange if you do not apply it (and let it dry)</li>
            <li>While the lotion is good, mosturizes well, and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad</li>
            <li>neither bad or good.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a great lotion to use.</li>

            <li> Works great, no orange color.  </li>
            <li> It works great in the sun or in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> make sure you wash your hands after you use this stuff!!</li>
            <li> , the smell is very nice though, and it does go on nicley.</li>
            <li> My color comes out amazing!</li>
            <li> It smells good going on, but doesn&#x27;t smell that great after you tan.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice lotion!</li>
            <li> I am very fair complected and now have a great tan (worked well even the very first time)!!  </li>
            <li> strong bronzers, but all in all a great buy!</li>
            <li> Also it smells good and doesnt smell after you tan either.</li>
            <li> Glides on ,&amp; has good scent, not fruity or coco-nutty.</li>
            <li> Good price, but</li>
            <li> it smelled so good, and when I told her it was tan lotion, and I had just tanned</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, glides on smooth not sticky or tacky and seems to work wonders too.</li>
            <li> I tan before work and Like something that smells good after I Tan</li>
            <li> and it works good if you use a good amount of lotion.</li>
            <li> So while the product is good, I am still on the search for my miracle tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I feels good and smells good too.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a good tanning product.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but does not do a good job bronzing.</li>
            <li> good stuff.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a cheap lotion that is, in my opinion, one of the best ones...</li>
            <li> It also smells good.</li>
            <li> but I also don&#x27;t have anything good to say about it.</li>
            <li> good lotion, and good price</li>
            <li> Smells good though.</li>
            <li> and I told them to recommend this tanning lotion to people who need a good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Im fair skinned</li>
            <li> I got a good deal on it, however.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a great quality lotion and leaves your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice use of bronzers helps you to get a good tan</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion, you can see results right away.</li>
            <li> This is some CHEAP tanning lotion!!  </li>
            <li> The color is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING for the price.  </li>
            <li> a nice bronze look not orange at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x60;t leave you greasy &amp; you get nice color.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and doesn&#x27;t discolor at all with the bronzers.</li>
            <li> I have troubles with turning orange after using a tanning lotion with bronzer, but this one is a nice brown glow.</li>
            <li> With so many products out there you never know what&#x27;s a good one for you until you try.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice and not over powering.</li>
            <li> just make sure u apply a good amount and get it on even.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion goes on the skin nicely - easy to rub in - smells good -</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion that I have used so far!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this lotion after reading good things about it.  </li>
            <li> super!!</li>

            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I get the most compliments after leaving the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m glad i did</li>
            <li> i love this lotion it gives you</li>
            <li> Hope this helps ! :)</li>
            <li> I love the built-in bronzers and I saw IMMEDIATE results.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a self tanner, this product is ok.  </li>
            <li> love to use this product.</li>
            <li> Snap it up, you will love it.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Thats when I fell in love with this one.</li>
            <li> you have that &#x27;burnt&#x27; smell but this lotion is so great, it really doesnt matter.</li>
            <li> At this point I would not purchase again - rather try another product that might work better.</li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I just love this lotion   </li>
            <li> The smell is ok...</li>
            <li> When you go tanning you will get a deeper more bronze tan with this product.</li>
            <li> smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Millennium Tanning lotions are my favorite</li>
            <li> I love it because I would tan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to buy this every time because I love it</li>
            <li> Spend more and get more out of your tan.  </li>
            <li> This is just okay.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion I&#x27;ve used a lot of diffrent lotion that have givein me some color but not a lot when I came across this product</li>
            <li> This is more of a bronzer, and i think it would work better if you were tanning in the sun.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it. :)</li>
            <li> The lotion smells pretty good too..</li>
            <li> So as long as you get it on perfectly evenly you&#x27;re set.</li>
            <li> my skin hasnt seen sun in months, and im am pretty fair skinned.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th buy of Black Night and the lotion produces a beautiful tan; nice warm brown glow without an orange appearance.  </li>
            <li> Definately worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the product on amazon for an amazing price and it gave me the same great results as the sample packs; I purchased at the salon.</li>
            <li> Black night has a very good smell, goes on nice and smooth, but in my personal opnion it isnt the greatest lotion to get you darker.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my skin feels and how the lotion absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think this product is as good as it is built up to be.</li>
            <li> It does go on very silky and that I loved.</li>
            <li> Get this, I got a couple right away!!</li>
            <li> I bough this tanning lotion from Amazon and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and this lotion helps me achieve a healthy natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> I definitely have tried way better lotions and you can get them for a great price online.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, this is hands down best tanning lotion I have used.</li>
            <li> I was using Worship by Designer Skin and quickly fell out of love with that lotion</li>
            <li> The smell is not overwhellming and i have never got tan so quick!</li>
            <li> I am not seeing a huge difference by using this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Also not to mention, I purchased this on sale w/ free shipping</li>
            <li> This lotion truelly gives a great dark color and smells pretty good, except afterwards</li>
            <li> This lotion has really given me a nice color.  </li>
            <li> feels great, and I got darker after only 1 visit!!!</li>
            <li> It will also stain your clothes if you&#x27;re wearing anything that&#x27;s light in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin silky smooth, smells</li>
            <li> gotten a lot of comments from my local tanning salon on the smell and how great it tans.</li>
            <li> its smooth going on and you dont feel like you have a layer of nastiness on you after youre done tanning.</li>
            <li> i recommend, works great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It has a lite tropical smell and a light application.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap but gives you an orange tint.</li>
            <li> Okay before I say anything further I want to say that some people have good experiences with this lotion.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice, smells clean, leaves your skin silky soft and doesn&#x27;t give you that feared carrot orange glow :)  </li>
            <li> It is very GOOOD Lotion!!!</li>
            <li> and I was excited when I got this one because of all of the fantastic reviews.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product at Boca Tanning(sample packs)</li>
            <li> I was super excited about getting this stuff, because of the price.</li>
            <li> Prevents me from using too much--it is such a good lotion you don&#x27;t need to slather it on.  </li>
            <li> but i think everbody has a different sense of what smells good.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion, even the owner of the Tanning Salon that I tan at asked me about it</li>
            <li> It leave your skin silky smooth, smells great and produces a super dark tan.  </li>
            <li> The lotion was delivered very quickly and is very affordable (spending 50 bucks on lotion is just not plausable for me!).  </li>
            <li> Also the 50x which is super cheap right now.</li>
            <li> lol oh, and be careful!</li>
            <li> the only problem that i have with this lotion is that if you don&#x27;t make sure that you thoroughly rub it in and make sure that it is even, you will get the orange streaks...</li>
            <li> an older brand that I know more about and therefore can trust.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who needs a quick tan (for an event or something).</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t getting adequate color.</li>
            <li> This one does a super job of moisturizing my skin as well.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.....</li>
            <li> In LOVE so far, can&#x27;t wait to use it again!!</li>
            <li> I moisterize first with a cheap lotion i don&#x27;t like any more_*(I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> great n&#x27; gets me dark.  </li>
            <li> Black night 60x is great product.  </li>
            <li> Millenium tanning Black Night was a great choice.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and my skin tends to get dry and it hasn&#x27;t with this lotion.</li>
            <li> and i am very noticeably darker!!</li>
            <li> This product is well worth getting.</li>
            <li> , I only bought this to have a nice tan for Hawaii.(though</li>
            <li> It is fantastic you don&#x27;t have to use that much as it just glides on your body like silk, and it really smells nice, leaves your skin feeling so soft and radiant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll just glide on and you&#x27;ll look super tan first time using.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> The product will lose its effectiveness after a few months so its best to use it quickly instead of making it go further like I try to do.</li>
            <li> If you tan fairly easily this may work fine for you, I on the other hand and pretty light skinned and need some help.</li>
            <li> the smell is kind of strange</li>
            <li> And seems to help achieve a nice kinda dark tan rather quickly.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s had the same problem and that it seemed the lotion had very cheap bronzers.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m a little fair skinned</li>
            <li> From the first time I put it on...</li>
            <li> First off I do not tan</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived!  </li>
            <li> It works really well!  </li>
            <li> I also have gotten better color from lotions that are around the same price.</li>
            <li> It is way better then the last bronzer I had.  </li>
            <li> After my first tanning session I was seeing a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I think that is outstanding when I only tan for 12 min.  </li>
            <li> this works pretty well</li>
            <li> This  is not a product that I would be willing to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like it, its more of a self tanner.</li>
            <li> ive been using it for a couple of weeks now and it works a lot better than my last lotion.</li>
            <li> When I began to switch up my routine and alternate this with another one I got a better tan.</li>
            <li> It does contain some either heavy duty bronzers or self tanner in it because after I tanned that evening I just looked really good and brown.</li>
            <li> At the salons you can pay 100 dollars or more for lotions that work the same if not worse.</li>
            <li> im shorter on money these days and decided to do some research on some cheaper lotions, and when i came across this lotion and seen a lot of the positive reviews, i figured why not?</li>
            <li> I definitely felt more heat in my skin just like when using Black Storm, so I know its doing its job getting me darker, but honestly at this point I can&#x27;t tell much difference.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few different ones at the salon, but by far this product gave me the best results.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion does what it says it giving you a nice bronze dark tan.</li>
            <li> I got the lotion VERY quickly using standard shipping...</li>
            <li> The product was in good condition, however, this is not a very good product.</li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t seem to keep going after a certain point</li>
            <li> I have just started tanning, and after the third time i notest orange in between my fingers and a huge orange streak on my arm.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery....</li>
            <li> it seems to moisturize really well though</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t feel like it really made THAT much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I want to have a real tan that will stay, and with this stuff, it didn&#x27;t do that for me.</li>
            <li> I started noticing that my coloring was very orange and after a couple weeks use It started rubbing off in places.</li>
            <li> Like it was shielding me from real color?</li>
            <li> This method prevents me from unnessarily using too much.</li>
            <li> and works really well.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really boost anything.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> this lotion really works..</li>
            <li> and I have a whole lot of Belgian in me.</li>
            <li> It may be a whole lot of bronzer layered on</li>
            <li> my tanning salons mark up lotions so much.</li>
            <li> The scent of the lotion is subtle and pleasant to smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as soft as my last lotion, but it sure gets me darker faster.  </li>
            <li> it does not really irrate my skin, makes it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and wow they were right.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I used it I felt as if I had gotten darker, but now it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much more then mosturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is hands down my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> I got this for 12$ when it was on sale and since this is a high end lotion it doesnt stain your skin as much so</li>
            <li> The spray tan is supposed to even out and blend imperfections such as light areas, and tanning prior to the spray (without using an enhancing lotion,) is supposed to open up your pores and let it do it a better job.  </li>
            <li> so it takes a while to get me tan , but within the first two visits i already saw a major difference !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned person, and usually, it takes me a couple of weeks of tanning 4 days a wk (or more) to get a good base tan.  </li>
            <li> It got me so dark on the first time I used it I will get this again !!!</li>
            <li> Black alot better,</li>
            <li> (I still feel like I need a shower after I tan, but I&#x27;ve experienced worse smelling lotions by far)</li>
            <li> if your looking for a quick acting bronzer this one is not for you...  </li>
            <li> When I did I was pretty white under it all, even after a month of consistent tanning.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t particularly like this lotion.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this tanning product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying Black Storm next, in hopes it will smell better!</li>
            <li> My legs don&#x27;t tan very well and this fixed that as well.</li>
            <li> it doesnt smell that good in the bottle, and it smells even worse after you&#x27;ve tanned with it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t alternate it with other lotions it will gradually turn you orange instead of giving you a nice brown natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Everyone notes how easily you get dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, so I&#x27;m not going to jump the gun and give it a five,yet, but it really helped my tan!!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but a more tropical scent would be nice.</li>
            <li> So first off, it&#x27;s white</li>
            <li> Same great product, only I thought the shipping was a bit slow (a week).</li>
            <li> You can see a big difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> get Australian Golds First Blush.</li>
            <li> I like it &amp; it makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> This is for someone who wants more of a subtle color.</li>
            <li> typical bronzer lightly enhances your tan; it doesn&#x27;t actually turn your skin a tan color after the first use.</li>
            <li> The smell was nothing special, as I said not bad but not good..</li>
            <li> the smell is nice and not overwhelming, so i can go on my lunchbreaks at work and not come back smelling like burnt skin.</li>
            <li> I have used so many different brands and NOTHING compares to Black Night.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this solar addict lotion by Australian Gold after the fourth time i used the Black Night lotion, and after two uses i had amazing results.</li>
            <li> It does a ok job on tanning; however, it will turn your hands orange no matter how hard you try to wipe it off when you are done applying it onto your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly the bronzer in this lotion</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have what would be classified as sensitive skin</li>
            <li> fast shipping totally recommended.</li>
            <li> I can only darken my skin so much</li>
            <li> but it looks natural.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll be completely evened out after that.</li>
            <li> Ok, so it works, I was really dark after the first few times I tried it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think they were working as expected and felt kind of pale</li>
            <li> Low price, decent tan.  </li>
            <li> Moved up to a high pressure bed and used this lotion at the same visit.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I noticed people either love or hate this lotion.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical ordering this, as I&#x27;ve always used Australian Gold products, but had read good reviews on this site about it.  </li>
            <li> As other reviews mentioned the smell is also very yummy!</li>
            <li> its not a very dark bronzer which alot of people look for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already pretty dark, but for the price I&#x27;d say you can&#x27;t beat something like this.  </li>
            <li> Just because they are cheaper than Designer Skin products doesn&#x27;t mean they are any less effective.  </li>
            <li> I have been so much darker before with other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of this, I highly recommend careful application.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many other tanning products so its hard for me to compare this one, but it seems to work</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews before purchasing, I was really thinking that this lotion was going to get me extremely dark.</li>
            <li> Much like other self-tanners, this stuff will make your skin blotchy and orange if you do not apply it (and let it dry)</li>
            <li> While the lotion is good, mosturizes well, and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad</li>
            <li> neither bad or good.  </li>
            <li> Another thing is, you have to wait a while before bathing, because it seriously rubs right off.</li>
            <li> I didnt really want to admit it myself because I had worked so hard on my tan, but I was orange</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have been much darker before with other lotions.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used Black Storm by Millenium Tanning, this has the same before and after smells to me.  </li>
            <li> I alternate between this, Black Storm, Solid Black, and Designer Skin&#x27;s Bombshell on a day to day basis.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see the deep dark tan results they promised!</li>
            <li> But it is great for Tanning before the gym because it does not get nasty when you start to sweat.</li>
            <li> It was almost as if not only was it giving me a fake tan but also keeping me from getting a real tan.</li>
            <li> Like the crease between my upper arm and forearm, my feet and a few others.</li>
            <li> Not really getting anywhere with this.</li>
            <li> It looks like I&#x27;ve just spent all my time laying out on beaches.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about a week now, ive tanned before using luminary, and black, and Roar lotions, this one is really not my favorite, it keeps my old tan up</li>
            <li> and you look like a brown and white streaky mess!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t discolor my hands.</li>
            <li> I had been tanning about a month using some other lotion and didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting tan at all.  </li>
            <li> but now I can tell that I am extremely darker than I was before.</li>
            <li> and I got darker quicker then other products.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell and its not sticky like some of the other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> Other people say it hasn&#x27;t splotched on them, but they all look orange to me</li>
            <li> What I would suggest doing is to going tanning every other day,</li>
            <li> use this stuff one day and the other day use a tanning accelerator.</li>
            <li> But, be careful!</li>
            <li> once every other day....</li>
            <li> Other products have not worked as well.  </li>
            <li> i have been an avid designer skin buyer for years, which is quite expensive.</li>
            <li> a dark, musky pomergrante smell</li>
            <li> and I got quite dark.  </li>
            <li> but people kept telling me how dark I was.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely dark and didn&#x27;t even realize it.</li>
            <li> I now have a dark tan.</li>
            <li> This product gives me a dark dark tan.</li>
            <li> and i think cut down on the rash time.</li>
            <li> BE VERY CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> Black Night got me darker.</li>
            <li> so i went with the Black Knight</li>
            <li> I am tan now, and when I used this lotion for the first time, my skin turned orange the next morning atfter tanning! :(</li>
            <li> It Black.  </li>
            <li> i got rid of it in less than a day.</li>
            <li> so I ordered paint it black and black storm instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker, and sometimes can&#x27;t tell subtle differences in aromas, but overall its a pleasing scent going on and after tanning.  </li>
            <li> It was Paint it Black and Black Storm that got me to where I am now, though, so don&#x27;t let Millenium Tanning&#x27;s prices fool you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on getting a spray tan on Tuesday because they are half price at my salon on that day</li>
            <li> , she needed to know what I used, since her lotion was a bad smelling one, just like the box full</li>
            <li> You do get color very fast, but not only does it look fake, it IS fake.</li>
            <li> still not sure if i can use this product some other way.....</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about which tanning loition to pick from, because there are about a million...</li>
            <li> I was very dark and had color in places that didnt tan well before.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years and have gotten very dark from this lotion.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a little on the pale side as of now.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t start noticing a color until after a few sessions</li>
            <li> dont waste your money buying $50 lotions when this one works as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> not sure it was needed.</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t end up with any weird orange streaks from it since the lotion is white.</li>
            <li> This price is unbelievable, and even with my discount from where I work, this is way cheaper.</li>
            <li> , I was simply just not impressed by it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure if this helped me tan,</li>
            <li> It did give me a decent tan, but it left me smelling horrible.  </li>
            <li> so its hard to see that its on evenly.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hands orange and it is really hard to get off.</li>
            <li> And let me tell you it is very frustrating to feel like you&#x27;re starting all over on a tan you&#x27;ve been working very hard to build.</li>
            <li> So this made it even harder when the lotion failed me.</li>
            <li> its really thick</li>
            <li> i mean i did get tanner using it, but you can also tan without lotion and still get tan.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that is smells really bad after tanning.</li>
            <li> I am not a good tanner.</li>
            <li> however you won&#x27;t notice a dramatic color change of your skin.</li>
            <li> but i definitely had a horrible allergic reaction on my chest from it, but nowhere else.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  </li>
            <li> This lotion works well, it applies easily,doesn&#x27;t give you that fake orange color that some lotions do.</li>
            <li> And, the lotion is very THIN.  </li>
            <li> , Other lotions Ive tried smell horrible.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with either!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> The orange color was extremely hard to get off, and it looked horrible.</li>
            <li> Its VERY expensive at salons, so I purchased it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to exfoliate the streaks off, already been there done that yesterday...</li>
            <li> Im not nervous leaving the salon after tanning about how bad I smell, even had someone ask what body spray I had on</li>
            <li> my bad....</li>
            <li> I have nothing BAD to say about this tanning lotion</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad in fact</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad and I like it doesn&#x27;t turn your hands orange.</li>
            <li> so it shocked me that i had an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is AWFUL.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this lotion but I don&#x27;t like the smell, there not reall one, if it maybe had a dark, musky pomergrante smell itd be amazing!!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. I get the most compliments after leaving the tanning salon. Keep in mind the power lies in the \\&quot;thermal emulsion bronzing\\&quot; so leaving the bottle exposed to prolonged heat, like in your car, can decrease your tanning results. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but a more tropical scent would be nice. A little bit goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t discolor my hands.</li>
            <li> This product is a GREAT bronzer!!! The color is amazing. I&#x27;ve did &#x27;side by side&#x27; comparision tanning to Austrailian Gold Chrystal XII 12 Plus Triple Body blush.  Black Night got me darker. The only downside is that is smells really bad after tanning. I had to get some body spray to try and mask the odor, since I had to go back to work after tanning. I&#x27;m trying Black Storm next, in hopes it will smell better!</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever used...I have never been darker in my life!  From the first time I put it on...I will never buy anything else...Fast delivery....Great Price!</li>
            <li> I just started back tanning and i have always used tinglers and i wanted somethin different so i went with the Black Knight and i&#x27;m glad i did i have some freckles and i&#x27;m a little fair skinned so it takes a while to get me tan , but within the first two visits i already saw a major difference !! i love this lotion it gives you a nice bronze look not orange at all. Also it smells good and doesnt smell after you tan either. Hope this helps ! :)</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this product to anyone. I have been tanning with this for a week and I am already brown! I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great.Glides on ,&amp; has good scent, not fruity or coco-nutty.I&#x60;v been tanning indoors for over 10 years &amp; this is the best lotion ,and I&#x60;v tried a lot.Doesn&#x60;t leave you greasy &amp; you get nice color.</li>
            <li> I got the lotion VERY quickly using standard shipping...I love the built-in bronzers and I saw IMMEDIATE results. The lotion smells pretty good too..</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! I had been tanning about a month using some other lotion and didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting tan at all.  It did take about 4 visits before I noticed the difference but now I can tell that I am extremely darker than I was before. The lotion was delivered very quickly and is very affordable (spending 50 bucks on lotion is just not plausable for me!).  Definately worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 4 times since I bought it.  If you&#x27;re looking for a self tanner, this product is ok.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for a tanning lotion with a bronzer, keep looking.  Everytime I use this product, any color I get washes off in the shower. Also, it causes streaking and an orange tint to your hands.  I gave it one star, and I consider that generous.</li>
            <li> I am not seeing a huge difference by using this lotion.  Good price, but not sure it was needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 4-5 times and it works great! My tan seems to last longer and I got darker quicker then other products.  I like the smell and its not sticky like some of the other tanning lotions. Also not to mention, I purchased this on sale w/ free shipping</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tanning lotion.  It leave your skin silky smooth, smells great and produces a super dark tan.  You also don&#x27;t end up with any weird orange streaks from it since the lotion is white.</li>
            <li> Get great color from this..  Very good Bronzers  Remember wash hands after use.</li>
            <li> I would not suggest buying this lotion. It will turn your skin orange. I am tan now, and when I used this lotion for the first time, my skin turned orange the next morning atfter tanning! :(</li>
            <li> Ok, so I noticed people either love or hate this lotion. I&#x27;ve been tanning for 7 years off and on and know about a lot of lotions. Well I only go tanning in the summer so I&#x27;m a little on the pale side as of now. Moved up to a high pressure bed and used this lotion at the same visit. So first off, it&#x27;s white so its hard to see that its on evenly. It does contain some either heavy duty bronzers or self tanner in it because after I tanned that evening I just looked really good and brown. Woke up the next morning to run errands and noticed under florescent lighting it looked like I had been rolling in dirt! It&#x27;s not orange streaky, it&#x27;s BROWN streaky! So as long as you get it on perfectly evenly you&#x27;re set. Miss one spot and you can see the difference in the tan lines. Miss a lot and you look like a brown and white streaky mess! BE VERY CAREFUL! It&#x27;s impossible to exfoliate the streaks off, already been there done that yesterday...no luck!</li>
            <li> love to use this product. great tanning bed lotion with bronzer that helps you get a tan look quicker and keep it longer</li>
            <li> If your an indoor tanner this you need. Its one of the best lotions, and I worked in the industry for years!! This price is unbelievable, and even with my discount from where I work, this is way cheaper. Snap it up, you will love it. Not that after burn feeling, and smells great. Im not nervous leaving the salon after tanning about how bad I smell, even had someone ask what body spray I had on it smelled so good, and when I told her it was tan lotion, and I had just tanned, she needed to know what I used, since her lotion was a bad smelling one, just like the box full I have which I will never use!! Get this, I got a couple right away!! Also the 50x which is super cheap right now. You cant go wrong with either!</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with Paint It Black.  I would alternate between the two and I got quite dark.  These lotions work well and leave your skin feeling great.  I didn&#x27;t think they were working as expected and felt kind of pale but people kept telling me how dark I was.  So I decided to take a picture of myself and wow they were right.  I was extremely dark and didn&#x27;t even realize it.</li>
            <li> Great lotion. Smells nice and doesn&#x27;t discolor at all with the bronzers. It still smells funky after tanning but what lotion doesn&#x27;t???</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many other tanning products so its hard for me to compare this one, but it seems to work okay. it doesnt smell that good in the bottle, and it smells even worse after you&#x27;ve tanned with it. it seems to moisturize really well though</li>
            <li> I bough this tanning lotion from Amazon and received it very quickly. Smells wonderful, glides on smooth not sticky or tacky and seems to work wonders too. I rotate my tanning lotions every 4-5 days. And when I rotate to a different lotion I miss this one! All in all, a great lotion at a great price.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells Great! I tan before work and Like something that smells good after I Tan, Other lotions Ive tried smell horrible. Fast shipping and it works good if you use a good amount of lotion.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews before purchasing, I was really thinking that this lotion was going to get me extremely dark. While the lotion is good, mosturizes well, and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad (I still feel like I need a shower after I tan, but I&#x27;ve experienced worse smelling lotions by far), I don&#x27;t feel like it really made THAT much of a difference. The first few times I used it I felt as if I had gotten darker, but now it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much more then mosturizing my skin. So while the product is good, I am still on the search for my miracle tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth getting. I now have a dark tan. It spreads on like silk.</li>
            <li> I was using Worship by Designer Skin and quickly fell out of love with that lotion so I found myself \\&quot;shopping\\&quot; around with the packets at my tanning salon. Thats when I fell in love with this one. Its VERY expensive at salons, so I purchased it through Amazon. Same great product, only I thought the shipping was a bit slow (a week). This lotion truelly gives a great dark color and smells pretty good, except afterwards you have that &#x27;burnt&#x27; smell but this lotion is so great, it really doesnt matter.</li>
            <li> This is a good product! You can see a big difference the first time you use it. I feels good and smells good too. It does not rubb off on your clothes and does not leave you red!! It is very GOOOD Lotion!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion has really given me a nice color.  Didn&#x27;t turn me orange at all.  It smells good going on, but doesn&#x27;t smell that great after you tan.  For the price, this is a good tanning product.</li>
            <li> I got this for 12$ when it was on sale and since this is a high end lotion it doesnt stain your skin as much so if your looking for a quick acting bronzer this one is not for you...  But it is great for Tanning before the gym because it does not get nasty when you start to sweat.</li>
            <li> First off I do not tan, I only bought this to have a nice tan for Hawaii.(though I use to tan often about 5 years ago) I have normally VERY fair skin, after two level 4 sessions (9 min each) I look nice and tanned! They sell the same product at the salon for $95.00! As other reviews mentioned the smell is also very yummy! Easy to apply, this is hands down best tanning lotion I have used.</li>
            <li> HAD HOPED BY THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT THAT \\&quot;60X\\&quot; WOULD GIVE A GREAT TAN...  WRONG! I COULD&#x27;VE USED A BODY LOTION, (NOT INDOOR TANNING LOTION) TO GET A MOISTURIZER. THIS DID NOT GIVE ME A TAN AT ALL!</li>
            <li> The product was in good condition, however, this is not a very good product. It smells good, but does not do a good job bronzing. I would not suggest this product to anyone although I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> make sure you wash your hands after you use this stuff!! strong bronzers, but all in all a great buy!</li>
            <li> pays to read everything ....my bad....i don&#x27;t use a tanning bed...still not sure if i can use this product some other way.....and i have friends that do use a tanning bed so i can just give it to them....DON\\&quot;T BE ME! READ!</li>
            <li> I was super excited about getting this stuff, because of the price. I have been tanning at a salon for about a month now. I have been using australian gold. good stuff. I recently ran out, so I decided to switch it up and try this.    Ok, so it works, I was really dark after the first few times I tried it. The problem is that I had streaks on my legs and arms, and ankles. My fingernails turned orange, as well as my hands, and trust me I wiped my hands prior to getting in that bed. Another thing is, you have to wait a while before bathing, because it seriously rubs right off. I took a shower the next day, and my tan was gone. I want to have a real tan that will stay, and with this stuff, it didn&#x27;t do that for me.</li>
            <li> the only problem that i have with this lotion is that if you don&#x27;t make sure that you thoroughly rub it in and make sure that it is even, you will get the orange streaks... i didn&#x27;t get the streaks... i just got an orange blob on my leg. lol oh, and be careful! i don&#x27;t know what it is about this lotion... but i definitely had a horrible allergic reaction on my chest from it, but nowhere else. i don&#x27;t have what would be classified as sensitive skin so it shocked me that i had an allergic reaction to it. for future reference, if you get a rash on the chest from this product, lotion lotion lotion and if it itches, use a v e n o baby diaper cream. its really thick and i think cut down on the rash time. i got rid of it in less than a day. if you are looking for a cheap lotion that is, in my opinion, one of the best ones... get Australian Golds First Blush. if i didn&#x27;t have the allergic reaction, i probably would still be using it. im even contemplating using it for just my legs. who knows.</li>
            <li> I use this product about once a week and it works great. I have fair skin and this lotion helps me achieve a healthy natural looking glow. I would not recommend this product if you are trying to get a deep brown tan. This is for someone who wants more of a subtle color. It also smells good.</li>
            <li> Okay before I say anything further I want to say that some people have good experiences with this lotion. In the beginning I loved it! I was very dark and had color in places that didnt tan well before. So this made it even harder when the lotion failed me. I started noticing that my coloring was very orange and after a couple weeks use It started rubbing off in places. Like the crease between my upper arm and forearm, my feet and a few others. Eventually it started being so splotchy and orange that I had to scrub it all off. When I did I was pretty white under it all, even after a month of consistent tanning. It was almost as if not only was it giving me a fake tan but also keeping me from getting a real tan. Like it was shielding me from real color? Finally I&#x27;ve gotten all the orange off and am now using an Australian gold bronzer..they&#x27;re an older brand that I know more about and therefore can trust. When I told the lady at my salon about this she told me she&#x27;s had the same problem and that it seemed the lotion had very cheap bronzers. Other people say it hasn&#x27;t splotched on them, but they all look orange to me and I just don&#x27;t think they want to realize it. I didnt really want to admit it myself because I had worked so hard on my tan, but I was orange alright. And let me tell you it is very frustrating to feel like you&#x27;re starting all over on a tan you&#x27;ve been working very hard to build. Considering my experience, I would not reccomend this product. You do get color very fast, but not only does it look fake, it IS fake.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this product is not what it is all worked up to be. Not really getting anywhere with this. I have been so much darker before with other tanning lotions. It leaves your hands orange and it is really hard to get off. What I would suggest doing is to going tanning every other day, use this stuff one day and the other day use a tanning accelerator. That is what helped me with this stuff to max out its potential.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this if you are looking for a tan.   I noticed no difference using this product.  And I did not like the smell.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th buy of Black Night and the lotion produces a beautiful tan; nice warm brown glow without an orange appearance.  The scent of the lotion is subtle and pleasant to smell. I would recommend this lotion to everyone, in fact, I have given my daughter and best friend a try and they both are buying this. One of the best lotions Designer Skin has made.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion goes on the skin nicely - easy to rub in - smells good - but I don&#x27;t see the deep dark tan results they promised! I will continue to use it and see if I get tanner! At this point I would not purchase again - rather try another product that might work better.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion, you can see results right away. I have troubles with turning orange after using a tanning lotion with bronzer, but this one is a nice brown glow. The seller is great, my product shipped when they said they would. Very Happy</li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth! feels great, and I got darker after only 1 visit!!! I&#x27;m hooked</li>
            <li> I just love this lotion   At this price I like to make it last.  I moisterize first with a cheap lotion i don&#x27;t like any more_*(I&#x27;m so frugle) and then use this.  Prevents me from using too much--it is such a good lotion you don&#x27;t need to slather it on.  It&#x27;ll just glide on and you&#x27;ll look super tan first time using. This method prevents me from unnessarily using too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of different tanning lotions and I was excited when I got this one because of all of the fantastic reviews. Everyone notes how easily you get dark. But, be careful! I believe this stuff has self-tanner in it, not just a regular bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A typical bronzer lightly enhances your tan; it doesn&#x27;t actually turn your skin a tan color after the first use. This one does - and not because you&#x27;re actually tanning, it&#x27;s because it has self-tanner in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, I highly recommend careful application. Much like other self-tanners, this stuff will make your skin blotchy and orange if you do not apply it (and let it dry) just right. It will also stain your clothes if you&#x27;re wearing anything that&#x27;s light in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to give you immediate (but not permanent) color, this is it. If you&#x27;re looking for something to help you achieve (and monitor) your actual tan, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical ordering this, as I&#x27;ve always used Australian Gold products, but had read good reviews on this site about it.  I got this order within just 3 days or so...I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived!  I&#x27;m a fair skinned person, and usually, it takes me a couple of weeks of tanning 4 days a wk (or more) to get a good base tan.  It only took me 3 times....once every other day....with this lotion to already see a tan/bronze!  It works really well!  The smell is ok...neither bad or good.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as soft as my last lotion, but it sure gets me darker faster.  And what a bargain buying online from the Amazon site!  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a quick tan (for an event or something).</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about a week now, ive tanned before using luminary, and black, and Roar lotions, this one is really not my favorite, it keeps my old tan up but i havent gotten any darker like i was hoping, the smell is very nice though, and it does go on nicley. it does not really irrate my skin, makes it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awsome.  When you go tanning you will get a deeper more bronze tan with this product.</li>
            <li> I have nothing BAD to say about this tanning lotion but I also don&#x27;t have anything good to say about it. For the money, I would purchase something else if I were you. I will definitely not be buying this again, I was simply just not impressed by it. The smell was nothing special, as I said not bad but not good.. I also have gotten better color from lotions that are around the same price. So maybe it&#x27;s just hit or miss with some people but I didn&#x27;t particularly like this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING for the price.  It leaves my skin silky smooth, smells great n&#x27; gets me dark.  Best tanning bottle that i&#x27;ve boughten for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  Buy it !</li>
            <li> smells fantastic! and works really well. my skin hasnt seen sun in months, and im am pretty fair skinned. after one use, i already have seen a fair amount of color! good lotion, and good price</li>
            <li> This is some CHEAP tanning lotion!!  The fragrance is AWFUL.  And, the lotion is very THIN.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure if this helped me tan, i mean i did get tanner using it, but you can also tan without lotion and still get tan. it didn&#x27;t really boost anything. Smells good though.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and my skin tends to get dry and it hasn&#x27;t with this lotion. I&#x27;ve been very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It is way better then the last bronzer I had.  After my first tanning session I was seeing a difference in my skin.  I think that is outstanding when I only tan for 12 min.  I will be getting this Bronzer from now on.</li>
            <li> With so many products out there you never know what&#x27;s a good one for you until you try.  Black night 60x is great product.  It goes on nice, smells clean, leaves your skin silky soft and doesn&#x27;t give you that feared carrot orange glow :)  I would buy this lotion again.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion to use. I have been tanning for years and have gotten very dark from this lotion. I would recommend it to everyone, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Loved this item, it smells good, works good, and overall I was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This lotion works well, it applies easily,doesn&#x27;t give you that fake orange color that some lotions do. the smell is kind of strange but i think everbody has a different sense of what smells good.  Would recommend this lotion especially for the price. At the salons you can pay 100 dollars or more for lotions that work the same if not worse. Shipping was promt, no issues.</li>
            <li> this works pretty well and it smells awesome. i didn&#x27;t start noticing a color until after a few sessions but once you get color it lasts. gotten a lot of comments from my local tanning salon on the smell and how great it tans. fast shipping totally recommended.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon, we carry the millennium lotions and they are a great product.Black night has a very good smell, goes on nice and smooth, but in my personal opnion it isnt the greatest lotion to get you darker. its not a very dark bronzer which alot of people look for.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product at Boca Tanning(sample packs) I tried a few different ones at the salon, but by far this product gave me the best results. Salon price was $80 something. I ordered the product on amazon for an amazing price and it gave me the same great results as the sample packs; I purchased at the salon. Millennium Tanning lotions are my favorite you get a sun-kiss Miami Tan not tanning bed orange...I wanted to reorder this product and its unavailable so I ordered paint it black and black storm instead.Also by Millennium Tanning.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Fast delivery.  Best smelling tanning lotion I have ever had.  And seems to help achieve a nice kinda dark tan rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion that I have used so far! I love it because I would tan and it wouldn&#x27;t seem to keep going after a certain point but this definitely helped! My legs don&#x27;t tan very well and this fixed that as well. I talked to the ladies in the salon and I told them to recommend this tanning lotion to people who need a good tanning lotion. I&#x27;m about to buy this every time because I love it but I&#x27;m going to try others (similar to this) and see if they compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are lighter complected and worry about this product don&#x27;t worry anymore. I am lighter complected and it works great for me! If you are tan and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be progressing, USE THIS! It will work for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Low price, decent tan.  Spend more and get more out of your tan.  This is just okay.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion I&#x27;ve used a lot of diffrent lotion that have givein me some color but not a lot when I came across this product I read some of the reviews and thought I would give it a try and ILOVE IT !!!,and its a great price ! It got me so dark on the first time I used it I will get this again !!! Great tanning lotion (&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, so I&#x27;m not going to jump the gun and give it a five,yet, but it really helped my tan!!! I had gone 6 or 7 times prior to using this and I wasn&#x27;t getting adequate color. I used this and i am very noticeably darker!! In LOVE so far, can&#x27;t wait to use it again!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think this product is as good as it is built up to be. The smell is nice and not over powering. It does a ok job on tanning; however, it will turn your hands orange no matter how hard you try to wipe it off when you are done applying it onto your skin. If you don&#x27;t alternate it with other lotions it will gradually turn you orange instead of giving you a nice brown natural looking tan. I use it as a \\&quot;last resort\\&quot; lotion. This  is not a product that I would be willing to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like it, its more of a self tanner. I have just started tanning, and after the third time i notest orange in between my fingers and a huge orange streak on my arm. The orange color was extremely hard to get off, and it looked horrible. I decided to buy this solar addict lotion by Australian Gold after the fourth time i used the Black Night lotion, and after two uses i had amazing results. This is more of a bronzer, and i think it would work better if you were tanning in the sun.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this lotion after reading good things about it.  It did give me a decent tan, but it left me smelling horrible.  It also left orange marks around my feet and between my fingers if I didn&#x27;t scrub them.  I definitely have tried way better lotions and you can get them for a great price online.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Gives your skin a great bronze color along with enhancing your tanning visit.  It also seems to make my tan last longer.  Smells great too.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion does what it says it giving you a nice bronze dark tan. The smell isn&#x27;t bad in fact I like it &amp; it makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Im fair skinned and ive been tanning in the regular beds for 15 mins Eod or E3d&#x27;s and using this and im Darker than i EVER have been in my life.. this lotion really works.. just make sure u apply a good amount and get it on even.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works well. Nice use of bronzers helps you to get a good tan</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this tanning product. Works great, no orange color.  I am very fair complected and now have a great tan (worked well even the very first time)!!  Other products have not worked as well.  This one does a super job of moisturizing my skin as well. This is the second time purchasing the product and will purchase again. Product arrived quickly.....super!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is one I will purchase again! The smell isn&#x27;t too bad and I like it doesn&#x27;t turn your hands orange. It is a nice lotion! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good lotion!</li>
            <li> i have been an avid designer skin buyer for years, which is quite expensive. im shorter on money these days and decided to do some research on some cheaper lotions, and when i came across this lotion and seen a lot of the positive reviews, i figured why not? the shipment was very quick and the lotion is amazing. ive been using it for a couple of weeks now and it works a lot better than my last lotion. the smell is nice and not overwhelming, so i can go on my lunchbreaks at work and not come back smelling like burnt skin. its smooth going on and you dont feel like you have a layer of nastiness on you after youre done tanning. i recommend, works great, especially for the price. dont waste your money buying $50 lotions when this one works as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> I like Paint it Black alot better, but this will suffice. I got a good deal on it, however. The product will lose its effectiveness after a few months so its best to use it quickly instead of making it go further like I try to do.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about which tanning loition to pick from, because there are about a million...but I read the reviews and made a choice!  Millenium tanning Black Night was a great choice. It has a lite tropical smell and a light application. It is not greasy, is glides on even and gives me even color!  It works great in the sun or in the tanning bed. My color comes out amazing! Plus if you can&#x27;t make it to the tanning bed or catch some rays in the sun, the color last! It keeps my skin mositurized all day! I will defently buy again!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is hands down my absolute favorite. I have used so many different brands and NOTHING compares to Black Night. I do not have any Hispanic or Indian in my ancestral background and I have a whole lot of Belgian in me. I am not a good tanner. I don&#x27;t tan I just burn and what I call a tan looks like a sunburn to everyone. This product gives me a dark dark tan. It looks like I&#x27;ve just spent all my time laying out on beaches. However I must say that you will notice after shaving that orange/brown film will be in the water. It&#x27;s clearly the bronzer in this lotion however you won&#x27;t notice a dramatic color change of your skin. I can only darken my skin so much but what this lotion does is helps you get your skin to a darker level. It may be a whole lot of bronzer layered on but it looks natural.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap but gives you an orange tint. You get what you pay for with this.</li>
            <li> with this loation i got the darkest i ever have i tried a $90 loation and this beat it i would buy this again</li>
            <li> This lotion is a great quality lotion and leaves your skin very smooth. It does go on very silky and that I loved. My only complaint is that I have been much darker before with other lotions. When I began to switch up my routine and alternate this with another one I got a better tan. If you tan fairly easily this may work fine for you, I on the other hand and pretty light skinned and need some help.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. The smell is not overwhellming and i have never got tan so quick! I love how smooth my skin feels and how the lotion absorbs into my skin. you cant beat this deal either! my tanning salons mark up lotions so much.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used Black Storm by Millenium Tanning, this has the same before and after smells to me.  Granted I&#x27;m a smoker, and sometimes can&#x27;t tell subtle differences in aromas, but overall its a pleasing scent going on and after tanning.  I definitely felt more heat in my skin just like when using Black Storm, so I know its doing its job getting me darker, but honestly at this point I can&#x27;t tell much difference.  I alternate between this, Black Storm, Solid Black, and Designer Skin&#x27;s Bombshell on a day to day basis.  I&#x27;m already pretty dark, but for the price I&#x27;d say you can&#x27;t beat something like this.  It was Paint it Black and Black Storm that got me to where I am now, though, so don&#x27;t let Millenium Tanning&#x27;s prices fool you.  Just because they are cheaper than Designer Skin products doesn&#x27;t mean they are any less effective.  After almost 3 months I am beginning to notice some imperfections in my skin...some lighter spots in areas, but from what I understand that happens with everyone who uses tanning beds a lot.  I&#x27;m planning on getting a spray tan on Tuesday because they are half price at my salon on that day and I&#x27;ll only be paying $8.  The spray tan is supposed to even out and blend imperfections such as light areas, and tanning prior to the spray (without using an enhancing lotion,) is supposed to open up your pores and let it do it a better job.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll be completely evened out after that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this lotion for a couple of months now. It is fantastic you don&#x27;t have to use that much as it just glides on your body like silk, and it really smells nice, leaves your skin feeling so soft and radiant. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion, even the owner of the Tanning Salon that I tan at asked me about it and I let her try it and she loves it so now she order it for her salon. All I can say is try it you&#x27;ll love it. :)</li>
