            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always perspired a great deal, and I continued to do so when using this, but there was no odor or stink.    </li>
            <li>This Thai spray is great, though.</li>
            <li>I discoverd my boyfriend&#x27;s gel deodorant, and have been happy since.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for me.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great organic deordarant</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>Since this had great reviews, I figured that I had nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li>Love this!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I discovered it!!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Great product, good price, prompt ship.</li>
            <li>This product might be good, but for others, not for me.</li>
            <li>If storing it at work or in your bag, try to keep it out of the sun, and in a comfortable room temperature (again, best if kept in the fridge).  </li>
            <li>The best thing is that it works fantastic if you had foot odor.</li>
            <li>Good competitive price.  </li>
            <li>Good by stained clothes and aluminum.</li>
            <li>Have had good results with this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anything about that, but it does do what it says it will if you have good hygiene</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Thai Deodorant Stick and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>I believe that  that&#x27;s a GOOD THING.  </li>
            <li>Good product anyways</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how quickly this product was shipped to me.  </li>
            <li>so I was very pleased about that.  </li>
            <li>Works great, better for you than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deoderants.</li>
            <li>I apply it right after a shower, best way to use this.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)!</li>
            <li>No way is that healthy!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I used to use the stick form, the spray is much better!</li>
            <li>your time rubbing it in with the crystal.&lt;br /&gt;no more stinky pits!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>This still is pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It is amazing what this spray can do for body odor.</li>
            <li>It is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>The spray version is the best way to administer this product and it really works.</li>
            <li>my shirts all smell quite nice</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot, so use about twice the recommended amount, followed by either Weleda Rose deodorant spray or Aubrey Organics Calendula deodorant spray.  </li>
            <li>but in this case I can honestly tell you that this item made a believer out of me</li>
            <li>It was not until I found this product that I can honestly say that I am odor-free.  </li>
            <li>However, there were so many good reviews that I thought I&#x27;d take a chance.</li>
            <li>No scent in product is nice.  </li>
            <li>I have found it to be non-irritating to my skin, yet highly effective against odor.</li>
            <li>Honestly there is no smell whatsoever even after a day at work.</li>
            <li>I have since bought it because I found it so effective.  </li>
            <li>Of course you should use some kind of an antiperspirant if you do not want it to &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; off the body.  </li>
            <li>No perfume, no aluminum salts, just an effective product.</li>
            <li>if you do not do this you will not create a protect bond and the spray will not work effectively.</li>
            <li>want to be totally honest here, and share that</li>
            <li>; It&#x27;s totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li>then i tried Nature&#x27;s Gate (tea tree oil and lichen); it was mild on my skin, but wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more effective than some of the heavy-duty chemical garbage that i used to use.</li>
            <li>I stopped using this for a while, and forgot how awesome it was until I stumbled across this old review on my profile.</li>
            <li>but I wanted something natural so this is a great alternative!</li>
            <li>However, this spray also works fine on its own.  </li>
            <li>But i love it</li>
            <li>Our favorite, a family staple at this point.</li>
            <li>I can get away with wearing most tops twice now before they go in the laundry hamper.  </li>
            <li>With Dove deodorant, I would be stinky and have more perspiration come through (sounds lovely, I know).  </li>
            <li>probably the best personal hygiene product purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>Buy this if staining/odor of most deodorants bother you.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked way better.</li>
            <li>i know i sweat like a beast, but this stuff makes me not a stinky beast. :)</li>
            <li>It prevents most underarm odor.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients&#x27; list is simple, crystals and ionized water, so for people like me, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to apply liberally and all around your armpit ( i use 3-5 sprays)</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the most effective deodorant that I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>However, I am a woman, and always seeking a more feminine choice.</li>
            <li>The latest in that journey has been to switch from the mainstream deodorant that I have used since puberty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided the product that already had it pulverized with the water was probably a better option.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad that I switched.</li>
            <li>but I love that it controls bacteria without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok....</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s a spray.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it gets away from using more toxic types of deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Best part-NO white marks on clothes!  </li>
            <li>No smell and healthy deodorant - love it.</li>
            <li>this is the best deoderant i know, but one of the two bottles i got had a faulty pump sprayer, so buy two to get a chance of actually using them  --  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This did not do anything more than water would</li>
            <li>I waited 3 months to write this to be sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Your better off wearing nothing then paying $8 for mineral salt water..</li>
            <li>Been using for many years.</li>
            <li>Feels refreshing when spraying as well.</li>
            <li>I was using the rock form of another brand of this type of deodorant and it worked okay,</li>
            <li>it will provide 24+ hours of smell free armpits though and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I started with the rock/stone version, but I like the spray better.</li>
            <li>I thought this spray would be even better.</li>
            <li>and I think this one is ok.</li>
            <li>I love this spray.  </li>
            <li>I know most people like to believe that they sweat, but they literally just glisten.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I apply it by spraying liberally all over the area, probably more than is necessary--the mist ends up dripping but dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it the first time midday with 90+ degree temps and 50% humidity with my underarms anything but pleasant.</li>
            <li>I already liked the original Thai Crystal, but I dropped it after just a week</li>
            <li>Works great, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but honestly this stuff is great; this also tells me it&#x27;s not a total cure</li>
            <li>This keeps the preservative-free, water-based solution fresh, and the cool spray feels very good on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>I love the natural scent, it&#x27;s not too manly or feminine, its very nuetral but wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love the natural scent, it&#x27;s not too manly or feminine, its very nuetral but wonderful.</li>
            <li>Wow, it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural alternative for deoderent.</li>
            <li>and this is the most important part...</li>
            <li>Works great and all natural</li>
            <li>This is easy, clean and works!</li>
            <li>so easy to put on.</li>
            <li>It is easy to spray on twice after a shower.  </li>
            <li>sure shoes are clean as well).  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is a mist spray which is odorless and dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is very reasonably priced and seems to work just as well as the Dr. Hauschka deodorant, though it admittedly doesn&#x27;t smell as nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as effective for me on the hot days.</li>
            <li>i love that it&#x27;s a spray; so quick and easy to put on, coats evenly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, hands down.  </li>
            <li>It is aluminum free, non staining (true!), no alcohol, etc.  </li>
            <li>And now that spring is on us, the nozzle works just fine.</li>
            <li>this product would probably be fine for that as well.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s aluminum free (some crystal deodorants are not).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alcohol free and dries like a mist of water would.</li>
            <li>Re-applying it at work is more of a challenge because in order for it to work for me, I need to re-wash my under arms/feet with soap and water and follow-up with a fresh doseof spray.  </li>
            <li>have been using this stuff for years, stink free.</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Product same as we buy in stores and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Thai spray mist deodorant has been the best alternative to harsh aluminum antiperspirant/deodorants.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s important that you wash and soap the area while taking a bath.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen  reviews about some ppl saying it keeps them fresh for two or more days...</li>
            <li>Now, I can buy nice new clothes!  </li>
            <li>Seriously; no perfume or odor of any kind.</li>
            <li>love it as very sensitive to most deoderants</li>
            <li>Believe it&#x27;s environmentally friendly too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to hug him after he comes home!</li>
            <li>I have switched to Schmidt&#x27;s Cedarwood and Juniper, and have been happy with it for a very long time, alternating it with one I make myself.</li>
            <li>I have switched to Schmidt&#x27;s Cedarwood and Juniper, and have been happy with it for a very long time, alternating it with one I make myself.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best natural deodorant ive tried</li>
            <li>And when I do my laundry the clothes are clean even in the underarm area.  </li>
            <li>I always apply it to clean skin...</li>
            <li>During much research concerning menopause, I discovered that I would benefit greatly by changing to all natural and organic products.  </li>
            <li>This product qualifies for Free Super Saver Shipping</li>
            <li>No chemicals - just water and special salt.</li>
            <li>Nothing special regarding effect, but like the spray bottle feature.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to keep it in the fridge, I just cool it in there to harden it together a bit.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to keep it in the fridge, I just cool it in there to harden it together a bit.</li>
            <li>-- 3/3 of my friends who have tried this for 1-2 full days bought it themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One more trip to Whole Foods found me searching the shelves for an alternative.</li>
            <li>However, I read the reviews on this liquid product, some reviews noted the same result with salt rock, but good results from the liquid version.</li>
            <li>This is only a \\&quot;good product\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I love how its not irritating and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li>i have, let&#x27;s say, a odor and thai crystal has really given me more confidence while dancing or working out.</li>
            <li>It was good but would develop tiny chips about two or three weeks in.  </li>
            <li>I have had not a bad day.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li>It appears that my body adapted to it quickly and it became ineffective over time.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other deodorant for our family and we LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Then I got pregnant.</li>
            <li>I especially love that it is not tested on animals, is natural for my body as opposed to the typical poisonous antiperspirant and deodorant, is earth friendly and is vegan.  </li>
            <li>I still find this deodorant so much more effective than other kinds of deodorants.</li>
            <li>I normally use the crystal but this is so much better because it is a mist.</li>
            <li>You still sweat, which is normal and healthy, but there is NO ODOR...</li>
            <li>With me, I also noticed that it needs to be re-applied \\&quot;several times\\&quot; a day to \\&quot;clean skin\\&quot;, if I am having a high-activity day or if the weather is warm.  </li>
            <li>I am always open to more natural treatments, and if it&#x27;s fairly harmless, I figure it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I also really like that it is a spray formula so that I can easily apply it to my skin/feet.  </li>
            <li>looks and feels like misting water under your arms, but as long as I keep my meat intake low, it does an excellent job!</li>
            <li>but it sure does help a girl to stay dry and confident.</li>
            <li>This works great for me with just a few squirts.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are similar to my own recipe.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are similar to my own recipe.</li>
            <li>I am not a heavy sweater, so I can&#x27;t vouch for people looking for something heavy duty, but it works perfectly for me even when exercising all day.</li>
            <li>aside from the fact that it was eating away at my flesh, i learned that most deodorant also contained aluminum, which could be carcinogenic, so i decided to try some natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>I dont sweat alot or have a particular problem with a strong odor.</li>
            <li>My sister has some friends who use this spray on their face to prevent acne, and for 7 bucks, I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Currently I am experimenting with the thai spray and an arm &amp; hammer \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant and so far I&#x27;m happy with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Who would have thought that a basic saline solution would be an effective deodorant?</li>
            <li>Spray keeps you fresh longer and it&#x27;s easier.</li>
            <li>Take care if thinking of using this in more sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The trick to its effectiveness is to apply right out of the shower, before  you have a chance to sweat.  </li>
            <li>I pat dry for the first 30 minutes and then seem to do pretty good the rest of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also live a vegan lifestyle, so have always had to struggle with finding a hygiene product that works effectively for these body areas, yet is cruelty-free, vegan and natural.</li>
            <li>Great product as usual.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really effective and long</li>
            <li>I have tried several &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; that weren&#x27;t really so, and I have tried to make my own deodorant, which is what I do now (alternating with Schmidt&#x27;s deodorant sold here on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>(if you skip this step, it will be gritty), just till warm, mix it again really well</li>
            <li>(if you skip this step, it will be gritty), just till warm, mix it again really well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had the rock form (or any natural deodorant) work all day, or hold up to wearing a tight-in-the-pits shirt, but I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and am constantly amazed at how good it works.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you apply it to clean, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I decided to order another bottle and use it again, and it&#x27;s still awesome, works way better than my other natural deodorants (previously using tea tree oil deodorant).</li>
            <li>First I was just happy that it kept me from stinking sitting at home with a loose shirt and air conditioning, next I wore it out on a hot (and HUMID!)</li>
            <li>Last all day and more.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t feel anything (it dries in seconds with a bit of &amp;#34;fanning&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>1 heaping tablespoon of baking soda and enough organic coconut oil to be able to mix it all together, but not too runny.</li>
            <li>1 heaping tablespoon of baking soda and enough organic coconut oil to be able to mix it all together, but not too runny.</li>
            <li>I am a big sweat-er, and it takes many sprays of this with the addition of a scented body oil to stop the smell.</li>
            <li>This was summer time, and I was traveling, and at first I thought it was insect bites.</li>
            <li>Awesome thing, no more use simple deodorants with chemicals.</li>
            <li>It has no odor, and you can even put on deodorant on top of this stuff for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Funny, thought you&#x27;d like to be aware.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and will be ordering it for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>I decided to apply it several more times.</li>
            <li>Safe enough for my kids.  </li>
            <li>She is always hot and sweaty.  </li>
            <li>A gal can only shower, so many times a day, but if I spray this stuff on all the &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34;, my 2-3 showers a day hold up teaching 2-5 group exercise classes and 3-6 personal training clients 6 days a week:-).  </li>
            <li>This works for me pretty darn well...</li>
            <li>THANKS THAI CRYSTAL!</li>
            <li>I like to spray it on immediately after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a particularly busy and vigorous day, or an important meeting, I would tend to choose something with a scent instead….but</li>
            <li>the smell gets into my house sometimes and all i do is spray coupme times in tbe rooms and the smell is gone, with no weird smell after.</li>
            <li>My underarms and feet tend to sweat a lot, and I am very conscious about feeling and smelling clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very economical because it lasts and lasts, and it has all natural ingredients, nothing wierd that will harm you.  </li>
            <li>The product works and its ALL NATURAL!!!!  </li>
            <li>I tried many other natural things but haven&#x27;t found anything better yet.</li>
            <li>The odor-protection lasted a good month, but then I noticed that the product became less and less effective.</li>
            <li>The pits still kind of smelled from the 2 hours I had worn it the other day</li>
            <li>My search is over for deodorant, I have found something that keeps me dry, clean, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It is not a perfect solution to my hygiene needs, but it is a good remedy until I can find something else that works better.  </li>
            <li>, this was not a product that was good enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing the good reviews are coming from people who do not actual physical activity..  </li>
            <li>I use it along with an antiperspirant to ensure that I stay dry and smell great all day long.  </li>
            <li>I go the whole day in this hot weather this summer (June of 2011)</li>
            <li>He works in a bakery, which is very labor intensive while working in a hot environment...</li>
            <li>Dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>When i first got it i didn&#x27;t use it correctly and it didn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li>The Thai deodorant in general is fantastic and works very well.</li>
            <li>then you should certainly try this product.  </li>
            <li>Large bottle, but sprays quite a bit too.</li>
            <li>Been using this for years, great stuff, I mix a little essential oils to give to some zing.</li>
            <li>Did not break me out and really mask the odor.</li>
            <li>It dries fast</li>
            <li>This really works and sometimes for two days.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a fragrance/chemical free deodorant, I would definitely recommend this</li>
            <li>I smelled it and did not believe that it really worked</li>
            <li>it is all natural and keeps me smelling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>No chemical smells or allergic reactions, and odor free 24 hours later.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t effect the amount you sweat, but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t smell much anymore.  </li>
            <li>This, however, really works.  </li>
            <li>and it really work.........</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat much and I work in a very chill office environment.</li>
            <li>Although the re-washing and re-applying is hum bug, my body odor would be \\&quot;much worse\\&quot; if I was using no product at all.  </li>
            <li>I hope this \\&quot;very honest\\&quot; and thorough review is helpful for you.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I buy at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>so I would not have to make the trip to Whole Foods to pick up a bottle but looks like I will have to after all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really sweaty and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li>** Experiment #1--I re-applied product several times during the day, light housework &amp; baking-----excellent results Experiment</li>
            <li>It really works, and the pump is so convenient for applying to feet.</li>
            <li>THAT was the point that stuck with me throughout the whole process.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, quality product.</li>
            <li>I sprayed four spritzes on each armpit for a week straight.</li>
            <li>Maybe this works for women who don&#x27;t sweat much for a guy like me who sweats a lot</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped with my hidratenitis supparativa.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even sweat that much and when I do, it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>I take anywhere from two to four fitness classes a week, and although they are geared towards middle-aged women and even elderly women, these classes do make you sweat and are an intense workout.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about his daily exposure to the chemicals, but nothing else would keep him odor free.  </li>
            <li>hahaha.  </li>
            <li>Really like the health aspect.</li>
            <li>I really like the spray version of this product because it&#x27;s easier to apply than the stick version.</li>
            <li>This works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>SO much easier and no scratching.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat so much that it&#x27;s an embarrassment.  </li>
            <li>I find that if I keep my underarms free from hair, the Thai deodorant will last 24 hrs or longer.  </li>
            <li>Wore the shirt the whole day, no stink.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>I have been using the stick for years, but this is much easier.</li>
            <li>No matter what clinical strenth deoderant/antiperspirant that I used, it never seemed to work the whole day.  </li>
            <li>day-at least in the 90&#x27;s if not 100&#x27;s-and was amazed that it worked just as good as my anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>and I live in an extremely hot climate.  </li>
            <li>I perspired heavily when I was younger, but now I barely, so this is the perfect deodorant for me -- all natural and no fragrance.</li>
            <li>Will recommend to anyone who wants to move to something natural that works!!</li>
            <li>fantastic product-eliminates odor-last a long time</li>
            <li>First of all, it works and it&#x27;s a natural option.  </li>
            <li>This has worked pretty well to help me move away from aluminum deodorants which have stained nearly all of my clothing.</li>
            <li>Be generous so enough salt reaches the skin and inhibits sweat, a full 5 or 6 pumps each arm.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great value too; my girlfriend and i both use the same bottle, and after at least 3 weeks we&#x27;ve touched maybe 1/4 of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, I spray it on daily and notice a big difference without it.</li>
            <li>So far this is working great for both my wife and I and no more breathing in aluminum from the aerosol deodorants or getting white streaks on my shirts from roll-on or gel deodorants</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>; Well, let me tell you that by looking at the presentation and the package of the product it does not look as much (you can see it for yourselves in the displayed picture), it looks just like bottled water that you can buy at the local grocery store, and it is sad that sometimes the advertising is what makes a product valuable and popular more than its usefulness,</li>
            <li>I do, however, highly recommend the product otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I tried another organic brand that had really high reviews.</li>
            <li>Bacteria is always an issue here with the high humidity.  </li>
            <li>Since I have been wearing only \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, non-aluminum-based deodorants for many years, I decided to go back to Whole Foods and find another natural deodorant from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li>This whole experience along with a new born had me ready to give up on the crystal deodorant and all natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I use this because it a more natural alternative to other deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Tried lots of natural products that don&#x27;t work, but this does!!</li>
            <li>Then I did the ultimate test: hot day with a tight-pitted shirt, and, OH MY GOSH!</li>
            <li>I tried it again recently and discovered that it does work if used directly after a shower on clean skin (seven pumps under arms, and seven-nine pumps on feet and between toes</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat a whole a lot (which is the point of using natural thing that doesn&#x27;t clog your pores) but will eliminate the smell.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the harsh aluminum antiperspirant/deodorants stain clothes, I have so many tops ruined from aluminum.  </li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t even worry about travel--the bottle seems to be your standard issue squirt bottle, and it should be easy to pour into a similar travel-sized container.</li>
            <li>It works fine if you are just lounging around the house, but if you plan on being outside or sweating at all, I definitely recommend something stronger!</li>
            <li>i live in florida, and in the summer</li>
            <li>Well, for now I will start looking for a new deoderant, can&#x27;t walk around with smelly pits any longer.</li>
            <li>I live in the south and it gets humid over here.</li>
            <li>The salty solution (among the other safe ingredients in this) create a hyper-tonic environment; water rushes out of the bacteria by osmosis, killing the bacteria as water goes from low salt to a high salt concentration, it leaves the bacteria into the salt, therefore killing the bacteria...and the odor it</li>
            <li>, it works as promised and despite the $10.00 price tag, which may seem a little too much for a regular deodorant, it is actually very cheap because I have used it for 1 month now</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it if you had problems finding a natural product that works with your body chemistry to keep that BO at bay.</li>
            <li>I like this deodorant, first because it&#x27;s natural and second because it keeps me fresh a bit longer than regular deodorants.</li>
            <li>For a little over $7 this deodorant will last at least 3 months per bottle, which is quite impressive.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not greasy at all, it left no residue at all on my clothing, and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It went directly in the trash!</li>
            <li>so I can research the product properly and get as many reviews from different sources as possible</li>
            <li>Cant beat this all natural deodorant!</li>
            <li>I had started using men&#x27;s gel deodorant over past 2 years, still do and am pleased with the product.  .  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t consistent last time I tried.</li>
            <li>have purchased this product many times with no issues, but with my most recent purchase, something has gone wrong.</li>
            <li>All natural, so no issues there!</li>
            <li>This product didnt keep me dry during the days that it was hot!</li>
            <li>The longevity isn&#x27;t exactly there, and on a warm day it definitely fails.</li>
            <li>I certainly feel a big difference when I forget to put it on.</li>
            <li>This product works well for me, however, only if used a certain way.  </li>
            <li>About 2 years ago, I started breaking out in large red welts under my arms.</li>
            <li>This no-frills deodorant is exactly what it says it is--the packaging is simple and easy to use, the product lasts for, from my experience, around twelve average hours or so, and you&#x27;ll definitely sweat (it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant), but you won&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of crystal deo&#x27;s and have used them for years, but the spray mist is fantastic to use and lasts for a long long time.</li>
            <li>I have been going through menopause for several years now and have experienced all of the uncomfortable signs and symptoms that go along with this stage of my life.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only works on clean dry underarms.</li>
            <li>you still want to try the Thai mist, here is my old review (the recipe for the deodorant I make myself is at the bottom):</li>
            <li>enough?&lt;br /&gt;-possible skin irritation if you&#x27;re sensitive?</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised how well this worked.</li>
            <li>Ive tried a few natural deodorants before, and they always stained my clothes and never actually worked fore more then a couple hours.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had to go whole weekends without showering, and it was still working on the 3rd day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum for awhile.</li>
            <li>My mother was amazed at how well it worked and was relieved that she could stop using aluminum based products that are linked to cancer, clogged your pores, and kept your body from sweating which is a natural way of cooling the body and releasing toxins.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna go through the whole bottle and will update my review as a final one as it finishes.</li>
            <li>And Thank you Lord Jesus for directing my path to yet another one of your natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does work, but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate my body odor even though I&#x27;ve followed the directions.  </li>
            <li>I gave away the stock-pile of my old brand.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work and have been surprised ever since.  </li>
            <li>Natural.  </li>
            <li>I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural that I could use and not worry throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I still have so much of the tube left and have no idea what to do with it.</li>
            <li>My housemate who works in a natural grocery store got a full-size sample of this product and gave it to me.  </li>
            <li>I have a \\&quot;workout buddy\\&quot; who is a menopausal woman in her early 50s</li>
            <li>I like that there are no harsh chemicals or aluminum in it.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses prescription strength Antiperspirant Old Spice</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works nearly as well as the stick.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of natural deodorants</li>
            <li>I find I have to wash my skin with soap and water and reapply throughout the the day, but that&#x27;s what I do with any natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>If I find that I am in between hair removal, it will last a whole workday but after that I will have to reapply by evening.  </li>
            <li>But this alone really helps cut back on odor.</li>
            <li>Then i can scent the house any natural way i want</li>
            <li>love this stuff because this product is made up of a salty solution that actually kills odor causing bacteria, by creating a harsh environment that bacteria will not thrive in.</li>
            <li>I love it and no more rashes!</li>
            <li>After you get that all mixed together well enough that it isn&#x27;t gritty anymore, then cool in the fridge.</li>
            <li>After you get that all mixed together well enough that it isn&#x27;t gritty anymore, then cool in the fridge.</li>
            <li>This stuff does leave a very light white mark on black or other dark colored shirts though, but its easy to remove with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li>Things like eating more fruits and veggies and less processed items, starting a daily vitamin regime, etc.</li>
            <li>Earlier this year I started making small changes in my life that will, hopefully, one day lead to a greater impact.</li>
            <li>It is NOT pink, but clear.</li>
            <li>With the stick I could go for a LONG time without reapplying, but this spray, it seems to stop working twice as fast.</li>
            <li>I did perspire in the hot weather and during Zumba, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li>It works better than any of the other products that I had previously used.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida, and my feet sweat constantly, even in sandals.  </li>
            <li>Apparently prevents foot odor, too!  </li>
            <li>Tried Toms of Maine and got major burns under my arms.</li>
            <li>I am really active and it has been really hot.</li>
            <li>Apparently it was the anti-perspirant, and not the sweat</li>
            <li>I realized that I must have finally developed an allergy to my deodorant, probably the perfume as I also have an intolerance to perfumes and essential oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to applying deodorant the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>So I went back to the drawing board looking for a natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now I barely have one boil per year.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I do combine it with my natural deodorant stick for extra help.</li>
            <li>and it worked better than any other deodorants that I tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>Skeptical, I tried it and am amazed at how well the crystals work, about 18 months now, much better than my old deodorant ever did.</li>
            <li>It comes in other forms, most common the rock form</li>
            <li>I only barely get how this product works, but it still blew my mind.</li>
            <li>For awhile I went without any deodorant at all, but because I live in Austin, Texas, going without deodorant is not very feasible.</li>
            <li>let your body completely air dry, or speed up the process with a hair dryer or fan, before you put on clothes....</li>
            <li>lbs-I&#x27;m not a cute, thin thing that looks good in yoga clothes.  </li>
            <li>but I really wouldn&#x27;t trust it for all day, or if I was wearing a shirt that was tight under my pits.</li>

            <li> The bottle spray is very good, it does provide a good misting!</li>
            <li> it works exceptionally well!</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always perspired a great deal, and I continued to do so when using this, but there was no odor or stink.    </li>
            <li> This Thai spray is great, though.</li>
            <li> I discoverd my boyfriend&#x27;s gel deodorant, and have been happy since.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for me.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Great organic deordarant</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> lol...</li>
            <li> Since this had great reviews, I figured that I had nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li> Love this!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I discovered it!!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Great product, good price, prompt ship.</li>
            <li> This product might be good, but for others, not for me.</li>
            <li> If storing it at work or in your bag, try to keep it out of the sun, and in a comfortable room temperature (again, best if kept in the fridge).  </li>
            <li> The best thing is that it works fantastic if you had foot odor.</li>
            <li> Good competitive price.  </li>
            <li> Good by stained clothes and aluminum.</li>
            <li> Have had good results with this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about that, but it does do what it says it will if you have good hygiene</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Thai Deodorant Stick and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> I believe that  that&#x27;s a GOOD THING.  </li>
            <li> Good product anyways</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how quickly this product was shipped to me.  </li>
            <li> so I was very pleased about that.  </li>
            <li> Works great, better for you than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deoderants.</li>
            <li> I apply it right after a shower, best way to use this.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)!</li>
            <li> No way is that healthy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> I used to use the stick form, the spray is much better!</li>
            <li> your time rubbing it in with the crystal.&lt;br /&gt;no more stinky pits!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> This still is pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It is amazing what this spray can do for body odor.</li>
            <li> It is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> The spray version is the best way to administer this product and it really works.</li>
            <li> my shirts all smell quite nice</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot, so use about twice the recommended amount, followed by either Weleda Rose deodorant spray or Aubrey Organics Calendula deodorant spray.  </li>
            <li> but in this case I can honestly tell you that this item made a believer out of me</li>
            <li> It was not until I found this product that I can honestly say that I am odor-free.  </li>
            <li> However, there were so many good reviews that I thought I&#x27;d take a chance.</li>
            <li> No scent in product is nice.  </li>
            <li> I have found it to be non-irritating to my skin, yet highly effective against odor.</li>
            <li> Honestly there is no smell whatsoever even after a day at work.</li>
            <li> I have since bought it because I found it so effective.  </li>
            <li> Of course you should use some kind of an antiperspirant if you do not want it to &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; off the body.  </li>
            <li> No perfume, no aluminum salts, just an effective product.</li>
            <li> if you do not do this you will not create a protect bond and the spray will not work effectively.</li>
            <li> want to be totally honest here, and share that</li>
            <li> ; It&#x27;s totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li> then i tried Nature&#x27;s Gate (tea tree oil and lichen); it was mild on my skin, but wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more effective than some of the heavy-duty chemical garbage that i used to use.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this for a while, and forgot how awesome it was until I stumbled across this old review on my profile.</li>
            <li> but I wanted something natural so this is a great alternative!</li>
            <li> However, this spray also works fine on its own.  </li>
            <li> But i love it</li>
            <li> Our favorite, a family staple at this point.</li>
            <li> I can get away with wearing most tops twice now before they go in the laundry hamper.  </li>
            <li> With Dove deodorant, I would be stinky and have more perspiration come through (sounds lovely, I know).  </li>
            <li> probably the best personal hygiene product purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Buy this if staining/odor of most deodorants bother you.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked way better.</li>
            <li> i know i sweat like a beast, but this stuff makes me not a stinky beast. :)</li>
            <li> It prevents most underarm odor.</li>
            <li> I have used it for many years.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients&#x27; list is simple, crystals and ionized water, so for people like me, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to apply liberally and all around your armpit ( i use 3-5 sprays)</li>
            <li> Most importantly, the most effective deodorant that I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> However, I am a woman, and always seeking a more feminine choice.</li>
            <li> The latest in that journey has been to switch from the mainstream deodorant that I have used since puberty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided the product that already had it pulverized with the water was probably a better option.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad that I switched.</li>
            <li> but I love that it controls bacteria without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok....</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s a spray.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it gets away from using more toxic types of deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Best part-NO white marks on clothes!  </li>
            <li> No smell and healthy deodorant - love it.</li>
            <li> this is the best deoderant i know, but one of the two bottles i got had a faulty pump sprayer, so buy two to get a chance of actually using them  --  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This did not do anything more than water would</li>
            <li> I waited 3 months to write this to be sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Your better off wearing nothing then paying $8 for mineral salt water..</li>
            <li> Been using for many years.</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing when spraying as well.</li>
            <li> I was using the rock form of another brand of this type of deodorant and it worked okay,</li>
            <li> it will provide 24+ hours of smell free armpits though and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I started with the rock/stone version, but I like the spray better.</li>
            <li> I thought this spray would be even better.</li>
            <li> and I think this one is ok.</li>
            <li> I love this spray.  </li>
            <li> I know most people like to believe that they sweat, but they literally just glisten.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I apply it by spraying liberally all over the area, probably more than is necessary--the mist ends up dripping but dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it the first time midday with 90+ degree temps and 50% humidity with my underarms anything but pleasant.</li>
            <li> I already liked the original Thai Crystal, but I dropped it after just a week</li>
            <li> Works great, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but honestly this stuff is great; this also tells me it&#x27;s not a total cure</li>
            <li> This keeps the preservative-free, water-based solution fresh, and the cool spray feels very good on a hot day.  </li>
            <li> I love the natural scent, it&#x27;s not too manly or feminine, its very nuetral but wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love the natural scent, it&#x27;s not too manly or feminine, its very nuetral but wonderful.</li>
            <li> Wow, it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural alternative for deoderent.</li>
            <li> and this is the most important part...</li>
            <li> Works great and all natural</li>
            <li> This is easy, clean and works!</li>
            <li> so easy to put on.</li>
            <li> It is easy to spray on twice after a shower.  </li>
            <li> sure shoes are clean as well).  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is a mist spray which is odorless and dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant is very reasonably priced and seems to work just as well as the Dr. Hauschka deodorant, though it admittedly doesn&#x27;t smell as nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as effective for me on the hot days.</li>
            <li> i love that it&#x27;s a spray; so quick and easy to put on, coats evenly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, hands down.  </li>
            <li> It is aluminum free, non staining (true!), no alcohol, etc.  </li>
            <li> And now that spring is on us, the nozzle works just fine.</li>
            <li> this product would probably be fine for that as well.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aluminum free (some crystal deodorants are not).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alcohol free and dries like a mist of water would.</li>
            <li> Re-applying it at work is more of a challenge because in order for it to work for me, I need to re-wash my under arms/feet with soap and water and follow-up with a fresh doseof spray.  </li>
            <li> have been using this stuff for years, stink free.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Product same as we buy in stores and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Thai spray mist deodorant has been the best alternative to harsh aluminum antiperspirant/deodorants.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s important that you wash and soap the area while taking a bath.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen  reviews about some ppl saying it keeps them fresh for two or more days...</li>
            <li> Now, I can buy nice new clothes!  </li>
            <li> Seriously; no perfume or odor of any kind.</li>
            <li> love it as very sensitive to most deoderants</li>
            <li> Believe it&#x27;s environmentally friendly too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid to hug him after he comes home!</li>
            <li> I have switched to Schmidt&#x27;s Cedarwood and Juniper, and have been happy with it for a very long time, alternating it with one I make myself.</li>
            <li> I have switched to Schmidt&#x27;s Cedarwood and Juniper, and have been happy with it for a very long time, alternating it with one I make myself.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best natural deodorant ive tried</li>
            <li> And when I do my laundry the clothes are clean even in the underarm area.  </li>
            <li> I always apply it to clean skin...</li>
            <li> During much research concerning menopause, I discovered that I would benefit greatly by changing to all natural and organic products.  </li>
            <li> This product qualifies for Free Super Saver Shipping</li>
            <li> No chemicals - just water and special salt.</li>
            <li> Nothing special regarding effect, but like the spray bottle feature.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to keep it in the fridge, I just cool it in there to harden it together a bit.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to keep it in the fridge, I just cool it in there to harden it together a bit.</li>
            <li> -- 3/3 of my friends who have tried this for 1-2 full days bought it themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One more trip to Whole Foods found me searching the shelves for an alternative.</li>
            <li> However, I read the reviews on this liquid product, some reviews noted the same result with salt rock, but good results from the liquid version.</li>
            <li> This is only a \\&quot;good product\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I love how its not irritating and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li> i have, let&#x27;s say, a odor and thai crystal has really given me more confidence while dancing or working out.</li>
            <li> It was good but would develop tiny chips about two or three weeks in.  </li>
            <li> I have had not a bad day.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li> It appears that my body adapted to it quickly and it became ineffective over time.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other deodorant for our family and we LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Then I got pregnant.</li>
            <li> I especially love that it is not tested on animals, is natural for my body as opposed to the typical poisonous antiperspirant and deodorant, is earth friendly and is vegan.  </li>
            <li> I still find this deodorant so much more effective than other kinds of deodorants.</li>
            <li> I normally use the crystal but this is so much better because it is a mist.</li>
            <li> You still sweat, which is normal and healthy, but there is NO ODOR...</li>
            <li> With me, I also noticed that it needs to be re-applied \\&quot;several times\\&quot; a day to \\&quot;clean skin\\&quot;, if I am having a high-activity day or if the weather is warm.  </li>
            <li> I am always open to more natural treatments, and if it&#x27;s fairly harmless, I figure it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I also really like that it is a spray formula so that I can easily apply it to my skin/feet.  </li>
            <li> looks and feels like misting water under your arms, but as long as I keep my meat intake low, it does an excellent job!</li>
            <li> but it sure does help a girl to stay dry and confident.</li>
            <li> This works great for me with just a few squirts.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are similar to my own recipe.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are similar to my own recipe.</li>
            <li> I am not a heavy sweater, so I can&#x27;t vouch for people looking for something heavy duty, but it works perfectly for me even when exercising all day.</li>
            <li> aside from the fact that it was eating away at my flesh, i learned that most deodorant also contained aluminum, which could be carcinogenic, so i decided to try some natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> I dont sweat alot or have a particular problem with a strong odor.</li>
            <li> My sister has some friends who use this spray on their face to prevent acne, and for 7 bucks, I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Currently I am experimenting with the thai spray and an arm &amp; hammer \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant and so far I&#x27;m happy with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that a basic saline solution would be an effective deodorant?</li>
            <li> Spray keeps you fresh longer and it&#x27;s easier.</li>
            <li> Take care if thinking of using this in more sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The trick to its effectiveness is to apply right out of the shower, before  you have a chance to sweat.  </li>
            <li> I pat dry for the first 30 minutes and then seem to do pretty good the rest of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also live a vegan lifestyle, so have always had to struggle with finding a hygiene product that works effectively for these body areas, yet is cruelty-free, vegan and natural.</li>
            <li> Great product as usual.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really effective and long</li>
            <li> I have tried several &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; that weren&#x27;t really so, and I have tried to make my own deodorant, which is what I do now (alternating with Schmidt&#x27;s deodorant sold here on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> (if you skip this step, it will be gritty), just till warm, mix it again really well</li>
            <li> (if you skip this step, it will be gritty), just till warm, mix it again really well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had the rock form (or any natural deodorant) work all day, or hold up to wearing a tight-in-the-pits shirt, but I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and am constantly amazed at how good it works.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you apply it to clean, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I decided to order another bottle and use it again, and it&#x27;s still awesome, works way better than my other natural deodorants (previously using tea tree oil deodorant).</li>
            <li> First I was just happy that it kept me from stinking sitting at home with a loose shirt and air conditioning, next I wore it out on a hot (and HUMID!)</li>
            <li> Last all day and more.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t feel anything (it dries in seconds with a bit of &amp;#34;fanning&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> 1 heaping tablespoon of baking soda and enough organic coconut oil to be able to mix it all together, but not too runny.</li>
            <li> 1 heaping tablespoon of baking soda and enough organic coconut oil to be able to mix it all together, but not too runny.</li>
            <li> I am a big sweat-er, and it takes many sprays of this with the addition of a scented body oil to stop the smell.</li>
            <li> This was summer time, and I was traveling, and at first I thought it was insect bites.</li>
            <li> Awesome thing, no more use simple deodorants with chemicals.</li>
            <li> It has no odor, and you can even put on deodorant on top of this stuff for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Funny, thought you&#x27;d like to be aware.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and will be ordering it for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I decided to apply it several more times.</li>
            <li> Safe enough for my kids.  </li>
            <li> She is always hot and sweaty.  </li>
            <li> A gal can only shower, so many times a day, but if I spray this stuff on all the &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34;, my 2-3 showers a day hold up teaching 2-5 group exercise classes and 3-6 personal training clients 6 days a week:-).  </li>
            <li> This works for me pretty darn well...</li>
            <li> THANKS THAI CRYSTAL!</li>
            <li> I like to spray it on immediately after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a particularly busy and vigorous day, or an important meeting, I would tend to choose something with a scent instead….but</li>
            <li> the smell gets into my house sometimes and all i do is spray coupme times in tbe rooms and the smell is gone, with no weird smell after.</li>
            <li> My underarms and feet tend to sweat a lot, and I am very conscious about feeling and smelling clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very economical because it lasts and lasts, and it has all natural ingredients, nothing wierd that will harm you.  </li>
            <li> The product works and its ALL NATURAL!!!!  </li>
            <li> I tried many other natural things but haven&#x27;t found anything better yet.</li>
            <li> The odor-protection lasted a good month, but then I noticed that the product became less and less effective.</li>
            <li> The pits still kind of smelled from the 2 hours I had worn it the other day</li>
            <li> My search is over for deodorant, I have found something that keeps me dry, clean, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It is not a perfect solution to my hygiene needs, but it is a good remedy until I can find something else that works better.  </li>
            <li> , this was not a product that was good enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the good reviews are coming from people who do not actual physical activity..  </li>
            <li> I use it along with an antiperspirant to ensure that I stay dry and smell great all day long.  </li>
            <li> I go the whole day in this hot weather this summer (June of 2011)</li>
            <li> He works in a bakery, which is very labor intensive while working in a hot environment...</li>
            <li> Dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> When i first got it i didn&#x27;t use it correctly and it didn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li> The Thai deodorant in general is fantastic and works very well.</li>
            <li> then you should certainly try this product.  </li>
            <li> Large bottle, but sprays quite a bit too.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, great stuff, I mix a little essential oils to give to some zing.</li>
            <li> Did not break me out and really mask the odor.</li>
            <li> It dries fast</li>
            <li> This really works and sometimes for two days.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a fragrance/chemical free deodorant, I would definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> I smelled it and did not believe that it really worked</li>
            <li> it is all natural and keeps me smelling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> No chemical smells or allergic reactions, and odor free 24 hours later.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t effect the amount you sweat, but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t smell much anymore.  </li>
            <li> This, however, really works.  </li>
            <li> and it really work.........</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat much and I work in a very chill office environment.</li>
            <li> Although the re-washing and re-applying is hum bug, my body odor would be \\&quot;much worse\\&quot; if I was using no product at all.  </li>
            <li> I hope this \\&quot;very honest\\&quot; and thorough review is helpful for you.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I buy at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> so I would not have to make the trip to Whole Foods to pick up a bottle but looks like I will have to after all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sweaty and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li> ** Experiment #1--I re-applied product several times during the day, light housework &amp; baking-----excellent results Experiment</li>
            <li> It really works, and the pump is so convenient for applying to feet.</li>
            <li> THAT was the point that stuck with me throughout the whole process.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, quality product.</li>
            <li> I sprayed four spritzes on each armpit for a week straight.</li>
            <li> Maybe this works for women who don&#x27;t sweat much for a guy like me who sweats a lot</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This has really helped with my hidratenitis supparativa.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even sweat that much and when I do, it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> I take anywhere from two to four fitness classes a week, and although they are geared towards middle-aged women and even elderly women, these classes do make you sweat and are an intense workout.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about his daily exposure to the chemicals, but nothing else would keep him odor free.  </li>
            <li> hahaha.  </li>
            <li> Really like the health aspect.</li>
            <li> I really like the spray version of this product because it&#x27;s easier to apply than the stick version.</li>
            <li> This works really well for me.  </li>
            <li> SO much easier and no scratching.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat so much that it&#x27;s an embarrassment.  </li>
            <li> I find that if I keep my underarms free from hair, the Thai deodorant will last 24 hrs or longer.  </li>
            <li> Wore the shirt the whole day, no stink.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using the stick for years, but this is much easier.</li>
            <li> No matter what clinical strenth deoderant/antiperspirant that I used, it never seemed to work the whole day.  </li>
            <li> day-at least in the 90&#x27;s if not 100&#x27;s-and was amazed that it worked just as good as my anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> and I live in an extremely hot climate.  </li>
            <li> I perspired heavily when I was younger, but now I barely, so this is the perfect deodorant for me -- all natural and no fragrance.</li>
            <li> Will recommend to anyone who wants to move to something natural that works!!</li>
            <li> fantastic product-eliminates odor-last a long time</li>
            <li> First of all, it works and it&#x27;s a natural option.  </li>
            <li> This has worked pretty well to help me move away from aluminum deodorants which have stained nearly all of my clothing.</li>
            <li> Be generous so enough salt reaches the skin and inhibits sweat, a full 5 or 6 pumps each arm.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great value too; my girlfriend and i both use the same bottle, and after at least 3 weeks we&#x27;ve touched maybe 1/4 of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, I spray it on daily and notice a big difference without it.</li>
            <li> So far this is working great for both my wife and I and no more breathing in aluminum from the aerosol deodorants or getting white streaks on my shirts from roll-on or gel deodorants</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> ; Well, let me tell you that by looking at the presentation and the package of the product it does not look as much (you can see it for yourselves in the displayed picture), it looks just like bottled water that you can buy at the local grocery store, and it is sad that sometimes the advertising is what makes a product valuable and popular more than its usefulness,</li>
            <li> I do, however, highly recommend the product otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I tried another organic brand that had really high reviews.</li>
            <li> Bacteria is always an issue here with the high humidity.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been wearing only \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, non-aluminum-based deodorants for many years, I decided to go back to Whole Foods and find another natural deodorant from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This whole experience along with a new born had me ready to give up on the crystal deodorant and all natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I use this because it a more natural alternative to other deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Tried lots of natural products that don&#x27;t work, but this does!!</li>
            <li> Then I did the ultimate test: hot day with a tight-pitted shirt, and, OH MY GOSH!</li>
            <li> I tried it again recently and discovered that it does work if used directly after a shower on clean skin (seven pumps under arms, and seven-nine pumps on feet and between toes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat a whole a lot (which is the point of using natural thing that doesn&#x27;t clog your pores) but will eliminate the smell.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the harsh aluminum antiperspirant/deodorants stain clothes, I have so many tops ruined from aluminum.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t even worry about travel--the bottle seems to be your standard issue squirt bottle, and it should be easy to pour into a similar travel-sized container.</li>
            <li> It works fine if you are just lounging around the house, but if you plan on being outside or sweating at all, I definitely recommend something stronger!</li>
            <li> i live in florida, and in the summer</li>
            <li> Well, for now I will start looking for a new deoderant, can&#x27;t walk around with smelly pits any longer.</li>
            <li> I live in the south and it gets humid over here.</li>
            <li> The salty solution (among the other safe ingredients in this) create a hyper-tonic environment; water rushes out of the bacteria by osmosis, killing the bacteria as water goes from low salt to a high salt concentration, it leaves the bacteria into the salt, therefore killing the bacteria...and the odor it</li>
            <li> , it works as promised and despite the $10.00 price tag, which may seem a little too much for a regular deodorant, it is actually very cheap because I have used it for 1 month now</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it if you had problems finding a natural product that works with your body chemistry to keep that BO at bay.</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant, first because it&#x27;s natural and second because it keeps me fresh a bit longer than regular deodorants.</li>
            <li> For a little over $7 this deodorant will last at least 3 months per bottle, which is quite impressive.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not greasy at all, it left no residue at all on my clothing, and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It went directly in the trash!</li>
            <li> so I can research the product properly and get as many reviews from different sources as possible</li>
            <li> Cant beat this all natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> I had started using men&#x27;s gel deodorant over past 2 years, still do and am pleased with the product.  .  </li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t consistent last time I tried.</li>
            <li> have purchased this product many times with no issues, but with my most recent purchase, something has gone wrong.</li>
            <li> All natural, so no issues there!</li>
            <li> This product didnt keep me dry during the days that it was hot!</li>
            <li> The longevity isn&#x27;t exactly there, and on a warm day it definitely fails.</li>
            <li> I certainly feel a big difference when I forget to put it on.</li>
            <li> This product works well for me, however, only if used a certain way.  </li>
            <li> About 2 years ago, I started breaking out in large red welts under my arms.</li>
            <li> This no-frills deodorant is exactly what it says it is--the packaging is simple and easy to use, the product lasts for, from my experience, around twelve average hours or so, and you&#x27;ll definitely sweat (it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant), but you won&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of crystal deo&#x27;s and have used them for years, but the spray mist is fantastic to use and lasts for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I have been going through menopause for several years now and have experienced all of the uncomfortable signs and symptoms that go along with this stage of my life.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only works on clean dry underarms.</li>
            <li> you still want to try the Thai mist, here is my old review (the recipe for the deodorant I make myself is at the bottom):</li>
            <li> enough?&lt;br /&gt;-possible skin irritation if you&#x27;re sensitive?</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised how well this worked.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a few natural deodorants before, and they always stained my clothes and never actually worked fore more then a couple hours.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had to go whole weekends without showering, and it was still working on the 3rd day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum for awhile.</li>
            <li> My mother was amazed at how well it worked and was relieved that she could stop using aluminum based products that are linked to cancer, clogged your pores, and kept your body from sweating which is a natural way of cooling the body and releasing toxins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna go through the whole bottle and will update my review as a final one as it finishes.</li>
            <li> And Thank you Lord Jesus for directing my path to yet another one of your natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does work, but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate my body odor even though I&#x27;ve followed the directions.  </li>
            <li> I gave away the stock-pile of my old brand.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work and have been surprised ever since.  </li>
            <li> Natural.  </li>
            <li> I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural that I could use and not worry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I still have so much of the tube left and have no idea what to do with it.</li>
            <li> My housemate who works in a natural grocery store got a full-size sample of this product and gave it to me.  </li>
            <li> I have a \\&quot;workout buddy\\&quot; who is a menopausal woman in her early 50s</li>
            <li> I like that there are no harsh chemicals or aluminum in it.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses prescription strength Antiperspirant Old Spice</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works nearly as well as the stick.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of natural deodorants</li>
            <li> I find I have to wash my skin with soap and water and reapply throughout the the day, but that&#x27;s what I do with any natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> If I find that I am in between hair removal, it will last a whole workday but after that I will have to reapply by evening.  </li>
            <li> But this alone really helps cut back on odor.</li>
            <li> Then i can scent the house any natural way i want</li>
            <li> love this stuff because this product is made up of a salty solution that actually kills odor causing bacteria, by creating a harsh environment that bacteria will not thrive in.</li>
            <li> I love it and no more rashes!</li>
            <li> After you get that all mixed together well enough that it isn&#x27;t gritty anymore, then cool in the fridge.</li>
            <li> After you get that all mixed together well enough that it isn&#x27;t gritty anymore, then cool in the fridge.</li>
            <li> This stuff does leave a very light white mark on black or other dark colored shirts though, but its easy to remove with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li> Things like eating more fruits and veggies and less processed items, starting a daily vitamin regime, etc.</li>
            <li> Earlier this year I started making small changes in my life that will, hopefully, one day lead to a greater impact.</li>
            <li> It is NOT pink, but clear.</li>
            <li> With the stick I could go for a LONG time without reapplying, but this spray, it seems to stop working twice as fast.</li>
            <li> I did perspire in the hot weather and during Zumba, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> It works better than any of the other products that I had previously used.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida, and my feet sweat constantly, even in sandals.  </li>
            <li> Apparently prevents foot odor, too!  </li>
            <li> Tried Toms of Maine and got major burns under my arms.</li>
            <li> I am really active and it has been really hot.</li>
            <li> Apparently it was the anti-perspirant, and not the sweat</li>
            <li> I realized that I must have finally developed an allergy to my deodorant, probably the perfume as I also have an intolerance to perfumes and essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to applying deodorant the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li> So I went back to the drawing board looking for a natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now I barely have one boil per year.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I do combine it with my natural deodorant stick for extra help.</li>
            <li> and it worked better than any other deodorants that I tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> Skeptical, I tried it and am amazed at how well the crystals work, about 18 months now, much better than my old deodorant ever did.</li>
            <li> It comes in other forms, most common the rock form</li>
            <li> I only barely get how this product works, but it still blew my mind.</li>
            <li> For awhile I went without any deodorant at all, but because I live in Austin, Texas, going without deodorant is not very feasible.</li>
            <li> let your body completely air dry, or speed up the process with a hair dryer or fan, before you put on clothes....</li>
            <li> lbs-I&#x27;m not a cute, thin thing that looks good in yoga clothes.  </li>
            <li> but I really wouldn&#x27;t trust it for all day, or if I was wearing a shirt that was tight under my pits.</li>
            <li> There is just no excuse to keep smearing those aluminum loaded deodorants under your arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used this deodorant for a long time, and then, it just stopped working for me.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I did not like to buy new clothes for fear that I&#x27;d ruin them just from perspiration.  </li>
            <li> I did try the roll on (which was messy &amp; wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again).I highly recommend the spray mist.  </li>
            <li> This of course only works if you have access to a restroom with single occupancy, so that you can wash in private.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time, only a couple times, for the reasons mentioned before.</li>
            <li> It also seems to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I began looking for a more natural deodorant after I realized I couldn&#x27;t even shave my armpits while using Secret deodorant because the stuff was just so thick and clogged up my skin.</li>
            <li> I have an entire lifetime of disappointment over female deodorant sticks--terribly strong scents, do not conquer body odors, and left gummy white stains on clothing.  </li>
            <li> Also, this product is going to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my clothes are far less stained than they were when I used Mitchum.  </li>
            <li> my skin is too sensitive for antiperspirants and ive read its not very good for you in general, so ive stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I begin to try several other deodorants that you find in local drug stores and none of them would work for me.</li>
            <li> The other thing to consider is that it will leave white residue stains if you spray it around furniture or a wooden vanity.    </li>
            <li> Due to shipping costs, I would only buy if it was in commonly local stores.</li>
            <li> I usually sweat through the Dove high aluminum content deodorant I used to use too.</li>
            <li> (we carpool together and will motivate each other, especially for body sculpt class--weightlifting in various positions, which we both hate but know is good for us).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I bought it a long time</li>
            <li> what - but provided absolutely no protection like the same brand and style</li>
            <li> I have used it for several years now and it goes on wet</li>
            <li> Even after working a long shift, there&#x27;s no hint of stinky armpit smell.</li>
            <li> For one, it doesn&#x27;t work as long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found other aluminum free products to be sloppy, greasy and not at all dry.</li>
            <li> until last year, i had been using the usual stuff like Old Spice, or any other male grooming brand...</li>
            <li> The block crystals are so much more efficient and less expensive than the mist.</li>
            <li> Using the product is a little tricky since it is essentially water and minerals mixed together.</li>
            <li> In other words, it does not work in taking away odor like a regular antiperspirant or deodorant if you apply it to sweaty skin, after exercising, nor does it work to take away foot odor if you are trying to apply it to sweaty feet after a day at work, etc.  </li>
            <li> My pits don&#x27;t even usually stink, but this shirt would extract any stink I did have, and this spray completely countered that!</li>
            <li> I have been using this spray for a very long time</li>
            <li> wait for it to dry after applying.</li>
            <li> I use it after every shower, I even use my blow dryer to quickly dry the pit area.  </li>
            <li> If you are not yet menopausal or are beyond menopause, then this product seems to keep you odor-free and relatively dry.  </li>
            <li> then dry off and spray a couple spritz into each armpit.</li>
            <li> I perspire pretty heavily &amp; have had to use clinical protection antiperspirant + deodorant in the past to reduce odor.</li>
            <li> After several applications my grundel began to smell like rotting cow balls.</li>
            <li> Every single day I noticed body odor by noon.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was simply an old bottle or</li>
            <li> I even use it on my feet, then dry them in front of a fan, and NO stinky shoes!</li>
            <li> The Thai spray is my only recommendation though, as previous &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brands hurt my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first, but living in the Dallas/Ft Worth area with our heat and humidity, one tends to get a little sweaty!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 other natural deodorants that either didn&#x27;t work or made my armpits raw.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s harder to get even/solid coverage, it&#x27;s hard to tell where the spray has hit, thus I&#x27;m often left with parts under my arm that didn&#x27;t get hit, and start smelling instantly.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> (I use a popsicle stick) and add a few drops of any essential oil that you like, and that doesn&#x27;t cause you skin irritation.</li>
            <li> (I use a popsicle stick) and add a few drops of any essential oil that you like, and that doesn&#x27;t cause you skin irritation.</li>
            <li> It irritates my skin and I am not very convinced of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wet the crystal before using it then</li>
            <li> Item exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the actual stones and they were just too messy.  </li>
            <li> Since the product worked so well in keeping odor away, I decided to spend the extra few pennies and try the spray.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that I hate the most is the sudden sweats followed by BO.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves it too (and anti prespirants were never strong enough for him-</li>
            <li> but it ran down my arms when i use it &amp; had to dry myself with a towel.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is after spraying it takes a while to dry.  </li>
            <li> She recommended the Thai Mist after having tried almost all of the other brands they carried.</li>
            <li> No more white stains on your clothing, doesn&#x27;t fight with perfumy smells...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering other products of this brand.</li>
            <li> Even my friend who has to reapply other deodorants 4 times a day says this stuff works for her</li>
            <li> People around me even started commenting on the odor, which was extremely embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it failed the &#x27;hot day&#x27; test.</li>
            <li> Hubby doesn&#x27;t like it as well probably because the spray can&#x27;t reach his skin due to all the hair</li>
            <li> The product label has changed, and ironically it does not offer the same protection it has in the past for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried other brands of deodorants w/ antipers.</li>
            <li> The spray does drip down your sides a little bit, but it&#x27;s just salt and water, so it doesn&#x27;t stain or dry sticky.</li>
            <li> Other deodorants wore off before the end of the day, and I would detect a slight odor by nightfall.</li>
            <li> When I first tried Thai Crystal Spray a few years ago, I was not impressed because it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  </li>
            <li> At the end of a long shift I do notice a small body odor smell</li>
            <li> You spray your underarms and it will run down the side of your body if you don&#x27;t use a towel.</li>
            <li> I like the spray vs. stone as I feel it gives even coverage and the water doesn&#x27;t drip down my arm like when I use the stone.</li>
            <li> But preventing &amp; slowing down the bacteria breaking down and causing odor is solved with just a little bit of this spray.</li>
            <li> I had tried the salt block previously, but prefer the ease of the spray mist.  </li>
            <li> : when I perspired through the Thai crystal deodorant, it had no odor (I wasn&#x27;t stinky, and there was less perspiration).  </li>
            <li> seriously, there is a detox that takes place ... and didn&#x27;t want to go back.</li>
            <li> I kept trying to only use my crystal deodorant, but I stunk so bad that, even with taking a shower first and thoroughly cleaning myself (baking soda and all), I managed to transfer my funk to the crystal deodorant and that poor deodorant was never the same.  </li>
            <li> but this is much less trouble and not as drippy as the rock version.</li>
            <li> I get a little canning jar, any little glass jar will do.</li>
            <li> I get a little canning jar, any little glass jar will do.</li>
            <li> I use about 6 sprays on a little cotton pad and rub it on my face twice a day.</li>
            <li> The smell (not in a bad way) under your arms begins to change and I no longer smelled of deodorant residue even when freshly bathed.</li>
            <li> You might experiment a few times, until you get the consistency you like.weating through it almost immediately, and it just had no effect on me anymore.  </li>
            <li> You might experiment a few times, until you get the consistency you like.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a heavy sweater it wont work well</li>
            <li> I noticed the bottle when I was visiting her a few months ago and after hearing her rave about it, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Was skeptical &amp; took my old brand of anti-prespirant along to work just in case the 1st time.</li>
            <li> I visited an out of town friend a few months ago, and forgot my deodorant.  </li>
            <li> maybe lasts 4 to 5 hours if you sweat heavily</li>
            <li> Another purchase wasted....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking it might have been because I was sick when I first started using the product</li>
            <li> I was doubtful that this product would be effective, afterall, it is merely a deoderant, not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Tried before to go natural and leave my coconut scented Secret behind.</li>
            <li> If you keep it in other sections of your fridge, the sprayer may freeze up and not work properly, as the temp is too cold for it.  </li>
            <li> it works and I have been using it now for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the case with everyone who uses it,</li>
            <li> Not sure where the disconnect it</li>
            <li> I had been seeing a dermatologist and after several failed treatments, she suggested Accutane.</li>
            <li> You probably shouldn&#x27;t have a faint smell at all times, ESPECIALLY after bathing, from the use of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A coworker</li>
            <li> I spray this on every morning, and no more sweaty, smelly feet.  </li>
            <li> It will run like crazy down your arms/chest especially if you use the maximum-recommended 6 squirts under each arm.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it less than a star!!  </li>
            <li> only downside is that it&#x27;s a little awkward applying it.</li>
            <li> I use to get a rash and itch so bad in my armpits due to regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> It may work for others, but this did absolutely nothing for me. :(</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time finding a stick deodorant that wasn&#x27;t too perfumey or sticky.  </li>
            <li> It can be hard to find a deodorant that works without all the chemicals.  </li>
            <li> i tried crystal rock deodorant, and that probably worked the least well of all for me, so i gave that up.  </li>
            <li> I started having underarm odor in my late 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 10 years now.  </li>
            <li> have this one shirt made from materials that just seem to instantly suck up any odor I have and it stinks by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I have been slowly changing what I use, wear, and eat.  </li>
            <li> if you know what I mean.....</li>
            <li> I mean a facesaver.  </li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews on the crystals and the fact that you had to wet it before use and its propensity to shatter when dropped made me believe that was a REALLY bad idea for my less that coordinated way of life.</li>
            <li> summertime sweat produces only a very faint odor by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I had serious doubts about this deodorant.</li>
            <li> This product seriously works.</li>
            <li> I found out the hard way (read that as a horrific looking itchy rash right in the crease of my armpit), was that I too was allergic to the aggravating substance.</li>
            <li> I say that slightly shocked, as I was convinced there was no way that was going to be possible.</li>
            <li> At least not in the summer time!</li>
            <li> boyfriend started using this soon after I did, and he had some pretty awful &#x27;pits.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my armpits smell worse.</li>
            <li> But I hate the result and will go back to the stick just as soon as this is gone, and I&#x27;ll never get another bottle of it!</li>
            <li> areas&#x27;...it can be a ting irritating.</li>
            <li> but it would leave a nasty stiff white residue on all his shirts!  </li>
            <li> I sweat very badly, and nothing natural has worked to cover the smell and work as an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> After a day or longer, I do begin to smell, but NEVER as bad as I used to smell with any other underarm product.</li>
            <li> and if anything it made my odor WORSE!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s like not working when I&#x27;m home and just chilling and not doing anything.</li>
            <li> Leaving me totally uncomfortable and embarrassed to be in the company of anyone.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant and skeptical.</li>
            <li> i wont give 5 stars for mediocre products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am unable to use products with coconut oil</li>
            <li> Some people may have tried the crystal deodorant stone in the past, I know I have, and I hated it.  </li>
            <li> I can now wear my tops 2 to 3 times without odor, and wash them because they&#x27;re dirty, not because they have B.O.</li>
            <li> This product changes during cold months.  </li>
            <li> The so-called &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; ones seemed to leave a weird scent (?!)</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Eventually, I stank so bad it was like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any deodorant at all.</li>
            <li> It used to be really bad</li>
            <li> After giving birth and going through all sorts of hormonal changes I stunk really bad.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed of this product.</li>
            <li> So I used her salt rock, and was quickly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> i am disappointed in the faulty sprayer, of course</li>
            <li> Some days this product seems like it&#x27;s working, some days I hate to have bought it at all.</li>
            <li> The salt crystallized at base of bottle.</li>
            <li> Had I known about this product sooner I would have given up that chemical crap years ago.</li>
            <li> Note, this is not an antiperspirant (which is bad for you anyway), so you&#x27;ll still sweat, but it won&#x27;t stink!</li>
            <li> Tried Arm and Hammer and hated the overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about nasty ingredients.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it! so easy to put on. Did not break me out and really mask the odor. Although the whitening part hasn&#x27;t taken effect yet as it has only been a month. But i love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this spray for a very long time and I do sweat a LOT. It doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat a whole a lot (which is the point of using natural thing that doesn&#x27;t clog your pores) but will eliminate the smell. I certainly feel a big difference when I forget to put it on. I tried many other natural things but haven&#x27;t found anything better yet.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  No harmful ingredients!  Works perfectly! Very good service from this company!</li>
            <li> Our favorite, a family staple at this point.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Last all day and more.  Shipping was quick.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this stuff eons ago!  I have always had a hard time finding a stick deodorant that wasn&#x27;t too perfumey or sticky.  The so-called &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; ones seemed to leave a weird scent (?!) on my clothes that sometimes didn&#x27;t come out in the wash.  But this salt spray is a miracle!  You don&#x27;t feel anything (it dries in seconds with a bit of &amp;#34;fanning&amp;#34;) you smell nothing (even if you sweat a bit) and there&#x27;s no smell on your clothes.  I can get away with wearing most tops twice now before they go in the laundry hamper.  I had tried the salt block previously, but prefer the ease of the spray mist.  A friend of mine told me about it because he uses it on his feet before running.  Apparently prevents foot odor, too!  I have a desk job, so can&#x27;t speak to sweat prevention when exercising.  But even if you sweat, you will not smell a thing!</li>
            <li> I have tried several &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; that weren&#x27;t really so, and I have tried to make my own deodorant, which is what I do now (alternating with Schmidt&#x27;s deodorant sold here on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;If you still want to try the Thai mist, here is my old review (the recipe for the deodorant I make myself is at the bottom): Thai crystal deodorant mist: Ingredients: mineral salts and purified water.  It is aluminum free, non staining (true!), no alcohol, etc.  You can spray it on your feet, under your arms.. The trick to its effectiveness is to apply right out of the shower, before  you have a chance to sweat.  Now, I tested it in 100 plus degree weather, through Zumba, and here&#x27;s how it worked... I did perspire in the hot weather and during Zumba, but that&#x27;s expected. This is a deodorant, not an anti perspirant. I usually sweat through the Dove high aluminum content deodorant I used to use too. I had to reapply once during the day. Also had to do that with Dove deodorant.  Here is the difference: when I perspired through the Thai crystal deodorant, it had no odor (I wasn&#x27;t stinky, and there was less perspiration).  With Dove deodorant, I would be stinky and have more perspiration come through (sounds lovely, I know).  Dove also leaves streaks on my clothes, and the crystal deodorant doesn&#x27;t.  During regular indoor activities, I did not have a problem at all with perspiration or odor (with the Thai crystal deodorant mist).  Some people may have tried the crystal deodorant stone in the past, I know I have, and I hated it.  The Thai crystal mist is NOT the same thing.  First of all, it works and it&#x27;s a natural option.  It&#x27;s aluminum free (some crystal deodorants are not).  It dries fast, it&#x27;s not greasy at all, it left no residue at all on my clothing, and it works pretty well. There is just no excuse to keep smearing those aluminum loaded deodorants under your arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used this deodorant for a long time, and then, it just stopped working for me.  I started sweating through it almost immediately, and it just had no effect on me anymore.  I have switched to Schmidt&#x27;s Cedarwood and Juniper, and have been happy with it for a very long time, alternating it with one I make myself. I love the natural scent, it&#x27;s not too manly or feminine, its very nuetral but wonderful. They do make five different scents, if you want something different.  The ingredients are similar to my own recipe. I get a little canning jar, any little glass jar will do. I mix just under 1/2 cup of arrowroot powder, 1 heaping tablespoon of baking soda and enough organic coconut oil to be able to mix it all together, but not too runny. Then I microwave it (if you skip this step, it will be gritty), just till warm, mix it again really well (I use a popsicle stick) and add a few drops of any essential oil that you like, and that doesn&#x27;t cause you skin irritation. I am currently using lemongrass essential oil in mine, but my next one will be a mix of cedarwood and grapefruit! After you get that all mixed together well enough that it isn&#x27;t gritty anymore, then cool in the fridge. You don&#x27;t have to keep it in the fridge, I just cool it in there to harden it together a bit. You might experiment a few times, until you get the consistency you like.weating through it almost immediately, and it just had no effect on me anymore.

            <li> This stuff is amazing and probably the best personal hygiene product purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. I am not a heavy sweater, so I can&#x27;t vouch for people looking for something heavy duty, but it works perfectly for me even when exercising all day. Buy this if staining/odor of most deodorants bother you. Can&#x27;t recommend enough -- 3/3 of my friends who have tried this for 1-2 full days bought it themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t stain!!&lt;br /&gt;-no odor!! (can wear cologne without synthetic deodorant scents mixing)&lt;br /&gt;-works all day&lt;br /&gt;-no irritation&lt;br /&gt;-bottle lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-maybe if you&#x27;re a heavy sweater it wont work well enough?&lt;br /&gt;-possible skin irritation if you&#x27;re sensitive?</li>
            <li> This really works and sometimes for two days.  I love it and no more rashes!</li>
            <li> This product might be good, but for others, not for me. It irritates my skin and I am not very convinced of its effectiveness. I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time, only a couple times, for the reasons mentioned before. I am disappointed of this product.</li>
            <li> I use this because it a more natural alternative to other deodorants.  It&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant... so that&#x27;s something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised how well this worked. I had my doubts when I bought it a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a fragrance/chemical free deodorant, I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little awkward applying it. You spray your underarms and it will run down the side of your body if you don&#x27;t use a towel.</li>
            <li> Works great, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a few natural deodorants before, and they always stained my clothes and never actually worked fore more then a couple hours. This stuff worked way better. It doesn&#x27;t stop me from sweating since its not an antiperspirant, but it stopped me from having BO all day. This stuff does leave a very light white mark on black or other dark colored shirts though, but its easy to remove with a damp cloth. This is definitely the best natural deodorant ive tried and i&#x27;ll probably buy it again. my skin is too sensitive for antiperspirants and ive read its not very good for you in general, so ive stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I highly recommend it. No chemicals - just water and special salt. It works great. It comes in other forms, most common the rock form but this is much less trouble and not as drippy as the rock version. The spray version is the best way to administer this product and it really works.</li>
            <li> Liquad Spray Deodrant works for me.  It can be hard to find a deodorant that works without all the chemicals.  This works great for me with just a few squirts.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This has worked pretty well to help me move away from aluminum deodorants which have stained nearly all of my clothing. The longevity isn&#x27;t exactly there, and on a warm day it definitely fails. I can&#x27;t recommend this for extended use, but for my current purposes it&#x27;s working well. It&#x27;s definitely prevented itching and rashes as I try to move away from the aluminum based products.</li>
            <li> Every since I started wearing deodorant I have always used the brand Secert. Well a couple years ago Secert stated to tell eveyone my secert ( I can sometimes get funky) &#x3D;)! I begin to try several other deodorants that you find in local drug stores and none of them would work for me. One day I was over my aunts house, my aunt was in remission from breast cancer and I saw this deodorant on her sink and asked her what was that and she explained to me what it was. I smelled it and did not believe that it really worked but she convinced me to try it anyway. I tried it and to my suprise it works and I have been using it now for the past 5 years. I told my bother about it because he would get these monstor size boils under his arms 5 years later he hasn&#x27;t had one since..... All around I must say this stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> love it as very sensitive to most deoderants</li>
            <li> this is the only deodorant i use anymore! it is all natural and keeps me smelling fresh all day.  i live in florida, and in the summer i know i sweat like a beast, but this stuff makes me not a stinky beast. :)</li>
            <li> I am a big sweat-er, and it takes many sprays of this with the addition of a scented body oil to stop the smell. It is drippy with a lot of sprays, and I had to tissue off the run off. It works fine if you are just lounging around the house, but if you plan on being outside or sweating at all, I definitely recommend something stronger!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 other natural deodorants that either didn&#x27;t work or made my armpits raw. This stuff is amazing and lasts all day. I would highly recommend it if you had problems finding a natural product that works with your body chemistry to keep that BO at bay.</li>
            <li> i have been using this stuff for a couple months now, and am extremely impressed by how well it works! until last year, i had been using the usual stuff like Old Spice, or any other male grooming brand... and then my armpit skin started to peel and burn like i was rubbing corrosive substances on it. it was then that i decided i should PROBABLY use something else...  aside from the fact that it was eating away at my flesh, i learned that most deodorant also contained aluminum, which could be carcinogenic, so i decided to try some natural deodorants. Tom&#x27;s of Maine (lemongrass variety) also made my armpits burn LIKE FIRE (your mileage may vary), though not peel. then i tried Nature&#x27;s Gate (tea tree oil and lichen); it was mild on my skin, but wasn&#x27;t very effective. i tried crystal rock deodorant, and that probably worked the least well of all for me, so i gave that up.  finally, i&#x27;ve found this stuff. i love that it&#x27;s a spray; so quick and easy to put on, coats evenly. haha. it&#x27;s more effective than some of the heavy-duty chemical garbage that i used to use. i&#x27;ve had to go whole weekends without showering, and it was still working on the 3rd day. summertime sweat produces only a very faint odor by the end of the day. my shirts all smell quite nice and i don&#x27;t have to wash them until i&#x27;ve worn them 3 or 4 times. it&#x27;s amazing how well this works. it&#x27;s a great value too; my girlfriend and i both use the same bottle, and after at least 3 weeks we&#x27;ve touched maybe 1/4 of the bottle.  UPDATE 7/16/2015: I stopped using this for a while, and forgot how awesome it was until I stumbled across this old review on my profile. I decided to order another bottle and use it again, and it&#x27;s still awesome, works way better than my other natural deodorants (previously using tea tree oil deodorant).</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I am a fan of crystal deo&#x27;s and have used them for years, but the spray mist is fantastic to use and lasts for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum for awhile. Tried Toms of Maine and got major burns under my arms. Tried Arm and Hammer and hated the overpowering smell. My mother of all people went to her local health food and vitamin store and asked a clerk for a recommendation. She recommended the Thai Mist after having tried almost all of the other brands they carried. My mother was amazed at how well it worked and was relieved that she could stop using aluminum based products that are linked to cancer, clogged your pores, and kept your body from sweating which is a natural way of cooling the body and releasing toxins. I noticed the bottle when I was visiting her a few months ago and after hearing her rave about it, I decided to give it a try. Wow, it works great. No chemical smells or allergic reactions, and odor free 24 hours later. Great stuff. Trying to get my wife to start using it, though she is concerned about sweat stains even though I&#x27;ve told her the stains are from the chemicals in her a/p and not from the sweat. Hopefully she too will start using it soon. I want to try their deodorant stone too as that would be excellent from traveling and for trips to the gym. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I dont stink anymore and i&#x27;m happy! I use to get a rash and itch so bad in my armpits due to regular deodorant. My rash is gone, and the product works.</li>
            <li> I started using this after abandoning the use of aluminum-based antiperspirants. The product doesn&#x27;t effect the amount you sweat, but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to. I&#x27;ve always perspired a great deal, and I continued to do so when using this, but there was no odor or stink.    Using the product is a little tricky since it is essentially water and minerals mixed together. It will run like crazy down your arms/chest especially if you use the maximum-recommended 6 squirts under each arm. The other thing to consider is that it will leave white residue stains if you spray it around furniture or a wooden vanity.    The odor-protection lasted a good month, but then I noticed that the product became less and less effective. Eventually, I stank so bad it was like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any deodorant at all. I had to quit using it out of sheer embarrassment. It appears that my body adapted to it quickly and it became ineffective over time. Not sure if this is the case with everyone who uses it, but it&#x27;s something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful that this product would be effective, afterall, it is merely a deoderant, not an antiperspirant. It looks like water and has no odor. My body odor problems have been solved. I haven&#x27;t used my regular antiperspirant since I got this. Works well in the pits, but I also spray on my feet. I will definitely purchase this again. It dries without leaving any residue. There is no transfer or white marks left on my clothes, either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alcohol free and dries like a mist of water would. Be generous so enough salt reaches the skin and inhibits sweat, a full 5 or 6 pumps each arm. I&#x27;ve found other aluminum free products to be sloppy, greasy and not at all dry.</li>
            <li> This product works.  It is easy to spray on twice after a shower.  I go the whole day in this hot weather this summer (June of 2011) and I don&#x27;t smell much anymore.  Previously, I did not like to buy new clothes for fear that I&#x27;d ruin them just from perspiration.  Now, I can buy nice new clothes!  And when I do my laundry the clothes are clean even in the underarm area.  I like how it is unscented and how nobody can tell that I&#x27;m wearing deoderant.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;rock\\&quot; version of the crystal does not work for me at all.  This, however, really works.  I sweat a lot, so use about twice the recommended amount, followed by either Weleda Rose deodorant spray or Aubrey Organics Calendula deodorant spray.  However, this spray also works fine on its own.  I am quite impressed with its efficacy, hence this review.  If you are allergic to regular drugstore brand deodorants then you should certainly try this product.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my clothes are far less stained than they were when I used Mitchum.  Apparently it was the anti-perspirant, and not the sweat, that was ruining my clothes!</li>
            <li> I only use this deodorant it has no chemicals no scent and no aluminum  and you can also use it on stinky feet and it really work.........</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it less than a star!!  I don&#x27;t know what this stuff is but it doesn&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I don&#x27;t know how it could possibly work for anyone.  I started having underarm odor in my late 20&#x27;s.  Nothing works, I&#x27;ve found a product called Dr Mist that is supposed to be guaranteed to work that I might try.  I tried using this stuff for a week or so and if anything it made my odor WORSE!  It went directly in the trash!</li>
            <li> I perspire pretty heavily &amp; have had to use clinical protection antiperspirant + deodorant in the past to reduce odor. I&#x27;ve used the Crystal rock stuff before &amp; it didn&#x27;t work well enough. This Thai spray is great, though. It prevents most underarm odor. I use body spray over it &amp; sometimes need to apply a 2nd time in the day, but I definitely prefer it to the regular stuff &amp; I know it is healthier.</li>
            <li> Some days this product works for me and some days it just doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t sweat much and I work in a very chill office environment. Some days this product seems like it&#x27;s working, some days I hate to have bought it at all. I always apply it to clean skin...Not sure where the disconnect it but it&#x27;s like not working when I&#x27;m home and just chilling and not doing anything. I&#x27;m gonna go through the whole bottle and will update my review as a final one as it finishes.</li>
            <li> I have been going through menopause for several years now and have experienced all of the uncomfortable signs and symptoms that go along with this stage of my life.  The one thing that I hate the most is the sudden sweats followed by BO.  I was using degree and it worked better than any other deodorants that I tried in the past.  But sometimes the deodorant would break.....if you know what I mean.....Leaving me totally uncomfortable and embarrassed to be in the company of anyone.  During much research concerning menopause, I discovered that I would benefit greatly by changing to all natural and organic products.  I have been slowly changing what I use, wear, and eat.  My search is over for deodorant, I have found something that keeps me dry, clean, and comfortable.  It even continues to work after a 2 hour workout.  Hallelujah! And Thank you Lord Jesus for directing my path to yet another one of your natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeee...aaah!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference at all</li>
            <li> came to me today with unsealed ends !  no tape on either side!  cant speak for product, only about who sent it!</li>
            <li> This product works well for me, however, only if used a certain way.  My underarms and feet tend to sweat a lot, and I am very conscious about feeling and smelling clean.  I also live a vegan lifestyle, so have always had to struggle with finding a hygiene product that works effectively for these body areas, yet is cruelty-free, vegan and natural. When I first tried Thai Crystal Spray a few years ago, I was not impressed because it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  I tried it again recently and discovered that it does work if used directly after a shower on clean skin (seven pumps under arms, and seven-nine pumps on feet and between toes -be sure shoes are clean as well).  In other words, it does not work in taking away odor like a regular antiperspirant or deodorant if you apply it to sweaty skin, after exercising, nor does it work to take away foot odor if you are trying to apply it to sweaty feet after a day at work, etc.  With me, I also noticed that it needs to be re-applied \\&quot;several times\\&quot; a day to \\&quot;clean skin\\&quot;, if I am having a high-activity day or if the weather is warm.  This requires me to wash my underarms and feet with soap, and reapply the seven-nine pumps.  Again, my chosen activity or the weather temperature determines how often I need to re-wash and re-apply (reapplying to sweaty skin does not work!).  I like this product a lot, and even purchased a second bottle.  I especially love that it is not tested on animals, is natural for my body as opposed to the typical poisonous antiperspirant and deodorant, is earth friendly and is vegan.  I also really like that it is a spray formula so that I can easily apply it to my skin/feet.  It is not a perfect solution to my hygiene needs, but it is a good remedy until I can find something else that works better.  My final comments are these: 1.) Re-applying it at work is more of a challenge because in order for it to work for me, I need to re-wash my under arms/feet with soap and water and follow-up with a fresh doseof spray.  This of course only works if you have access to a restroom with single occupancy, so that you can wash in private.  2.) Spray the inside of your shoes too, to help keep foot odor at bay.  3.) Although the re-washing and re-applying is hum bug, my body odor would be \\&quot;much worse\\&quot; if I was using no product at all.  4.) I keep a bottle of this spray in the vegetable crisper section of my fridge.  This keeps the preservative-free, water-based solution fresh, and the cool spray feels very good on a hot day.  If you keep it in other sections of your fridge, the sprayer may freeze up and not work properly, as the temp is too cold for it.  If storing it at work or in your bag, try to keep it out of the sun, and in a comfortable room temperature (again, best if kept in the fridge).  5.) This product qualifies for Free Super Saver Shipping so I was very pleased about that.  I hope this \\&quot;very honest\\&quot; and thorough review is helpful for you.  Take care.

            <li> I wanted this to work..but it didnt.At least not in the summer time! I dont sweat alot or have a particular problem with a strong odor. This product didnt keep me dry during the days that it was hot!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I sweat very badly, and nothing natural has worked to cover the smell and work as an antiperspirant. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product works; I do not tend to rush into buying anything because of someone&#x27;s recommendation and I would rather wait some time so I can research the product properly and get as many reviews from different sources as possible; Well, let me tell you that by looking at the presentation and the package of the product it does not look as much (you can see it for yourselves in the displayed picture), it looks just like bottled water that you can buy at the local grocery store, and it is sad that sometimes the advertising is what makes a product valuable and popular more than its usefulness, but in this case I can honestly tell you that this item made a believer out of me, it works as promised and despite the $10.00 price tag, which may seem a little too much for a regular deodorant, it is actually very cheap because I have used it for 1 month now and I have only used 1 quarter of the bottle, so you do the math and I leave the decision to you; It&#x27;s totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how quickly this product was shipped to me.  It does work, but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate my body odor even though I&#x27;ve followed the directions.  I&#x27;m thinking it might have been because I was sick when I first started using the product</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was simply an old bottle or what - but provided absolutely no protection like the same brand and style I buy at Whole Foods.  I bought through Amazon so I would not have to make the trip to Whole Foods to pick up a bottle but looks like I will have to after all.  I do, however, highly recommend the product otherwise.  I have used it for many years.  Stick deodorant causes my underarms to itch - this product does not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Thai crystal deodorant for almost 2 yrs and it&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, hands down.  When using regular deodorant, I still smelled, but not with Thai.  I can go for 3 to 4 days without rewashing my underarms, (because they don&#x27;t smell) and just apply the Thai and theres never any odor.  I can now wear my tops 2 to 3 times without odor, and wash them because they&#x27;re dirty, not because they have B.O. I&#x27;ve only tried the spray, but I think I&#x27;ll order a stone and try it out as an alternative, it would be easier to travel with.  It&#x27;s very economical because it lasts and lasts, and it has all natural ingredients, nothing wierd that will harm you.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago, I started breaking out in large red welts under my arms. This was summer time, and I was traveling, and at first I thought it was insect bites. After suffering for almost a month, I decided to stop wearing my deodorant, and within a couple of days the welts subsided. I realized that I must have finally developed an allergy to my deodorant, probably the perfume as I also have an intolerance to perfumes and essential oils. Since I have been wearing only \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, non-aluminum-based deodorants for many years, I decided to go back to Whole Foods and find another natural deodorant from another manufacturer. Soon I had welts again! For awhile I went without any deodorant at all, but because I live in Austin, Texas, going without deodorant is not very feasible. One more trip to Whole Foods found me searching the shelves for an alternative. Finally an employee approached me and when I explained the problem, she reached for the Thai crystal mist. Skeptical, I tried it and am amazed at how well the crystals work, about 18 months now, much better than my old deodorant ever did. The ingredients&#x27; list is simple, crystals and ionized water, so for people like me, this is perfect. I endorse this product unreservedly.&lt;br /&gt;Additional comments added 3/2/2013: \\&quot;I have since moved on to using the crystals in block form, and no longer use the mist. The block crystals are so much more efficient and less expensive than the mist. I still find this deodorant so much more effective than other kinds of deodorants. Other deodorants wore off before the end of the day, and I would detect a slight odor by nightfall. I never have that experience with the crystals.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product truly DOES WORK. Was skeptical &amp; took my old brand of anti-prespirant along to work just in case the 1st time. Never needed it &amp; never went back. I gave away the stock-pile of my old brand. Stops bacteria before it starts, thus no smell. The best thing is that it works fantastic if you had foot odor. What a God-send Thai spray mist is. I did try the roll on (which was messy &amp; wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again).I highly recommend the spray mist.  No more white stains on your clothing, doesn&#x27;t fight with perfumy smells... I&#x27;ve used it for years &amp; would never go back to regular deoderants. My husband loves it too (and anti prespirants were never strong enough for him- THIS IS!)  Believe it&#x27;s environmentally friendly too.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.  A friend of mine recommended this to me and I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work and have been surprised ever since.  I&#x27;m really sweaty and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Does not work (and I&#x27;ve given it several chances). I&#x27;m back to applying deodorant the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li> Awesome thing, no more use simple deodorants with chemicals.</li>
            <li> A lot easier to use than the stone &amp; with the same benefits. Cant beat this all natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> I keep buying this stuff from different retails over the years as the price continues to drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not cover up odor, so its NOT a deodorant, and it also does not contain aluminum to block pores, so its NOT a anti-antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff because this product is made up of a salty solution that actually kills odor causing bacteria, by creating a harsh environment that bacteria will not thrive in. It has no odor, and you can even put on deodorant on top of this stuff for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works:&lt;br /&gt;Salt dehydrates bacteria through diffusion. The salty solution (among the other safe ingredients in this) create a hyper-tonic environment; water rushes out of the bacteria by osmosis, killing the bacteria as water goes from low salt to a high salt concentration, it leaves the bacteria into the salt, therefore killing the bacteria...and the odor it causes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this stuff for years, stink free. Make sure to apply liberally and all around your armpit ( i use 3-5 sprays)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a \\&quot;sweat-er,\\&quot; trust me.  Body odor has always been a chore to mitigate in my life.  It was not until I found this product that I can honestly say that I am odor-free.  Easy to use.  Natural.  Most importantly, the most effective deodorant that I have ever purchased.  I will be a life-long customer!</li>
            <li> Finally a deodorant that works!</li>
            <li> It works well on odor but it ran down my arms when i use it &amp; had to dry myself with a towel.  I went back to the solid crystal which i like a lot.</li>
            <li> I normally use the crystal but this is so much better because it is a mist. I don&#x27;t have to wet the crystal before using it then wait for it to dry after applying. I just spray and it dries in seconds and I am ready to go. It does not leave deoderant stains on your clothing as well</li>
            <li> I had serious doubts about this deodorant. However, there were so many good reviews that I thought I&#x27;d take a chance. Cannot believe the results!! it works exceptionally well! After a day or longer, I do begin to smell, but NEVER as bad as I used to smell with any other underarm product. Go ahead, take a chance and buy some. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> works well and has no scent. great price!</li>
            <li> Storyline:  I had started using men&#x27;s gel deodorant over past 2 years, still do and am pleased with the product.  .  I have an entire lifetime of disappointment over female deodorant sticks--terribly strong scents, do not conquer body odors, and left gummy white stains on clothing.  I discoverd my boyfriend&#x27;s gel deodorant, and have been happy since. However, I am a woman, and always seeking a more feminine choice. I visited an out of town friend a few months ago, and forgot my deodorant.  So I used her salt rock, and was quickly disappointed.  I stunk within hours.  However, I read the reviews on this liquid product, some reviews noted the same result with salt rock, but good results from the liquid version. **Over the Christmas week, I had solely used the Thai spray--no odors from spray nor my underarm, no sensitivity** Experiment #1--I re-applied product several times during the day, light housework &amp; baking-----excellent results Experiment #2--Only one application with my return to work-----good results Experiment #3--Workout/YardWork with hearty sweat, armpit rubbing------short term results Experiment #4--It&#x27;s winter here in Texas, need attempt #1, #2, and #3 during extended Texas heat------- did not work for me  Update 12/2014: I like the product, no burning sensation. I use after shower/ before bed treatment. In morning, apply gel deodorant, and have no odor issues at all. The Thai spray is my only recommendation though, as previous &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brands hurt my skin.  The spray is liquid, so some time needed for drying. No scent in product is nice.  I also use this product during weekends when in and out of pools and simple home chores.  Update April 2015: This product changes during cold months.  The salt crystallized at base of bottle. When it warms, they dissolve again. So, during winter months, the push nozzle was inoperable as product was uncooperative. And now that spring is on us, the nozzle works just fine. Funny, thought you&#x27;d like to be aware.</li>
            <li> It really works, and the pump is so convenient for applying to feet.</li>
            <li> I only barely get how this product works, but it still blew my mind. I tried it the first time midday with 90+ degree temps and 50% humidity with my underarms anything but pleasant. 6 sprays each side and 5 minutes later I smell nothing! Seriously; no perfume or odor of any kind. It was like my pits had just been sterilized! Also, this product is going to last a very long time. No fear of unintentional overuse, or breakage, like with a bar. For a little over $7 this deodorant will last at least 3 months per bottle, which is quite impressive.</li>
            <li> Works for acne, believe it or not.  I had been seeing a dermatologist and after several failed treatments, she suggested Accutane. I considered it, but didn&#x27;t want to deal with the potential side effects. My sister has some friends who use this spray on their face to prevent acne, and for 7 bucks, I figured it was worth a try. I use about 6 sprays on a little cotton pad and rub it on my face twice a day. I saw results after about a month, and 9 months later, I&#x27;m still using it. And for those who think it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; people who avoid western medicine...I am a health care provider. I am always open to more natural treatments, and if it&#x27;s fairly harmless, I figure it&#x27;s worth a try. This is my second bottle and I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends as well.</li>
            <li> Earlier this year I started making small changes in my life that will, hopefully, one day lead to a greater impact. Things like eating more fruits and veggies and less processed items, starting a daily vitamin regime, etc. The latest in that journey has been to switch from the mainstream deodorant that I have used since puberty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confession - I didn&#x27;t start out with the Thai Crystal Mist. I tried another organic brand that had really high reviews. What I brushed off in those reviews, however, was the regular mention of allergic reactions brought on either by the content of baking soda used or the use of essential oils. I found out the hard way (read that as a horrific looking itchy rash right in the crease of my armpit), was that I too was allergic to the aggravating substance. So I went back to the drawing board looking for a natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I had detoxed from the use of a product with metals in it ... seriously, there is a detox that takes place ... and didn&#x27;t want to go back. The smell (not in a bad way) under your arms begins to change and I no longer smelled of deodorant residue even when freshly bathed. THAT was the point that stuck with me throughout the whole process. You probably shouldn&#x27;t have a faint smell at all times, ESPECIALLY after bathing, from the use of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A coworker recounted using the pulverized crystal while growing up in the Philippines. I read all of the reviews on the crystals and the fact that you had to wet it before use and its propensity to shatter when dropped made me believe that was a REALLY bad idea for my less that coordinated way of life. I decided the product that already had it pulverized with the water was probably a better option. I am SO glad that I switched. This product seriously works. I say that slightly shocked, as I was convinced there was no way that was going to be possible. Even after a day of hiking there is still no odor. If you are on the fence, I say try it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. Tried before to go natural and leave my coconut scented Secret behind. Tom&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t consistent last time I tried. Perhaps I didn&#x27;t give it enough time. I also had to reapply Tom&#x27;s several times and felt nervous all day!&lt;br /&gt;Sprayed 3-4 sprays of this Liquid Mist each side, Cleaning in 90 degree weather, then went swimming 2 hrs. Still no smell that night or next morning. I am really active and it has been really hot. Hopefully it will continue to work! I wanted something natural that I could use and not worry throughout the day. I&#x27;m only on day 2.. Will update if change.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for me. I have used it for several years now and it goes on wet but I love that it controls bacteria without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic product. I absolutely love it and will be ordering it for the foreseeable future. I&#x27;m considering other products of this brand.</li>
            <li> Trying to avoid aluminum.  Works well for me on all but the hottest days of summer.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other deodorant for our family and we LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, quality product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My husband talked me into purchasing this product. I was hesitant and skeptical. I actually scoffed at him. He wanted me to buy it because after 12 hours on my feet at the hospital I come home and stink up the room when taking off my shoes! I have used odor eaters, lotions, foot creams, sprays, etc. and nothing helped with the odor. Until my husband talked me into Thai Liquid Spray Mist deodorant. I spray to sprays on my feet before work and when I get home my feet do not have odor. I never pulled my feet to my nose to smell, but I was impressed that my feet did not reek after removing my shoes. I am now a believer in this product.</li>
            <li> This works.  I have used it for years.  Good competitive price.  It is NOT pink, but clear. Arrived in a timely manner and in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> This deodorant spray is amazing!! I began looking for a more natural deodorant after I realized I couldn&#x27;t even shave my armpits while using Secret deodorant because the stuff was just so thick and clogged up my skin. No way is that healthy! My coworker gave me a bottle of this stuff, and it works like a dream. Even my friend who has to reapply other deodorants 4 times a day says this stuff works for her and she only sprays it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray about 4 sprays in each armpit in the morning before I get dressed. The spray does drip down your sides a little bit, but it&#x27;s just salt and water, so it doesn&#x27;t stain or dry sticky. It lasts me through my work day and even my evening workout. Note, this is not an antiperspirant (which is bad for you anyway), so you&#x27;ll still sweat, but it won&#x27;t stink!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Product same as we buy in stores and at a great price.</li>
            <li> If you are problem sweater...it&#x27;s ok....maybe lasts 4 to 5 hours if you sweat heavily</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I tried crystal, thai sticks, and now this thai spray on. I sprayed four spritzes on each armpit for a week straight. Every single day I noticed body odor by noon. People around me even started commenting on the odor, which was extremely embarrassing. Maybe this works for women who don&#x27;t sweat much for a guy like me who sweats a lot, this was not a product that was good enough for daily use. I still have so much of the tube left and have no idea what to do with it. Another purchase wasted....</li>
            <li> This stuff made my armpits smell worse. After several applications my grundel began to smell like rotting cow balls. I decided to apply it several more times. One morning i woke up to a sworm of flies vacationing in my nether region.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s a spray. Unfortunately it failed the &#x27;hot day&#x27; test. By the evening, I smelled.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it gets away from using more toxic types of deodorants.  Its basically mineral salts.  Safe enough for my kids.  The only draw back is when it is sprayed it runs alittle, but we still like it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 10 years now.  I LOVE it!  I used to use the stick form, the spray is much better! I use it after every shower, I even use my blow dryer to quickly dry the pit area.  It keeps me from stinking &amp; I don&#x27;t have to use yucky store bought sticks.  Best part-NO white marks on clothes!  This is a great natural alternative for deoderent.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for a friend so I have no idea.</li>
            <li> No smell and healthy deodorant - love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years now, just spray some on coming out of the shower.  Works great, better for you than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deoderants.</li>
            <li> This is only a \\&quot;good product\\&quot;.  Nothing special regarding effect, but like the spray bottle feature.  Would I buy again?  Due to shipping costs, I would only buy if it was in commonly local stores.</li>
            <li> this is the best deoderant i know, but one of the two bottles i got had a faulty pump sprayer, so buy two to get a chance of actually using them  --  i am disappointed in the faulty sprayer, of course</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the best I have found yet on the market. I have found it to be non-irritating to my skin, yet highly effective against odor. And it&#x27;s price is unbeatable as well.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! Tried lots of natural products that don&#x27;t work, but this does!!</li>
            <li> Great organic deordarant</li>
            <li> This stuff is really effective and long lasting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend started using this soon after I did, and he had some pretty awful &#x27;pits. He works in a bakery, which is very labor intensive while working in a hot environment... so he works up quite a sweat. Even after working a long shift, there&#x27;s no hint of stinky armpit smell. I&#x27;m not afraid to hug him after he comes home!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse and trust me....it gets sweaty in those scrubs!  Thai spray mist deodorant has been the best alternative to harsh aluminum antiperspirant/deodorants. I use it along with an antiperspirant to ensure that I stay dry and smell great all day long.  At the end of a long shift I do notice a small body odor smell but honestly this stuff is great; this also tells me it&#x27;s not a total cure but it is helping. Furthermore, the harsh aluminum antiperspirant/deodorants stain clothes, I have so many tops ruined from aluminum.  Currently I am experimenting with the thai spray and an arm &amp; hammer \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant and so far I&#x27;m happy with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, thai spray may not be the total answer to your sweaty issues but it sure does help a girl to stay dry and confident.</li>
            <li> i never thought i would say this but it works. i wont give 5 stars for mediocre products.&lt;br /&gt;i had used the thai crystal for years only to give up with it and go to stinking or commercial BO coverups&lt;br /&gt;now what i do is use 2 spurts of this spray and THEN spread it around with the thai crystal.&lt;br /&gt;it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;take your time rubbing it in with the crystal.&lt;br /&gt;no more stinky pits!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff. It is amazing what this spray can do for body odor. I have none. Honestly there is no smell whatsoever even after a day at work. Had I known about this product sooner I would have given up that chemical crap years ago. THANK YOU!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Note: I make no claims this will work for you, you just have to take a chance; you will never know if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  No problems with order.</li>
            <li> This has really helped with my hidratenitis supparativa. It used to be really bad and now I barely have one boil per year. I feel so blessed to have found this product. I don&#x27;t even sweat that much and when I do, it doesn&#x27;t smell. Love this!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I started using it about  3 years ago I was getting staining on my clothes under arm.  I haven&#x27;t gone back to regular deodorant since.  Just the cost alone, about 5 bottles in 3 years justifies the cost.  You will sweat.  But you will not smell.  The product works by killing bacteria that causes the odor.  So it&#x27;s important that you wash and soap the area while taking a bath.  Apply it liberally and it lasts the entire day.  I have had not a bad day.  Good by stained clothes and aluminum.</li>
            <li> This did not do anything more than water would</li>
            <li> Works amazingly! !!! Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My housemate who works in a natural grocery store got a full-size sample of this product and gave it to me.  (He kinda spoils me!)  I have since bought it because I found it so effective.  I take anywhere from two to four fitness classes a week, and although they are geared towards middle-aged women and even elderly women, these classes do make you sweat and are an intense workout.  I have a \\&quot;workout buddy\\&quot; who is a menopausal woman in her early 50s (we carpool together and will motivate each other, especially for body sculpt class--weightlifting in various positions, which we both hate but know is good for us).  She is always hot and sweaty.  I do not know if this product would work as well if you are experiencing menopause.  I&#x27;m not there yet!  If you are not yet menopausal or are beyond menopause, then this product seems to keep you odor-free and relatively dry.  I like that there are no harsh chemicals or aluminum in it.  It also seems to last a long time.  I love Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Floral Deodorant, but it is too expensive.  This deodorant is very reasonably priced and seems to work just as well as the Dr. Hauschka deodorant, though it admittedly doesn&#x27;t smell as nice.</li>
            <li> Works for Me!  The only complaint is after spraying it takes a while to dry.  But it doesn&#x27;t harm your body and keeps the smell away!</li>
            <li> So far this is working great for both my wife and I and no more breathing in aluminum from the aerosol deodorants or getting white streaks on my shirts from roll-on or gel deodorants</li>
            <li> My husband uses prescription strength Antiperspirant Old Spice but it would leave a nasty stiff white residue on all his shirts!  I had to buy Deo-Go to get the stuff off.  I was worried about his daily exposure to the chemicals, but nothing else would keep him odor free.  Plus his neck would smell all mildewy in the morning from sweating all night in his sleep.  So, I found this and bought it in March 2012.  After his shower, he sprays this on his neck and his underarms (which I made him shave).  Then he applies regular deodorant (not antiperspirant) on, and OMG, he doesn&#x27;t stink AND I don&#x27;t have extra laundry work to do!  hahaha.  I waited 3 months to write this to be sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> As a female that works out for a living, this stuff is a lifesaver... I mean a facesaver.  A gal can only shower, so many times a day, but if I spray this stuff on all the &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34;, my 2-3 showers a day hold up teaching 2-5 group exercise classes and 3-6 personal training clients 6 days a week:-).  Of course you should use some kind of an antiperspirant if you do not want it to &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; off the body.  But preventing &amp; slowing down the bacteria breaking down and causing odor is solved with just a little bit of this spray.</li>
            <li> Received item in time promised.  Item exactly as expected.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the good reviews are coming from people who do not actual physical activity..  Your better off wearing nothing then paying $8 for mineral salt water..</li>
            <li> This works for both of us, even during the hottest part of summer!</li>
            <li> Been using for many years. Really like the health aspect.</li>
            <li> Have had good results with this. Large bottle, but sprays quite a bit too. Not sure how long it will last. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, I spray it on daily and notice a big difference without it. Without multiple reapplication under the arms it&#x27;s not as effective for me on the hot days. I like the spray vs. stone as I feel it gives even coverage and the water doesn&#x27;t drip down my arm like when I use the stone. Feels refreshing when spraying as well.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that a basic saline solution would be an effective deodorant? No perfume, no aluminum salts, just an effective product.</li>
            <li> looks and feels like misting water under your arms, but as long as I keep my meat intake low, it does an excellent job!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year and it works great! I pump about 5 sprays under each pit and then I wait for it today while getting dressed.  Dries pretty fast. Hubby doesn&#x27;t like it as well probably because the spray can&#x27;t reach his skin due to all the hair so I recommend it for women not men. I have tried the actual stones and they were just too messy.  This is easy, clean and works!</li>
            <li> I was using the rock form of another brand of this type of deodorant and it worked okay, but I really wouldn&#x27;t trust it for all day, or if I was wearing a shirt that was tight under my pits. Then I got pregnant. And just so you know, I&#x27;m tall and thick-200+ lbs-I&#x27;m not a cute, thin thing that looks good in yoga clothes.  After giving birth and going through all sorts of hormonal changes I stunk really bad. I kept trying to only use my crystal deodorant, but I stunk so bad that, even with taking a shower first and thoroughly cleaning myself (baking soda and all), I managed to transfer my funk to the crystal deodorant and that poor deodorant was never the same.  This whole experience along with a new born had me ready to give up on the crystal deodorant and all natural deodorants.  Then I found this spray as an option and I have to say it works sooooooo wonderful!  I&#x27;ve never had the rock form (or any natural deodorant) work all day, or hold up to wearing a tight-in-the-pits shirt, but I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and am constantly amazed at how good it works. First I was just happy that it kept me from stinking sitting at home with a loose shirt and air conditioning, next I wore it out on a hot (and HUMID!) day-at least in the 90&#x27;s if not 100&#x27;s-and was amazed that it worked just as good as my anti-perspirant. Then I did the ultimate test: hot day with a tight-pitted shirt, and, OH MY GOSH! IT WORKED! So, I can&#x27;t praise it enough!  I&#x27;m so happy with it, and thankful to have found it!</li>
            <li> All expectation were met</li>
            <li> fantastic product-eliminates odor-last a long time</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, great stuff, I mix a little essential oils to give to some zing. This way you can personalize you protection.</li>
            <li> This works for me pretty darn well...and I live in an extremely hot climate.  I still perspire and that takes some getting used to.  Just shower and use it.  I don&#x27;t worry about nasty ingredients.  I love how its not irritating and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! I was very skeptical at first, but living in the Dallas/Ft Worth area with our heat and humidity, one tends to get a little sweaty! This stuff works like a charm! You still sweat, which is normal and healthy, but there is NO ODOR...Nothing...Nada! I can actually wear the same shirt a couple times before washing it because there is no odor! I even use it on my feet, then dry them in front of a fan, and NO stinky shoes! I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant, first because it&#x27;s natural and second because it keeps me fresh a bit longer than regular deodorants. I&#x27;ve seen  reviews about some ppl saying it keeps them fresh for two or more days...I don&#x27;t know anything about that, but it does do what it says it will if you have good hygiene habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;June 20th 2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this product many times with no issues, but with my most recent purchase, something has gone wrong. The product label has changed, and ironically it does not offer the same protection it has in the past for me. I have been using this product for about 5 years, so let&#x27;s just hope they haven&#x27;t messed with the formula. I reached out to the company, sending them a picture of the bottle, asking if the item is legit and they say yes that they have changed their product label design. Well, for now I will start looking for a new deoderant, can&#x27;t walk around with smelly pits any longer.</li>
            <li> this is the best product. no it will not prevent you from sweating... your body needs to sweat! let it sweat. it will provide 24+ hours of smell free armpits though and it is amazing. When i first got it i didn&#x27;t use it correctly and it didn&#x27;t really work well. all you need to do is shower. wash your armpits well. then dry off and spray a couple spritz into each armpit. and this is the most important part... let your body completely air dry, or speed up the process with a hair dryer or fan, before you put on clothes.... if you do not do this you will not create a protect bond and the spray will not work effectively. I can go two days without noticing any smell and best of all i don&#x27;t smell like deodorant! I smell like me! i have used the spray and the roll on and prefer the spray because the roll can pick up smells. one last thing... do not try to reapply without taking another shower... it will only intensify your funk. i have, let&#x27;s say, a odor and thai crystal has really given me more confidence while dancing or working out. THANKS THAI CRYSTAL!</li>
            <li> I live in the south and it gets humid over here. I have worn it threw the summer, and it passes the test of making it threw the heat! I will use this for the rest of my life</li>
            <li> Great product as usual.</li>
            <li> I started with the rock/stone version, but I like the spray better. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Thai Deodorant Stick and LOVED it. I thought this spray would be even better. I don&#x27;t think it is at all! For one, it doesn&#x27;t work as long. With the stick I could go for a LONG time without reapplying, but this spray, it seems to stop working twice as fast. And it&#x27;s harder to get even/solid coverage, it&#x27;s hard to tell where the spray has hit, thus I&#x27;m often left with parts under my arm that didn&#x27;t get hit, and start smelling instantly. The bottle spray is very good, it does provide a good misting! But I hate the result and will go back to the stick just as soon as this is gone, and I&#x27;ll never get another bottle of it! I don&#x27;t think it works nearly as well as the stick.</li>
            <li> I really like the spray version of this product because it&#x27;s easier to apply than the stick version. The Thai deodorant in general is fantastic and works very well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Works great and all natural</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of natural deodorants and I think this one is ok. I find I have to wash my skin with soap and water and reapply throughout the the day, but that&#x27;s what I do with any natural deodorant. I do like that you can spray on your legs, feet, etc. if you wanted to.</li>
            <li> This works really well for me.  I am unable to use products with coconut oil but I wanted something natural so this is a great alternative!</li>
            <li> I used to use the stone that THAI had.  It was good but would develop tiny chips about two or three weeks in.  I didn&#x27;t like that scratchy feeling on my arms.  Since the product worked so well in keeping odor away, I decided to spend the extra few pennies and try the spray.  I LOVE IT!  SO much easier and no scratching.  Only thing is, I use it up faster that I did the stone.  It&#x27;s also because I use double the recommended sprays under each arm.  I wasn&#x27;t covering enough with just three sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to be totally honest here, and share that, I still SWEAT.  I believe that  that&#x27;s a GOOD THING.  I don&#x27;t want to block my pores.  I don&#x27;t sweat so much that it&#x27;s an embarrassment.  I pat dry for the first 30 minutes and then seem to do pretty good the rest of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO ODOR even with the release of perspiration!  Sometimes I&#x27;ll reapply at some point during the day, but that is only after working out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to go back to the mainstream deodorant and anti-persp. but when I didn&#x27;t sweat for two days and didn&#x27;t need to reapply even after a shower, I felt unsafe about it.  I went back to THAI.  I&#x27;ve also tried other brands of deodorants w/ antipers. and didn&#x27;t like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hunting!  I give this 5 stars and have been using THAI brand for six years now!</li>
            <li> Great product, good price, prompt ship. I don&#x27;t stink; I don&#x27;t sweat...well maybe I glisten. Everyone&#x27;s body is different.  I perspired heavily when I was younger, but now I barely, so this is the perfect deodorant for me -- all natural and no fragrance. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Works well. Scrub your pits well before and no stink. Applicator does tend to clog. Tried their crystal stone version and I prefer the spray. Spray keeps you fresh longer and it&#x27;s easier.</li>
            <li> Only got to use it once then bottle fell off coffee table and broke.</li>
            <li> This stuff is MAGIC!!!  I love this spray.  It WORKS! I&#x27;m so glad I discovered it!!  Just make sure that you apply it to clean, dry skin.  I know most people like to believe that they sweat, but they literally just glisten.  I AM A WOMAN WHO SWEATS!!!!!  And it may have an odor.  I find that if I keep my underarms free from hair, the Thai deodorant will last 24 hrs or longer.  If I find that I am in between hair removal, it will last a whole workday but after that I will have to reapply by evening.  The product works and its ALL NATURAL!!!!  Will recommend to anyone who wants to move to something natural that works!!</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Wish I found the 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> This still is pretty awesome.  I already liked the original Thai Crystal, but I dropped it after just a week and I NEVER drop stuff, lol... but it burst like I had heard it would, so I got this as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this one shirt made from materials that just seem to instantly suck up any odor I have and it stinks by the end of the day.  The pits still kind of smelled from the 2 hours I had worn it the other day (so I didn&#x27;t wash it, 2 hours, please?), so I sprayed them with this, stink GONE.  Wore the shirt the whole day, no stink.  My pits don&#x27;t even usually stink, but this shirt would extract any stink I did have, and this spray completely countered that!</li>
            <li> I like the spray it did keep the order away, I had problems with perspiration during the end of the work day. It&#x27;s only works on clean dry underarms. Good product anyways</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I apply it right after a shower, best way to use this. Sometimes I do combine it with my natural deodorant stick for extra help. But this alone really helps cut back on odor. I use on my feet too, in my shoes and to freshen up my hats in between washes....works great! I will buy more for sure. Take care if thinking of using this in more sensitive skin areas&#x27;...it can be a ting irritating.</li>
            <li> The spray didn&#x27;t work as well as the crystal deodorant push up stick.  I didn&#x27;t care that the liquid runs when you spray it.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be an excellent product.  It is a mist spray which is odorless and dries very quickly.  I like to spray it on immediately after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a particularly busy and vigorous day, or an important meeting, I would tend to choose something with a scent instead….but this product would probably be fine for that as well.</li>
            <li> It may work for others, but this did absolutely nothing for me. :(</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  I live in Florida, and my feet sweat constantly, even in sandals.  Bacteria is always an issue here with the high humidity.  I spray this on every morning, and no more sweaty, smelly feet.  All natural, so no issues there!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I have been using the stick for years, but this is much easier.</li>
            <li> This no-frills deodorant is exactly what it says it is--the packaging is simple and easy to use, the product lasts for, from my experience, around twelve average hours or so, and you&#x27;ll definitely sweat (it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant), but you won&#x27;t smell. The product itself has no fragrance, which is sensible. I apply it by spraying liberally all over the area, probably more than is necessary--the mist ends up dripping but dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t even worry about travel--the bottle seems to be your standard issue squirt bottle, and it should be easy to pour into a similar travel-sized container. Personally, I&#x27;d rather have the spray than the stick for hygiene purposes, but if you have a lot of liquids I guess one bottle fewer is always a boon.</li>
            <li> I was looking online for a product to deoderize my clothes.  No matter what clinical strenth deoderant/antiperspirant that I used, it never seemed to work the whole day.  Since this had great reviews, I figured that I had nothing to lose.  It is truly amazing.  It works better than any of the other products that I had previously used.  Now my teenage son and husband are using it too.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised and has not caused any irritation. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This is not just a deodorant this disappears all smells. My neighbor smokes n the smell gets into my house sometimes and all i do is spray coupme times in tbe rooms and the smell is gone, with no weird smell after. Then i can scent the house any natural way i want</li>
