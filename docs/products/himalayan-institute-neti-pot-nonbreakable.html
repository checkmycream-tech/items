            <li>Good price, good results--</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>Then I did some research on neti pots and found that they&#x27;re the most effective way to get rid of nasal irritants for good.</li>
            <li>Works well, looks nice, and handy for travel.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of upset about the quality of the material</li>
            <li>I breath freer and more easy, morning noon and night!!</li>
            <li>This neti pot is very easy to use when you follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li>This one is light and unbreakable with a spout that fits nicely into the nostril.</li>
            <li>I have been able to give up the over-the-counter pills which has given me more energy.  </li>
            <li>I guess it would be OK for travel.</li>
            <li>The ceramic pot is much, much better.</li>
            <li>We finally purchased this product and have been very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>About the size of your fist and holds a surprising large amount of water.</li>
            <li>The instructions are fairly easy to follow.</li>
            <li>This neti pot is nonbreakable light weight plastic.</li>

            <li>I heard so much about the Netty pot from Allergists and users, and I was expecting to get better results than with just saline irrigation from a bottle or spray.</li>
            <li>So product is OK color not so much.</li>
            <li>It shouldn&#x27;t have a price tag of more than $3.00; the packaging probably cost as much the product itself.</li>
            <li>It keeps me clear and free of congestion and has STOPPED my snoring!</li>
            <li>The instructions tell what adjustments to make if it&#x27;s not working quite right.  </li>
            <li>After using the Netty pot, although I did not purchase the solutions but used mild homemade warm salt solution, I did not get the phenomonal mucus clearance that I expected or relief of symptoms.</li>
            <li>Good little pot.</li>
            <li>This has helped so much!  </li>

            <li>It is much easier to use than I thought it would and would recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li>Mine is a white plastic one, which i know works just as well as the blue would have, but it would have been nice to know what colour was being ordered.</li>
            <li>Maybe less would be better.  </li>
            <li>I also like having a backup in case my ceramic one breaks since I&#x27;m kind of clumsy.</li>
            <li>Still, the feeling of having ocean water in the sinuses was better than constant sneezing all day long.</li>

            <li> I heard so much about the Netty pot from Allergists and users, and I was expecting to get better results than with just saline irrigation from a bottle or spray. I had been having post-nasal drip for a least 2 months with an annoying cough keeping me awake at night. After using the Netty pot, although I did not purchase the solutions but used mild homemade warm salt solution, I did not get the phenomonal mucus clearance that I expected or relief of symptoms. I felt like I had just another piece of equipment, although small, to store. Also, it is an uncomfortable feeling to irrigate your nose with the netty pot...I do not think a child would endure this treatment.   Karen</li>
            <li> This product works great just as advertised but the plastic is very thin. Anyhow, this does the job and I&#x27;m happy with the product.   Cleans your sinus really well if you have allergies.</li>
            <li> Used to be that nasal allergy was driving me nuts. I&#x27;ve tried nasal sprays, allergy medications with moderate success--nothing to hoot about. Then I did some research on neti pots and found that they&#x27;re the most effective way to get rid of nasal irritants for good. This one is light and unbreakable with a spout that fits nicely into the nostril. The instructions are easy and with some practice, you&#x27;ll be wondering why you didn&#x27;t discover this earlier.  Good price, good results--so what are you waiting for?</li>
            <li> I love this!  I have horrible allergies and get sinus infections all the time.  This has helped so much!  I love that it&#x27;s plastic since I am quite clumsy.  It is a little odd at first and it seems like putting water up your nose would be a bad thing, but being able to breathe is a great thing.  I use filtered water since I have not-so-nice water where I live.  I have been able to give up the over-the-counter pills which has given me more energy.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is as great as it is clamined to be! It keeps me clear and free of congestion and has STOPPED my snoring! I breath freer and more easy, morning noon and night!! I just love it!!</li>
            <li> We had the ceramic neti pot, but one drop on the floor ant it was in three pieces.  This one works just as well, the only thing is that the spout seems to be a little bigger than the ceramic, so hope you have bigger nostrils.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t doing Neti, you don&#x27;t know how good it feels to have clean, clear nostrils.  This pot is pretty and has the great advantage of being unbreakable, because if you set it on your sink, sooner or later, you will drop it.</li>
            <li> All that matters are results! I bought the plastic version because it is unbreakable, light,and just as functional.   As I write this I have a terrible case of the flu and the use of the Neti pot stopped my post nasal drip and helped to relieve my hacking. It works! Flushed out the yellow mucus from both nostrils.Beats nasal sprays.</li>
            <li> I bought this produce for traveling and as a spare to my ceramic pot.  I have not used it yet, but it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this neti pot last year for traveling since my regular use neti pot is ceramic. I certainly like the shape and texture of the ceramic pot better, but this works fine for traveling. Personally, I prefer one that has a taller body because the water spills out a bit at the angle that I have to hold it when I tilt my head. However, for something that I only use a few times a year while traveling, it does the job. I also like having a backup in case my ceramic one breaks since I&#x27;m kind of clumsy. The only other complaint I can see other people having is that this is made of molded plastic, and if you have really sensitive nasal passages, you might find the slight feel of the plastic seam to be a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> My ceramic Himalayan Institute Neti Pot was accidently broken, I decided to get the nonbreakable one to prevent this from happening again. This neti pot is nonbreakable light weight plastic. I guess it would be OK for travel. I was disappointed because it seems so cheap and chintzy. The ceramic pot is much, much better. This nonbreakable pot is not worth the price they are asking.</li>
            <li> I ordered the blue travel neti-pot but got the white ECO version instead.  The Eco version is in fact breakable, I&#x27;m disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Good little pot. About the size of your fist and holds a surprising large amount of water. One thing about nasal irrigation, the water has to be hot enough (but not scalding) or the water stings my sinuses. And if your sinuses are totally blocked, nothing is going to get through, but the water does help shift things.</li>
            <li> i believe in this product. and i actually believe it is for everyone. clears the sinuses drug free, pain free, quickly. save yourself a copay and use it whenever you feel congested.</li>
            <li> It probably only cost about 10 cents to make, and 12 dollars seems a lot to pay for it, but it is portable and does the job.</li>
            <li> This neti pot is very easy to use when you follow the instructions.  The instructions tell what adjustments to make if it&#x27;s not working quite right.  You may have to tip your head a little bit to get the saline to flow properly.  I bought this one, because it seemed well designed for the purpose, and it is.  Some of the other designs looked awkward to use in comparison.         I used it when I felt allergy symptoms coming on, and I didn&#x27;t have any symptoms afterwards.  My only problem is not with the product itself, but with the treatment.  It stopped what seemed to be allergy symptoms, but  for the rest of the day I felt like I&#x27;d been swimming in the ocean and got water up my nose a few times.  I used the amount of non-iodized salt in solution that is recommended.  Maybe less would be better.  Still, the feeling of having ocean water in the sinuses was better than constant sneezing all day long.</li>
            <li> My sister has been trying to get us to try the Neti Pot for over two years.  We finally purchased this product and have been very happy with the results.  It is much easier to use than I thought it would and would recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Works well, looks nice, and handy for travel.  Especially good if you are going to a relative&#x27;s house who has animals you are alergic too.</li>
            <li> This is just as described. It was shipped out promptly. I would definately buy from this seller again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have severe allergies but since using the Neti pot, I can actually breathe out of both nostrils and remember what it is to smell. The instructions are fairly easy to follow. I didn&#x27;t get the neti salt but opted instead to use regular table salt which has worked well for me.     That being said, the Neti Pot I received was not the pretty blue coloured one that is pictured. Mine is a white plastic one, which i know works just as well as the blue would have, but it would have been nice to know what colour was being ordered. Maybe Amazon can offer both colour options.</li>
            <li> The product does work but I was disappointed when I opened the box and it was plain white.  Why show the color blue and send white.  There also wasn&#x27;t a spot to select the color.  So product is OK color not so much.</li>
            <li> To concur with the other reviewer&#x27;s statement, it does the job, but it&#x27;s made of cheap (and I mean cheap) plastic.  It shouldn&#x27;t have a price tag of more than $3.00; the packaging probably cost as much the product itself. I was kind of upset about the quality of the material so I threw it against the wall, and of course it just bounce off without a scratch.  So at least it&#x27;s truly unbreakable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would get the ceramic one (it&#x27;s about the same price) as it has a better value.</li>
