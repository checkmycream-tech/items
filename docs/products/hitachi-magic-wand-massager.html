            <li>It is great to use for stress relief.</li>

            <li>Though if you do get there, it is GREAT with the wand above.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it still does the job, I am happy</li>
            <li>and I believe the people at Hitachi do not like people praising it as a great vibrator.</li>
            <li>We use this all the time works great</li>
            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>This thing is great for all genders, all sexualities, all levels of experience.  </li>

            <li>Go forth, and spread the joy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard great things about the Hitachi and decided to look it up for myself.</li>

            <li>Great power.</li>
            <li>very effective</li>

            <li>Loved product...</li>
            <li>Good news is I&#x27;m off the walker and using a cane.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t review a lot of products - but this one deserves a good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for all muscle aches and pains.</li>
            <li>It does a good job</li>
            <li>Good product and I</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>there you have it, it does a good job at it&#x27;s manufacture intended purchase, either buy it on Amazon or just steal your wife&#x27;s / girlfriend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>Can be used for muscle massage as well as for erotic pleasure.</li>
            <li>It is a good massager</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had my Hitachi Magic Wand for 20 years... and it has performed beautifully for all my massaging</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product itself is great but don&#x27;t order from this seller because it is fake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And I probably dont need to elaborate on why this is so great.</li>
            <li>After reading even more great reviews about the wand, I decided to add it to my wishlist.</li>
            <li>They too have all been very pleased with this massager.  </li>
            <li>If more women knew about the magic wand, it could change the world!!</li>
            <li>Okay, lets start off with the pro&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>You already know they love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an AMAZING \\&quot;stress reliever\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Amazing my G/F loves it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also amazing during intercourse for both him and her.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this anymore, it is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, the product is amazing, but check the product when you receive it and make sure it&#x27;s an authentic product, and happy massaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li>i bought this massager for my gf, and after looking around and seeing so many good review about this massager i decided to buy it for her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure hitachi thought reducing the weight was a good idea, and it probably is.</li>
            <li>/lo switch is a nice feature-</li>
            <li>well i dont think i am allowed to write the kind of review that is needed here....</li>
            <li>Nice right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price was nice.</li>
            <li>and I could honestly say it was a muscle massager.</li>
            <li>honestly don&#x27;t know why you haven&#x27;t bought this yet.  </li>
            <li>honestly don&#x27;t know why you haven&#x27;t bought this yet.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked it the speed/</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to own the knock-off that I have read people&#x27;s complaints about breaking in a matter of weeks.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to own it period. . .</li>
            <li>EVERY WOMAN should own a Hitachi Wand, the \\&quot;Wand of Wonder,\\&quot; as I reverently call it.  </li>
            <li>Whatever you need it for, it is sure to be, good.</li>
            <li>This is very good at stimulation and at the right angle</li>
            <li>When I first heard about the Hitachi Magic Wand it was touted as the best vibrator ever</li>
            <li>This massager works great as a full body massager.</li>
            <li>So I bought a new one and its perfect every time.</li>
            <li>After receiving it I was relieved that it was in fact the mythical magic wand that I&#x27;d heard so many good things about.</li>
            <li>and now she says is by far the best toy she ever had.</li>
            <li>I guess to each their own. :)</li>
            <li>(Great fun, by the way.</li>
            <li>magic wand is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful massager which I like to use on the highest intensity, but it is loud &amp; will overheat.  </li>
            <li>Well okay then, Hitachi you are keeping a smile on her face!!!  </li>
            <li>You both will have a LOT more fun with this!!!  </li>
            <li>should have known the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It was very light and the foam head was detachable.</li>
            <li>It has a large semisoft rubber tip that feels great.</li>
            <li>it,s a bit noisey...but not horrible...</li>
            <li>it worked even better for me....</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s region seems more engorged, tighter, better, when we use this</li>
            <li>, this is NOT the Hitachi Magic Wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is still the best product on the market, and I only gave it a four because it didn&#x27;t work out for us.</li>
            <li>The service was great but the electric cord on the wand leaves much to be desired inasmuch as it seems to want to curl up every time you use it longer than 10 mins.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just humorous.  </li>
            <li>We have tried many different massagers but this one is the best!</li>
            <li>Ive heard great things about the real item</li>
            <li>I assume it got over heated and died, it heats up REAL quickly</li>
            <li>i heard hitachi magic wand was the cadillac of vibes...</li>
            <li>head is way more flexible</li>
            <li>After I put some layers in between it and my clit, it felt a lot better.</li>
            <li>The Magic Wand can get me from ho-hum to f</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is electrical.</li>
            <li>It still is better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get 17 years of wear out of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is one of many toys.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Better than the rattling knock off  </li>
            <li>If you have one you love it.</li>
            <li>Simply the best!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  </li>
            <li>All Hitachi Magic Wand&#x27;s come with a 1-year manufacturers warranty as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kudos from the boyfriend as well :)</li>
            <li>My magic wand relaxes me like nothing else can.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my favorite for many years....</li>
            <li>Betty Dodson introduced me this one many years ago.....</li>
            <li>Also works for body, which is what it was initially for, but works great either way!</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>Any girls that love messages here you go.</li>
            <li>If you ever wanted to know what it&#x27;s like to shake hands with Wally West, this might be able to tell you.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you just want to be able to relax by yourself.  </li>
            <li>Hitachi Magic Wand.  </li>
            <li>Hitachi Magic Wand.  </li>
            <li>Because you&#x27;ve maxed out your gift giving, nothing will be able to compare.  </li>
            <li>Because you&#x27;ve maxed out your gift giving, nothing will be able to compare.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this to many, many friends who have bought it after listening to my stories raving about this massager.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Its definitely magical.</li>
            <li>This is considered the best personal massager on the market for a reason.  </li>
            <li>It has made me, even without it, more orgasmic.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>For my favorite girl friends, this is the gift that I give.  </li>
            <li>I decided to replace it with a LELO product (which cost twice as much as this) because of the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>The LELO is ok, but nothing compares to the Hitachi Magic Wand.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love and</li>
            <li>I have suggested this massager to many women over the years.</li>
            <li>Hitachi Magic Wand HV250R</li>
            <li>It will work on men too :)</li>
            <li>but I think more than two speeds are needed for this puppy.  </li>
            <li>She now comes so fast and often she is a new woman, this is a wonderful product to own and use.  </li>
            <li>but it happened great by highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Despite these minor setbacks I will say it is wonderful to save on batteries.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my original wand that I have had for 17 years!</li>
            <li>After some checking and research and looking at a GENUINE Hitachi Magic Wand, I was convinced that what I purchased was a Magic Wand wannabe, not manufactured by Hitachi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very good at various angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lowest price available is $54.95 which is what Hitachi Magic, an authorized retailer, sell&#x27;s it for.</li>
            <li>Probably the best money I&#x27;ve spent this year.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t THAT good.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t pitch my original Hitachi before trying this one out.</li>
            <li>Original Hitachi Magic Wands are made in Japan.  </li>
            <li>The fact that the head is detachable for easy boiling to keep it clean at all times is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>i strongly recommend  this massager.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I have severe back, neck and shoulder pain and this massager works very effective on relieving most of the pain in those areas.</li>
            <li>I had an AMAZING experience with this product the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I ordered it thinking ok on sale cool</li>
            <li>The price is pretty cheap for a Hitachi and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>The newer model is much more lightweight, which may be a positive for many.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s HUGE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and switch speeds with one hand.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my fault for ordering something so cheap and from someone called US Wholesaler 33.</li>
            <li>Had the same wand for 4 years and it worked great.</li>
            <li>and i lostmy receipt and wahl is going to fix or replace my massager for free cause</li>
            <li>sure, it goes, but not as powerful.  </li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t know how easy it would be to clean.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s sure is powerful..</li>
            <li>It is much more powerful than you would think.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>both are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also works great for back and neck massages too!  </li>
            <li>This is one of the few items I would say everybody should own to appreciate it!!!  </li>
            <li>This product has some heft to it, so it isn&#x27;t cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>I find it works great on my lower back and sore</li>
            <li>Two speeds and low speed works great on any stiffness you might have.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy this wand.</li>
            <li>For couples who enjoy using a massager in the bedroom, this item is the gold</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great buy and would recommend it to anyone looking for extra spice in the bedroom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll let you know if I break it anytime soon, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Because the Hitachi Magic Wand will still be ready to go, and will still be just as entertaining.  </li>
            <li>Because the Hitachi Magic Wand will still be ready to go, and will still be just as entertaining.  </li>
            <li>My massager is now 4 years old and still works as good as it did the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li>this one is not as good as the old type.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine has a REAL Hitachi magic wand and it is way better than this.</li>
            <li>Pros - Very powerful \\&quot;intense\\&quot; massager.</li>
            <li>and I have found it to be very useful with our without attachments.  </li>
            <li>This is seriously the most impressive massager I have ever used.</li>
            <li>She liked the weight of the older one.</li>
            <li>I used it one time on my partner&#x27;s ehum* male parts and he was way too quick for me, but for all my women who review this, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>but if it blows up any time soon, it was worth the money just to get that knot out of my calf!</li>
            <li>The motor was changed (which was not at all close to the original strength of the Hitachi motor).</li>
            <li>I first saw the Magic Wand, I thought \\&quot;this does not look like a sex toy.\\</li>
            <li>It looks like the original one</li>
            <li>The original Hitachi wand HV250R doesn&#x27;t have a removable foam head.</li>
            <li>The original Hitachi wand HV250R is made in Japan.</li>
            <li>The rounded switch panel reveals that this is not an original Hitachi product.  </li>
            <li>It is not the original Hitachi.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>is definitely an original product of Hitachi or Vibratex.</li>
            <li>This is the original brand.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I know Hitachi doesn&#x27;t like for people to review this as a vibrator, but that&#x27;s exactly what I bought it for</li>
            <li>First trip scheduled in two weeks... :-)</li>
            <li>It works great, I thought it would have a little more voltage</li>
            <li>$50-60 might seem kind of pricey at first, but this is likely the best present you&#x27;re going to find for under $1000.</li>
            <li>$50-60 might seem kind of pricey at first, but this is likely the best present you&#x27;re going to find for under $1000.</li>
            <li>Older one more powerful and can adjust speeds better.</li>
            <li>This is the best, after a hard week of work to come to the best massage therapy, you can&#x27;t get no better than that.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, does what its supposed to, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend likes to use it on special occasions.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they will make this right!</li>
            <li>The price was right!</li>
            <li>Five minutes into it early Christmas morn, she has a great orgasm and then told me she wanted to spend the rest of Christmas day in the bedroom with her new toy!</li>
            <li>(I wouldn&#x27;t count the one I threw away after the first ten minutes from Spencer&#x27;s) but this product is still GREAT.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s cord operated and not battery, power is never a problem and it&#x27;s always operating at full speed.  </li>
            <li>Good for back massager.</li>
            <li>My physical therapist recommended this product (they use it in their clinics) to work on the area and it does a really good job.</li>
            <li>The ones that sell for close to $75 and who address the fact that they are a REAL Hitachi product are a better bet.  </li>
            <li>cause she keeps her wand running at full speed.  </li>
            <li>and she said it is good for deep tissue.  </li>
            <li>It does have a cord, which will definitely save you on batteries, and it&#x27;s a good length, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind it being a bit longer.</li>
            <li>only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t look like a sex toy, but that could be a good thing too.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Just wait til you experience two people at full strength plus Hitachi helping out.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I think it&#x27;s good for back massages and stuff like that too, but I haven&#x27;t tested that theory out yet haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good product and like a lot of people stated the cord is short and</li>
            <li>electric massagers work by having a mechanical components dig or kneed your muscles via some kind of rotating action.  </li>
            <li>Girlfriend loved it for her back.</li>
            <li>I would just spend a bit more and get the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I would reccomend this product, even though I&#x27;ve heard the real thing is better.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping it would be more intense and vibrate deeper into the tissue.  </li>
            <li>I think that both are too large &amp; would be perfect if cut in half the size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m here not so much to talk about the Wand itself, but the new lifestyle you&#x27;ll be buying when you get this wand for your loved ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new product is flimsy and cheap like so many products now made overseas.</li>
            <li>It can be a little overwhelming but it was definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li>great product, the intensity settings could be a tad bit much for the (intended) female user, but trust me, you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li>Almost too quickly.</li>
            <li>I received an actual authentic Hitachi Magic Wand.</li>
            <li>After several subsequent uses she now tells me this is the best Christmas gift I&#x27;ve ever given her.  </li>
            <li>PUT SUPER GLUE ON IT</li>
            <li>Only 2 speeds but overall great product!!</li>
            <li>The original Hitachi wand HV250R is very top heavy (feels like most of the weight is in the head) when you hold it in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was seriously not an orgasmic woman before I get the Hitachi Wand and now am!!!  </li>
            <li>Only complaints - the cord is not so sexy, but the tradeoff is its more powerful than batteries</li>
            <li>This new one works OK but is so inferior in craftsmanship, materials, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super happy with it anymore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and really relieves aches and pains without tiring out the person giving the massage!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>however, after reading the reviews and becoming concerned about this not being authentic, I did some research on this product and discovered that making knock-offs of it seems to be big business!</li>
            <li>I tell my guy friends to buy one for the woman he wants to please and have sex with often...but hide it/keep possession of it, otherwise he will not be needed as often!!</li>
            <li>Great for achy muscles or just to add a little spice to the bedroom.  </li>
            <li>You might not be able to use the high setting at first, but when you do OMG!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The thing is, it&#x27;s a different KIND of power.</li>
            <li>It looked powerful.</li>
            <li>Either way, this thing is powerful.</li>
            <li>Out of the box,  my husband even noticed that it was far more lightweight and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>It is a shame they don&#x27;t make drill bit attachments for this wand, it is so powerful it would drill a hole in the wall.  </li>
            <li>So so so so sooo worth the money.</li>
            <li>worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It is fairly powerful</li>
            <li>Very much worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking to soothe sore muscles or have a bit of fun</li>
            <li>I was having fun with this toy.</li>
            <li>it works well with powerful vibrations to all kinds of neat things to my fiance.</li>
            <li>its fun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Hitachi Magic Wand Massager work via vibrations, so there is no mechanical action digging into your sore muscles, rather the repeating vibrations stimulate your muscles into releasing knots.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>(like he always does before he buys anything) and surprised me with the Magic Wand for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  </li>
            <li>I do like the fact that both are electric &amp; are powerful.  </li>
            <li>totally worth it</li>
            <li>The weight is much lighter than a REAL Hitachi magic wand</li>
            <li>You will not see an authentic Hitachi Magic Wand manufactured in China, Korea, USA, Africa or any other country.</li>
            <li>** me in about 3-4 minutes if the mood is right.</li>
            <li>Came right on time.</li>
            <li>Hitachi got it right when they made this massager.  </li>
            <li>I was right up there with him, too.</li>
            <li>Just add to what you&#x27;d normally do, and suddenly it&#x27;s at least twice as awesome.  </li>
            <li>For anyone with experience with a Hitachi, you would know as soon as you opened the package that the massager is way too light in weight, and the speeds are not as high.</li>
            <li>I went right ahead with full power, it did the, ummm...job, very well ;)</li>
            <li>I am pleased with its speed settings, but after using it for greater than 20 minutes I do notice it smells a little like burning plastic.</li>
            <li>When this new one arrived it seemed flimsy and light weight, not at all sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like a battery operated vibe just more powerful, it&#x27;s a totally different</li>
            <li>Be prepared, because even at low speed, this is the most powerful massager I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li>The foam cover comes off easily and the massager  is not as sturdy as the old ones.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my girlfriend for Valentine&#x27;s, she says she loves it, but as a fair warning it might not be for extra sensitive people.</li>
            <li>Comes with an extra piece that makes things more fun.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s the one who can tell you about the awesomeness of this product, my own experience is more secondary.  </li>
            <li>Wow, that&#x27;s strong and 2)</li>
            <li>Just give your inferior gift next year, and bust out the Hitachi Magic Wand for some fun</li>
            <li>And it actually does a great job on your neck and back, too.</li>
            <li>Just give your inferior gift next year, and bust out the Hitachi Magic Wand for some fun</li>
            <li>And it actually does a great job on your neck and back, too.</li>
            <li>Just the low setting is more powerful</li>
            <li>Great for female and male stimulation.</li>
            <li>I previously stated that it was a good product but have since then changed my mind.</li>
            <li>This yields some very intense orgasms.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason the Hitachi has the reputation it does: it does one thing and does it very, very well</li>
            <li>The new Magic Wand is not as powerful as my old one, though it is quieter.  </li>
            <li>The recipient of this device has made it clear that she will never go without one of these fine masssagggers again.  </li>
            <li>you have never used an Hitachi before, it can be very intense at first.</li>
            <li>It works in minutes on my wife and just makes my job that much easier!  </li>
            <li>At first, I was hesitant, since it has a cord instead of batteries.  </li>
            <li>If it dies in the next decade, I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also suggest investing in a longer power cord ;)</li>
            <li>They have changed the head of the magic wand  to be a cover rather than a solid rubber head.</li>
            <li>This sucker worked great, makes b*tches cum in under 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>This is not my first one</li>
            <li>would be willing to retract this if they tried to settle anything , but I doubt they will.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>One the first day I received the Hitachi, everything worked well.</li>
            <li>Or, if you&#x27;re a great big meanie like I am and you hold it against your partner for a long time on its highest setting, scream-inducing and thrashing-about-making.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the Magic Wand for about 3 months or so, but it looks pretty well built.</li>
            <li>but I personally would prefer it  to have more power than it does.</li>
            <li>only one more word...  yes.</li>
            <li>It was a Fourth of July grand finale for the ages.</li>
            <li>for the real wand, it rocks my world and the quality is undeniable!</li>
            <li>My wife had been able to reach climax before, but it was always a 45 minute ordeal and if she came up short</li>
            <li>- Only two speeds but the two speeds are ok, not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not any better than a $20 chinese knockoff, in fact if it weren&#x27;t for the frayed cord, i would have stuck with the one i had.</li>
            <li>Of course, I plugged it in immediately and instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li>Also, the area around the switch became hot to the point where i couldn&#x27;t use it (the smell turned me off first).</li>
            <li>This is my second Hitachi and I love it just as the first, which is why I got another.</li>
            <li>My dog got a hold of the cord on the first one.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The claims of 3 minutes to bliss are not exaggerated.  </li>
            <li>This is lighter weight than the Brookstone Personal Massager which appears to be better made.  </li>
            <li>it does the job well and fast!</li>
            <li>Its use for self pleasuring in addition to muscle massage makes it it extremely useful, and appreciated as a present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute;e and the first day she had it she used it again and again and again.</li>
            <li>She really loves it!</li>
            <li>Got the exact reaction from my boyfriend that I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I can pretty much guarantee it&#x27;s not going</li>
            <li>Yes, this is my first (REAL) vibrator</li>
            <li>Even more concerned was the possibility that this noise was a signal of more serious problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it on low and that is plenty strong for me, but it does have a high setting if you need a bit more</li>
            <li>It broke too easily and was constantly a burden.</li>
            <li>Take together time to the next level!&lt;br /&gt;OK, intimacy isn&#x27;t always easy.  </li>
            <li>As directed, I made certain that each use never exceeded twenty minutes.</li>
            <li>little intense at first, but alot of fun learning:)</li>
            <li>Very well made and certainly does the job...</li>
            <li>nice if it was a little longer.  </li>
            <li>Low is almost as strong as the original High, the new High is DAMN High.</li>
            <li>Now, we do really use it for back and neck massages and it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Every woman I&#x27;ve ever talked to that doesn&#x27;t have one of these is afraid of it because of the legendary power of the wand....</li>
            <li>You may have to wrap something around it to keep it from being too intense.</li>
            <li>Now I will have to pay again to get the REAL DEAL.</li>
            <li>NOW every time we get intimated she wants to use it.</li>
            <li>and I think that this time I received a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; as opposed to a real one.  </li>
            <li>I opened it up inside and checked the \\&quot;guts\\&quot; to see if it was a real one or just making them cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>she began too shake, and jump she orgasm like never before this Hitachi wand is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This really pissed me off.</li>
            <li>Product received fast and as promised</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is VERY loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>not so much yall.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing is DH needs to be gentle</li>
            <li>works on every muscle, light weight, quiet.  </li>
            <li>I lost track of how much I like it for some number of years and will never do it again.</li>
            <li>DIDDN&#x27;T PAY THE PRICE OF THE REAL DEAL-</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t anything that can do what this &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; wand can do.  </li>
            <li>and NOT THE REAL THING.</li>
            <li>The attachments not so much, they numbed the feeling somewhat for me, so if you need to put a towel or something between you and the Hitachi you wouldn&#x27;t need to with a attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very versatile despite the size.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Used it for sore muscles too and it works really well.</li>
            <li>It looks real unless you know the real deal</li>
            <li>In the weeks since Christmas, I&#x27;ve found myself left to my own devices for hours at a time, while my partner is left with this device.  </li>
            <li>The two speeds allow for deep muscle massage or a lighter impact in more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>It is very powerful even on low</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t apply the same amount of preassure, softer more porous material too so its harder to clean and absorbs some of the vibration.  </li>
            <li>the switches were different and the head was not like my original.  </li>
            <li>The switch is even different from the original.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try some other brands to compare and find more power.</li>
            <li>The original Hitachi wand HV250R has a rocker switch with the off position being in the middle.</li>
            <li>It is much weaker and far less effective.</li>
            <li>With the wand alone, I get intense quick multiple orgasms of amazingness</li>
            <li>Luckily I can chuck it in the trash (after a cool down period) and chalk it up to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use and has lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li>I surprised her with this Hitachi wand funny thing is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple cheap knockoffs of this unit before finally deciding it might be worth spending the extra money and buying it for the brand name.</li>
            <li>Pay a little more and get the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>New model is heavier, and your arm figures that out fast.</li>
            <li>My wife has the older model, and thought it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li>need a blanket or such between them and the head to control the intensity some and others, like me, like to be able to pinpoint the vibrations using the tip of the G-spot addition externally....  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic, reliable and lasts for years..  </li>
            <li>love this product, had my last one for ten years before the cord shorted out.  </li>
            <li>The low setting is high on most other massager&#x27;s and the high setting is so powerful that it&#x27;ll knock your socks off, curl your toes, and make your eyeballs fall out of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I tried it out, it was a little strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The original seller was &amp;#34;Mega_deals813&amp;#34;, and I can&#x27;t leave a product review on their site because it looks like they&#x27;re long gone.</li>
            <li>This massager didn&#x27;t last 15 minutes before it became very hot and shut-off.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this massager.</li>
            <li>who says online dating can not result in a highly satisfactory relationship.....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, and have to others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;like a little better would be the Pocket Rocket</li>
            <li>After a little explaining and a google image search with safe search turned off, her life was changed.</li>
            <li>so far so good, looking forward to see how it holds up after some serious use.</li>
            <li>Great for sore, tight muscles and other things....!</li>
            <li>I have two older Hitachi wands and they both have moe weight than the new wand.</li>
            <li>Also, worked really well on the tendonitis I developed in my tricept from using a walker.</li>
            <li>so if you are sensitive this might take some getting use to or might be to much.</li>
            <li>And it comes with an extra long cord, so you can get creative with where you want to use it.</li>
            <li>And this thing is built to last pretty much forever.  </li>
            <li>And this thing is built to last pretty much forever.  </li>
            <li>the switch is different, its lighter, the head is removable and its not as powerful.  </li>
            <li>This is not some cheap massager that is going to die out on you within the first few months or year.  </li>
            <li>Even low setting is a bit intense at first, but after a bit of practice, you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I can only use the low speed with an adapter because it is so strong on my &amp;#34;special button&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>the exception of a rabbit vibrator, which I also cannot live without)</li>
            <li>They advertise as new and they are repairing these.</li>
            <li>and I have to buy a new one every couple years</li>
            <li>New amounts of alone</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, you live together.  </li>
            <li>They told me they get these particular devices directly from Hitachi.  </li>
            <li>OK...at the risk of sounding risque, I have owned a Hitachi Magic Wand for several years, due to *</li>
            <li>and it has definitely lived up to that name ;)</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well and it is quiet.  </li>
            <li>WOW WHEE!</li>
            <li>No more magic here.</li>
            <li>and ive never heard her scream so loud!  </li>
            <li>This is the second time I purchased this item, and this newer version is very unferior to the older one.</li>
            <li>Which is awesome, because my #1 complaint with all vibrators is that they are not strong enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Hitachi for over 10 years which finally died and I was really looking forward to getting a new one.  </li>
            <li>This one is much lighter and much less powerful.</li>
            <li>If a Hitachi wand is being sold less than this price, it is most likely a replica</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter and less powerful.  </li>
            <li>It may very well be worth half the price. . .  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to suprise my partner and she was less than excited</li>
            <li>I received this item and it was clearly refurbished with non-Hitachi parts.</li>
            <li>And if only lightly pressed to skin, it rattles, pressing harder gets rid of the rattle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s outside is too soft and it doesn&#x27;t vibrate intensely.</li>
            <li>The real Hitachi product is terrific.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that she rarely wants to come out of her room anymore, even when her grandkids are over.</li>
            <li>As far as the motor goes, it is in NO way comparable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for 8 years so far with no problems.</li>
            <li>I thought it was much &#x27;softer&#x27; than it actually is.</li>
            <li>and then it quit completely.</li>
            <li>I paid too much for this massager for it to last one month.</li>
            <li>AND WOW GET THIS</li>
            <li>As such, I&#x27;m not going to tell you much about the product itself.  </li>
            <li>I chose this rating because the product arrived on time, it was reasonablly priced, and it was what I was expecting as far as quality.</li>
            <li>Very durable and made to last.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who&#x27;s complaining about it being too loud needs to reevaluate their life decisions.</li>
            <li>It looks kinda retro-industrial and not the least bit sexy.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>just wow.</li>
            <li>it does is supply powerful, high-speed vibration to a very specific part of the female anatomy to produce results that are...</li>
            <li>even says in the instructions that you can&#x27;t use it over 25 min without a 30 min cool down.</li>
            <li>Makes an unusual really loud noise when on the high setting and high / low shwitch center smells like burned wires when running.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase, especially as someone who has spent countless dollars on batteries for other vibrators.</li>
            <li>On a serious note things have gotten even better since we bought it</li>
            <li>It may be because I am used to a &amp;#34;massager&amp;#34; that can easily be used with one hand, but I found it to be a little too big.  </li>
            <li>It will have the low speed in one direction and a high speed in another direction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not good for sexual pleasure...</li>
            <li>Too lightweight, nowhere near as powerful, DIED in two days and NOT because I was missing the old one...</li>
            <li>It replaces one that I have had for a very long time that was very high quality.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing a new one from a local store for about $90.</li>
            <li>I often found it necessary to use the Hitachi Magic Wand late in the evening.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that the current product had almost the exact if not the exact heft and feel as the old one, at least to me.</li>
            <li>hitachi&#x27;s gspot attachment is good but for clitoral stim i had to take off the spongy head and press down on the hard plastic to feel the vibes enough.</li>
            <li>first I would like to say that i have recently purchased and used a real Hitachi wand and bought this one a few months after because my gf took the one i had for herself.  </li>
            <li>, the lamp dimmer at full power left the unit under powered just slightly.</li>
            <li>#34;wait, won&#x27;t such a great present make all my future presents seem lame in comparison?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>#34;wait, won&#x27;t such a great present make all my future presents seem lame in comparison?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews that stated the current product didn&#x27;t have the same feel in hand as the older one, so I was prepared for this when I opened the box.</li>
            <li>I was just hoping for some relief from my menstrual pains, but the product barely worked.</li>
            <li>The wifes old one wore out after several years of use.</li>
            <li>My old one finally broke.</li>
            <li>I have had wands since the mid 90&#x27;s and not one of my wands sounded as loud or smelled like burned wires.</li>
            <li>Both massagers are the same size &amp; are quite loud.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other products from pure romance and fantasy gifts.  </li>
            <li>the lady loves it so much she uses it to massage her body almost every day, works extremely well apparently.</li>
            <li>But may be a little strong on other areas.</li>
            <li>It even adds a little extra fun in the bedroom for my boyfriend to play with.</li>
            <li>This is an imitation of the real product, do not trust this</li>
            <li>You can try putting a towel down first then use it, it will make the vibration less intense.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but if you like vibrators, I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>In the end if this happens near the big moment, not only are you frowning but you also get a heaping dose of the heat that I mentioned earlier.</li>
            <li>I imagine that it will last a very short time, unlike my former unit which is about 15 years old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, if you don&#x27;t reach the big moment fast, you are just going to end up waiting till the thing over heats or until whatever its touching goes numb.</li>
            <li>But the *REAL* reason that we got it was for use down below, and it does not dissapoint.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Just get one, don&#x27;t waste time with &#x27;cheap&#x27; other massagers, they just don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>The ad is very misleading, the tiny generic picture is actually one of the genuine article, but the product I received was a fake.</li>
            <li>I got my Hitachi in less than a week when it was supposed to take much longer.</li>
            <li>when I finaly took the wand out of her hands, and layed her down to show her my real reason for buying this almost instantly</li>
            <li>Seems very sturdy and well-made and should last longer than my previous massager.</li>
            <li>This bad boy packs every bit of punch you&#x27;ve ever seen in porn, but in real life it&#x27;s even BETTER.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d heard great things about the Hitachi and decided to look it up for myself.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t review a lot of products - but this one deserves a good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It does a good job</li>
            <li> Good product and I</li>

            <li> there you have it, it does a good job at it&#x27;s manufacture intended purchase, either buy it on Amazon or just steal your wife&#x27;s / girlfriend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Good buy</li>
            <li> Can be used for muscle massage as well as for erotic pleasure.</li>
            <li> It is a good massager</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my Hitachi Magic Wand for 20 years... and it has performed beautifully for all my massaging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product itself is great but don&#x27;t order from this seller because it is fake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And I probably dont need to elaborate on why this is so great.</li>
            <li> After reading even more great reviews about the wand, I decided to add it to my wishlist.</li>
            <li> They too have all been very pleased with this massager.  </li>
            <li> If more women knew about the magic wand, it could change the world!!</li>
            <li> Okay, lets start off with the pro&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> You already know they love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an AMAZING \\&quot;stress reliever\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Amazing my G/F loves it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also amazing during intercourse for both him and her.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this anymore, it is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, the product is amazing, but check the product when you receive it and make sure it&#x27;s an authentic product, and happy massaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> i bought this massager for my gf, and after looking around and seeing so many good review about this massager i decided to buy it for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure hitachi thought reducing the weight was a good idea, and it probably is.</li>
            <li> /lo switch is a nice feature-</li>
            <li> well i dont think i am allowed to write the kind of review that is needed here....</li>
            <li> Nice right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the price was nice.</li>
            <li> and I could honestly say it was a muscle massager.</li>
            <li> honestly don&#x27;t know why you haven&#x27;t bought this yet.  </li>
            <li> honestly don&#x27;t know why you haven&#x27;t bought this yet.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked it the speed/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to own the knock-off that I have read people&#x27;s complaints about breaking in a matter of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to own it period. . .</li>
            <li> EVERY WOMAN should own a Hitachi Wand, the \\&quot;Wand of Wonder,\\&quot; as I reverently call it.  </li>
            <li> Whatever you need it for, it is sure to be, good.</li>
            <li> This is very good at stimulation and at the right angle</li>
            <li> When I first heard about the Hitachi Magic Wand it was touted as the best vibrator ever</li>
            <li> This massager works great as a full body massager.</li>
            <li> So I bought a new one and its perfect every time.</li>
            <li> After receiving it I was relieved that it was in fact the mythical magic wand that I&#x27;d heard so many good things about.</li>
            <li> and now she says is by far the best toy she ever had.</li>
            <li> I guess to each their own. :)</li>
            <li> (Great fun, by the way.</li>
            <li> magic wand is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful massager which I like to use on the highest intensity, but it is loud &amp; will overheat.  </li>
            <li> Well okay then, Hitachi you are keeping a smile on her face!!!  </li>
            <li> You both will have a LOT more fun with this!!!  </li>
            <li> should have known the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> It was very light and the foam head was detachable.</li>
            <li> It has a large semisoft rubber tip that feels great.</li>
            <li> it,s a bit noisey...but not horrible...</li>
            <li> it worked even better for me....</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s region seems more engorged, tighter, better, when we use this</li>
            <li> , this is NOT the Hitachi Magic Wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is still the best product on the market, and I only gave it a four because it didn&#x27;t work out for us.</li>
            <li> The service was great but the electric cord on the wand leaves much to be desired inasmuch as it seems to want to curl up every time you use it longer than 10 mins.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just humorous.  </li>
            <li> We have tried many different massagers but this one is the best!</li>
            <li> Ive heard great things about the real item</li>
            <li> I assume it got over heated and died, it heats up REAL quickly</li>
            <li> i heard hitachi magic wand was the cadillac of vibes...</li>
            <li> head is way more flexible</li>
            <li> After I put some layers in between it and my clit, it felt a lot better.</li>
            <li> The Magic Wand can get me from ho-hum to f</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is electrical.</li>
            <li> It still is better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get 17 years of wear out of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is one of many toys.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Better than the rattling knock off  </li>
            <li> If you have one you love it.</li>
            <li> Simply the best!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  </li>
            <li> All Hitachi Magic Wand&#x27;s come with a 1-year manufacturers warranty as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kudos from the boyfriend as well :)</li>
            <li> My magic wand relaxes me like nothing else can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my favorite for many years....</li>
            <li> Betty Dodson introduced me this one many years ago.....</li>
            <li> Also works for body, which is what it was initially for, but works great either way!</li>
            <li> and I love it...</li>
            <li> Any girls that love messages here you go.</li>
            <li> If you ever wanted to know what it&#x27;s like to shake hands with Wally West, this might be able to tell you.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you just want to be able to relax by yourself.  </li>
            <li> Hitachi Magic Wand.  </li>
            <li> Hitachi Magic Wand.  </li>
            <li> Because you&#x27;ve maxed out your gift giving, nothing will be able to compare.  </li>
            <li> Because you&#x27;ve maxed out your gift giving, nothing will be able to compare.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended this to many, many friends who have bought it after listening to my stories raving about this massager.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Its definitely magical.</li>
            <li> This is considered the best personal massager on the market for a reason.  </li>
            <li> It has made me, even without it, more orgasmic.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> For my favorite girl friends, this is the gift that I give.  </li>
            <li> I decided to replace it with a LELO product (which cost twice as much as this) because of the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> The LELO is ok, but nothing compares to the Hitachi Magic Wand.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love and</li>
            <li> I have suggested this massager to many women over the years.</li>
            <li> Hitachi Magic Wand HV250R</li>
            <li> It will work on men too :)</li>
            <li> but I think more than two speeds are needed for this puppy.  </li>
            <li> She now comes so fast and often she is a new woman, this is a wonderful product to own and use.  </li>
            <li> but it happened great by highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Despite these minor setbacks I will say it is wonderful to save on batteries.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my original wand that I have had for 17 years!</li>
            <li> After some checking and research and looking at a GENUINE Hitachi Magic Wand, I was convinced that what I purchased was a Magic Wand wannabe, not manufactured by Hitachi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very good at various angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lowest price available is $54.95 which is what Hitachi Magic, an authorized retailer, sell&#x27;s it for.</li>
            <li> Probably the best money I&#x27;ve spent this year.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t THAT good.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t pitch my original Hitachi before trying this one out.</li>
            <li> Original Hitachi Magic Wands are made in Japan.  </li>
            <li> The fact that the head is detachable for easy boiling to keep it clean at all times is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> i strongly recommend  this massager.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I have severe back, neck and shoulder pain and this massager works very effective on relieving most of the pain in those areas.</li>
            <li> I had an AMAZING experience with this product the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I ordered it thinking ok on sale cool</li>
            <li> The price is pretty cheap for a Hitachi and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> The newer model is much more lightweight, which may be a positive for many.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s HUGE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and switch speeds with one hand.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my fault for ordering something so cheap and from someone called US Wholesaler 33.</li>
            <li> Had the same wand for 4 years and it worked great.</li>
            <li> and i lostmy receipt and wahl is going to fix or replace my massager for free cause</li>
            <li> sure, it goes, but not as powerful.  </li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t know how easy it would be to clean.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s sure is powerful..</li>
            <li> It is much more powerful than you would think.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> both are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also works great for back and neck massages too!  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few items I would say everybody should own to appreciate it!!!  </li>
            <li> This product has some heft to it, so it isn&#x27;t cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> I find it works great on my lower back and sore</li>
            <li> Two speeds and low speed works great on any stiffness you might have.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy this wand.</li>
            <li> For couples who enjoy using a massager in the bedroom, this item is the gold</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great buy and would recommend it to anyone looking for extra spice in the bedroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you know if I break it anytime soon, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Because the Hitachi Magic Wand will still be ready to go, and will still be just as entertaining.  </li>
            <li> Because the Hitachi Magic Wand will still be ready to go, and will still be just as entertaining.  </li>
            <li> My massager is now 4 years old and still works as good as it did the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li> this one is not as good as the old type.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has a REAL Hitachi magic wand and it is way better than this.</li>
            <li> Pros - Very powerful \\&quot;intense\\&quot; massager.</li>
            <li> and I have found it to be very useful with our without attachments.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously the most impressive massager I have ever used.</li>
            <li> She liked the weight of the older one.</li>
            <li> I used it one time on my partner&#x27;s ehum* male parts and he was way too quick for me, but for all my women who review this, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> but if it blows up any time soon, it was worth the money just to get that knot out of my calf!</li>
            <li> The motor was changed (which was not at all close to the original strength of the Hitachi motor).</li>
            <li> I first saw the Magic Wand, I thought \\&quot;this does not look like a sex toy.\\</li>
            <li> It looks like the original one</li>
            <li> The original Hitachi wand HV250R doesn&#x27;t have a removable foam head.</li>
            <li> The original Hitachi wand HV250R is made in Japan.</li>
            <li> The rounded switch panel reveals that this is not an original Hitachi product.  </li>
            <li> It is not the original Hitachi.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> is definitely an original product of Hitachi or Vibratex.</li>
            <li> This is the original brand.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I know Hitachi doesn&#x27;t like for people to review this as a vibrator, but that&#x27;s exactly what I bought it for</li>
            <li> First trip scheduled in two weeks... :-)</li>
            <li> It works great, I thought it would have a little more voltage</li>
            <li> $50-60 might seem kind of pricey at first, but this is likely the best present you&#x27;re going to find for under $1000.</li>
            <li> $50-60 might seem kind of pricey at first, but this is likely the best present you&#x27;re going to find for under $1000.</li>
            <li> Older one more powerful and can adjust speeds better.</li>
            <li> This is the best, after a hard week of work to come to the best massage therapy, you can&#x27;t get no better than that.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, does what its supposed to, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes to use it on special occasions.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they will make this right!</li>
            <li> The price was right!</li>
            <li> Five minutes into it early Christmas morn, she has a great orgasm and then told me she wanted to spend the rest of Christmas day in the bedroom with her new toy!</li>
            <li> (I wouldn&#x27;t count the one I threw away after the first ten minutes from Spencer&#x27;s) but this product is still GREAT.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s cord operated and not battery, power is never a problem and it&#x27;s always operating at full speed.  </li>
            <li> Good for back massager.</li>
            <li> My physical therapist recommended this product (they use it in their clinics) to work on the area and it does a really good job.</li>
            <li> The ones that sell for close to $75 and who address the fact that they are a REAL Hitachi product are a better bet.  </li>
            <li> cause she keeps her wand running at full speed.  </li>
            <li> and she said it is good for deep tissue.  </li>
            <li> It does have a cord, which will definitely save you on batteries, and it&#x27;s a good length, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind it being a bit longer.</li>
            <li> only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t look like a sex toy, but that could be a good thing too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Just wait til you experience two people at full strength plus Hitachi helping out.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I think it&#x27;s good for back massages and stuff like that too, but I haven&#x27;t tested that theory out yet haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good product and like a lot of people stated the cord is short and</li>
            <li> electric massagers work by having a mechanical components dig or kneed your muscles via some kind of rotating action.  </li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it for her back.</li>
            <li> I would just spend a bit more and get the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I would reccomend this product, even though I&#x27;ve heard the real thing is better.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping it would be more intense and vibrate deeper into the tissue.  </li>
            <li> I think that both are too large &amp; would be perfect if cut in half the size.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here not so much to talk about the Wand itself, but the new lifestyle you&#x27;ll be buying when you get this wand for your loved ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new product is flimsy and cheap like so many products now made overseas.</li>
            <li> It can be a little overwhelming but it was definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li> great product, the intensity settings could be a tad bit much for the (intended) female user, but trust me, you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> Almost too quickly.</li>
            <li> I received an actual authentic Hitachi Magic Wand.</li>
            <li> After several subsequent uses she now tells me this is the best Christmas gift I&#x27;ve ever given her.  </li>
            <li> PUT SUPER GLUE ON IT</li>
            <li> Only 2 speeds but overall great product!!</li>
            <li> The original Hitachi wand HV250R is very top heavy (feels like most of the weight is in the head) when you hold it in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was seriously not an orgasmic woman before I get the Hitachi Wand and now am!!!  </li>
            <li> Only complaints - the cord is not so sexy, but the tradeoff is its more powerful than batteries</li>
            <li> This new one works OK but is so inferior in craftsmanship, materials, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super happy with it anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and really relieves aches and pains without tiring out the person giving the massage!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> however, after reading the reviews and becoming concerned about this not being authentic, I did some research on this product and discovered that making knock-offs of it seems to be big business!</li>
            <li> I tell my guy friends to buy one for the woman he wants to please and have sex with often...but hide it/keep possession of it, otherwise he will not be needed as often!!</li>
            <li> Great for achy muscles or just to add a little spice to the bedroom.  </li>
            <li> You might not be able to use the high setting at first, but when you do OMG!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thing is, it&#x27;s a different KIND of power.</li>
            <li> It looked powerful.</li>
            <li> Either way, this thing is powerful.</li>
            <li> Out of the box,  my husband even noticed that it was far more lightweight and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> It is a shame they don&#x27;t make drill bit attachments for this wand, it is so powerful it would drill a hole in the wall.  </li>
            <li> So so so so sooo worth the money.</li>
            <li> worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> It is fairly powerful</li>
            <li> Very much worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking to soothe sore muscles or have a bit of fun</li>
            <li> I was having fun with this toy.</li>
            <li> it works well with powerful vibrations to all kinds of neat things to my fiance.</li>
            <li> its fun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Hitachi Magic Wand Massager work via vibrations, so there is no mechanical action digging into your sore muscles, rather the repeating vibrations stimulate your muscles into releasing knots.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> (like he always does before he buys anything) and surprised me with the Magic Wand for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  </li>
            <li> I do like the fact that both are electric &amp; are powerful.  </li>
            <li> totally worth it</li>
            <li> The weight is much lighter than a REAL Hitachi magic wand</li>
            <li> You will not see an authentic Hitachi Magic Wand manufactured in China, Korea, USA, Africa or any other country.</li>
            <li> ** me in about 3-4 minutes if the mood is right.</li>
            <li> Came right on time.</li>
            <li> Hitachi got it right when they made this massager.  </li>
            <li> I was right up there with him, too.</li>
            <li> Just add to what you&#x27;d normally do, and suddenly it&#x27;s at least twice as awesome.  </li>
            <li> For anyone with experience with a Hitachi, you would know as soon as you opened the package that the massager is way too light in weight, and the speeds are not as high.</li>
            <li> I went right ahead with full power, it did the, ummm...job, very well ;)</li>
            <li> I am pleased with its speed settings, but after using it for greater than 20 minutes I do notice it smells a little like burning plastic.</li>
            <li> When this new one arrived it seemed flimsy and light weight, not at all sturdy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like a battery operated vibe just more powerful, it&#x27;s a totally different</li>
            <li> Be prepared, because even at low speed, this is the most powerful massager I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li> The foam cover comes off easily and the massager  is not as sturdy as the old ones.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my girlfriend for Valentine&#x27;s, she says she loves it, but as a fair warning it might not be for extra sensitive people.</li>
            <li> Comes with an extra piece that makes things more fun.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s the one who can tell you about the awesomeness of this product, my own experience is more secondary.  </li>
            <li> Wow, that&#x27;s strong and 2)</li>
            <li> Just give your inferior gift next year, and bust out the Hitachi Magic Wand for some fun</li>
            <li> And it actually does a great job on your neck and back, too.</li>
            <li> Just give your inferior gift next year, and bust out the Hitachi Magic Wand for some fun</li>
            <li> And it actually does a great job on your neck and back, too.</li>
            <li> Just the low setting is more powerful</li>
            <li> Great for female and male stimulation.</li>
            <li> I previously stated that it was a good product but have since then changed my mind.</li>
            <li> This yields some very intense orgasms.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason the Hitachi has the reputation it does: it does one thing and does it very, very well</li>
            <li> The new Magic Wand is not as powerful as my old one, though it is quieter.  </li>
            <li> The recipient of this device has made it clear that she will never go without one of these fine masssagggers again.  </li>
            <li> you have never used an Hitachi before, it can be very intense at first.</li>
            <li> It works in minutes on my wife and just makes my job that much easier!  </li>
            <li> At first, I was hesitant, since it has a cord instead of batteries.  </li>
            <li> If it dies in the next decade, I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also suggest investing in a longer power cord ;)</li>
            <li> They have changed the head of the magic wand  to be a cover rather than a solid rubber head.</li>
            <li> This sucker worked great, makes b*tches cum in under 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> This is not my first one</li>
            <li> would be willing to retract this if they tried to settle anything , but I doubt they will.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> One the first day I received the Hitachi, everything worked well.</li>
            <li> Or, if you&#x27;re a great big meanie like I am and you hold it against your partner for a long time on its highest setting, scream-inducing and thrashing-about-making.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the Magic Wand for about 3 months or so, but it looks pretty well built.</li>
            <li> but I personally would prefer it  to have more power than it does.</li>
            <li> only one more word...  yes.</li>
            <li> It was a Fourth of July grand finale for the ages.</li>
            <li> for the real wand, it rocks my world and the quality is undeniable!</li>
            <li> My wife had been able to reach climax before, but it was always a 45 minute ordeal and if she came up short</li>
            <li> - Only two speeds but the two speeds are ok, not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not any better than a $20 chinese knockoff, in fact if it weren&#x27;t for the frayed cord, i would have stuck with the one i had.</li>
            <li> Of course, I plugged it in immediately and instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li> Also, the area around the switch became hot to the point where i couldn&#x27;t use it (the smell turned me off first).</li>
            <li> This is my second Hitachi and I love it just as the first, which is why I got another.</li>
            <li> My dog got a hold of the cord on the first one.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The claims of 3 minutes to bliss are not exaggerated.  </li>
            <li> This is lighter weight than the Brookstone Personal Massager which appears to be better made.  </li>
            <li> it does the job well and fast!</li>
            <li> Its use for self pleasuring in addition to muscle massage makes it it extremely useful, and appreciated as a present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute;e and the first day she had it she used it again and again and again.</li>
            <li> She really loves it!</li>
            <li> Got the exact reaction from my boyfriend that I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I can pretty much guarantee it&#x27;s not going</li>
            <li> Yes, this is my first (REAL) vibrator</li>
            <li> Even more concerned was the possibility that this noise was a signal of more serious problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it on low and that is plenty strong for me, but it does have a high setting if you need a bit more</li>
            <li> It broke too easily and was constantly a burden.</li>
            <li> Take together time to the next level!&lt;br /&gt;OK, intimacy isn&#x27;t always easy.  </li>
            <li> As directed, I made certain that each use never exceeded twenty minutes.</li>
            <li> little intense at first, but alot of fun learning:)</li>
            <li> Very well made and certainly does the job...</li>
            <li> nice if it was a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Low is almost as strong as the original High, the new High is DAMN High.</li>
            <li> Now, we do really use it for back and neck massages and it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Every woman I&#x27;ve ever talked to that doesn&#x27;t have one of these is afraid of it because of the legendary power of the wand....</li>
            <li> You may have to wrap something around it to keep it from being too intense.</li>
            <li> Now I will have to pay again to get the REAL DEAL.</li>
            <li> NOW every time we get intimated she wants to use it.</li>
            <li> and I think that this time I received a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; as opposed to a real one.  </li>
            <li> I opened it up inside and checked the \\&quot;guts\\&quot; to see if it was a real one or just making them cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> she began too shake, and jump she orgasm like never before this Hitachi wand is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This really pissed me off.</li>
            <li> Product received fast and as promised</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is VERY loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> not so much yall.</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing is DH needs to be gentle</li>
            <li> works on every muscle, light weight, quiet.  </li>
            <li> I lost track of how much I like it for some number of years and will never do it again.</li>
            <li> DIDDN&#x27;T PAY THE PRICE OF THE REAL DEAL-</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t anything that can do what this &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; wand can do.  </li>
            <li> and NOT THE REAL THING.</li>
            <li> The attachments not so much, they numbed the feeling somewhat for me, so if you need to put a towel or something between you and the Hitachi you wouldn&#x27;t need to with a attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very versatile despite the size.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Used it for sore muscles too and it works really well.</li>
            <li> It looks real unless you know the real deal</li>
            <li> In the weeks since Christmas, I&#x27;ve found myself left to my own devices for hours at a time, while my partner is left with this device.  </li>
            <li> The two speeds allow for deep muscle massage or a lighter impact in more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> It is very powerful even on low</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t apply the same amount of preassure, softer more porous material too so its harder to clean and absorbs some of the vibration.  </li>
            <li> the switches were different and the head was not like my original.  </li>
            <li> The switch is even different from the original.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try some other brands to compare and find more power.</li>
            <li> The original Hitachi wand HV250R has a rocker switch with the off position being in the middle.</li>
            <li> It is much weaker and far less effective.</li>
            <li> With the wand alone, I get intense quick multiple orgasms of amazingness</li>
            <li> Luckily I can chuck it in the trash (after a cool down period) and chalk it up to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use and has lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> I surprised her with this Hitachi wand funny thing is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple cheap knockoffs of this unit before finally deciding it might be worth spending the extra money and buying it for the brand name.</li>
            <li> Pay a little more and get the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> New model is heavier, and your arm figures that out fast.</li>
            <li> My wife has the older model, and thought it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li> need a blanket or such between them and the head to control the intensity some and others, like me, like to be able to pinpoint the vibrations using the tip of the G-spot addition externally....  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic, reliable and lasts for years..  </li>
            <li> love this product, had my last one for ten years before the cord shorted out.  </li>
            <li> The low setting is high on most other massager&#x27;s and the high setting is so powerful that it&#x27;ll knock your socks off, curl your toes, and make your eyeballs fall out of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I tried it out, it was a little strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The original seller was &amp;#34;Mega_deals813&amp;#34;, and I can&#x27;t leave a product review on their site because it looks like they&#x27;re long gone.</li>
            <li> This massager didn&#x27;t last 15 minutes before it became very hot and shut-off.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this massager.</li>
            <li> who says online dating can not result in a highly satisfactory relationship.....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, and have to others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;like a little better would be the Pocket Rocket</li>
            <li> After a little explaining and a google image search with safe search turned off, her life was changed.</li>
            <li> so far so good, looking forward to see how it holds up after some serious use.</li>
            <li> Great for sore, tight muscles and other things....!</li>
            <li> I have two older Hitachi wands and they both have moe weight than the new wand.</li>
            <li> Also, worked really well on the tendonitis I developed in my tricept from using a walker.</li>
            <li> so if you are sensitive this might take some getting use to or might be to much.</li>
            <li> And it comes with an extra long cord, so you can get creative with where you want to use it.</li>
            <li> And this thing is built to last pretty much forever.  </li>
            <li> And this thing is built to last pretty much forever.  </li>
            <li> the switch is different, its lighter, the head is removable and its not as powerful.  </li>
            <li> This is not some cheap massager that is going to die out on you within the first few months or year.  </li>
            <li> Even low setting is a bit intense at first, but after a bit of practice, you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I can only use the low speed with an adapter because it is so strong on my &amp;#34;special button&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> the exception of a rabbit vibrator, which I also cannot live without)</li>
            <li> They advertise as new and they are repairing these.</li>
            <li> and I have to buy a new one every couple years</li>
            <li> New amounts of alone</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, you live together.  </li>
            <li> They told me they get these particular devices directly from Hitachi.  </li>
            <li> OK...at the risk of sounding risque, I have owned a Hitachi Magic Wand for several years, due to *</li>
            <li> and it has definitely lived up to that name ;)</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well and it is quiet.  </li>
            <li> WOW WHEE!</li>
            <li> No more magic here.</li>
            <li> and ive never heard her scream so loud!  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this item, and this newer version is very unferior to the older one.</li>
            <li> Which is awesome, because my #1 complaint with all vibrators is that they are not strong enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Hitachi for over 10 years which finally died and I was really looking forward to getting a new one.  </li>
            <li> This one is much lighter and much less powerful.</li>
            <li> If a Hitachi wand is being sold less than this price, it is most likely a replica</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter and less powerful.  </li>
            <li> It may very well be worth half the price. . .  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to suprise my partner and she was less than excited</li>
            <li> I received this item and it was clearly refurbished with non-Hitachi parts.</li>
            <li> And if only lightly pressed to skin, it rattles, pressing harder gets rid of the rattle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s outside is too soft and it doesn&#x27;t vibrate intensely.</li>
            <li> The real Hitachi product is terrific.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that she rarely wants to come out of her room anymore, even when her grandkids are over.</li>
            <li> As far as the motor goes, it is in NO way comparable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 8 years so far with no problems.</li>
            <li> I thought it was much &#x27;softer&#x27; than it actually is.</li>
            <li> and then it quit completely.</li>
            <li> I paid too much for this massager for it to last one month.</li>
            <li> AND WOW GET THIS</li>
            <li> As such, I&#x27;m not going to tell you much about the product itself.  </li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the product arrived on time, it was reasonablly priced, and it was what I was expecting as far as quality.</li>
            <li> Very durable and made to last.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who&#x27;s complaining about it being too loud needs to reevaluate their life decisions.</li>
            <li> It looks kinda retro-industrial and not the least bit sexy.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> just wow.</li>
            <li> it does is supply powerful, high-speed vibration to a very specific part of the female anatomy to produce results that are...</li>
            <li> even says in the instructions that you can&#x27;t use it over 25 min without a 30 min cool down.</li>
            <li> Makes an unusual really loud noise when on the high setting and high / low shwitch center smells like burned wires when running.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase, especially as someone who has spent countless dollars on batteries for other vibrators.</li>
            <li> On a serious note things have gotten even better since we bought it</li>
            <li> It may be because I am used to a &amp;#34;massager&amp;#34; that can easily be used with one hand, but I found it to be a little too big.  </li>
            <li> It will have the low speed in one direction and a high speed in another direction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not good for sexual pleasure...</li>
            <li> Too lightweight, nowhere near as powerful, DIED in two days and NOT because I was missing the old one...</li>
            <li> It replaces one that I have had for a very long time that was very high quality.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing a new one from a local store for about $90.</li>
            <li> I often found it necessary to use the Hitachi Magic Wand late in the evening.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that the current product had almost the exact if not the exact heft and feel as the old one, at least to me.</li>
            <li> hitachi&#x27;s gspot attachment is good but for clitoral stim i had to take off the spongy head and press down on the hard plastic to feel the vibes enough.</li>
            <li> first I would like to say that i have recently purchased and used a real Hitachi wand and bought this one a few months after because my gf took the one i had for herself.  </li>
            <li> , the lamp dimmer at full power left the unit under powered just slightly.</li>
            <li> #34;wait, won&#x27;t such a great present make all my future presents seem lame in comparison?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> #34;wait, won&#x27;t such a great present make all my future presents seem lame in comparison?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews that stated the current product didn&#x27;t have the same feel in hand as the older one, so I was prepared for this when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> I was just hoping for some relief from my menstrual pains, but the product barely worked.</li>
            <li> The wifes old one wore out after several years of use.</li>
            <li> My old one finally broke.</li>
            <li> I have had wands since the mid 90&#x27;s and not one of my wands sounded as loud or smelled like burned wires.</li>
            <li> Both massagers are the same size &amp; are quite loud.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other products from pure romance and fantasy gifts.  </li>
            <li> the lady loves it so much she uses it to massage her body almost every day, works extremely well apparently.</li>
            <li> But may be a little strong on other areas.</li>
            <li> It even adds a little extra fun in the bedroom for my boyfriend to play with.</li>
            <li> This is an imitation of the real product, do not trust this</li>
            <li> You can try putting a towel down first then use it, it will make the vibration less intense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but if you like vibrators, I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> In the end if this happens near the big moment, not only are you frowning but you also get a heaping dose of the heat that I mentioned earlier.</li>
            <li> I imagine that it will last a very short time, unlike my former unit which is about 15 years old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, if you don&#x27;t reach the big moment fast, you are just going to end up waiting till the thing over heats or until whatever its touching goes numb.</li>
            <li> But the *REAL* reason that we got it was for use down below, and it does not dissapoint.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Just get one, don&#x27;t waste time with &#x27;cheap&#x27; other massagers, they just don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> The ad is very misleading, the tiny generic picture is actually one of the genuine article, but the product I received was a fake.</li>
            <li> I got my Hitachi in less than a week when it was supposed to take much longer.</li>
            <li> when I finaly took the wand out of her hands, and layed her down to show her my real reason for buying this almost instantly</li>
            <li> Seems very sturdy and well-made and should last longer than my previous massager.</li>
            <li> This bad boy packs every bit of punch you&#x27;ve ever seen in porn, but in real life it&#x27;s even BETTER.</li>
            <li> I put some fabric in between it and my clit partially to dull the sensation and partially to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> My 4-year old asked me whatit was the other day</li>
            <li> If I leave it on too long, my clit goes kind of numb, so I would alternate between on and off, on and off, and that seemed to work</li>
            <li> The long shape allows for reaching harder-to-access areas such as the middle of the shoulders.</li>
            <li> The head is soft and rubbery and less likely to cause numbness or itching.</li>
            <li> My only issue, and it&#x27;s a minor one, is that the head doesn&#x27;t seem to be as well-attached as it could be; it has somewhat of a variable buzz to it, but I think it might be just this unit.</li>
            <li> I hope this one last that long.</li>
            <li> Needed to have an extra for our long trips.  </li>
            <li> For the same price that I paid for the original, this one is a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t expect it will last very long at all.</li>
            <li> When you turned it on it would come on then quickly slow down to an almost stop then finally quit working completely on both high and low.</li>
            <li> Even if you have a low miticlorian count and minimal training in the way of the jedi, with this tool in your hands you will be a regular mace windu!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny spent and no more batteries!</li>
            <li> I have had a knot in my calf due to a lo back injury and the sciatic nerve being in a spasm for 6 months, causing the muscles of my left leg to be contracted all the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of ugly, it comes in a box that looks like it time-traveled from 1976, and has two settings: 1)</li>
            <li> Now on those long football sundays, she has something to keep herself occupied.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a long time to get out of any appliance.</li>
            <li> The old one use to last for a LONG TIME and this one didn&#x27;t make it past a couple months.</li>
            <li> I wish I had thought of getting something like this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> wands\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll see the difference in the original packaging and the fake, as well as other photos of whata fake magic wand looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for NOT cheating, Green Web and shame on all the other dealers at Amazon and to Amazon itself by not doing anything about these cheaters!</li>
            <li> It definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and I mean everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding comments about the current product feeling lighter than the old ones--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, easy to use, and won&#x27;t raise any awkward conversations if it&#x27;s noticed by kids or those who aren&#x27;t in the know about all the uses of a &amp;#34;personal massager&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll actually have LESS pressure for all future gifts.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll actually have LESS pressure for all future gifts.  </li>
            <li> I owned one in the early 1980s, bought it to help relieve migraine headaches (yes, I was young and naive; it might have saved my marriage if I had realized it had, ahem, other uses, but that&#x27;s another story).</li>
            <li> When this one arrived it was identical (other than the blue color) to a cheaper version Shibari Wand</li>
            <li> Your mind, among other things, will be totally blown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Therefore I doubt that there will be a very long life span with this purchase</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for relieving boredom on a dull Saturday afternoon.)</li>
            <li> Overall, I have not had one bad experience with my Hitachi Magic Wand Massager.</li>
            <li> , then you realize quickly it isn&#x27;t as heavy, and doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as the actual product.  </li>
            <li> , you already know it&#x27;s impossible to top this one.  </li>
            <li> , you already know it&#x27;s impossible to top this one.  </li>
            <li> She was kidding around but probably only half kidding.  </li>
            <li> Total use was less than 1 hour before dying.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t 100% until I compared it to a friends and found it indeed felt like half the weight, the head shape and texture was different, and the speeds/strength was weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reading thru all the other reviews at Amazon I was amazed that even at Amazon dealers are selling cheap chinese fake shit.</li>
            <li> I think the size is a little larger and the one that I&lt;</li>
            <li> This is NOT a real Hitachi product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, just get the Cadillac of personal massagers...</li>
            <li> this thing broke the second day the rubber piece that attaches to the head didnt stay snug waste of money</li>
            <li> It lasts only a few minutes, you can buy it at alibaba.com, the state-run garbage selling point of china for about 8 US $ if you buy</li>
            <li> This is not a real Hitachi.</li>
            <li> Taking the attachments on and off will weaken the foam pad and eventually it will be bent and unable to stay focused in the right</li>
            <li> My last massager lasted approximately 7 months (which is longer than the average of 4 months per other reviewers) with heavy useage before it quit vibrating &amp; only made a loud noise.  </li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> (not becuase she was not interested), just didnt seem to have the power we were hoping for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d look for other wands before buying a Hitachi.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped bothering with other vibrators entirely over the past 8 years.</li>
            <li> If you plan on using this only a few times, ya go ahead get it if you want to blow that cash!</li>
            <li> only other vibrator I&#x27;ve owned was a small vibrating bullet I got at one of those sex toy parties.</li>
            <li> not sure whats the big deal about it ...</li>
            <li> You see each other all the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, what other gift are you thinking about?  </li>
            <li> Other massagers I&#x27;ve bought were too superficial.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands.</li>
            <li> But from what I have read it is supposed to work well for other parts of the body.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to the massage game this may work, but if you&#x27;ve owned a Hitachi...</li>
            <li> The problem with this is that it does not actually target the muscles specifically, and the mechanical action ranges from useless to pain</li>
            <li> may even be a bargain for that matter, but, selling a knock-off product with the same box and assuming the same name is false advertising.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, you need to have a pretty tough nether region to be able to handle this bad boy.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to leave my wife a stress releiver for those lonely nights that she&#x27;s missing her man.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Iv&#x27;e been late several times over this thing!</li>
            <li> Maybe you want to get a few rounds of that new video game in, but don&#x27;t want to bore your partner to death.  </li>
            <li> I used to have hair down there, no....not anymore.</li>
            <li> but my wahl percussion massager is 40 bucks at walgreens down the street</li>
            <li> OTHERS ARE LESS STIMULATING.</li>
            <li> I had ordered previously.</li>
            <li> This will get you where you need to be in 5 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> &amp; A HALF.</li>
            <li> Seriously, that&#x27;s the only thing I can say.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Prior one failed after several years of use and liquid getting in the motor.  </li>
            <li> batteries to mess.</li>
            <li> My thigh muscles are ultra tight as a result of the trauma and surgery.</li>
            <li> I was like a little kid when I received this item</li>
            <li> I was a little embarrassed pulling this thing out that looks like a BASEBALL BAT almost.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> We had never used anything like this before, and I was a little put off by the appearance and size of the massager.  </li>
            <li> It is a little aggressive for everyday use.</li>
            <li> After experiencing the real deal this is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I happened to buy a few differant attachments .and</li>
            <li> I had a road bike accident which resulted in a broken femur, surgery and physical therapy.</li>
            <li> I thought the thing was a missing the motor.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll have trouble stopping and will end up orgasming because I just can&#x27;t wait any longer.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I almost lost my mind while using it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I bought from Green Web</li>
            <li> I use this in between classes, before sex, and if he&#x27;s too tired later on, after sex.</li>
            <li> im incredibly disappointed as ive had 2 real hitachis in the past and was obviously looking to replace my last one.&lt;br /&gt;definitely FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
            <li> Works well on stiff muscles.</li>
            <li> NOT NEARLY AS STRONG AS ORGIONAL.</li>
            <li> So every other review of this massager either on Amazon or on other websites is either a blatant or subtle review for it&#x27;s use as a woman&#x27;s personal sex toy.  </li>
            <li> THIS Hitachi is either a fake or a ridiculous new edition.</li>
            <li> maybe for virgins and those who need very little stimulation.</li>
            <li> I ask her what is hurting on you so bad that you are using this so much</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mother this past mother&#x27;s day.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what all the press is about.  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure how it will hold up</li>
            <li> So - please note that this review is for the FAKE wand that I received and not the actual wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gizmo Liquidation was the seller of this fake item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reordered and low and behold</li>
            <li> the product that i was sent is not an actual hitachi, but a fake.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, when I used it for the past 2 nights, I noticed a burning smell when I used it.</li>
            <li> I want to write an insane review like the hilarious ones I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> But I say don&#x27;t waste your money trying a knockoff brand when you know this one works!</li>
            <li> No more batteries and no more slow speeds.  </li>
            <li> if you google fake hitachi, youll see that this description matches fake hitachis and not the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked when I received this new Hitachi massager.</li>
            <li> They last a really long time IF you don&#x27;t use any of the stupid attachments.</li>
            <li> Hurt my lower back at work and for some reason my butt cheeks and down my legs also hurt really bad.</li>
            <li> so see if she could come faster and hard.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY DOUBT you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been late to work over this thing.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to file a complaint at the moment.  </li>
            <li> I wish I wasn&#x27;t so naive.</li>
            <li> My wife was always slow in coming if she could come at all.  </li>
            <li> I mean women please.</li>
            <li> but if u hold it there too long it does make it numb..</li>
            <li> but this is a scam and the only bad seller I&#x27;ve encountered on amazon.</li>
            <li> AND, the Hitachi that I owned (and purchased right here on Amazon)kicked ALL those awful muscle aches in the proverbial kiester, every time.  </li>
            <li> I reordered from same source (stupid me).  </li>
            <li> Only a imbecile cannot tell what use you is for.</li>
            <li> You know what you&#x27;re doing in the bedroom, but you can&#x27;t bring your A game every night.  </li>
            <li> heats up really bad after just a few min...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s obviously a fake</li>
            <li> But gets the job done, over and over again without fail.  </li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> but my seller sold me a fake thing.</li>
            <li> Given that this is a personal massager, this is disgusting.</li>
            <li> If you leave it lying around, you won&#x27;t get weird looks from your in-laws, so that&#x27;s probably a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY</li>
            <li> There are plenty of websites that will help you to distinguish whether or not you have a fake or a read</li>
            <li> Just Google \\&quot;Hitachi fake</li>
            <li> I was unable to return the product because it arrived without paperwork.</li>
            <li> I checked online, and unfortunately I did get a fake/counterfeit version of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So after doing some research online, I found out this is indeed a knock off or fake from China.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about boring her with my cheesy TV choices; she&#x27;s off in the other room,</li>
            <li> In my awkward moment of, this is weird, I got online and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed!</li>
            <li> Crazy me tried it like that.....</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this purchase, but my husband insisted that we try it.  </li>
            <li> It acted like it had a bad motor.</li>
            <li> wasnt bad either</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;d get frustrated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed in Amazon for allowing this.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Well, after reading the thousands of five-star reviews about this product, I finally decided to order one for my wife and I.  One of the best decisions that I have ever made!  Now, we do really use it for back and neck massages and it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  Since it&#x27;s cord operated and not battery, power is never a problem and it&#x27;s always operating at full speed.  But the *REAL* reason that we got it was for use down below, and it does not dissapoint.  Guys, do yourself a favor and get one of these for you and your woman.  It works in minutes on my wife and just makes my job that much easier!  Makes her good to go for the rest of the night!</li>
            <li> Burned a hole through my clit. I used to have hair down there, no....not anymore. That&#x27;s all burned off too. Good for back massager. But c&#x27;mon ladies....I know why you initially bought this.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other products from pure romance and fantasy gifts.  Never again.  No more batteries and no more slow speeds.  This is a must have for anyone, male or female.  The best friend you never knew you wanted.</li>
            <li> Loved product...it,s a bit noisey...but not horrible...I happened to buy a few differant attachments .and when I was switching them...I pulled off the white cushion off the head....Crazy me tried it like that.....omg.........it worked even better for me....within seconds....must try</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it!!! little intense at first, but alot of fun learning:) so far so good, looking forward to see how it holds up after some serious use.</li>
            <li> Excellant device if you are horny and want to get off.  I was like a little kid when I received this item had to open the package and use it ASAP.</li>
            <li> Every woman I&#x27;ve ever talked to that doesn&#x27;t have one of these is afraid of it because of the legendary power of the wand.... We were no different.... The thing is, it&#x27;s a different KIND of power. It&#x27;s not like a battery operated vibe just more powerful, it&#x27;s a totally different sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts: It seems to help improve blood flow to the female genitals. My wife&#x27;s region seems more engorged, tighter, better, when we use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just awesome.</li>
            <li> I had a road bike accident which resulted in a broken femur, surgery and physical therapy. My thigh muscles are ultra tight as a result of the trauma and surgery. My physical therapist recommended this product (they use it in their clinics) to work on the area and it does a really good job. Also, worked really well on the tendonitis I developed in my tricept from using a walker. Good news is I&#x27;m off the walker and using a cane. Progress.</li>
            <li> Be prepared, because even at low speed, this is the most powerful massager I&#x27;ve ever encountered. You may have to wrap something around it to keep it from being too intense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Hitachi for over 10 years which finally died and I was really looking forward to getting a new one.  When I opened it up. I thought the thing was a missing the motor.  It has no weight to it. the switches were different and the head was not like my original.  I thought  I was getting a deal for the price when I got this but it&#x27;s obviously a fake and I got what I paid for.  Now I will have to pay again to get the REAL DEAL.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift after my battery powered vibrator died.  At first, I was hesitant, since it has a cord instead of batteries.  It looked powerful. And it totally is. Which is awesome, because my #1 complaint with all vibrators is that they are not strong enough.  The Hitachi is.  Seriously, you need to have a pretty tough nether region to be able to handle this bad boy. He is AGGRESSIVE.  But gets the job done, over and over again without fail.  And it comes with an extra long cord, so you can get creative with where you want to use it.</li>
            <li> Had one of these for years.  It finally broke.  When this new one arrived it seemed flimsy and light weight, not at all sturdy.  It broke in 5 minutes.  I forgot about it for several months.  I reordered from same source (stupid me).  Second time it didn&#x27;t even last 30 seconds.  The real Hitachi product is terrific.  This is NOT a real Hitachi product.  Check all the sources on this website.  The ones that sell for close to $75 and who address the fact that they are a REAL Hitachi product are a better bet.  Be careful!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mother this past mother&#x27;s day.  She couldn&#x27;t be any happier.  Now on those long football sundays, she has something to keep herself occupied.  The only downside is that she rarely wants to come out of her room anymore, even when her grandkids are over.</li>
            <li> This massager works great as a full body massager. It&#x27;s easy to use and really relieves aches and pains without tiring out the person giving the massage!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This works so well on my neck and back! I have been looking for something that can I can use myself.</li>
            <li> This is an imitation of the real product, do not trust this, this is NOT the Hitachi Magic Wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an inferior device.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review a lot of products - but this one deserves a good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my Hitachi Magic Wand for 20 years... and it has performed beautifully for all my massaging needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 years... that&#x27;s a long time to get out of any appliance. If it dies in the next decade, I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to give them as wedding gifts... call them &#x27;marriage savers&#x27; if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get one, don&#x27;t waste time with &#x27;cheap&#x27; other massagers, they just don&#x27;t last. I went through TWO different plug-in types before I met my Hitachi. Don&#x27;t waste your money, just get the Cadillac of personal massagers... you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> i bought this massager for my gf, and after looking around and seeing so many good review about this massager i decided to buy it for her. as soon as got she used it  and now she says is by far the best toy she ever had. NOW every time we get intimated she wants to use it. if you want to spice up things in the bed in want to keep you lady HAppy i strongly recommend  this massager.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what all the press is about.  I purchased this to suprise my partner and she was less than excited (not becuase she was not interested), just didnt seem to have the power we were hoping for.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my wife. but she doesn&#x27;t like it at all....she said it&#x27;s to aggressive and is causing etching ....also has only two speeds so you can&#x27;t adjust the speed vibrations. not good for sexual pleasure...sorry</li>
            <li> or droids. Either way, this thing is powerful. Even if you have a low miticlorian count and minimal training in the way of the jedi, with this tool in your hands you will be a regular mace windu!</li>
            <li> I have two older Hitachi wands and they both have moe weight than the new wand. The manufacturer probably engineered out some of the costs to maximize their profit! I know about these product managers! Anyway, being lighter the wand does not give deep massage as earlier models. I&#x27;d look for other wands before buying a Hitachi.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd hitachi. They last a really long time IF you don&#x27;t use any of the stupid attachments. Taking the attachments on and off will weaken the foam pad and eventually it will be bent and unable to stay focused in the right place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend using any attachments. Just use it as is and it will last forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest investing in a longer power cord ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best vibrator ever&lt;br /&gt;the only one you&#x27;ll ever need&lt;br /&gt;(with the exception of a rabbit vibrator, which I also cannot live without)</li>
            <li> My wife has the older model, and thought it was time to replace it. The newer model is much more lightweight, which may be a positive for many. Not for her. She liked the weight of the older one. This is still the best product on the market, and I only gave it a four because it didn&#x27;t work out for us. I&#x27;m sure hitachi thought reducing the weight was a good idea, and it probably is. Just not for us.</li>
            <li> They have changed the head of the magic wand  to be a cover rather than a solid rubber head. The foam cover comes off easily and the massager  is not as sturdy as the old ones.</li>
            <li> I ordered it thinking ok on sale cool&lt;br /&gt;It was a knock and broke on the 2nd time i tried to use it</li>
            <li> This is a great product, constructed sturdily, and performs to expectations.  The toggle off/hi/lo switch is a nice feature- no buttons to wear out or damage.  A+</li>
            <li> OK...at the risk of sounding risque, I have owned a Hitachi Magic Wand for several years, due to *cough* muscle aches.  AND, the Hitachi that I owned (and purchased right here on Amazon)kicked ALL those awful muscle aches in the proverbial kiester, every time.  This one?  No way, Jose.  Out of the box,  my husband even noticed that it was far more lightweight and flimsy.  As far as the motor goes, it is in NO way comparable.  The switch is even different from the original.  I plan on returning this to Amazon ASAP. For the same price that I paid for the original, this one is a complete disappointment. Take a pass on this one, and read the reviews.  I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t pitch my original Hitachi before trying this one out.</li>
            <li> This sucker worked great, makes b*tches cum in under 30 seconds. I actually used it on my D-I-C-K once, actually made me climax. Buckets.... thats all I have to say. But this trucker broke after about 10 uses. It makes me cry at night</li>
            <li> The service was great but the electric cord on the wand leaves much to be desired inasmuch as it seems to want to curl up every time you use it longer than 10 mins.  Therefore I doubt that there will be a very long life span with this purchase and I will try probably somewhere else next time.  This is not my first one and I think that this time I received a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; as opposed to a real one.  I opened it up inside and checked the \\&quot;guts\\&quot; to see if it was a real one or just making them cheaper.  The old one use to last for a LONG TIME and this one didn&#x27;t make it past a couple months.</li>
            <li> I have had a knot in my calf due to a lo back injury and the sciatic nerve being in a spasm for 6 months, causing the muscles of my left leg to be contracted all the time. This has gradually started to loosen up the muscle. I wish I had thought of getting something like this a long time ago. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couplke weeks so I am not sure how it will hold up but if it blows up any time soon, it was worth the money just to get that knot out of my calf!</li>
            <li> As my title suggests:  I totally forget this thing can be used as a massager. I think I&#x27;ve used it as such twice in the eight years I&#x27;ve owned it and then only because my husband reminded me that it has that use lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve had mine for 8 years so far with no problems. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and switch speeds with one hand.  It&#x27;s very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some need a blanket or such between them and the head to control the intensity some and others, like me, like to be able to pinpoint the vibrations using the tip of the G-spot addition externally....  If I use it without pin-pointing it just feels like someone is shaking the heck out of my genitals.... For some that,s AWESOME for me it&#x27;s just humorous.  So if you get one, tinker around with what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY DOUBT you&#x27;ll be disappointed. I&#x27;ve stopped bothering with other vibrators entirely over the past 8 years. They just can&#x27;t match up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been late to work over this thing.  It&#x27;s helped me learn to have multiple, rolling, and extended orgasm so I can now have them also with partnered sex. It&#x27;s an AMAZING \\&quot;stress reliever\\&quot;. You should get one, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it can help sore shoulders.</li>
            <li> Great for sore, tight muscles and other things....! It&#x27;s great to have something that isn&#x27;t battery operated so hopefully it doesn&#x27;t die any time soon!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend. This yields some very intense orgasms. It can be a little overwhelming but it was definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li> This is everything we hoped it would be and no batteries required!  It is sturdy and well made.  We have tried many different massagers but this one is the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a truck driver and I wanted to leave my wife a stress releiver for those lonely nights that she&#x27;s missing her man. I surprised her with this Hitachi wand funny thing is my wife immidiately began to massage her neck, and back she even used it on my lower back OMG as a massager this thing works miracles. when I finaly took the wand out of her hands, and layed her down to show her my real reason for buying this almost instantly she began too shake, and jump she orgasm like never before this Hitachi wand is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Too lightweight, nowhere near as powerful, DIED in two days and NOT because I was missing the old one... THIS Hitachi is either a fake or a ridiculous new edition. This is en route BACK to Amazon for a refund. If you&#x27;re new to the massage game this may work, but if you&#x27;ve owned a Hitachi... This will only disappoint you.  I hope Amazon gets the hint.</li>
            <li> I have severe back, neck and shoulder pain and this massager works very effective on relieving most of the pain in those areas. It is great to use for stress relief. I highly recommend this massager.</li>
            <li> Amazing my G/F loves it but the should make a cordless one. It is very powerful even on low so if you are sensitive this might take some getting use to or might be to much.</li>
            <li> The product worked for maybe 5 minutes before stopping. Ive heard great things about the real item but my seller sold me a fake thing. I never heard back from them. it&#x27;s my fault for ordering something so cheap and from someone called US Wholesaler 33. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM. I am trying to file a complaint at the moment.  I was just hoping for some relief from my menstrual pains, but the product barely worked. I tried to settle the problem and send it back but they never responded. I wish I wasn&#x27;t so naive. I&#x27;m sure the product itself is great but don&#x27;t order from this seller because it is fake.&lt;br /&gt;I would be willing to retract this if they tried to settle anything , but I doubt they will. I try to hope for the best in people but this is a scam and the only bad seller I&#x27;ve encountered on amazon.</li>
            <li> This is not a Hitachi, it&#x27;s a knockoff. The ad is very misleading, the tiny generic picture is actually one of the genuine article, but the product I received was a fake. I figured that I was avoiding a fake because I was buying from Amazon and the price was similar to authentic Hitachi&#x27;s. This really pissed me off.</li>
            <li> It has power!!! I thought it was much &#x27;softer&#x27; than it actually is. It is great, I really enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product and was unsure.  After receiving it and using, this product I would recommend to any and all!! Product received fast and as promised</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend because she has aches and pains now and then.  Now all of a sudden she is hurting all the time cause she keeps her wand running at full speed.  I ask her what is hurting on you so bad that you are using this so much and she said it is good for deep tissue.  Well okay then, Hitachi you are keeping a smile on her face!!!  I do not think I have ever seen her so happy in my life.  The only drawback is that I am concerned about the electric bill.  It is a shame they don&#x27;t make drill bit attachments for this wand, it is so powerful it would drill a hole in the wall.  I guess I should of let her do this review instead of me.  I tried it on my shoulder like the guy on the box and it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I guess to each their own. :)</li>
            <li> I received this item and it was clearly refurbished with non-Hitachi parts. Given that this is a personal massager, this is disgusting. Do not purchase from this company. The motor was changed (which was not at all close to the original strength of the Hitachi motor). They advertise as new and they are repairing these. Find another company.</li>
            <li> well i dont think i am allowed to write the kind of review that is needed here.... lets just say my mail order husband has taken me to all the places that start with an O......OOOOOOmaha......OOOOOOKlahoma......you name it and we have been there.  who says online dating can not result in a highly satisfactory relationship.....i have found it with my mail order husband....Mr. Hitachi</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this item, and this newer version is very unferior to the older one. Older one more powerful and can adjust speeds better.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I bought it for. Seems very sturdy and well-made and should last longer than my previous massager.</li>
            <li> Had the same wand for 4 years and it worked great. This one is much lighter and much less powerful. I&#x27;m a little disappointed!</li>
            <li> Okay, lets start off with the pro&#x27;s! This is very good at stimulation and at the right angle gives you the best moment you can get! Plus its powerful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW THE CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it three times, it just stopped working. I assume it got over heated and died, it heats up REAL quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massager head, WILL fall off or move off constantly. It&#x27;s not glued on there ladies and gents. In the end if this happens near the big moment, not only are you frowning but you also get a heaping dose of the heat that I mentioned earlier. Nice right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is VERY loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not very good at various angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT discreet despite what others tell you. Only a imbecile cannot tell what use you is for. I mean women please. There is enough videos on the internet for anyone to know what that thing beside you bed is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, if you don&#x27;t reach the big moment fast, you are just going to end up waiting till the thing over heats or until whatever its touching goes numb. Though if you do get there, it is GREAT with the wand above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVER ALL:&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. It broke too easily and was constantly a burden. If you plan on using this only a few times, ya go ahead get it if you want to blow that cash! But don&#x27;t be deceived next time you see those &#x27;videos&#x27; on the net. It really isn&#x27;t THAT good.</li>
            <li> I got my Hitachi in less than a week when it was supposed to take much longer. And I probably dont need to elaborate on why this is so great. Very powerful, does what its supposed to, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best vibe ever.  Only complaints - the cord is not so sexy, but the tradeoff is its more powerful than batteries and I have to buy a new one every couple years bc it burns out.</li>
            <li> One the first day I received the Hitachi, everything worked well. In subsequent days, it became noisier and noisier. As directed, I made certain that each use never exceeded twenty minutes. It made no difference. I often found it necessary to use the Hitachi Magic Wand late in the evening. I became concerned that it would disturb my wife. Even more concerned was the possibility that this noise was a signal of more serious problems. As a result, I decided to stop using the unit and called Amazon in hopes that they would come up with a solution to my concerns. I was advised to return the unit. I did return the unit. I will order another unit.</li>
            <li> This is a legendary massager, and all the glowing reviews for it are well-earned. It definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and I mean everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding comments about the current product feeling lighter than the old ones--I owned one in the early 1980s, bought it to help relieve migraine headaches (yes, I was young and naive; it might have saved my marriage if I had realized it had, ahem, other uses, but that&#x27;s another story). I read the reviews that stated the current product didn&#x27;t have the same feel in hand as the older one, so I was prepared for this when I opened the box. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the current product had almost the exact if not the exact heft and feel as the old one, at least to me. My only issue, and it&#x27;s a minor one, is that the head doesn&#x27;t seem to be as well-attached as it could be; it has somewhat of a variable buzz to it, but I think it might be just this unit. It&#x27;s not objectionable enough to trigger a return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this massager, don&#x27;t be. It&#x27;s a wonder.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this purchase, but my husband insisted that we try it.  Ladies this is absoulutly mind blowing! Every women should own one!</li>
            <li> This thing is orgasmic!! So so so so sooo worth the money. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because there are only two intensity settings. Now if this thing had an intensity slider...Wow.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, great product, the intensity settings could be a tad bit much for the (intended) female user, but trust me, you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> The wifes old one wore out after several years of use. She loves this one. Excellent product. A must have item.</li>
            <li> It works great, I thought it would have a little more voltage but it still does the job, I am happy</li>
            <li> Bought this for my GF Haha this thing broke the second day the rubber piece that attaches to the head didnt stay snug waste of money</li>
            <li> i heard hitachi magic wand was the cadillac of vibes...not so much yall. maybe for virgins and those who need very little stimulation. the price was nice. but my wahl percussion massager is 40 bucks at walgreens down the street and i lostmy receipt and wahl is going to fix or replace my massager for free cause i only had it 2 months...even with no receipt! try getting that from hitachi..i doubt it. hitachi&#x27;s gspot attachment is good but for clitoral stim i had to take off the spongy head and press down on the hard plastic to feel the vibes enough.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason the Hitachi has the reputation it does: it does one thing and does it very, very well indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not talking about massaging sore, aching muscles. It might do a so-so job of that, though I don&#x27;t know anyone who&#x27;s tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does is supply powerful, high-speed vibration to a very specific part of the female anatomy to produce results that are...well, breathtaking. Or, if you&#x27;re a great big meanie like I am and you hold it against your partner for a long time on its highest setting, scream-inducing and thrashing-about-making. (Great fun, by the way. I highly recommend it for relieving boredom on a dull Saturday afternoon.)</li>
            <li> what can I say. It&#x27;s a classic, reliable and lasts for years..  Good for all muscle aches and pains. Always reliable, runs and runs</li>
            <li> first I would like to say that i have recently purchased and used a real Hitachi wand and bought this one a few months after because my gf took the one i had for herself.  so i bought this one and here are the things i have noticed:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  it does work, as in, it turns on and vibrates...&lt;br /&gt;which leads me to the cons:  its kinda like replacing a BMW with a civic in terms of performance.  sure, it goes, but not as powerful.  It feels lighter and cheaper.  It looks cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;other cons: head is way more flexible so you can&#x27;t apply the same amount of preassure, softer more porous material too so its harder to clean and absorbs some of the vibration.  heats up really bad after just a few min...even says in the instructions that you can&#x27;t use it over 25 min without a 30 min cool down.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about the Hitachi Magic Wand it was touted as the best vibrator ever and it has definitely lived up to that name ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other vibrator I&#x27;ve owned was a small vibrating bullet I got at one of those sex toy parties. Cheap and it broke after about 10 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first saw the Magic Wand, I thought \\&quot;this does not look like a sex toy.\\&quot; It doesn&#x27;t, at all. It&#x27;s actually a muscle massager and I believe the people at Hitachi do not like people praising it as a great vibrator. I say if it works, go with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it out, it was a little strong. I put some fabric in between it and my clit partially to dull the sensation and partially to keep it clean. The head looks like it&#x27;s made of a porous type of material and I didn&#x27;t know how easy it would be to clean. After I put some layers in between it and my clit, it felt a lot better. If I leave it on too long, my clit goes kind of numb, so I would alternate between on and off, on and off, and that seemed to work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this vibrator is its strength. This ain&#x27;t no wussy vibrator. The Magic Wand can get me from ho-hum to f*** me in about 3-4 minutes if the mood is right. Sometimes I&#x27;ll have trouble stopping and will end up orgasming because I just can&#x27;t wait any longer. I&#x27;ve only used it on low and that is plenty strong for me, but it does have a high setting if you need a bit more power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried any of the attachments, so I&#x27;m looking forward to trying them out. I&#x27;ve only had the Magic Wand for about 3 months or so, but it looks pretty well built. I&#x27;ll let you know if I break it anytime soon, but so far so good. It does have a cord, which will definitely save you on batteries, and it&#x27;s a good length, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind it being a bit longer. That&#x27;s what extension cords are for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t look like a sex toy, but that could be a good thing too. My 4-year old asked me whatit was the other day and I could honestly say it was a muscle massager. If you leave it lying around, you won&#x27;t get weird looks from your in-laws, so that&#x27;s probably a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but if you like vibrators, I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> love this product, had my last one for ten years before the cord shorted out.  worth every penny.  very effective</li>
            <li> I love this product. Came right on time. Love the fact that it is electrical. Recommended for anyone. It does a good job</li>
            <li> The new Magic Wand is not as powerful as my old one, though it is quieter.  The attachments do not stay on as well either.  It still is better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> IF SHE NEEDS LOTS OF STIMULATION THEN THIS IS WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED.  BIG BULKY BUT A GOLD STANDARD ALL OTHERS ARE LESS STIMULATING.</li>
            <li> Ive had this for one month. it&#x27;s been used maybe 3 times and it stopped working. It started acting like it had a short in the wire and then it quit completely. I paid too much for this massager for it to last one month. Ive sent an email to the seller requesting a replacement. Hopefully they will make this right!</li>
            <li> I have seen HEAVEN AND GOD AND JESUS AND ANGELS AND WOW GET THIS YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY I PROMISE!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my original wand that I have had for 17 years! I hope this one last that long. It looks like the original one so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get 17 years of wear out of it.</li>
            <li> THIS MASSAGER DOES NOT WORK. I AM WAITING TO HEAR FROM COMPANY ON HOW TO RETURN FOR A REPLACEMENT. THIS ONE DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> Almost too quickly. The head is soft and rubbery and less likely to cause numbness or itching. Best one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well and it is quiet.  It is fairly powerful but I personally would prefer it  to have more power than it does. I am going to try some other brands to compare and find more power. The Hitachi has been the best one I&#x27;ve tried yet though.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the most impressive massager I have ever used. I obviously use it for what 99% of women use it for, and I must say it does not disappoint for those who need a stronger vibration. It&#x27;s also amazing during intercourse for both him and her. I am very satisfied with this purchase, especially as someone who has spent countless dollars on batteries for other vibrators. Ladies, you want this in your life!</li>
            <li> This was quite the ....wow!&lt;br /&gt;It is one of many toys.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is DH needs to be gentle or I will explode!</li>
            <li> After ordering I noticed the reviews claiming that it was a counterfeit product and worried that I&#x27;d have to deal with returning it. After receiving it I was relieved that it was in fact the mythical magic wand that I&#x27;d heard so many good things about. It&#x27;s simple, easy to use, and won&#x27;t raise any awkward conversations if it&#x27;s noticed by kids or those who aren&#x27;t in the know about all the uses of a &amp;#34;personal massager&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Better than the rattling knock off  it replaces. Price was yet another  bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Even included a not advertised extra attachment.</li>
            <li> I wished that we discovered this product years ago.  My wife was always slow in coming if she could come at all.  I got this product for her so see if she could come faster and hard.  We should have got this product years ago.  She now comes so fast and often she is a new woman, this is a wonderful product to own and use.  I highly recommend it, and have to others.</li>
            <li> If you have one you love it. If you don&#x27;t have one, you should get one! Very much worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: This is the second I&#x27;ve purchased. My old one finally broke. New model is heavier, and your arm figures that out fast. The two settings are separated by the off now. Low is almost as strong as the original High, the new High is DAMN High. Which means louder, boo at that. And if only lightly pressed to skin, it rattles, pressing harder gets rid of the rattle. I&#x27;m not super happy with it anymore. Time to save up for a fancy toy I guess!</li>
            <li> We use this all the time works great</li>
            <li> awesome product.  works on every muscle, light weight, quiet.  Simply the best! Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  only one more word...  yes.</li>
            <li> This bad boy packs every bit of punch you&#x27;ve ever seen in porn, but in real life it&#x27;s even BETTER. If you can&#x27;t get her off, this will... I promise.</li>
            <li> Got it today, used it today, and watched the fireworks. It was a Fourth of July grand finale for the ages. Well done, Hitachi. Well done.</li>
            <li> So - please note that this review is for the FAKE wand that I received and not the actual wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know, there are actually FAKE Hitachi Magic Wands. When this one arrived it was identical (other than the blue color) to a cheaper version Shibari Wand I had ordered previously. It was very light and the foam head was detachable. Anyway, it powered up once and KAPUT it was done. Gizmo Liquidation was the seller of this fake item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reordered and low and behold I received an actual authentic Hitachi Magic Wand. There are plenty of websites that will help you to distinguish whether or not you have a fake or a read Hitachi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following was taken from a website that helps you to tell if you have a fake:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The original Hitachi wand HV250R doesn&#x27;t have a removable foam head. The foam head is a solid one-piece structure.&lt;br /&gt;2. The original Hitachi wand HV250R is very top heavy (feels like most of the weight is in the head) when you hold it in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;3. The original Hitachi wand HV250R has a rocker switch with the off position being in the middle. It will have the low speed in one direction and a high speed in another direction.&lt;br /&gt;4. Hitachi protects it&#x27;s brand and sets a minimum advertised price for the massager which means the price cannot be lower than what is set by Hitachi. This lowest price available is $54.95 which is what Hitachi Magic, an authorized retailer, sell&#x27;s it for. If a Hitachi wand is being sold less than this price, it is most likely a replica so BE AWARE!&lt;br /&gt;5. The original Hitachi wand HV250R is made in Japan. You will not see an authentic Hitachi Magic Wand manufactured in China, Korea, USA, Africa or any other country. All Hitachi Magic Wand&#x27;s come with a 1-year manufacturers warranty as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the boxes are similar, but not the same. Just Google \\&quot;Hitachi fake wands\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll see the difference in the original packaging and the fake, as well as other photos of whata fake magic wand looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the real wand, it rocks my world and the quality is undeniable!</li>
            <li> This will get you where you need to be in 5 minutes or less. But you won&#x27;t want to stop there. Enough said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect massager and this seems to be it.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item back on March 3 and was just told by friends that we had a knock off.  After some checking and research and looking at a GENUINE Hitachi Magic Wand, I was convinced that what I purchased was a Magic Wand wannabe, not manufactured by Hitachi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> WOW WHEE! Grt massager. Kudos from the boyfriend as well :) Definitely worth every penny spent and no more batteries!</li>
            <li> So I bought this for my wife of 20+ years.  We&#x27;re are in our fifties so you can file this under \\&quot;it&#x27;s never too late\\&quot;!  My wife had been able to reach climax before, but it was always a 45 minute ordeal and if she came up short she&#x27;d get frustrated.  After kids, ten plus years ago, she gave up on trying.  Well I got her this for Christmas as a stocking stuffer!  Five minutes into it early Christmas morn, she has a great orgasm and then told me she wanted to spend the rest of Christmas day in the bedroom with her new toy! She was kidding around but probably only half kidding.  After several subsequent uses she now tells me this is the best Christmas gift I&#x27;ve ever given her.  So guys, gals, ditch the $5000 on a pearl necklace (the real kind) and just buy this.  You both will have a LOT more fun with this!!!  If Amazon offered the ability to only once a year, give one product a 10 star rating, this product would get my 10 stars!</li>
            <li> the lady loves it so much she uses it to massage her body almost every day, works extremely well apparently.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s sure is powerful..it&#x27;s HUGE. I was a little embarrassed pulling this thing out that looks like a BASEBALL BAT almost. but it has the two levels of strength. I went right ahead with full power, it did the, ummm...job, very well ;)</li>
            <li> Pros - Very powerful \\&quot;intense\\&quot; massager. It has a large semisoft rubber tip that feels great. It is much more powerful than you would think.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Only two speeds but the two speeds are ok, not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> My magic wand relaxes me like nothing else can. Every women in the world should have one. I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> The rounded switch panel reveals that this is not an original Hitachi product.  It is also fixed-voltage 110/120V so will not work outside of the Americas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple cheap knockoffs of this unit before finally deciding it might be worth spending the extra money and buying it for the brand name. It&#x27;s not any better than a $20 chinese knockoff, in fact if it weren&#x27;t for the frayed cord, i would have stuck with the one i had. And don&#x27;t listen to the rumors telling you to buy a lamp dimmer instead of the brand name speed controller, the lamp dimmer at full power left the unit under powered just slightly.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my girlfriend for Valentine&#x27;s, she says she loves it, but as a fair warning it might not be for extra sensitive people. Comes with an extra piece that makes things more fun.</li>
            <li> My husband bouht thus gor me. This messager Works as designed. I have no idea why it is not sold in stores.</li>
            <li> Well I like it , not sure whats the big deal about it ...yes it knocks off the edge but if u hold it there too long it does make it numb..lol...but overall I don&#x27;t regret my purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my favorite for many years....this is my second one.  Betty Dodson introduced me this one many years ago.....I lost track of how much I like it for some number of years and will never do it again.</li>
            <li> Works well for &amp;#34;pre party time&amp;#34; if you want to &amp;#34;get over the top&amp;#34; this does it well. Also works for body, which is what it was initially for, but works great either way! Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I received it on Monday, March 11, 2013... It came 3 days after I purchased which was like one month before it was supposed to come and I love it...</li>
            <li> DIDDN&#x27;T PAY THE PRICE OF THE REAL DEAL-HAVE ONE OF THSE AS WELL, BUT THIS IS MADE FROM PLASTIC &amp; THE CASE SURROUNDING THE VIBRATOR WAS CRACKED SAY AN IN. &amp; A HALF. PUT SUPER GLUE ON IT-SUPPOSE ITLL LAST FOR AWHILE. NOT NEARLY AS STRONG AS ORGIONAL.</li>
            <li> This device is so amazing! I almost lost my mind while using it a few weeks ago. I love it!</li>
            <li> You already know they love it! Well worth the money. Any girls that love messages here you go. This does the job.</li>
            <li> So, I gave this to my partner for Christmas.  She&#x27;s the one who can tell you about the awesomeness of this product, my own experience is more secondary.  As such, I&#x27;m not going to tell you much about the product itself.  It&#x27;s kind of ugly, it comes in a box that looks like it time-traveled from 1976, and has two settings: 1) Wow, that&#x27;s strong and 2) Oh god I think I&#x27;m being vibrated into another dimension.  If you ever wanted to know what it&#x27;s like to shake hands with Wally West, this might be able to tell you. I&#x27;m here not so much to talk about the Wand itself, but the new lifestyle you&#x27;ll be buying when you get this wand for your loved ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) New amounts of alone time!&lt;br /&gt;So, you live together.  You see each other all the time. Sometimes you just want to be able to relax by yourself.  Maybe you want to get a few rounds of that new video game in, but don&#x27;t want to bore your partner to death.  The solution? Hitachi Magic Wand.  In the weeks since Christmas, I&#x27;ve found myself left to my own devices for hours at a time, while my partner is left with this device.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about boring her with my cheesy TV choices; she&#x27;s off in the other room, perfectly content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Take together time to the next level!&lt;br /&gt;OK, intimacy isn&#x27;t always easy.  You know what you&#x27;re doing in the bedroom, but you can&#x27;t bring your A game every night.  Even athletes have their rest days. The solution? Hitachi Magic Wand.  This thing is like MSG for the bedroom.  Just add to what you&#x27;d normally do, and suddenly it&#x27;s at least twice as awesome.  Need to catch your breath for a second? Let Hitachi take some of the slack for a minute. Finally caught your second wind?  Just wait til you experience two people at full strength plus Hitachi helping out. Your mind, among other things, will be totally blown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Be the best gift giver EVER!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, what other gift are you thinking about?  I can pretty much guarantee it&#x27;s not going to be as well received as this. $50-60 might seem kind of pricey at first, but this is likely the best present you&#x27;re going to find for under $1000. And this thing is built to last pretty much forever.  You may be saying to yourself: &amp;#34;wait, won&#x27;t such a great present make all my future presents seem lame in comparison?&amp;#34;  Maybe.  But it won&#x27;t matter.  Because the Hitachi Magic Wand will still be ready to go, and will still be just as entertaining.  You&#x27;ll actually have LESS pressure for all future gifts.  Because you&#x27;ve maxed out your gift giving, nothing will be able to compare.  So no need to stress, you already know it&#x27;s impossible to top this one.  And because this thing is built like a Mack Truck, you know this present will be the one that keeps on giving.  Just give your inferior gift next year, and bust out the Hitachi Magic Wand for some fun times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t know why you haven&#x27;t bought this yet.  This thing is great for all genders, all sexualities, all levels of experience.  And it actually does a great job on your neck and back, too. Go forth, and spread the joy.ceived as this. $50-60 might seem kind of pricey at first, but this is likely the best present you&#x27;re going to find for under $1000.

            <li> There really isn&#x27;t anything that can do what this &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; wand can do.  If you need something to get her over the edge, this is it!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product and it arrived without any paperwork. I used it once and it malfunctioned and stopped working. It acted like it had a bad motor. When you turned it on it would come on then quickly slow down to an almost stop then finally quit working completely on both high and low. Total use was less than 1 hour before dying. I was unable to return the product because it arrived without paperwork. I ended up purchasing a new one from a local store for about $90.</li>
            <li> It Works like a messager should i guess, it is not the hand of god it is promised to be.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the product arrived on time, it was reasonablly priced, and it was what I was expecting as far as quality.</li>
            <li> the wording and advert for this product is misleading.  the product that i was sent is not an actual hitachi, but a fake.  the switch is different, its lighter, the head is removable and its not as powerful.  if you google fake hitachi, youll see that this description matches fake hitachis and not the real thing.  im incredibly disappointed as ive had 2 real hitachis in the past and was obviously looking to replace my last one.&lt;br /&gt;definitely FALSE ADVERTISING. and NOT THE REAL THING.</li>
            <li> Makes an unusual really loud noise when on the high setting and high / low shwitch center smells like burned wires when running. I have had wands since the mid 90&#x27;s and not one of my wands sounded as loud or smelled like burned wires. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for all of your massage needs... ahem... ALL of them.  I&#x27;ve abused this thing for over 4 years and it is still kicking.  I cannot recommend this anymore, it is AMAZING.  Two settings- OMG and OMFG Insane- both are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also works great for back and neck massages too!  XD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard great things about the Hitachi and decided to look it up for myself. After reading even more great reviews about the wand, I decided to add it to my wishlist. Not 24 hours later, a gracious being bought it for me and it was delivered the next day. Of course, I plugged it in immediately and instantly fell in love. I would recommend this to anyone looking to soothe sore muscles or have a bit of fun *wink wink*</li>
            <li> The Hitachi Magic Wand is a must have!!!  I have never been happier with a massager than this one.  My massager is now 4 years old and still works as good as it did the day I bought it.  Very durable and made to last.  This is not some cheap massager that is going to die out on you within the first few months or year.  Hitachi got it right when they made this massager.  Great for achy muscles or just to add a little spice to the bedroom.  I have recommended this to many, many friends who have bought it after listening to my stories raving about this massager.  They too have all been very pleased with this massager.  This is one of the few items I would say everybody should own to appreciate it!!!  MUST HAVE!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m righting this review after almost 2 years of use. Between the time I purchased it (December 3, 2012) and now (September 8, 2014) I was having fun with this toy. I used it off and on, but when I used it, it did its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, when I used it for the past 2 nights, I noticed a burning smell when I used it. Also, the area around the switch became hot to the point where i couldn&#x27;t use it (the smell turned me off first). I checked online, and unfortunately I did get a fake/counterfeit version of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original seller was &amp;#34;Mega_deals813&amp;#34;, and I can&#x27;t leave a product review on their site because it looks like they&#x27;re long gone. I thought Amazon &amp;#34;screened&amp;#34; their sellers to avoid fakes, but I guess I need to do my homework from now on. Luckily I can chuck it in the trash (after a cool down period) and chalk it up to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the product is amazing, but check the product when you receive it and make sure it&#x27;s an authentic product, and happy massaging.</li>
            <li> This massager didn&#x27;t last 15 minutes before it became very hot and shut-off. There was a tag on the cord that said if this occurred to discontinue use; well it didn&#x27;t matter anyway because it wouldn&#x27;t even turn back on. Should have sent it back but instead it ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> All I have to say about this is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;...If you&#x27;re use to battery operated toys go ahead and throw them away, you won&#x27;t need them after using Hitachi, or I should say you won&#x27;t want to use them!! This is my second Hitachi and I love it just as the first, which is why I got another. My dog got a hold of the cord on the first one.The attachments not so much, they numbed the feeling somewhat for me, so if you need to put a towel or something between you and the Hitachi you wouldn&#x27;t need to with a attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used an Hitachi before, it can be very intense at first. Just the low setting is more powerful then any battery operated toy I have ever used! You can try putting a towel down first then use it, it will make the vibration less intense. You might not be able to use the high setting at first, but when you do OMG!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iv&#x27;e been late several times over this thing! It&#x27;s just amazing. It even adds a little extra fun in the bedroom for my boyfriend to play with. He likes it to which is another plus. Oh, and I think it&#x27;s good for back massages and stuff like that too, but I haven&#x27;t tested that theory out yet haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONCE YOU GO HITACHI, THERE IS NO GOING BACK!</li>
            <li> its wonderful. it works well with powerful vibrations to all kinds of neat things to my fiance. its fun. thumbs up.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and like a lot of people stated the cord is short and it would&lt;br /&gt;be nice if it was a little longer.  I think the size is a little larger and the one that I&lt;br /&gt;like a little better would be the Pocket Rocket -Dr. Johnson.  Good product and I&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best items you can buy for the money. Great for female and male stimulation. Very versatile despite the size. I work out of town 5 days a week and it&#x27;s been a great way to keep Jody away. On a serious note things have gotten even better since we bought it I didn&#x27;t think it could but it happened great by highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is the cord it too short.  I would have liked it the speed/intensitly were variable as well.</li>
            <li> Very well made and certainly does the job...This product has some heft to it, so it isn&#x27;t cheaply made.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best, after a hard week of work to come to the best massage therapy, you can&#x27;t get no better than that.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes to use it on special occasions. It is a little aggressive for everyday use. Good product though</li>
            <li> So every other review of this massager either on Amazon or on other websites is either a blatant or subtle review for it&#x27;s use as a woman&#x27;s personal sex toy.  I guess that makes me an oddity, as I am a man, and I actually purchased this product for it&#x27;s intended manufactures use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most electric massagers work by having a mechanical components dig or kneed your muscles via some kind of rotating action.  The problem with this is that it does not actually target the muscles specifically, and the mechanical action ranges from useless to pain inducing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hitachi Magic Wand Massager work via vibrations, so there is no mechanical action digging into your sore muscles, rather the repeating vibrations stimulate your muscles into releasing knots. I find it works great on my lower back and sore shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it, it does a good job at it&#x27;s manufacture intended purchase, either buy it on Amazon or just steal your wife&#x27;s / girlfriend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> While there are more expensive options, this was recommended to me by a friend and I have found it to be very useful with our without attachments.  The two speeds allow for deep muscle massage or a lighter impact in more sensitive areas.  The long shape allows for reaching harder-to-access areas such as the middle of the shoulders.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it for her back. But may be a little strong on other areas. There are suggestions however to help with the over powering effects it may have on some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my wand for over 10 years and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I purchased this for a friend and she has thanked me over and over again.  Oh and did I mention that it&#x27;s a heck of a back Masager too!!</li>
            <li> Works well on stiff muscles. Two speeds and low speed works great on any stiffness you might have. Good buy</li>
            <li> This does just what it suppose to do. Massage you muscles and relax your body. I thoroughly enjoy this wand.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for someone and she liked it! The price was right! I have tried to do this review and it keeps telling me I need more words which is frustrating!</li>
            <li> The recipient of this device has made it clear that she will never go without one of these fine masssagggers again.  She just purrs when we use it.</li>
            <li> The price is pretty cheap for a Hitachi and it works amazingly well. Overall, I have not had one bad experience with my Hitachi Magic Wand Massager. Its definitely magical.</li>
            <li> Every couple should have one of these in their toy chest. Can be used for muscle massage as well as for erotic pleasure. Beware though, this massager is VERY powerful!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, that&#x27;s the only thing I can say.&lt;br /&gt;The magic wand is amazing. Anyone who&#x27;s complaining about it being too loud needs to reevaluate their life decisions. It&#x27;s a vibrator that you plug into a wall outlet. What were you expecting?</li>
            <li> It is not the original Hitachi.  It&#x27;s much lighter and less powerful.  I would just spend a bit more and get the real thing.  Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> For couples who enjoy using a massager in the bedroom, this item is the gold standard.&lt;br /&gt;No batteries to mess. Even low setting is a bit intense at first, but after a bit of practice, you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This one will definitely curl your toes and make your eyes roll back in your head!  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> It may be because I am used to a &amp;#34;massager&amp;#34; that can easily be used with one hand, but I found it to be a little too big.  I am pleased with its speed settings, but after using it for greater than 20 minutes I do notice it smells a little like burning plastic. Despite these minor setbacks I will say it is wonderful to save on batteries.</li>
            <li> This is considered the best personal massager on the market for a reason.  The fact that the head is detachable for easy boiling to keep it clean at all times is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t review it and its performance because I never switched it on. . . however, after reading the reviews and becoming concerned about this not being authentic, I did some research on this product and discovered that making knock-offs of it seems to be big business! I went to a local store where they sell these for about twice the price.  They told me they get these particular devices directly from Hitachi.  Though I did not remove the one I received from its plastic, I can say that the box is almost identical to the one in store. . . but it took me about 5 seconds to assess this device as a knock-off. The switch is different in feel, function, shape and color, the device is possibly an entire pound lighter than the one in the store, the head is a different shape and feel; the foam head is larger and removable possibly even made of a different material. . . and it is made in China.  Original Hitachi Magic Wands are made in Japan.  I can&#x27;t speak for its performance.  It may very well be worth half the price. . .  may even be a bargain for that matter, but, selling a knock-off product with the same box and assuming the same name is false advertising.  This is NOT the Hitachi everyone raves about lasting for 10+ years. . . it&#x27;s a bummer that I&#x27;ll probably just go back to that store and pay double. . . but I want the one that lasts for 10 years.  I want to write an insane review like the hilarious ones I&#x27;ve read. I don&#x27;t want to own the knock-off that I have read people&#x27;s complaints about breaking in a matter of weeks.  I don&#x27;t mind spending the shipping or whatever is needed to return it.  I don&#x27;t want to own it period. . . or even give it to anyone else to use.</li>
            <li> EVERY WOMAN should own a Hitachi Wand, the \\&quot;Wand of Wonder,\\&quot; as I reverently call it.  It has made me, even without it, more orgasmic. :)  With the wand alone, I get intense quick multiple orgasms of amazingness ALWAYS, even if I am \\&quot;not in the mood tonight, honey.\\&quot;  It always makes me in the mood as soon as I hear it humming.  Pavlovian response?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was seriously not an orgasmic woman before I get the Hitachi Wand and now am!!!  EVERY WOMAN SHOULD HAVE A HITACHI WAND!!!  For my favorite girl friends, this is the gift that I give.  I tell my guy friends to buy one for the woman he wants to please and have sex with often...but hide it/keep possession of it, otherwise he will not be needed as often!! ;)</li>
            <li> Prior one failed after several years of use and liquid getting in the motor.  I decided to replace it with a LELO product (which cost twice as much as this) because of the great reviews.  The LELO is ok, but nothing compares to the Hitachi Magic Wand. So I bought a new one and its perfect every time.</li>
            <li> My husband did his research (like he always does before he buys anything) and surprised me with the Magic Wand for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  We had never used anything like this before, and I was a little put off by the appearance and size of the massager.  It looks kinda retro-industrial and not the least bit sexy. I have to admit I wasn&#x27;t too impressed - that is, until I tried it.  Oh my goodness!  This thing is a miracle! The claims of 3 minutes to bliss are not exaggerated.  It is liberating! If more women knew about the magic wand, it could change the world!! :)  Buy one now!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful massager which I like to use on the highest intensity, but it is loud &amp; will overheat.  My last massager lasted approximately 7 months (which is longer than the average of 4 months per other reviewers) with heavy useage before it quit vibrating &amp; only made a loud noise.  This is lighter weight than the Brookstone Personal Massager which appears to be better made.  I am used to the Hitachi &amp; prefer the Hitachi, but my 2nd purchase does not feel like the quality is there.  I cannot comment on the durability of Brookstone as I have just purchased it.  Both massagers are the same size &amp; are quite loud. The Hitachi is cheaper than the Brookstone.  I think that both are too large &amp; would be perfect if cut in half the size.  I do like the fact that both are electric &amp; are powerful.  The advantage of the Brookstone is that it has 4 speeds &amp; a 20 minute shut off.  The disadvantage of the Brookstone is its size, weight, &amp; sensative control button.</li>
            <li> So after doing some research online, I found out this is indeed a knock off or fake from China. Never owning a \\&quot;real\\&quot; Hitachi before, I couldn&#x27;t compare the two in terms of how well it works. It will say this, this thing had some kick! I love and it does the job well and fast! I would reccomend this product, even though I&#x27;ve heard the real thing is better.</li>
            <li> I looove my Hitachi!!! Wow just wow. My kitty cat is singing! Great power. Only 2 speeds but overall great product!!</li>
            <li> I have suggested this massager to many women over the years. Its use for self pleasuring in addition to muscle massage makes it it extremely useful, and appreciated as a present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ESBlumberg, Ph.D, LPC</li>
            <li> Reading thru all the other reviews at Amazon I was amazed that even at Amazon dealers are selling cheap chinese fake shit. It lasts only a few minutes, you can buy it at alibaba.com, the state-run garbage selling point of china for about 8 US $ if you buy a hundred minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Hitachi Magic Wand HV250R I bought from Green Web is definitely an original product of Hitachi or Vibratex. Thanks for NOT cheating, Green Web and shame on all the other dealers at Amazon and to Amazon itself by not doing anything about these cheaters!</li>
            <li> this one is not as good as the old type. it&#x27;s outside is too soft and it doesn&#x27;t vibrate intensely.</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t know what this was for; she was like, \\&quot;Oh, a massager thanks. Maybe you can massage me with it later.\\&quot;  After a little explaining and a google image search with safe search turned off, her life was changed. This thing is a powerhouse. I&#x27;d give it 4 if it had a cord that was 2 or 3 feet longer. We have a 6ft extension cord because the cord is really short. It will work on men too :) Maybe we should do a video review...</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d say this but I think more than two speeds are needed for this puppy.  The low setting is high on most other massager&#x27;s and the high setting is so powerful that it&#x27;ll knock your socks off, curl your toes, and make your eyeballs fall out of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are you still reading this?  Buy Buy Buy!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have torn up rotator cuff.  Other massagers I&#x27;ve bought were too superficial.  This one reaches deep and gives hours of relief.</li>
            <li> I already have one (bought it ~8 years ago) and bought this one for a friend. I can only use the low speed with an adapter because it is so strong on my &amp;#34;special button&amp;#34;. Comfortable to use and has lasted me a long time. This is the original brand.  I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands. But I say don&#x27;t waste your money trying a knockoff brand when you know this one works!</li>
            <li> My mother in law said, you have to get this, everyone in my cul-de-sac has one.  In my awkward moment of, this is weird, I got online and ordered it.  Oh my.... the mother in law knows best.  Whatever you need it for, it is sure to be, good.</li>
            <li> I just wish this one had lasted longer than 2 years.  The cable frayed where it goes into the wand.  My last one died after 4 years ... the motor burnt out.</li>
            <li> This is not a real Hitachi. It&#x27;s a cheap knock-off. Pay a little more and get the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed in Amazon for allowing this.</li>
            <li> thhis  is a powerfull massager.  i recomend it .it has been of valuble use  in enhancing our lives.the price wasnt bad either</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute;e and the first day she had it she used it again and again and again. She really loves it! Used it for sore muscles too and it works really well. She TOLD ME to rate it 5 stars, lol!</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I received this new Hitachi massager. It replaces one that I have had for a very long time that was very high quality. This new one works OK but is so inferior in craftsmanship, materials, etc. I imagine that it will last a very short time, unlike my former unit which is about 15 years old. The power rating says it&#x27;s the same power but in reality, it isn&#x27;t. It is much weaker and far less effective. The new product is flimsy and cheap like so many products now made overseas. I am very disappointed. It cost a lot of money and I don&#x27;t expect it will last very long at all. Too bad. No more magic here.</li>
            <li> Decided to buy one on a whim. Probably the best money I&#x27;ve spent this year. Got the exact reaction from my boyfriend that I was hoping for. Definitely a great buy and would recommend it to anyone looking for extra spice in the bedroom.</li>
            <li> Hurt my lower back at work and for some reason my butt cheeks and down my legs also hurt really bad. I am always trying to rub out the pain.  I thought maybe this would work. I guess I was hoping for a miracle.  It is a good massager but I was hoping it would be more intense and vibrate deeper into the tissue.  But from what I have read it is supposed to work well for other parts of the body.  It is relaxing for my upper back, so that is how it works for me.</li>
            <li> Okay, I know Hitachi doesn&#x27;t like for people to review this as a vibrator, but that&#x27;s exactly what I bought it for so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to review it as. I had an AMAZING experience with this product the first time I used it and it was only on the low setting, but after a minute or two of using this I told my boyfriend to jump in and he was in HEAVEN!!!! I was right up there with him, too. Yes, this is my first (REAL) vibrator (I wouldn&#x27;t count the one I threw away after the first ten minutes from Spencer&#x27;s) but this product is still GREAT. I used it one time on my partner&#x27;s ehum* male parts and he was way too quick for me, but for all my women who review this, it&#x27;s great. I use this in between classes, before sex, and if he&#x27;s too tired later on, after sex.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loves it! i suprised her with this and ive never heard her scream so loud!  totally worth it</li>
            <li> Already have one for the home.  Needed to have an extra for our long trips.  Have not used this one yet.  First trip scheduled in two weeks... :-)</li>
            <li> For anyone with experience with a Hitachi, you would know as soon as you opened the package that the massager is way too light in weight, and the speeds are not as high. I wasn&#x27;t 100% until I compared it to a friends and found it indeed felt like half the weight, the head shape and texture was different, and the speeds/strength was weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> This product is a knock off. I previously stated that it was a good product but have since then changed my mind. A friend of mine has a REAL Hitachi magic wand and it is way better than this. The weight is much lighter than a REAL Hitachi magic wand and it just does not have the power. After experiencing the real deal this is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This was a knockoff.  It looks real unless you know the real deal, then you realize quickly it isn&#x27;t as heavy, and doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as the actual product.  Also, it died in 2 weeks.  Disappointed.</li>
