            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Voted one of the Top Eyebrow powders by Glamour</li>
            <li>Love this product my eyebrows have never looked better</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I woke up with still perfect eyebrows and avoiding them when washing my face the next morning</li>
            <li>I love this brow kit.</li>
            <li>I love it💕💕💕</li>
            <li>I freaking love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a wide range of beauty products, from drugstore brands to high-end labels, and this brow kit is up there with the best of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just sooo easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I like the color, and I used it for a while, but it&#x27;s an extremely finely textured powder and it does not fill my brows in quite as well as I would like.</li>
            <li>this one of the best products wet &amp; wild has , very pigmented great colors ....</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>Bought this 4 years ago in NYC, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in CA when 3 months ago i hit pan and broke off on the light color.</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>The brush actually works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use specially for a beginner like me.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>and I hope they have this product for a verrryy long timee love love love it</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and price is right</li>
            <li>Color is darker than I expected, but it is a great product.</li>
            <li>The brush works good, but I don&#x27;t use it only because I purchased one that was longer and makes it easier to apply the powder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in lost words I love this brow kit I purchased a whole bunch of stuff</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>It was kind of nice to have a little touch-up brow brush right in the case.</li>
            <li>I initially bought for my sister but was so pleased with it, decided to get another!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice only if trying to achieve natural and full eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth to buy it.</li>
            <li>This is one of those rare inexpensive products that works as well as department store brow products.</li>
            <li>it was well worth trying.</li>
            <li>The two tones allow you to mix them to achieve just the right color.  </li>
            <li>I use my own eyebrow brush to apply it, not the one included with it mostly because the applicator which comes with it is so &amp;#34;tiny&amp;#34; .. small, I guess for travel or in your purse it would work for touch ups if needed</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>However, this brow powder stays on the whole day!</li>
            <li>Pretty and natural-appearing brows are my result from using this quality product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep ordering more.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life my eyebrows started (how to explain it, ???)</li>
            <li>Exactly what is needed for enhancing your brow line.  </li>
            <li>I looooooove this the only down side that if you are looking for super fake/sharp eyebrows this won&#x27;t hold up to the task because you would have to keep reapplying all day, but if you just want a filler this is soooo good.</li>
            <li>So I recently ran out of my favorite eye brow pencil from Avon and I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>:) apply it very lightly for light shades or brown/blonde or you can press the brush down a little harder for a more darker, defining look.</li>
            <li>The darker shade is way too dark for my fair complexion and blonde hair, but the lighter of the two shades is just right.</li>
            <li>This product does the job though and its possibly even a much nicer color and fit for my face and coloring.</li>
            <li>I use this cheap product and looks as good as my expensive products.</li>
            <li>The brow brush also applies the color very well.  </li>
            <li>, Its really works.</li>
            <li>Definitely highly recommended!</li>
            <li>So much, I just ordered another one.</li>
            <li>i really like</li>
            <li>but I have very light blonde hair and average to light skin</li>
            <li>slanted brush is great and a little powder goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT in every other way.</li>
            <li>darkest color too dark but ok</li>
            <li>Anywho I will be ordering more when I&#x27;m half way on this one.</li>
            <li>I have always had extremely light eyebrows and blonde hair so trying to make them look natural</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve read about it is as women get older</li>
            <li>What I do first is apply a light colored brow pencil then go over it with the wet n wild brow kit powder to set it.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented colors have real staying power and look natural.</li>
            <li>Natural look and very usefull</li>
            <li>This is so much easier for me and looks cleaner and natural.</li>
            <li>but one day I lost my normal tweezers</li>
            <li>I only use the dark brown section, but the lighter brown works perfectly for my daughter who has dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li>One day after applying (putting my eyebrows on) and having a very busy day I went to bed without washing my face and in the morning</li>
            <li>so well it looks natural!</li>
            <li>When applied correctly, your eyebrows look natural!</li>
            <li>and I usually have to apply the powder more than once.</li>
            <li>I love this Wet n Wild Ultimate Brow Kit.</li>
            <li>I mix the two colors together as my hair is not as dark as the dark color but not as light as the light color.</li>
            <li>In fact, I find myself using them more than my normal tweezers lately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with this little brow kit!!</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and it&#x27;s great, apply a little of the darker brown to the ends of your brows and then use the lighter for the middle.</li>
            <li>i side the box, I founded by surprised.</li>
            <li>There are two eyebrow powders that you can mix to help match your natural eyebrow color and the kit comes with a wax to help keep brows in place.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look professionally done.</li>
            <li>Since the Wet and Wild is inexpensive, I thought it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>definitely recommend this brow powder kit to anyone curious about brow powders or those looking for amazing eyebrows at an extremely affordable price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not looking for a dark, bold brow, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it though.</li>
            <li>In addition, I really like the size and shape of the eyebrow brush, it is not too small nor too large which makes applying the brow powder much easier.</li>
            <li>2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered product I&#x27;m in live with it.</li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;m not using the right brush or maybe the color is a bit dark for me but all and all</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price and the results are amazing if you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and bought a seperate eyebrow brush that&#x27;s much nicer than the ones provided but the makeup itself last long.</li>
            <li>It came with fast shipping and a big blue bag to let USPS know its fragile but</li>
            <li>But now that my old brow powder is back on the market I will go back to that.</li>
            <li>Although this kit helps me to achieve decent looking filled-in brows, the colors are extremely dark.</li>

            <li> I will definitely keep ordering more.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life my eyebrows started (how to explain it, ???)</li>
            <li> Exactly what is needed for enhancing your brow line.  </li>
            <li> I looooooove this the only down side that if you are looking for super fake/sharp eyebrows this won&#x27;t hold up to the task because you would have to keep reapplying all day, but if you just want a filler this is soooo good.</li>
            <li> So I recently ran out of my favorite eye brow pencil from Avon and I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> :) apply it very lightly for light shades or brown/blonde or you can press the brush down a little harder for a more darker, defining look.</li>
            <li> The darker shade is way too dark for my fair complexion and blonde hair, but the lighter of the two shades is just right.</li>
            <li> This product does the job though and its possibly even a much nicer color and fit for my face and coloring.</li>
            <li> I use this cheap product and looks as good as my expensive products.</li>
            <li> The brow brush also applies the color very well.  </li>
            <li> , Its really works.</li>
            <li> Definitely highly recommended!</li>
            <li> So much, I just ordered another one.</li>
            <li> i really like</li>
            <li> but I have very light blonde hair and average to light skin</li>
            <li> slanted brush is great and a little powder goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT in every other way.</li>
            <li> darkest color too dark but ok</li>
            <li> Anywho I will be ordering more when I&#x27;m half way on this one.</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely light eyebrows and blonde hair so trying to make them look natural</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve read about it is as women get older</li>
            <li> What I do first is apply a light colored brow pencil then go over it with the wet n wild brow kit powder to set it.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented colors have real staying power and look natural.</li>
            <li> Natural look and very usefull</li>
            <li> This is so much easier for me and looks cleaner and natural.</li>
            <li> but one day I lost my normal tweezers</li>
            <li> I only use the dark brown section, but the lighter brown works perfectly for my daughter who has dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li> One day after applying (putting my eyebrows on) and having a very busy day I went to bed without washing my face and in the morning</li>
            <li> so well it looks natural!</li>
            <li> When applied correctly, your eyebrows look natural!</li>
            <li> and I usually have to apply the powder more than once.</li>
            <li> I love this Wet n Wild Ultimate Brow Kit.</li>
            <li> I mix the two colors together as my hair is not as dark as the dark color but not as light as the light color.</li>
            <li> In fact, I find myself using them more than my normal tweezers lately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this little brow kit!!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it&#x27;s great, apply a little of the darker brown to the ends of your brows and then use the lighter for the middle.</li>
            <li> i side the box, I founded by surprised.</li>
            <li> There are two eyebrow powders that you can mix to help match your natural eyebrow color and the kit comes with a wax to help keep brows in place.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look professionally done.</li>
            <li> Since the Wet and Wild is inexpensive, I thought it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> definitely recommend this brow powder kit to anyone curious about brow powders or those looking for amazing eyebrows at an extremely affordable price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not looking for a dark, bold brow, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it though.</li>
            <li> In addition, I really like the size and shape of the eyebrow brush, it is not too small nor too large which makes applying the brow powder much easier.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered product I&#x27;m in live with it.</li>
            <li> maybe I&#x27;m not using the right brush or maybe the color is a bit dark for me but all and all</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price and the results are amazing if you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought a seperate eyebrow brush that&#x27;s much nicer than the ones provided but the makeup itself last long.</li>
            <li> It came with fast shipping and a big blue bag to let USPS know its fragile but</li>
            <li> But now that my old brow powder is back on the market I will go back to that.</li>
            <li> Although this kit helps me to achieve decent looking filled-in brows, the colors are extremely dark.</li>
            <li> Also, the kit includes a small mirror that slides out from underneath the kit along with small tweezers which makes it easy to fix one&#x27;s eyebrows even on-the-go.</li>
            <li> but the product seems to be lasting a long time making up for it&#x27;s size</li>
            <li> A little info about myself, I&#x27;m a white, darker brunette 56 years old woman</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m new to doing this but after watching a few videos on uTube I decided to try this product</li>
            <li> I have not usually liked brow powder as much as using a gel liner in taupe for a substitution.</li>
            <li> Definitely smaller than expected</li>
            <li> A larger brush may be necessary for those who have difficulty grasping such small objects.</li>
            <li> what wild is the cheaper makeup I usually don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> BUT did arrive way faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for my usual brow powder (Bare Escentuals).  </li>
            <li> When I fought out it was only a few dollars</li>
            <li> the other day I was at Target and saw this product</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Darker than expected I use the dark powder over my eyeliner instead of my brow.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> slightly darker than I expected</li>
            <li> so my brows don&#x27;t look too dark.</li>
            <li> Be very careful !</li>
            <li> i have black hair and the color</li>
            <li> The lighter brown looks like the darker brown on the brow, and the darker brown looks black.</li>
            <li> She used a little brown to fill in the sparse areas &amp; a mix of black &amp; brown to define the arch.</li>
            <li> and the darker brown is way too dark!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy makeup off amazon</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of different brands and got tired of wasting my money on less than satisfactory products.</li>
            <li> long x 1 3/4&amp;#34; wide and each product inside is again approximately 3/4&amp;#34; x 3/4&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s kinda on the small side</li>
            <li> /&gt;•tweezers (I actually use for false eyelashes)&lt;br /&gt;• two brow cream powder</li>
            <li> Usually I fill in my brows with sweeping motion and</li>
            <li> The problem that I have had with a lot of brow powders in the past is that they don&#x27;t stick well</li>
            <li> For the price, this is unbelievable quality.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for my brows!</li>
            <li> Yes I have purchased this brow powder in the past</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the wax because if I want to use it I have to scrape it out with something sharp and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t hold my hairs down :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find a gray brown that works with my hair/brow color and complexion.</li>
            <li> was hard.</li>
            <li> one brow powder apply brush (I don&#x27;t use because its very small. )</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on anything else!!!</li>
            <li> Because my eyebriws are so thin, this us my go to filler.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken...</li>
            <li> The container (what it comes in) is approximately 3&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fake look</li>
            <li> For some inexplicable reason, they had stopped selling brow powder.  </li>
            <li> So sad I can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore, but I can&#x27;t do my brows without it :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this for years and love it.</li>
            <li> This product is no joke !!! i follow my favorite makeup artist on youtube she didnt lie to her subbies this one of the best products wet &amp; wild has , very pigmented great colors ....</li>
            <li> The two tones allow you to mix them to achieve just the right color.  The brow brush also applies the color very well.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this little brow kit!! I had another powder from Ofra and nothing compares to this one. It&#x27;s just sooo easy to use I am soo glad I gave it a chance cause I was worried it would not work. Anywho I will be ordering more when I&#x27;m half way on this one. I am well satisfied and I hope they have this product for a verrryy long timee love love love it and I surely recommend it! EDIT: the other day I was at Target and saw this product my local Target dosn&#x27;t have them so I guess only some do and it was like $3 so I won&#x27;t be ordering anymore. Yaaay!</li>
            <li> This is a great powder for me to put over my eyebrow pencil. Just the powder alone for my eyebrows just wouldnt suffice.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and price is right</li>
            <li> I love this product! The brushes are pretty much useless. I went ahead and bought a seperate eyebrow brush that&#x27;s much nicer than the ones provided but the makeup itself last long.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it&#x27;s great, apply a little of the darker brown to the ends of your brows and then use the lighter for the middle. The brush is the perfect size and shape. It comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> love this product! makes me look put together but not overly done. i have black hair and the color is perfect match so my brows don&#x27;t look too dark.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It fills in my eyebrows so well it looks natural!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fake look and I was hesitant to buy ANY powders. I only use Benefit wax for my eyebrows until my sister recommended this brow powder. She used a little brown to fill in the sparse areas &amp; a mix of black &amp; brown to define the arch. OMG, I suddenly had the eyebrows I always dreamed of having! 😍&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slanted brush is great and a little powder goes a long way. I like that it includes a wax to set the look. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price and the results are amazing if you know what you&#x27;re doing. 😉&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this brow powder kit to anyone curious about brow powders or those looking for amazing eyebrows at an extremely affordable price.</li>
            <li> Really great product. Perfect for the beginner and the pro.</li>
            <li> This brow kit is affordable, easy to use, and creates gorgeous brows. This is perfect for beginners like me. The brush is tiny, but works like a charm. A larger brush may be necessary for those who have difficulty grasping such small objects. The wax is nice, but I sometimes use my NYX eyebrow shaper wax pencil instead.  All in all, this is a fabulous product. I&#x27;ve tried a wide range of beauty products, from drugstore brands to high-end labels, and this brow kit is up there with the best of them.</li>
            <li> what wild is the cheaper makeup I usually don&#x27;t use it but this is the only stuff that ever works on coloring my eyebrows I put it on at night and it stays put when I wake up the next morning and doesn&#x27;t get on my pillow I&#x27;ve been using this for years I will continue to use it its the best stuff out there</li>
            <li> Shades darker than they look. Otherwise, an okay product.</li>
            <li> All-day staying power. The darker shade is way too dark for my fair complexion and blonde hair, but the lighter of the two shades is just right.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! I ordered a second one to have them in two different places for convenience. Now a daily go-to.</li>
            <li> I initially bought for my sister but was so pleased with it, decided to get another!</li>
            <li> Bought this 4 years ago in NYC, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in CA when 3 months ago i hit pan and broke off on the light color. I LOVE IT in every other way.</li>
            <li> Been using it for quite a while now &amp; the only store I know carries this is RiteAid for $3.99. Its perfect and cheap!!!!</li>
            <li> Great! I don&#x27;t do my eyebrows with anything else now.</li>
            <li> Works great, and it came with a mini mirror i side the box, I founded by surprised. Color is darker than I expected, but it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Definitely smaller than expected BUT did arrive way faster than expected. And its good&lt;br /&gt;What you get&lt;br /&gt;•tweezers (I actually use for false eyelashes)&lt;br /&gt;• two brow cream powder&lt;br /&gt;• one wax (I don&#x27;t use it)&lt;br /&gt;• one brow powder apply brush (I don&#x27;t use because its very small. )</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It&#x27;s worth to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  When applied correctly, your eyebrows look natural!</li>
            <li> I love this! If you&#x27;re not looking for a dark, bold brow, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it though.</li>
            <li> I have not usually liked brow powder as much as using a gel liner in taupe for a substitution. Usually I fill in my brows with sweeping motion and the gel liner looks like hairs. This product does the job though and its possibly even a much nicer color and fit for my face and coloring. I like the packaging and the option of the two colors. The wax is ok but Im still figuring out how I like to use it. This is a great product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> slightly darker than I expected but I have very light blonde hair and average to light skin so I&#x27;m sure its just me...  I&#x27;ve paid several times this amount for brow kits with similar results.  great price...  I apply once in the morning and it stays all day.</li>
            <li> The color same as a picture, Its really works. I suggest to buy. like it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I love it, strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> Darker than expected I use the dark powder over my eyeliner instead of my brow.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Brow Kit! There are two eyebrow powders that you can mix to help match your natural eyebrow color and the kit comes with a wax to help keep brows in place. Also, the kit includes a small mirror that slides out from underneath the kit along with small tweezers which makes it easy to fix one&#x27;s eyebrows even on-the-go. The brow powder is absolutely fantastic! The problem that I have had with a lot of brow powders in the past is that they don&#x27;t stick well and I usually have to apply the powder more than once. However, this brow powder stays on the whole day! In addition, I really like the size and shape of the eyebrow brush, it is not too small nor too large which makes applying the brow powder much easier. Very pleased with the quality and price of this product, would recommend.</li>
            <li> Turn Up ...I just switched from the Pencil and Im too cute Its Nice and My Eyebrows ON Fleek</li>
            <li> Pretty and natural-appearing brows are my result from using this quality product. Yaaas!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product, but it&#x27;d recommend it for people with darker eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love this Wet n Wild Ultimate Brow Kit. It&#x27;s easy to use specially for a beginner like me. Definitely highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Wish I had this product years ago.</li>
            <li> After years of trying almost every pencil, powder and gel on the market I tried Wet n Wild Ultimate Brow Kit! Highly pigmented colors have real staying power and look natural. A little goes a long way! Easy to use. Best kit ever. For the price, this is unbelievable quality. Try this product if you have been searching for the perfect brow kit.</li>
            <li> Got it as gift for my grandmother and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for her naturally light brown eyebrows, which are now thinning.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s quite a beauty queen herself and she loves this product now</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for my usual brow powder (Bare Escentuals).  For some inexplicable reason, they had stopped selling brow powder.  I tried a couple of different brands and got tired of wasting my money on less than satisfactory products. It&#x27;s really hard to find a gray brown that works with my hair/brow color and complexion. Since the Wet and Wild is inexpensive, I thought it would be worth a try.  I like the color, and I used it for a while, but it&#x27;s an extremely finely textured powder and it does not fill my brows in quite as well as I would like. Also I don&#x27;t use the middle color because it&#x27;s too red, and I didn&#x27;t need the wax. It was kind of nice to have a little touch-up brow brush right in the case. But now that my old brow powder is back on the market I will go back to that. When it goes on sale.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for my brows! Works well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the wax because if I want to use it I have to scrape it out with something sharp and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t hold my hairs down :( and the darker brown is way too dark!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Because my eyebriws are so thin, this us my go to filler. The brush works good, but I don&#x27;t use it only because I purchased one that was longer and makes it easier to apply the powder.</li>
            <li> Perfect product. Don&#x27;t waste money on anything else!!!</li>
            <li> Ran out of this and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except here. I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. So much, I just ordered another one. I have always had extremely light eyebrows and blonde hair so trying to make them look natural was hard. WAS. :) apply it very lightly for light shades or brown/blonde or you can press the brush down a little harder for a more darker, defining look.</li>
            <li> Natural look and very usefull</li>
            <li> Arrived broken... Powder spilled everywhere. Never again</li>
            <li> Got mine yay. So I recently ran out of my favorite eye brow pencil from Avon and I wanted to try something new and I got this so I tried it and I kinda like it maybe I&#x27;m not using the right brush or maybe the color is a bit dark for me but all and all it&#x27;s OK I think I&#x27;m going to keep giving this a try and see what happens</li>
            <li> I really love it n its very easy to apply. It came with fast shipping and a big blue bag to let USPS know its fragile but overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered product I&#x27;m in live with it. Super fast shipping. Very pleased with service. I will definitely keep ordering more.</li>
            <li> So sad I can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore, but I can&#x27;t do my brows without it :( I hope there is always someone on amazon to help me get my brows on for cheap! I only use the dark brown section, but the lighter brown works perfectly for my daughter who has dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Yes I have purchased this brow powder in the past and I like it alot...&lt;br /&gt;Voted one of the Top Eyebrow powders by Glamour (I think thats where I saw the article).&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in lost words I love this brow kit I purchased a whole bunch of stuff &amp; I wasn&#x27;t happy with anything except for this I will keep purchasing this kit .</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look professionally done. Best product ive used</li>
            <li> I have Ashley brown hair and this Brie pallet matches it great. I mix the two colors together as my hair is not as dark as the dark color but not as light as the light color. What I do first is apply a light colored brow pencil then go over it with the wet n wild brow kit powder to set it. This method will last all day. The product goes on smith and evenly. Oh ps I didn&#x27;t use the tweezers it came with for along time as I thought they would not work well but one day I lost my normal tweezers so I used the ones in the brow kit. Turns out they work really good. In fact, I find myself using them more than my normal tweezers lately. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare inexpensive products that works as well as department store brow products. A friend told me she used it... When I fought out it was only a few dollars it was well worth trying. I&#x27;m glad I did!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product my eyebrows have never looked better</li>
            <li> No I&#x27;m not Phil but I am the person using the brow kit. For the first time in my life my eyebrows started (how to explain it, ???) well they just sorta disappeared just patches here and there. What I&#x27;ve read about it is as women get older not only do our upper lips become thinner so do our eyebrows, which explained both my upper lip and eyebrows. A little info about myself, I&#x27;m a white, darker brunette 56 years old woman and I&#x27;ve never needed to use anything on my eyebrows until now, so I&#x27;m new to doing this but after watching a few videos on uTube I decided to try this product and I&#x27;m so pleased with it. I use my own eyebrow brush to apply it, not the one included with it mostly because the applicator which comes with it is so &amp;#34;tiny&amp;#34; .. small, I guess for travel or in your purse it would work for touch ups if needed but I doubt you&#x27;d need to. One day after applying (putting my eyebrows on) and having a very busy day I went to bed without washing my face and in the morning I woke up with still perfect eyebrows and avoiding them when washing my face the next morning I went another day without having to put on my eyebrows, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, you need to wash your entire face but it&#x27;s nice to know if the occasion were to come up where I didn&#x27;t or couldn&#x27;t wash my face before bed I&#x27;d still have my eyebrows in the morning. The container (what it comes in) is approximately 3&amp;#34; long x 1 3/4&amp;#34; wide and each product inside is again approximately 3/4&amp;#34; x 3/4&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s kinda on the small side but the product seems to be lasting a long time making up for it&#x27;s size and you can&#x27;t argue with the price rather I couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I looooooove this the only down side that if you are looking for super fake/sharp eyebrows this won&#x27;t hold up to the task because you would have to keep reapplying all day, but if you just want a filler this is soooo good. It&#x27;s very nice only if trying to achieve natural and full eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love this brow kit. It&#x27;s my staple been using it for years! I use this cheap product and looks as good as my expensive products. Use this with concealer under it and my eyebrows are flawless!</li>
            <li> darkest color too dark but ok product. stays I place</li>
            <li> I love it💕💕💕&lt;br /&gt;Second time purchasing💕</li>
            <li> Be very careful ! Although this kit helps me to achieve decent looking filled-in brows, the colors are extremely dark. The lighter brown looks like the darker brown on the brow, and the darker brown looks black. Also, both shades have a gray undertone.</li>
            <li> Very good ...i really like</li>
            <li> In love with this product!!!</li>
            <li> Good product, I bought one for myself and my mother and we both like it.</li>
            <li> I love itttt will be getting this again!</li>
            <li> I freaking love this product. It&#x27;s perfect and your brows will look believably real :D</li>
            <li> Exactly what is needed for enhancing your brow line.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used a pencil for years and decided to give powder a try...I will never use a pencil again. This is so much easier for me and looks cleaner and natural. The color is good for my medium skin tone and brown hair. I would also use this color if I had my blonde locks. The brush actually works great. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy makeup off amazon but I read the reviews and the pricing was good so I ordered 2 (since I know someone who could&#x27;ve used it if I didn&#x27;t like it) but I&#x27;m absolutely in love with everything about this product the colors match perfectly. The tweezers are adorable and very easy for tiny stray hairs and the brush isn&#x27;t the best but it&#x27;s not bad so basically it does the job. Definitely worth the money!</li>
