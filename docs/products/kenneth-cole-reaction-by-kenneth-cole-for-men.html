            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t get this on your clothing..</li>
            <li>I am forever in love with you.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>

            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>and he wanted more.</li>
            <li>The heading says it all, what more do you want in a cologne?  </li>
            <li>I get sooooo many complements off of it....</li>
            <li>The dominant notes are fruity - apple and more that a hint of melon.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes.</li>

            <li>I love this cologne.</li>

            <li>And such a great price from amazon!</li>
            <li>Love everything about this cologne.</li>

            <li>I love this scent...</li>
            <li>Smelled more like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>It is his favorite</li>
            <li>I was my alltime favorite.</li>
            <li>: ) I guess it just makes her jealous</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become a staple for me as I have received many complements on the scent and use of this product.</li>
            <li>The ladies love this on me.</li>
            <li>This is one of my all time favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I sprayed on a lot more to see if it would smell longer</li>
            <li>He used it up and needs/wants to get more.  </li>
            <li>The scent is just not as bright or fresh..</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m thinking of giving this expired one away and keep buying from Macy&#x27;s even it if does cost more.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne for men that I have used for quite some time.</li>
            <li>I supect that what I had ordered had ran out of stock and they just wanted to fulfil my order, in this way I am glad I picked Amazon to place my order.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>

            <li>I love this scent on a man.</li>
            <li>I guess, as another reviewer stated, they ran out of the stand alone fragrance, so to fulfill their customer&#x27;s satisfaction, they sent us something more :)</li>
            <li>this will be my favorite for a while.</li>

            <li>Otherwise, smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Good seller was exactly like the one in the store</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to guys who want to smell amazing!!</li>
            <li>However, if you just want to smell nice for a quick date you&#x27;re going to, a lunch with a friend, meeting with a client, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too strong but lasts usually most of the day.</li>
            <li>so I felt extra secure ordering from them as they have excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>very simple sweet smell, great for every day/morning at work!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite and primary cologne.</li>
            <li>Received this today, and my son loved it and it is reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the cologne its self smells gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Also the scent is very fresh -- Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too strong, with a nice, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>The price was excellent on Amazon compared to Macy&#x27;s or Dillard&#x27;s or even other online \\&quot;smell-good\\&quot; companies.  </li>
            <li>I love it fresh sexy smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not burning your nose strong.</li>
            <li>so the bottles didn&#x27;t leak, yet the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable and the deodorant is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased Reaction I liked it, and I used it within 3 years</li>
            <li>Not bad but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is a good cologne to wear all the time, clean smell, but nothing that really excites me.</li>
            <li>i didnt expect this to be an every day scent, but i quickly became enamored with it!</li>
            <li>Got to me fairly quickly and smell just like i rememer!</li>
            <li>Nice large bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells cheap.</li>
            <li>seen it in here for cheap</li>
            <li>, it smells light, makes me think of summer.</li>
            <li>rather cheap compared to sticker prices.  </li>
            <li>love the summery fresh smell which is not too toxic and over powering, will probably buy this again and at this price you cant beat it.</li>
            <li>It leans more on the fresh and invigorating side, but there is an undertone of wood and musk.</li>
            <li>So this is perfect for individuals with a spring in their step, and a refined and humble demeanor.</li>
            <li>So perhaps that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap?  </li>
            <li>Great fragrance for my teenage son.</li>
            <li>Big smell great and cheep.  </li>
            <li>Cheap price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m as straight as the next board, but this cologne is delightful.</li>
            <li>I just really like this Cologne, and really don&#x27;t want to say much more because I don&#x27;t want too many more Men wearing My fragrance :-)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the cologne, but not just me, my wife and i constantly get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>Exactly what he asked for!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very distinct smell.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and distinctive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it has got a spicy flavor which smells very fresh....</li>
            <li>Very fresh.  </li>
            <li>A signature scent of my husband and we both love it because it&#x27;s clean, fresh, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I would recommended this product to pretty much any guy who is searching for a good cologne without the huge price.</li>
            <li>Its very clean and fresh with a unique scent to it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather light, wears off quickly and has a light alcohol scent.  </li>
            <li>This has been my favorite cologne for years now ever since the first time I smelled it.  </li>
            <li>This is the original cologne, not a knock off.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, lasts not too long, however it isn&#x27;t overpowering either.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and more.</li>
            <li>Anywhere in the stores you pay 40-60 more for a smaller bottle, won&#x27;t need more for a year!</li>
            <li>I was excited to order some.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this for my bf who used to wear this cologne when we first met. :)</li>
            <li>This scent is crisp and clean - like most Kenneth Cole products.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s really clean and citrus like</li>
            <li>Clean scent.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but really mild and doesn&#x27;t stay for long.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it arrived pretty quick too.</li>
            <li>This was a smart buy for sure.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong or sweet, it is just right.  </li>
            <li>Just a great modern classic fragrance that you will consistently get complemented on.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, simple, clean!</li>
            <li>It is a discrete sweet summery smell with hints of fruit.  </li>
            <li>Being a regular user of Davidoff Coolwater, I tried this after reading some good reviews.</li>
            <li>i was like cool.  </li>
            <li>too so if the gift recipient likes it, he can readily stock up on more.  </li>
            <li>It came fast, as advertised and is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>Has a sweet smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is very crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>As of now, the scent in the box was pretty strong and the caps were still on everything with no leaks.</li>
            <li>first I was excited I found the product so cheap.  </li>
            <li>good  fresh clean smelling cologne, would be better if it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li>I wear it for most of the summer months and change to something a bit stronger during the winter or for more formal events (Burberry London or similar).  </li>
            <li>It just not only came the perfume, it was an entire kit with body lotion and after shave, really awesome!</li>
            <li>Chose this rating because firstly the product is exactly what I ordered, a refreshing smell which is not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and will be buying it again when hubby is running low. :)</li>
            <li>Received quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Thank you again, also the colonge fits very well in my growing set of bottles in my collection, it smells great and last over 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Ok ok, now to the actual smell.</li>
            <li>Showed up quick.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the very strong masculine &amp;#34;hit</li>
            <li>The kind that wakes you up, and conjures the image of a lush glade with a burbling stream right after the rain.</li>
            <li>Its a light fragrance that really makes a girl want to get closer!</li>
            <li>The problem is, he is very very very picky!</li>
            <li>Always loved reaction and you cannot beat this price for half of this bottle it cost more than the full bottle at Walmart and Walmart usually has great prices the 1.7 ounce cost $33 but on here</li>
            <li>and I think i found a new love.</li>
            <li>May be my new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and very summery; it&#x27;s quite sweet on my skin.</li>
            <li>Awesome scent-my hubbys favorite now!Clean smelling and a little goes a long ways!Love it!</li>
            <li>This is a great sweet smell but soft and musky at the same time.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!!</li>
            <li>Very light yet masculine.</li>
            <li>It is a crisp and clean scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crisp and clean without overpowering.</li>
            <li>It has a sharp fruity smell when you first get a whiff of it, but then you start to smell all kinds of great things.</li>
            <li>He uses it daily and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Great green apple cologne.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reminiscent of a particularly exotic cocktail that you might find in a trendy bar somewhere, the sort of trendy bar that routinely offers drinks with vanilla vodka, lychee juice and raspberry liqueur in them and not just the bog standard Martini or Singapore Sling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reaction</li>
            <li>The cologne smells amazing and seems to last for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is fresh and sporty.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this cologne so much that every time he sprays some on he remarks about how good it smells and he breathes deeply!</li>
            <li>It is not woodsy or overly powerful.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and fruity.</li>
            <li>He has the same kind</li>
            <li>This is my 20 year old son&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>I called customer service and was told that cologne is considered a hazardous material so it can only be shipped ground.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as a acqua di gio</li>
            <li>Reminds me of fresh cut cucumber.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and could not pass up a deeply discounted rate for this fantastic product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth throwing out.  </li>
            <li>Huge bottle for a most reasonable price over what you COULD pay for it at a major department or beauty store.</li>
            <li>This is the real product in original packaging.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know all the right adjectives to describe a smell</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments when wearing it and that tells me it&#x27;s doing something right.</li>
            <li>the price is just right</li>
            <li>(actually I had another fragrances too), and after 3 years when I run Out of it, I ordered new one with Amazon, this time I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>

            <li>far as the perfume is concerned this is my favourite after constantly smelling all the new perfumes that have come out from all the top brands that cost twice or even thrice this one!!</li>
            <li>the first night I put it on</li>
            <li>This does not seem to last more than about 5 hours on me</li>

            <li>Smells great and last long.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>After the first spray to the neck, I wanted to take me out to a steak dinner, get with myself at my front door afterward and conclude it all with an invitation to the bedroom.</li>
            <li>Whenever you (or your spouse) find something you like, that is exactly when they stop holding it in retail stores in your area.  </li>
            <li>This came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>And it was exactly as described on website.</li>

            <li>Great subtle smell.</li>

            <li>Than you very much.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had almost nothing but positive experiences with Amazon and still buy often, but I will not purchase cologne again.  </li>
            <li>this product is my favorite so far since it can be worn everyday and is not an overwhelming scent</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always nice to be told that I smell good by random people!</li>
            <li>I just thought it would have a bit of a different smell than described, I guess I was looking for something a bit less musky, but it&#x27;s very strong and long lasting, great manly smell!</li>
            <li>It smells fresh, clean, and younger.</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly and I was surprised that it came with body wash and shower gel as well as</li>
            <li>This is what I have been looking for...not too strong, but lasting.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but don&#x27;t last long @ all.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just pure alcohol and no scent.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>The smell is clean, fresh and classic all at the same time.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this scent and so do I.</li>
            <li>Others he likes are LIght Blue, Chrome, Gucci Homme.  </li>
            <li>I really like it too.  </li>
            <li>It is the real deal from packaging to smell.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li>and i got way more than i expected.</li>
            <li>you so much.</li>
            <li>Its smelled nothing like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>this is not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came with more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>However I buy it off amazon because its so much cheaper than purchasing in the store.</li>
            <li>they are Christmas presents but they arrived wrapped very well in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>This is not the real Kenneth Cole Reaction cologne.</li>
            <li>it was MUCH cheaper.  </li>
            <li>After that the smell isn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I know my wife really loves this Col&amp;oacute;n.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves this smell, it&#x27;s almost a cucumber like smell.</li>
            <li>I really like this deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s looks like the real thing smells close but is a knock off.</li>
            <li>I really like Amazon</li>
            <li>Much appreciated gift.</li>
            <li>it is the real thing.</li>
            <li>It is not over powering and smells very manly.</li>
            <li>Good perfume, a bit edgy for business use....Great for outdoor &amp; sports</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on buying some more once I run out, which it has lasted me much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>I love it and would tell other people about it and would them to buy it and try it out</li>
            <li>Very clean, fresh and not strong at all.</li>
            <li>is never going to have the street cred or mass-appeal of the other excellent summer staples like Cool Water, Acqua di Gio, Tommy or CK One, but for something certainly different which will make you stand out of the crowd, a cachet of its own, you certainly won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>Great size bottle lasts for a very long time with a few sprays a day.</li>
            <li>Not bad, I&#x27;d recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li>It smells really good, however, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>When he was in high school and all the boys were spraying themselves with Axe, I said &amp;#34;no way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this for all the pimp-ass dudes out there who are looking to score some ladies.</li>
            <li>not as great as expected doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it also came in a box 4 times as large as the display box, and that&#x27;s because Amazon was so generous in sending me the Gift Set that came with Body Wash and Aftershave Balm.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light and does not last long.</li>
            <li>I found it for less than half on amazon and am once again wearing this great cologne.</li>
            <li>Reaction smells great, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this cologne for a few years and I love it,</li>
            <li>Gotten many compliments over the few years i&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>It is a great casual cologne.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the cologne all in for $36 which seemed about right until I actually got the product.</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s not a really strong cologne.  </li>
            <li>Gift for husband to replace his Kenneth Cole New York.</li>
            <li>Disclaimer: I live in Iowa and have no connections whatsoever with either Kenneth Cole or Amazon.</li>
            <li>Due to low longevity, it really doesn&#x27;t deserve 5 stars, but it is such a nice scent</li>
            <li>There is a very clear difference and this is a cheap imitation.  </li>
            <li>no other way to really describe it.</li>
            <li>I ordered it, sprayed some on, and very quickly noticed the smell did not last as long as the store bought version I had gotten.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why more men do not use this.</li>
            <li>This is a complete fraud!</li>
            <li>the first thing I did was open it</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered, same size and brand.</li>
            <li>My product was delivered quickly and was everything I expected.  </li>
            <li>First of all let me start by thanking amazon for being brilliant and putting a smile on my face, I mean i was blown away by the fact that it came in one day!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift, it&#x27;s a fantastic smelling cologne and the Amazon Price was slightly cheaper than outlet prices with the added convenience of not having to go shopping during the busy season</li>
            <li>i bought this directly from amazon and not another seller, the cologne smells way too strongly of alcohol when compared to a genuine bottle, it also has marks on the largest of the sprayer neck that tells me it was probably either tampered or is 100% fake.</li>
            <li>Was so cheap I was a little worried to why.</li>
            <li>go to a retail outlet or directly from Kenneth Cole.</li>
            <li>In my opinion.. just buy these kinda stuff from the shop ( a reputed one ) directly...</li>
            <li>Young and old, this is for all ages.</li>
            <li>DIS FOR OLD MAN</li>
            <li>18 year old college student.</li>
            <li>I find myself frequently giving out it name to others.</li>
            <li>He ended up liking it so much that this is the only spray he buys now.</li>
            <li>What a complete rip off.</li>
            <li>Seems to smell like the old Reaction.</li>
            <li>You have to use twice as much to get the same effect</li>
            <li>Maybe old?</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my 19 year old grandson.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mellow and classy.</li>
            <li>The box on the left is a real one I bought at a store.</li>
            <li>his chip fill and the whole entire table men and women stoped and said omg what is that you have on!!!</li>
            <li>I might have just gotten an old bottle or it might not go well with my body.</li>
            <li>The box was completely packaged so it couldn&#x27;t have been opened.</li>
            <li>Masculine</li>
            <li>Smells like old</li>
            <li>you over the head&amp;#34; smell of a Polo or Brut or Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>Saw it in some shop for 50 bucks for the same size so big savings too and the perfume is fresh in case anyone was wondering, not an old perfume which feels like its lost its smell</li>
            <li>I have purchased three bottles so far</li>
            <li>It mixes well with a man&#x27;s natural scent.</li>
            <li>THe scent doesnt last long and runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a scent that becoming difficult to find (if not impossible) in stores.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptic of the recent reviews stating this was a cheap knock off, seeing as I&#x27;ve previously purchased it here with no problems, but was completely ticked off when I found out</li>
            <li>I thought it would be unique and different according to the description of other customers.</li>
            <li>I have use this cologne for several years now and I normally buy this from Kenneth Cole stores directly.</li>
            <li>but I really do like its unique and subtle nature.  </li>
            <li>Also the price is just right for the size and for what other stores and sites charge.</li>
            <li>It is not overwhelming and still is strong enough for a masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Not only did it arrive in less than a week&#x27;s time, but it came, as stated by Amazon, in its original factory packaging.</li>
            <li>Also when buying straight from amazon you actually receive an entire gift set which is not what i wanted as i won&#x27;t use the after shave or the body wash.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for something casual but stunning, get this!</li>
            <li>It is right up there with Kenneth Cole Black.</li>
            <li>Even though it had 4 1/2 stars, I was leary of those who said it was cheap, imitation, and wouldn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give it a shot, due to the positive feedback and price.</li>
            <li>I went in to a local outlet and they were completely sold out</li>
            <li>I surprised my husband with this cologne awhile back</li>
            <li>We compared to old bottle purchased at department store and the difference is obvious.</li>
            <li>my first bottle almost empty have to order second one for every day</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s some kind of fake.</li>
            <li>Out of all the colognes I have Tried over the years but have rarely found something I could wear everyday.</li>
            <li>Smells good but is a little weak for me.</li>
            <li>Back to Coolwater and maybe will try something new later.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really suggest it for an \\&quot;older\\&quot; man, but again, perfumes and cologne smell different on everybody due to your bodies natural oils.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased the exact cologne for my husband at the mall.</li>
            <li>but I feel that this particular mixture had a lot of alcohol in it and this fragrance did not last as long as I am used to but</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of weeks now and worn it a few times and it never lasts more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>I had read some concerning reviews about questionable sellers with cologne, but since I bought this direct through Amazon, I thought I was safe.  </li>
            <li>you cannot mail it back claiming it&#x27;s a dangerous good.</li>
            <li>They had it for half tge price of macys and it was the same exact thing</li>
            <li>I must&#x27;ve received a counterfeit product, you can barely smell the fragrance of this bottle and also doesn&#x27;t last at all</li>
            <li>Exactly the same size bottle I would&#x27;ve purchased for my husband at the store for half the price!</li>
            <li>The price is high compared to similar other colognes like the Claiborne Sport for men.</li>
            <li>Beware, once purchased, there is no return and for some reason my bottle must be really old/expired as it does NOT smell the same as the bottles I have previously purchased at dept. stores.</li>

            <li> Perfect scent for a teenage boy.</li>

            <li> if you look at this as prime eligable for the free 2 day shipping, it&#x27;s not!  </li>
            <li> Could not have asked for more.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume or cologne</li>
            <li> i love the kenneth cole reaction scent and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok and not too pricey but thee are better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li> for the price its ok</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if he would like this or not.  </li>
            <li> but my wife likes it more :-)</li>
            <li> so it was great to find it online for so much cheaper than at the department store.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS AWESOME AND WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> PRICE WAS GREAT AND SHIPPING WAS FAST.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and that&#x27;s what matters most.  </li>
            <li> A fairly safe scent to gift to people</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t get this on your clothing..</li>
            <li> I am forever in love with you.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  </li>
            <li> Have had many people complement it at work.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.</li>
            <li> and he wanted more.</li>
            <li> The heading says it all, what more do you want in a cologne?  </li>
            <li> I get sooooo many complements off of it....</li>
            <li> The dominant notes are fruity - apple and more that a hint of melon.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> And it was cheap!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne.</li>
            <li> My order was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did before Amazon came on the scene:)</li>
            <li> And such a great price from amazon!</li>
            <li> Love everything about this cologne.</li>
            <li> Love the scent on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Love the product and love Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  </li>
            <li> I love this scent...</li>
            <li> Smelled more like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> It is his favorite</li>
            <li> I was my alltime favorite.</li>
            <li> : ) I guess it just makes her jealous</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become a staple for me as I have received many complements on the scent and use of this product.</li>
            <li> The ladies love this on me.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I sprayed on a lot more to see if it would smell longer</li>
            <li> He used it up and needs/wants to get more.  </li>
            <li> The scent is just not as bright or fresh..</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m thinking of giving this expired one away and keep buying from Macy&#x27;s even it if does cost more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne for men that I have used for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I supect that what I had ordered had ran out of stock and they just wanted to fulfil my order, in this way I am glad I picked Amazon to place my order.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
            <li> Glad that I ordered in off of Amazon.com,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaylie</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and so do the ladies.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The ladies love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my top 3 favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, been using this cologne for years now.</li>
            <li> I love this scent on a man.</li>
            <li> I guess, as another reviewer stated, they ran out of the stand alone fragrance, so to fulfill their customer&#x27;s satisfaction, they sent us something more :)</li>
            <li> this will be my favorite for a while.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> My favorite mens cologne.</li>
            <li> I love Kenneth cole reaction.</li>
            <li> This has a nice, clean yet sexy scent and is never overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Ken Cole Reaction is the best, crisp, fresh scent that never overpowers or emits too light of a scent.</li>
            <li> Since this cologne came out, i have loved this crisp and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day on my skin and is great for summer and high heat days.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Good seller was exactly like the one in the store</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to guys who want to smell amazing!!</li>
            <li> However, if you just want to smell nice for a quick date you&#x27;re going to, a lunch with a friend, meeting with a client, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too strong but lasts usually most of the day.</li>
            <li> so I felt extra secure ordering from them as they have excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> very simple sweet smell, great for every day/morning at work!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and primary cologne.</li>
            <li> Received this today, and my son loved it and it is reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the cologne its self smells gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Also the scent is very fresh -- Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too strong, with a nice, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> The price was excellent on Amazon compared to Macy&#x27;s or Dillard&#x27;s or even other online \\&quot;smell-good\\&quot; companies.  </li>
            <li> I love it fresh sexy smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not burning your nose strong.</li>
            <li> so the bottles didn&#x27;t leak, yet the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable and the deodorant is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased Reaction I liked it, and I used it within 3 years</li>
            <li> Not bad but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a good cologne to wear all the time, clean smell, but nothing that really excites me.</li>
            <li> i didnt expect this to be an every day scent, but i quickly became enamored with it!</li>
            <li> Got to me fairly quickly and smell just like i rememer!</li>
            <li> Nice large bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells cheap.</li>
            <li> seen it in here for cheap</li>
            <li> , it smells light, makes me think of summer.</li>
            <li> rather cheap compared to sticker prices.  </li>
            <li> love the summery fresh smell which is not too toxic and over powering, will probably buy this again and at this price you cant beat it.</li>
            <li> It leans more on the fresh and invigorating side, but there is an undertone of wood and musk.</li>
            <li> So this is perfect for individuals with a spring in their step, and a refined and humble demeanor.</li>
            <li> So perhaps that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap?  </li>
            <li> Great fragrance for my teenage son.</li>
            <li> Big smell great and cheep.  </li>
            <li> Cheap price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m as straight as the next board, but this cologne is delightful.</li>
            <li> I just really like this Cologne, and really don&#x27;t want to say much more because I don&#x27;t want too many more Men wearing My fragrance :-)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the cologne, but not just me, my wife and i constantly get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Exactly what he asked for!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very distinct smell.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and distinctive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it has got a spicy flavor which smells very fresh....</li>
            <li> Very fresh.  </li>
            <li> A signature scent of my husband and we both love it because it&#x27;s clean, fresh, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I would recommended this product to pretty much any guy who is searching for a good cologne without the huge price.</li>
            <li> Its very clean and fresh with a unique scent to it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather light, wears off quickly and has a light alcohol scent.  </li>
            <li> This has been my favorite cologne for years now ever since the first time I smelled it.  </li>
            <li> This is the original cologne, not a knock off.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, lasts not too long, however it isn&#x27;t overpowering either.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and more.</li>
            <li> Anywhere in the stores you pay 40-60 more for a smaller bottle, won&#x27;t need more for a year!</li>
            <li> I was excited to order some.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this for my bf who used to wear this cologne when we first met. :)</li>
            <li> This scent is crisp and clean - like most Kenneth Cole products.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s really clean and citrus like</li>
            <li> Clean scent.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but really mild and doesn&#x27;t stay for long.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it arrived pretty quick too.</li>
            <li> This was a smart buy for sure.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong or sweet, it is just right.  </li>
            <li> Just a great modern classic fragrance that you will consistently get complemented on.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, simple, clean!</li>
            <li> It is a discrete sweet summery smell with hints of fruit.  </li>
            <li> Being a regular user of Davidoff Coolwater, I tried this after reading some good reviews.</li>
            <li> i was like cool.  </li>
            <li> too so if the gift recipient likes it, he can readily stock up on more.  </li>
            <li> It came fast, as advertised and is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> Has a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is very crisp and clean.</li>
            <li> As of now, the scent in the box was pretty strong and the caps were still on everything with no leaks.</li>
            <li> first I was excited I found the product so cheap.  </li>
            <li> good  fresh clean smelling cologne, would be better if it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> I wear it for most of the summer months and change to something a bit stronger during the winter or for more formal events (Burberry London or similar).  </li>
            <li> It just not only came the perfume, it was an entire kit with body lotion and after shave, really awesome!</li>
            <li> Chose this rating because firstly the product is exactly what I ordered, a refreshing smell which is not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and will be buying it again when hubby is running low. :)</li>
            <li> Received quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Thank you again, also the colonge fits very well in my growing set of bottles in my collection, it smells great and last over 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Ok ok, now to the actual smell.</li>
            <li> Showed up quick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the very strong masculine &amp;#34;hit</li>
            <li> The kind that wakes you up, and conjures the image of a lush glade with a burbling stream right after the rain.</li>
            <li> Its a light fragrance that really makes a girl want to get closer!</li>
            <li> The problem is, he is very very very picky!</li>
            <li> Always loved reaction and you cannot beat this price for half of this bottle it cost more than the full bottle at Walmart and Walmart usually has great prices the 1.7 ounce cost $33 but on here</li>
            <li> and I think i found a new love.</li>
            <li> May be my new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and very summery; it&#x27;s quite sweet on my skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent-my hubbys favorite now!Clean smelling and a little goes a long ways!Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great sweet smell but soft and musky at the same time.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!!</li>
            <li> Very light yet masculine.</li>
            <li> It is a crisp and clean scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crisp and clean without overpowering.</li>
            <li> It has a sharp fruity smell when you first get a whiff of it, but then you start to smell all kinds of great things.</li>
            <li> He uses it daily and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Great green apple cologne.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reminiscent of a particularly exotic cocktail that you might find in a trendy bar somewhere, the sort of trendy bar that routinely offers drinks with vanilla vodka, lychee juice and raspberry liqueur in them and not just the bog standard Martini or Singapore Sling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reaction</li>
            <li> The cologne smells amazing and seems to last for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is fresh and sporty.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne so much that every time he sprays some on he remarks about how good it smells and he breathes deeply!</li>
            <li> It is not woodsy or overly powerful.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and fruity.</li>
            <li> He has the same kind</li>
            <li> This is my 20 year old son&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> I called customer service and was told that cologne is considered a hazardous material so it can only be shipped ground.  </li>
            <li> Not as powerful as a acqua di gio</li>
            <li> Reminds me of fresh cut cucumber.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and could not pass up a deeply discounted rate for this fantastic product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth throwing out.  </li>
            <li> Huge bottle for a most reasonable price over what you COULD pay for it at a major department or beauty store.</li>
            <li> This is the real product in original packaging.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know all the right adjectives to describe a smell</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments when wearing it and that tells me it&#x27;s doing something right.</li>
            <li> the price is just right</li>
            <li> (actually I had another fragrances too), and after 3 years when I run Out of it, I ordered new one with Amazon, this time I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>

            <li> and he was excited to get a new cologne.</li>
            <li> far as the perfume is concerned this is my favourite after constantly smelling all the new perfumes that have come out from all the top brands that cost twice or even thrice this one!!</li>
            <li> the first night I put it on</li>
            <li> This does not seem to last more than about 5 hours on me</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;The cologne had a scent to when first sprayed on, but after 10 minutes the fragrance was GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Smells great and last long.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> After the first spray to the neck, I wanted to take me out to a steak dinner, get with myself at my front door afterward and conclude it all with an invitation to the bedroom.</li>
            <li> Whenever you (or your spouse) find something you like, that is exactly when they stop holding it in retail stores in your area.  </li>
            <li> This came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> And it was exactly as described on website.</li>

            <li> Scent did not last more than 1 hour.</li>
            <li> It apparently works really well with my body chemistry as I have had more compliments on the cologne than I can count on two hands and two feet.  </li>
            <li> Love this cologne only one I&#x27;ll use</li>
            <li> Was exactly what it said it would be.</li>
            <li> Spend 20 bucks more and get the actual item.</li>
            <li> I like a lot of different colognes but this is one of if not the one I like the most.</li>
            <li> Jus as i always expected nice scent</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance,but doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li> Only cologne my husband wears. :)</li>
            <li> good a few compliment.</li>
            <li> Great subtle smell.</li>
            <li> I noticed all the good reviews are from back than anyone else bought this recently?</li>
            <li> Than you very much.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had almost nothing but positive experiences with Amazon and still buy often, but I will not purchase cologne again.  </li>
            <li> this product is my favorite so far since it can be worn everyday and is not an overwhelming scent</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always nice to be told that I smell good by random people!</li>
            <li> I just thought it would have a bit of a different smell than described, I guess I was looking for something a bit less musky, but it&#x27;s very strong and long lasting, great manly smell!</li>
            <li> It smells fresh, clean, and younger.</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly and I was surprised that it came with body wash and shower gel as well as</li>
            <li> This is what I have been looking for...not too strong, but lasting.  </li>
            <li> Smells good but don&#x27;t last long @ all.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just pure alcohol and no scent.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> The smell is clean, fresh and classic all at the same time.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this scent and so do I.</li>
            <li> Others he likes are LIght Blue, Chrome, Gucci Homme.  </li>
            <li> I really like it too.  </li>
            <li> It is the real deal from packaging to smell.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li> and i got way more than i expected.</li>
            <li> you so much.</li>
            <li> Its smelled nothing like the real thing.  </li>
            <li> this is not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came with more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> However I buy it off amazon because its so much cheaper than purchasing in the store.</li>
            <li> they are Christmas presents but they arrived wrapped very well in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Kenneth Cole Reaction cologne.</li>
            <li> it was MUCH cheaper.  </li>
            <li> After that the smell isn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I know my wife really loves this Col&amp;oacute;n.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves this smell, it&#x27;s almost a cucumber like smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looks like the real thing smells close but is a knock off.</li>
            <li> I really like Amazon</li>
            <li> Much appreciated gift.</li>
            <li> it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> It is not over powering and smells very manly.</li>
            <li> Good perfume, a bit edgy for business use....Great for outdoor &amp; sports</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on buying some more once I run out, which it has lasted me much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I love it and would tell other people about it and would them to buy it and try it out</li>
            <li> Very clean, fresh and not strong at all.</li>
            <li> is never going to have the street cred or mass-appeal of the other excellent summer staples like Cool Water, Acqua di Gio, Tommy or CK One, but for something certainly different which will make you stand out of the crowd, a cachet of its own, you certainly won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great size bottle lasts for a very long time with a few sprays a day.</li>
            <li> Not bad, I&#x27;d recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, however, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> When he was in high school and all the boys were spraying themselves with Axe, I said &amp;#34;no way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this for all the pimp-ass dudes out there who are looking to score some ladies.</li>
            <li> not as great as expected doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it also came in a box 4 times as large as the display box, and that&#x27;s because Amazon was so generous in sending me the Gift Set that came with Body Wash and Aftershave Balm.</li>
            <li> The smell is very light and does not last long.</li>
            <li> I found it for less than half on amazon and am once again wearing this great cologne.</li>
            <li> Reaction smells great, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this cologne for a few years and I love it,</li>
            <li> Gotten many compliments over the few years i&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> It is a great casual cologne.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the cologne all in for $36 which seemed about right until I actually got the product.</li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s not a really strong cologne.  </li>
            <li> Gift for husband to replace his Kenneth Cole New York.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I live in Iowa and have no connections whatsoever with either Kenneth Cole or Amazon.</li>
            <li> Due to low longevity, it really doesn&#x27;t deserve 5 stars, but it is such a nice scent</li>
            <li> There is a very clear difference and this is a cheap imitation.  </li>
            <li> no other way to really describe it.</li>
            <li> I ordered it, sprayed some on, and very quickly noticed the smell did not last as long as the store bought version I had gotten.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why more men do not use this.</li>
            <li> This is a complete fraud!</li>
            <li> the first thing I did was open it</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered, same size and brand.</li>
            <li> My product was delivered quickly and was everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> First of all let me start by thanking amazon for being brilliant and putting a smile on my face, I mean i was blown away by the fact that it came in one day!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift, it&#x27;s a fantastic smelling cologne and the Amazon Price was slightly cheaper than outlet prices with the added convenience of not having to go shopping during the busy season</li>
            <li> i bought this directly from amazon and not another seller, the cologne smells way too strongly of alcohol when compared to a genuine bottle, it also has marks on the largest of the sprayer neck that tells me it was probably either tampered or is 100% fake.</li>
            <li> Was so cheap I was a little worried to why.</li>
            <li> go to a retail outlet or directly from Kenneth Cole.</li>
            <li> In my opinion.. just buy these kinda stuff from the shop ( a reputed one ) directly...</li>
            <li> Young and old, this is for all ages.</li>
            <li> DIS FOR OLD MAN</li>
            <li> 18 year old college student.</li>
            <li> I find myself frequently giving out it name to others.</li>
            <li> He ended up liking it so much that this is the only spray he buys now.</li>
            <li> What a complete rip off.</li>
            <li> Seems to smell like the old Reaction.</li>
            <li> You have to use twice as much to get the same effect</li>
            <li> Maybe old?</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 19 year old grandson.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mellow and classy.</li>
            <li> The box on the left is a real one I bought at a store.</li>
            <li> his chip fill and the whole entire table men and women stoped and said omg what is that you have on!!!</li>
            <li> I might have just gotten an old bottle or it might not go well with my body.</li>
            <li> The box was completely packaged so it couldn&#x27;t have been opened.</li>
            <li> Masculine</li>
            <li> Smells like old</li>
            <li> you over the head&amp;#34; smell of a Polo or Brut or Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> Saw it in some shop for 50 bucks for the same size so big savings too and the perfume is fresh in case anyone was wondering, not an old perfume which feels like its lost its smell</li>
            <li> I have purchased three bottles so far</li>
            <li> It mixes well with a man&#x27;s natural scent.</li>
            <li> THe scent doesnt last long and runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a scent that becoming difficult to find (if not impossible) in stores.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptic of the recent reviews stating this was a cheap knock off, seeing as I&#x27;ve previously purchased it here with no problems, but was completely ticked off when I found out</li>
            <li> I thought it would be unique and different according to the description of other customers.</li>
            <li> I have use this cologne for several years now and I normally buy this from Kenneth Cole stores directly.</li>
            <li> but I really do like its unique and subtle nature.  </li>
            <li> Also the price is just right for the size and for what other stores and sites charge.</li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming and still is strong enough for a masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Not only did it arrive in less than a week&#x27;s time, but it came, as stated by Amazon, in its original factory packaging.</li>
            <li> Also when buying straight from amazon you actually receive an entire gift set which is not what i wanted as i won&#x27;t use the after shave or the body wash.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for something casual but stunning, get this!</li>
            <li> It is right up there with Kenneth Cole Black.</li>
            <li> Even though it had 4 1/2 stars, I was leary of those who said it was cheap, imitation, and wouldn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give it a shot, due to the positive feedback and price.</li>
            <li> I went in to a local outlet and they were completely sold out</li>
            <li> I surprised my husband with this cologne awhile back</li>
            <li> We compared to old bottle purchased at department store and the difference is obvious.</li>
            <li> my first bottle almost empty have to order second one for every day</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s some kind of fake.</li>
            <li> Out of all the colognes I have Tried over the years but have rarely found something I could wear everyday.</li>
            <li> Smells good but is a little weak for me.</li>
            <li> Back to Coolwater and maybe will try something new later.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really suggest it for an \\&quot;older\\&quot; man, but again, perfumes and cologne smell different on everybody due to your bodies natural oils.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the exact cologne for my husband at the mall.</li>
            <li> but I feel that this particular mixture had a lot of alcohol in it and this fragrance did not last as long as I am used to but</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of weeks now and worn it a few times and it never lasts more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I had read some concerning reviews about questionable sellers with cologne, but since I bought this direct through Amazon, I thought I was safe.  </li>
            <li> you cannot mail it back claiming it&#x27;s a dangerous good.</li>
            <li> They had it for half tge price of macys and it was the same exact thing</li>
            <li> I must&#x27;ve received a counterfeit product, you can barely smell the fragrance of this bottle and also doesn&#x27;t last at all</li>
            <li> Exactly the same size bottle I would&#x27;ve purchased for my husband at the store for half the price!</li>
            <li> The price is high compared to similar other colognes like the Claiborne Sport for men.</li>
            <li> Beware, once purchased, there is no return and for some reason my bottle must be really old/expired as it does NOT smell the same as the bottles I have previously purchased at dept. stores.</li>
            <li> At least it will smell right.</li>
            <li> you are having a hard time finding this product at stores I recommend to buy this cologne, but keep in mind that you will have to re-apply it around 4 hours after the first application.</li>
            <li> It just sees weak and not as strong as some of my other cologne.</li>
            <li> Smell does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> and then it does not last as long.</li>
            <li> Seems to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting smell</li>
            <li> I used to buy this locally at one or the other of two big, well known discount stores.</li>
            <li> I get sick of other colognes but this one always is fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> The box was missing the bar code, which is the first indication that it is not original.  </li>
            <li> This cologne gets a lot of compliments even after a long twelve hour shift.</li>
            <li> I should have made this purchase a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long, even after I shower, I can still smell it</li>
            <li> Smell lasts long too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange that they can mail it to you yet</li>
            <li> Some of them would even smell me for long amounts of time.</li>
            <li> For any age guy, I&#x27;m in my early 20s, been using for almost 5 years now and not a single complaint.</li>
            <li> Even the next day they still have a slight smell of it.</li>
            <li> I had given him this same gift previously</li>
            <li> I have to admit that the fragrance of the Amazon&#x27;s cologne is the same as the one at the stores, the difference is that Amazon&#x27;s doesnt last that much, usually it wears out in about 4 hours</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m gonna go for a cologne that is a little stronger next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The staying power is much less than other KC products and is only about 15-45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Just not exactly how I expected</li>
            <li> The scent is alright just like every other eau de toilette.</li>
            <li> and I can no longer buy it in the stores in my area due to it being discontinued.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SEXY SCENT, YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Yea, just like all the other one star ratings....</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve gone to other colognes, but nothing compares to this one.</li>
            <li> I had to take some unboxing and product pictures and post them so everyone can see what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this, but received a set, which at first I thought was wrong but after reading some other reviews I guess it is correct.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and other women always comment to me about it when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> but it included two other products as well (a lotion and conditioner).</li>
            <li> and I get alot of compliments from other people quite abit asking me what type of cologne i am wearing.</li>
            <li> I am saying this because some people say the scent only lasts a few minutes so unless they packaged the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; scent on the UPS truck and then dropped it off at my house to sit for a few hours</li>
            <li> had read in other reviews the same complaint, but figured I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an average looking guy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to claim this is fake however, the scent is gone within 2-3 hours regardless of how much you put on.</li>
            <li> This is watered down or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells like Reaction out of the bottle but seems like it might be watered down......</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not even a slight hint of any of the notes, all this smells like is rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> it was still spotted/smelled on me 4 and a half hours after application.</li>
            <li> and I was giving the black jack dealer</li>
            <li> After my wife broke my previous bottle by accidentally dropping it in the sink.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I can get a bottle twice the size and quantity for less than I was paying for the half size bottles at the discount stores.  </li>
            <li> When seeing how much less Reaction was on amazon</li>
            <li> The smell is slightly off though, with all three of the products.  </li>
            <li> not a good odor for a male.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but I feel like the prime symbol on this item is a little deceiving.</li>
            <li> Its become my little trick.</li>
            <li> After seeing that this product was one of the highly rated products in the fragrance section I decided to buy only to be highly disappointed by it.</li>
            <li> I smelt a few alternatives</li>
            <li> You can wear it year round</li>
            <li> Waste of money..  </li>
            <li> I re-order every few months, and am always satistied.</li>
            <li> Its my everyday perfume.</li>
            <li> and I would have saved myself a lot of trouble just going to the department store.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble of giving your guy a cologne that he douses himself with 100 times a day because he cannot smell it</li>
            <li> After a few hours, you literally have to sniff my shirt to smell it.</li>
            <li> a few hours after I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> but if I think it is a fake or a waste of money I will post back and let everyone know.</li>
            <li> overall its fake, don&#x27;t purchase it as legitament as it looks.</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly not sure how it smells because its a Christmas gift for my husband.</li>
            <li> Disappointed really.</li>
            <li> cologne for during the day, a little too weak for night.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard for others to even smell it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe cologne</li>
            <li> It is definitely an everyday casual dress down or up scent!</li>
            <li> Buying KC Reaction at least twice a year-</li>
            <li> so this was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> It sort of sucks</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;R\\&quot; in reaction is also poorly printed which is also a dead give away.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this cologne for the past 8 years!</li>
            <li> I have both bottles with me and did a side-by-side smell test (yes, seriously) and my friends can notice a difference as well</li>
            <li> I like the subtle scent it leaves on clothing.</li>
            <li> I hope this is just a bad knock off of a knock off because the actual stuff is supposed to smell like apples and that&#x27;s why I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have had bad luck ordering cologne on Amazon.</li>
            <li> However, the longevity is not good at all.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I would definitely try something else other than this almost knock off perfume if I had read the bad reviews:(</li>
            <li> and I would say that I am not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was using curve by Liz Claiborne, but eventually grew tired of it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I received a fake or this perfume generally smells this way, whatever the reason I hated the fragrance.</li>
            <li> but i recall it being a stronger yet subtle smell, this seems faint, almost diluted, hv to put on a lot</li>
            <li> I usually wear Givenchy&#x27;s Play Summer Vibrations as a casual cologne, but not it has been replaced!</li>
            <li> RANDOM:</li>
            <li> it was a blind buy</li>
            <li> /&gt;You are unable to return this item.  </li>
            <li> again sorry</li>
            <li> quite wrong.</li>
            <li> Even the product code on the bottom is fake.  </li>
            <li> Product looks fake.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> very unhappy does not smell like the purfume...</li>
            <li> it stains very bad...</li>
            <li> and it seemed horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband is hooked on this cologne. He loves it</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance! Best price ever.</li>
            <li> He  loved the scent. I bought for my husbands birthday and he was excited to get a new cologne.</li>
            <li> I had recent,y bought this cologne and I would say that I am not happy with it. This cologne doesn&#x27;t last longer than15 to 30 minutes and then fades out. Aftermabout 30 minutes no one can actually tell that you are wearing cologne so I would suggest look for something else.</li>
            <li> Fragrance goes away after a short while. I would definitely try something else other than this almost knock off perfume if I had read the bad reviews:(</li>
            <li> i bought this directly from amazon and not another seller, the cologne smells way too strongly of alcohol when compared to a genuine bottle, it also has marks on the largest of the sprayer neck that tells me it was probably either tampered or is 100% fake. the \\&quot;R\\&quot; in reaction is also poorly printed which is also a dead give away. i can&#x27;t find a serial number verifier, but mine has 2262 on the bottom of the cologne bottle. Also when buying straight from amazon you actually receive an entire gift set which is not what i wanted as i won&#x27;t use the after shave or the body wash. overall its fake, don&#x27;t purchase it as legitament as it looks. go to a retail outlet or directly from Kenneth Cole.</li>
            <li> Received this today, and my son loved it and it is reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Buying KC Reaction at least twice a year- last bottle was a knock off- scent dosnt last, diffent cap, pump, and sticker on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Smells good got me some booty  the first night I put it on</li>
            <li> Awesome scent-my hubbys favorite now!Clean smelling and a little goes a long ways!Love it!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the cologne its self smells gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and I got an awesome deal on this.  Will definitely buy product again.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice. Received product on time.</li>
            <li> KENNETH COLE, NEED I SAY MORE #TURNIT</li>
            <li> Great deal and the girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> I have now bought two different sprays ( RL Blue for women and this one) . For both of them I have felt that the intesity is too low. The only time you smell it is when you spray it.. ( or actually sniff your collars) .. In my opinion.. just buy these kinda stuff from the shop ( a reputed one ) directly... Just my two cents...</li>
            <li> I have bought several bottles of this now and I love it.  I get compliments on it all the time.  I wear it for most of the summer months and change to something a bit stronger during the winter or for more formal events (Burberry London or similar).  It is a great casual cologne.  I get compliments on it all the time.  It is a discrete sweet summery smell with hints of fruit.  I&#x27;m not a guy to buy a cologne that the best way you can describe is \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; but I really do like its unique and subtle nature.  I went in to a local outlet and they were completely sold out so I am buying it online.  I smelt a few alternatives but nothing was the same.</li>
            <li> Great price! Fast shipping thanks!!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this scent and so do I.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is fresh and sporty. The staying power is much less than other KC products and is only about 15-45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband&#x27;s 31st birthday this month and not only did it come in time but it was not damaged in any way. My husband loves this cologne so much that every time he sprays some on he remarks about how good it smells and he breathes deeply! I would definitely recommend this product to guys who want to smell amazing!! It is not woodsy or overly powerful. Its a light fragrance that really makes a girl want to get closer!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my best friend all the time. Oh Oh my goodness it smells so damn good. Its just the bomb. He loves it as well. I&#x27;m telling ladies get it for your boo fellas hey get for yourself the ladies will love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use to use this year&#x27;s ago, I reordered it and it&#x27;s still a great smell. RANDOM: The smell reminds me of the taste of the Snow Cone the ice-cream man use to have.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne at a great price!! Young and old, this is for all ages.</li>
            <li> Perfect scent for a teenage boy.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased Reaction I liked it, and I used it within 3 years (actually I had another fragrances too), and after 3 years when I run Out of it, I ordered new one with Amazon, this time I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Very good, light smell, long lasting. Recommend to others, too.&lt;br /&gt;It has comparable quality with Acqua Di Gio(Giorgio Armani), but much more cheaper than that.</li>
            <li> I must&#x27;ve received a counterfeit product, you can barely smell the fragrance of this bottle and also doesn&#x27;t last at all</li>
            <li> Reaction is probably one of the best colognes I have purchased.  You can wear it year round and I get compliments on it all the time.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this smell on my man!  What a great price Amazon!</li>
            <li> got here in time and it smells good! Good deal</li>
            <li> Smell does not last long at all. I use to have this Cologne bought from Macy and that scent lasted a lot longer. I can only smell it if I am sniffing my clothes. Anyone else have this problem? I noticed all the good reviews are from back than anyone else bought this recently?</li>
            <li> The scent is alright just like every other eau de toilette. It&#x27;s very light so it&#x27;s hard for others to even smell it. I thought it would be unique and different according to the description of other customers. Perhaps it depends on your type. I&#x27;d prefer something else over Reaction.</li>
            <li> Ummmmmmmm  smells SO GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> Kenneth did it again. Im in love with this product so is my husband. He uses it daily and smells amazing. I always get compliments wearing this product. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> I like the fruity melon fragrance it has.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it and some people ask me what it is.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000C1VYHU Kenneth Cole Reaction By Kenneth Cole For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells cheap. Smells like a honeydew-watermelon flavored handwash foam but good for the price!</li>
            <li> DIS FOR OLD MAN I WONT WEAR IT BUT MY MAN LUV IT LIKE HE LUV THE SUNSHINE ON A WINTER DAY YOU DONT WANNA KNOW WHERE I BEEN BEFORE I GET HI DIS SPRAY ITS LIKE HEAVN IN A BOTTLE AND I TELLIN EVERYONE AROUND</li>
            <li> I love the scent and so does everyone else! The scent is fresh and fruity. But a manly fruity (if that makes sense). This does not seem to last more than about 5 hours on me so I had to ding it...</li>
            <li> A signature scent of my husband and we both love it because it&#x27;s clean, fresh, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly not sure how it smells because its a Christmas gift for my husband. He has the same kind but it is almost out.</li>
            <li> I think this scent is awesome.  citrusy-fruity.  just sublime.  I count this among my top 3 (along with Armani Mania and Azzaro Chrome).</li>
            <li> This Spray had to be a knock-off product.&lt;br /&gt;The cologne had a scent to when first sprayed on, but after 10 minutes the fragrance was GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had read in other reviews the same complaint, but figured I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Dont even Bother!!!!!!!!@</li>
            <li> It stays on all day. Great.</li>
            <li> This is my 20 year old son&#x27;s favorite cologne.  Others he likes are LIght Blue, Chrome, Gucci Homme.  This has a nice, clean yet sexy scent and is never overpowering.  I really like it too.  When he was in high school and all the boys were spraying themselves with Axe, I said &amp;#34;no way.  Let&#x27;s go find something classy&amp;#34;.  I never pay department store prices when I order online.</li>
            <li> very unhappy does not smell like the purfume...dont buy it .its a knockoff and you cant return it to amazon..</li>
            <li> Was so cheap I was a little worried to why. Now that I have it and used it, it&#x27;s all good. Came quicker than they said as well as smells great! If they ever get more I&#x27;ll be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I started using this cologne a couple years ago and then they discontinued selling it at local stores. Glad that I was able to find it here and for a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne.  It is the real deal from packaging to smell.  There was a UPC on the box, and it is not a knock off spray cologne.  The shipping was super fast.  I received the order within 3 days of order.  Thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorites, this will last you about 6-10 hours and the scent is awesome. I always seem to get asked what it is. It&#x27;s a quality citrus/fruity scent.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful on my husband.</li>
            <li> I bought this for mu husband... any time he puts it on, I just want to jump on him. It smells very different on his body than what it smells like on his clothes. But I love it either way. Might be a good idea to try it on skin before you purchase, just in case.</li>
            <li> 18 year old college student. Have had this cologne for 2 years. Smells good but is a little weak for me. I think I&#x27;m gonna go for a cologne that is a little stronger next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good cologne for during the day, a little too weak for night.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift, it&#x27;s a fantastic smelling cologne and the Amazon Price was slightly cheaper than outlet prices with the added convenience of not having to go shopping during the busy season</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with my chemistry.  Otherwise, smells pretty good.  Will use mostly as room air freshener and for guests in bathroom.</li>
            <li> I just got it today off of reviews I&#x27;ve read so it was a blind buy so when I smelt it i was took away by the freshness of it very clean smelling nice to the nose I love it fresh sexy smell</li>
            <li> My husband wears this and I can no longer buy it in the stores in my area due to it being discontinued. Better price than I could get in the store. Would recommend to any man :)</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift. It was great he liked it. It was as the seller described and on the plus side smells amazing!</li>
            <li> my boyfriend use it, and I totally love the smell, he always receive compliments about the perfum, is fresh and long duration</li>
            <li> The box was missing the bar code, which is the first indication that it is not original.  The smell is very light and does not last long. I used this cologne before so know how it smells.  Do not buy this product</li>
            <li> Being a regular user of Davidoff Coolwater, I tried this after reading some good reviews. It smells great, but really mild and doesn&#x27;t stay for long. The price is high compared to similar other colognes like the Claiborne Sport for men. Wont be buying this again. Back to Coolwater and maybe will try something new later.</li>
            <li> We found this item in a Kenneth Cole outlet store a month ago and it was way overpriced.  I am very happy to say I found it online for him at a much more reasonable price.  The smell is clean, fresh and classic all at the same time.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m as straight as the next board, but this cologne is delightful. Once you get a whiff you&#x27;ll know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this cologne. It was a very good price for that size bottle and shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic of the recent reviews stating this was a cheap knock off, seeing as I&#x27;ve previously purchased it here with no problems, but was completely ticked off when I found out I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received was a knock off. You can ONLY tell by the smell. Spray it and it&#x27;s just pure alcohol and no scent. It&#x27;s awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this at all costs if you love the smell of the cologne.</li>
            <li> It just not only came the perfume, it was an entire kit with body lotion and after shave, really awesome!</li>
            <li> I have a great experience ordering. Product shipped very quickly after ordering, and arrived in nice packaging to assure that the bottle of cologne did not break during shipping. Would recommend ordering from them. Will order more in future for myself again!</li>
            <li> Since this cologne came out, i have loved this crisp and refreshing scent. Reminds me of a sunny summer day.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, the price was great, plus I receive the body wash and after shave at no additional charge.  Ernest, Chicago</li>
            <li> Chose this rating because firstly the product is exactly what I ordered, a refreshing smell which is not too overpowering. I would recommended this product to pretty much any guy who is searching for a good cologne without the huge price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price, and authentic cologne. What more can you ask for and I would definitely order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite cologne for years now ever since the first time I smelled it.  I get nothing but compliments and attention because of it too!  ;)</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Got this as a Christmas gift and the recipient loved it. He has been wearing it every day.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same size bottle I would&#x27;ve purchased for my husband at the store for half the price! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the original cologne, not a knock off.  Ordered at my son&#x27;s request.  He loves it!  And it&#x27;s cheaper than the store price!</li>
            <li> not as great as expected doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments from people on this cologne. It is cheaper than the department stores and in the same size.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I was using curve by Liz Claiborne, but eventually grew tired of it. I went to go cologne hunting in a department store, and found that this scent had a very nice \\&quot;summer\\&quot; sense to it. So i went bargain hunting online and found this great deal. Every else in department stores such as macys or target, it was in the $40+ range. I&#x27;d recommend amazon to anyone looking for a quality, and affordable fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is the real product in original packaging. It smells great, lasts not too long, however it isn&#x27;t overpowering either. Great cologne at a sweet price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied that i finally hv more but i recall it being a stronger yet subtle smell, this seems faint, almost diluted, hv to put on a lot</li>
            <li> guys....&lt;br /&gt;If you wear this and you are in a slump, you will get out of one in a hurry</li>
            <li> This cologne gets a lot of compliments even after a long twelve hour shift. I find myself frequently giving out it name to others.</li>
            <li> Gift for husband to replace his Kenneth Cole New York. Nice large bottle. Smells great.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne, so I was so happy to find it on amazon for this price.  I will caution you about the shipping... if you look at this as prime eligable for the free 2 day shipping, it&#x27;s not!  I have prime and ordered this, and it took over a week to get here.  I called customer service and was told that cologne is considered a hazardous material so it can only be shipped ground.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I feel like the prime symbol on this item is a little deceiving.</li>
            <li> very simple sweet smell, great for every day/morning at work! i didnt expect this to be an every day scent, but i quickly became enamored with it!</li>
            <li> Loved it and i got way more than i expected. I thought i waz only getting the cologne, but i also got after shave and body wash. Could not have asked for more.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume or cologne i love the kenneth cole reaction scent and as well the price cheap but amazing worth the wait :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok and not too pricey but thee are better alternatives out there. THe scent doesnt last long and runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> not a good odor for a male.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this cologne for a few years and I love it, really good smell.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a hefty bottle and lasts me about a year (using it aprox. 5 days a week).</li>
            <li> this cologne smells good but I feel that this particular mixture had a lot of alcohol in it and this fragrance did not last as long as I am used to but for the price its ok</li>
            <li> classic.&lt;br /&gt;never goes out of style.&lt;br /&gt; try blending it w Armani Gio...perfect blend.&lt;br /&gt;always gets compliments with them mixed together...</li>
            <li> Seems like this is a knock off. What did i expect with this pricee. My husband immediately asked if i got it online or at the store cuz it didnt smell right..GRRR! we use it on the boys when they wanna be like daddy.</li>
            <li> I love it and would tell other people about it and would them to buy it and try it out</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d purchase this as one of the gifts I was going to give my boyfriend for his birthday.  The problem is, he is very very very picky! I wasn&#x27;t sure if he would like this or not.  He ended up liking it so much that this is the only spray he buys now.</li>
            <li> For anyone who is asking.. Yes, this is real! Price is very reasonable and the deodorant is a nice bonus. Wish I could find the deodorant by itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years.  As soon as I smelled this I knew something was off.  This is watered down or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are unable to return this item.  What a complete rip off.</li>
            <li> Seems to smell like the old Reaction. I like it...but my wife likes it more :-)</li>
            <li> Smells great so I got the Deodorant Stick as well</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne my son wears. He said the women tell him how good he smells and they want to bite him.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne for years so it was great to find it online for so much cheaper than at the department store. Love this stuff and will be buying it again when hubby is running low. :)</li>
            <li> Bought Kenneth Cole Reaction for my hubby and my brother. Got it for a great price! Made good Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li> This product was not as it was advertised. It was instead a gift set that had the cologne body gel and aftershave. Also the scent is off I think it&#x27;s some kind of fake. It just doesn&#x27;t smell the same. I would not buy this product!!!! On a sidenote though Amazon was very good after I explained to them what happened about refunding my money!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not even a slight hint of any of the notes, all this smells like is rubbing alcohol. It&#x27;s a 27 dollar bottle of rubbing alcohol. I hope this is just a bad knock off of a knock off because the actual stuff is supposed to smell like apples and that&#x27;s why I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the first time from Belk. I decided to re-order this time from Amazon. This product is almost like water. You have to use twice as much to get the same effect and then it does not last as long.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS AWESOME AND WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN. PRICE WAS GREAT AND SHIPPING WAS FAST. THIS IS A SEXY SCENT, YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> The shipping on this very quick and the quality of the packaging was good as well.</li>
            <li> This smells so wonderful on my man!</li>
            <li> YAY!!! Great price. Great Deal. Great shipping. Smelly? Yes. Stinky? No. Do I ever need to shower again? Nope! This will bring the ladies in!</li>
            <li> Product did not smell like Kennith Cole reaction that I have been wearing for years. Maybe old? Was going to return it but a friend of mine liked it so I let him have it. I guess you get what you pay for. This is the second time I have had bad luck ordering cologne on Amazon. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Great fresh spring smell, been using this for years</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. TIMELY DELIVERY</li>
            <li> awesome stuff so not over powering</li>
            <li> great i loved and  i like buying thing from you now and the future i will be buying only from you guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I like the reaction cologne this is my first time purchasing this cologne, I&#x27;m okay with it , I must agree with every one els it does not last long , it does smell okay not a bad smell , I can see wearing this cologne day or night , any given day any occasion !</li>
            <li> Got took for a ride.  Waste of money..  i been using reaction for yrs..  seen it in here for cheap so i decided to order it.  I order the cologne.  And the product came in a 3 pt set..  i was like cool.  So i opened the box.. spary the cologne  my shirt. Its smelled nothing like the real thing.  Smells like alcohol.  I learned my lession never buy a cologne  off amazon again..</li>
            <li> LIKE I SAID THIS MAN CAN DO NO WRONG FOR ME</li>
            <li> I like this cologne, it smells light, makes me think of summer.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and that&#x27;s what matters most.  It was a great price and product.  Smells great and last long.</li>
            <li> Great green apple cologne.  Its very clean and fresh with a unique scent to it.  Somewhat synthetic, but still very enjoyable.  A fairly safe scent to gift to people and it can be bought here on amazon rather cheap compared to sticker prices.  Very easy to find too so if the gift recipient likes it, he can readily stock up on more.  Lasts all day on my skin and is great for summer and high heat days.  I still wear it in the winter and its one of those fragrances you cannot overdo.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t get this on your clothing.. it stains very bad...All my dress shirt color got an oily stain..</li>
            <li> Yea, just like all the other one star ratings....this is not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars to Amazon on the way they handle it, but just disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, you have to buy this stuff in an actual store.Peroid</li>
            <li> Smells great but is very light. Definitely​ a summer fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is what I have been looking for...not too strong, but lasting.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this for all the pimp-ass dudes out there who are looking to score some ladies.</li>
            <li> I surprised my husband with this cologne awhile back and he was thrilled at what a deal I got on it. So was I. You just can&#x27;t beat this price anywhere. Awesome product... awesome price. My husband smells amazing! ;)</li>
            <li> It came fast, as advertised and is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Delivery was great product not happy doesnt feel genuine .....fragerance doesnt last will not buy from this company again sorry but this is my review, wish i can return the 2nd I bought thought it was a bargain.....quite wrong.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t bought cologne in a while and I saw this stuff on the site here. Thought I&#x27;d give it a shot, due to the positive feedback and price. I certainly don&#x27;t regret it. It smells AMAZING. After the first spray to the neck, I wanted to take me out to a steak dinner, get with myself at my front door afterward and conclude it all with an invitation to the bedroom. I literally slapped my ass, and said \\&quot;Yello!\\&quot;  I will, without a doubt, be purchasing this again. Thank you for showing me this product, Amazon. I am forever in love with you.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Have had many people complement it at work. I can still smell it in the cloths at night when I get home.  Seems to last a long time.  Even the next day they still have a slight smell of it.</li>
            <li> I like this cologne alot, and this is a great price for it.  I re-order every few months, and am always satistied.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i bought this and I think i found a new love. Its my everyday perfume. Lasts all day on my skin and in my clothes. Its not overpowering but it gives me all the confidence i need for my day. Amazing price too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll def buy again</li>
            <li> It came with more than I expected.  Whenever you (or your spouse) find something you like, that is exactly when they stop holding it in retail stores in your area.  I was happy to find it on Amazon. Exactly what I wanted and more.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne out there! It&#x27;s a very distinct smell.</li>
            <li> Smells good, girlfriend loves the citrus smell on me.</li>
            <li> Was very glad to get this for my husband, he was too.</li>
            <li> This came exactly as described. The price is unbeatable compared to what you would pay in a mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is also very good. I don&#x27;t know all the right adjectives to describe a smell but I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments when wearing it and that tells me it&#x27;s doing something right. Boys and girls alike have both been like &amp;#34;woah, you smell really good! what is that?&amp;#34; I even went to hug my aunt as I was leaving one evening and she made a comment on how good I smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be sticking with this scent.</li>
            <li> Same quality of cologne and it&#x27;s the cheapest I have found.</li>
            <li> I loved &#x27;Candies for Men&amp;#34; and since they discotinued that, this is the closest.  It&#x27;s a nice fruity.flowery smell without being &#x27;girly&#x27;.  Love this scent.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 19 year old grandson.  I had given him this same gift previously and he wanted more.</li>
            <li> This is a great sweet smell but soft and musky at the same time. Not as powerful as a acqua di gio but it gets the job done. Reaction and Acqua are my two favs. **update I keep getting lots of compliments on this. Long lasting smell even I thought the smell had weakened it was still spotted/smelled on me 4 and a half hours after application.</li>
            <li> The heading says it all, what more do you want in a cologne?  I have been wearing this for years now and still will have women remark at how good it smells.  Not sure why more men do not use this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son because he loves Kenneth Cole Reaction and had run out.  This is not Kenneth Cole Reaction!  Even the product code on the bottom is fake.  This is a complete fraud!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great. The price is great, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s not burning your nose strong. It&#x27;s mellow and classy. Very nice for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day. Got it on time and everything. Came sealed in plastic and in the box. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Product looks fake. The box on the left is a real one I bought at a store. No serial number on the bottle and smells like alcohol.</li>
            <li> Good seller was exactly like the one in the store</li>
            <li> I have literally bought this bottle of reaction like 5 times over the course of 7 years... I get sooooo many complements off of it.... I highly recommend this product! !!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time I was working at a Casino and I was giving the black jack dealer his chip fill and the whole entire table men and women stoped and said omg what is that you have on!!! It smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> to be honest I already knew what the product smelled like so I knew I was gonna like it. However I buy it off amazon because its so much cheaper than purchasing in the store. Its become my little trick.</li>
            <li> My husband loved the scent</li>
            <li> Exactly what he asked for!! If he&#x27;s happy we can relax!</li>
            <li> I love the scent, best purchase i ever made when it comes to cologne.</li>
            <li> good  fresh clean smelling cologne, would be better if it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> Good perfume, a bit edgy for business use....Great for outdoor &amp; sports</li>
            <li> I should have made this purchase a long time ago. Every time I go out wearing it, I get a compliment on the smell. In a word. Perfection.</li>
            <li> they are Christmas presents but they arrived wrapped very well in bubble wrap. excellant</li>
            <li> Buyer beware. This is not the real Kenneth Cole Reaction cologne. We compared to old bottle purchased at department store and the difference is obvious. I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years and the difference is simple to detect. Bottle labeling is also different.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and very summery; it&#x27;s quite sweet on my skin. The dominant notes are fruity - apple and more that a hint of melon. It&#x27;s reminiscent of a particularly exotic cocktail that you might find in a trendy bar somewhere, the sort of trendy bar that routinely offers drinks with vanilla vodka, lychee juice and raspberry liqueur in them and not just the bog standard Martini or Singapore Sling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reaction is never going to have the street cred or mass-appeal of the other excellent summer staples like Cool Water, Acqua di Gio, Tommy or CK One, but for something certainly different which will make you stand out of the crowd, a cachet of its own, you certainly won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is one cologne that both my husband and I agree on.  It is not too strong or sweet, it is just right.  The price was excellent on Amazon compared to Macy&#x27;s or Dillard&#x27;s or even other online \\&quot;smell-good\\&quot; companies.  I am giving this to my husband this weekend for our anniversary.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> After my wife broke my previous bottle by accidentally dropping it in the sink.  I was not relishing the thought of buying another bottle at $40 plus.  So I checked on Amazon and low and behold it was MUCH cheaper.  Even though it had 4 1/2 stars, I was leary of those who said it was cheap, imitation, and wouldn&#x27;t last long.  My experience has been the opposite.  The bottle I got was every bit as good as what I paid for at a fancy department store.  Kudos to Amazon for saving me money again!</li>
            <li> My son and husband loved it !</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great price.</li>
            <li> This product was great for the price and amount! Anywhere in the stores you pay 40-60 more for a smaller bottle, won&#x27;t need more for a year!</li>
            <li> Got to me fairly quickly and smell just like i rememer! And the price beat any store i went to</li>
            <li> Not bad, I&#x27;d recommend for daily use. Has a sweet smell. Lasts all day long, even after I shower, I can still smell it</li>
            <li> Reaction smells great, don&#x27;t get me wrong. It just sees weak and not as strong as some of my other cologne. It only sees to last about 4-6 hours. After that the smell isn&#x27;t very noticeable. Good for work and going to classes. The smell is very crisp and clean. If this lasted longer I would give it four stars. I might have just gotten an old bottle or it might not go well with my body.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING!!! Great price too!!</li>
            <li> The product came in a timely manner.  And it was exactly as described on website. I know my wife really loves this Col&amp;oacute;n. And if ever priced the same bottle as a retail store you&#x27;ll pay almost double.</li>
            <li> Shipped in great time. And it was cheap! Very satisfied! The box was completely packaged so it couldn&#x27;t have been opened.</li>
            <li> Smells really good. the price is just right.. will defiantly buy again once i run iout.  good a few compliment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I ordered. Smell lasts long too.</li>
            <li> I just really like this Cologne, and really don&#x27;t want to say much more because I don&#x27;t want too many more Men wearing My fragrance :-)</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. I&#x27;ve worn it almost daily for several years. It is a crisp and clean scent. I always get asked what I&#x27;m wearing because people like it. I&#x27;m an average looking guy so it&#x27;s always nice to be told that I smell good by random people!</li>
            <li> My order was completely satisfied. Than you very much.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This was a knockoff do not purchase. I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute; and it had zero smell and I would have saved myself a lot of trouble just going to the department store. It isn&#x27;t that amazon won&#x27;t send you another-it will like&lt;br /&gt;Y come from the same darn place or another knockoff company. Save yourself the trouble of giving your guy a cologne that he douses himself with 100 times a day because he cannot smell it</li>
            <li> Not only did it arrive in less than a week&#x27;s time, but it came, as stated by Amazon, in its original factory packaging. Huge bottle for a most reasonable price over what you COULD pay for it at a major department or beauty store. And as this item was from the Amazon marketplace, they guarantee their products so I felt extra secure ordering from them as they have excellent customer service. I don&#x27;t know what I did before Amazon came on the scene:)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the cologne, but not just me, my wife and i constantly get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great in the bottle and on the man. Its one of the best smells out on the market right now, in my opinion. VERY happy! And such a great price from amazon!</li>
            <li> Ordered several for Christmas gifts. Received quickly and packaged well. Great scent, without being overpowering. Love it! and, so did the receivers!!</li>
            <li> Love everything about this cologne. I bought it for my boyfriend 6 years ago, and every year since he always asks for it (for holidays and what not). We&#x27;ve gone to other colognes, but nothing compares to this one. It smells fresh, clean, and younger. I don&#x27;t really suggest it for an \\&quot;older\\&quot; man, but again, perfumes and cologne smell different on everybody due to your bodies natural oils.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. I got a good whiff of the scent in store before purchasing. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne!</li>
            <li> Great Value and fresh smell. I get sick of other colognes but this one always is fresh and clean smelling. Reminds me of spring.</li>
            <li> Smells great and long lasting. My last purchase was a gift to my son and I&#x27;ll be getting another one for myself</li>
            <li> Love the scent on my boyfriend. I just ordered his fourth bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, simple, clean! Masculine</li>
            <li> You know the feeling walk on a field of grass, this is exactly how I feel when I smell this</li>
            <li> This is a good cologne to wear all the time, clean smell, but nothing that really excites me.I like a cologne that makes people say you smell good , what are you wearing!</li>
            <li> Scent did not last more than 1 hour. Disappointed really. SIgh</li>
            <li> Bet men&#x27;s fragrance ever</li>
            <li> The smell would only last for about 15 minutes if that.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, however, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long enough. If you are thinking of wearing this cologne to work, where you spend 7-11 hours a day, this will not do the job. However, if you just want to smell nice for a quick date you&#x27;re going to, a lunch with a friend, meeting with a client, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of weeks now and worn it a few times and it never lasts more than a few hours. After a few hours, you literally have to sniff my shirt to smell it.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I was in good price and because they said it smelled good, when I get to Ecuador the first thing I did was open it and it seemed horrible. Smells like old</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent. Reminds me of fresh cut cucumber.</li>
            <li> I had to take some unboxing and product pictures and post them so everyone can see what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this, but received a set, which at first I thought was wrong but after reading some other reviews I guess it is correct. Score!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this yet but if I think it is a fake or a waste of money I will post back and let everyone know. As of now, the scent in the box was pretty strong and the caps were still on everything with no leaks. To check, I rubbed my fingers all over everything and then smelled them for the Reaction smell and didn&#x27;t smell anything so the bottles didn&#x27;t leak, yet the smell is strong. I am saying this because some people say the scent only lasts a few minutes so unless they packaged the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; scent on the UPS truck and then dropped it off at my house to sit for a few hours this seems like a quality product. Also the scent is very fresh -- Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for quite some time now. I love it because it&#x27;s not a really strong cologne.  As I spray it on and the fragrance hits my nose my brain says &amp;#34;watermelon&amp;#34;. It does have a kind of fruit fragrance to it. It apparently works really well with my body chemistry as I have had more compliments on the cologne than I can count on two hands and two feet.  I used to buy this locally at one or the other of two big, well known discount stores. Suddenly, neither store carries it any longer. I looked on Amazon to see if they sell it and low and behold they do. In fact, I can get a bottle twice the size and quantity for less than I was paying for the half size bottles at the discount stores.  Love the product and love Amazon for carrying it. Disclaimer: I live in Iowa and have no connections whatsoever with either Kenneth Cole or Amazon. I&#x27;m just a very satisfied customer of both companies.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  Very fresh and distinctive.  However, the longevity is not good at all.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good daytime EDT... But you will need to re-apply if you want it to last through the day -- just don&#x27;t over apply, as this scent has the potential to get cloying.  Due to low longevity, it really doesn&#x27;t deserve 5 stars, but it is such a nice scent I didn&#x27;t want to give it a 4 either.</li>
            <li> The cologne smells amazing and seems to last for an extended period of time. Have had many compliments on smellinod good a few hours after I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> Out of all the colognes I have Tried over the years but have rarely found something I could wear everyday. this product always give me so many compliments about how great it smells. Also the price is just right for the size and for what other stores and sites charge.</li>
            <li> Buy this perfume because my brother likes this fragrance when buying a smaller version. Not bad but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this purchase.  Ive had these cologne before and I truly believe what was shipped to me was a knockoff.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for a gift to give away. it smells just like it should looks just like I should and it was cheaper than getting in the store.</li>
            <li> I just thought it would have a bit of a different smell than described, I guess I was looking for something a bit less musky, but it&#x27;s very strong and long lasting, great manly smell! Just not exactly how I expected</li>
            <li> I had read some concerning reviews about questionable sellers with cologne, but since I bought this direct through Amazon, I thought I was safe.  I&#x27;ve had almost nothing but positive experiences with Amazon and still buy often, but I will not purchase cologne again.  The cologne wears off after about 10 seconds and must be a knock off or something with water added.  I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell that most guys don&#x27;t wear which makes it even better. I always Hey compliments.</li>
            <li> Every girl loves this</li>
            <li> This scent is crisp and clean - like most Kenneth Cole products. This was a smart buy for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this scent... I have gotten so many compliments on how delightfully delicious I smell... Guys you are gonna love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I buy this every year and I have never had a problem. Getting ready to purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> Product may be fraud, immediately asked for a refund.  Smelled more like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Just a great modern classic fragrance that you will consistently get complemented on. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband since he was running out of his current bottle! He absolutely loves this smell, it&#x27;s almost a cucumber like smell. We love it! It was exactly what I ordered, same size and brand. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like this deal. you get the 3.4oz plus body wash and after shave balm.  It&#x27;s a really good deal. This smells very good.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne.  My girlfriend and other women always comment to me about it when I wear it.  It&#x27;s hard to describe cologne but this is a lighter, citrusy-musky smell.  It doesn&#x27;t have the very strong masculine &amp;#34;hit you over the head&amp;#34; smell of a Polo or Brut or Old Spice.  I think it&#x27;s perfect.  I&#x27;m on my fourth bottle of it, which says a lot.</li>
            <li> love this smell and great price</li>
            <li> This is was a Christmas present for my daughter&#x27;s boyfriend! It is his favorite and I see why after he let me smell it!</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance which I like to use on fridays or just before heading for the gym...&lt;br /&gt;it has got a spicy flavor which smells very fresh....</li>
            <li> One of the best perfumes they don&#x27;t Cary them any more in malls or else where when I founded on amazon was nice surprise my first bottle almost empty have to order second one for every day use awesome not to strong highly recommend amazon delivers on time.</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne! You will not be disappointed. Very clean, fresh and not strong at all.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and could not pass up a deeply discounted rate for this fantastic product. Nice, bright and citrus notes, without being too sweet and/or overpowering.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the exact cologne for my husband at the mall. Well I couldn&#x27;t find it when he was through with it purchased it from here and the smell is very light. He has to spritz like 10 times to have any fragrance.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this cologne for 65+ at the department stores. I was my alltime favorite. I found it for less than half on amazon and am once again wearing this great cologne.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne only one I&#x27;ll use</li>
            <li> Smells so good my girlfriend says I smell like a slut. : ) I guess it just makes her jealous</li>
            <li> I have use this cologne for several years now and I normally buy this from Kenneth Cole stores directly. Since like a year ago they stop having this item in its inventory, I decided to buy it from Amazon. I have to admit that the fragrance of the Amazon&#x27;s cologne is the same as the one at the stores, the difference is that Amazon&#x27;s doesnt last that much, usually it wears out in about 4 hours vrs Store&#x27;s all day long.&lt;br /&gt;If you are having a hard time finding this product at stores I recommend to buy this cologne, but keep in mind that you will have to re-apply it around 4 hours after the first application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become a staple for me as I have received many complements on the scent and use of this product.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne.  Very fresh.  Great day!</li>
            <li> First of all let me start by thanking amazon for being brilliant and putting a smile on my face, I mean i was blown away by the fact that it came in one day!!!!!! Even though the delivery estimate was for five days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the perfume is concerned this is my favourite after constantly smelling all the new perfumes that have come out from all the top brands that cost twice or even thrice this one!! love the summery fresh smell which is not too toxic and over powering, will probably buy this again and at this price you cant beat it. Saw it in some shop for 50 bucks for the same size so big savings too and the perfume is fresh in case anyone was wondering, not an old perfume which feels like its lost its smell</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really good and is half the price as other good smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> After seeing that this product was one of the highly rated products in the fragrance section I decided to buy only to be highly disappointed by it.I am not sure if I received a fake or this perfume generally smells this way, whatever the reason I hated the fragrance. I bought this around 4 months back and have used it only once or twice. NOT RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> The ladies love this on me. I would only put two sprays on myself after the shower, and I would still receive compliments several hours later. It has this amazing alluring scent. The kind that wakes you up, and conjures the image of a lush glade with a burbling stream right after the rain. It leans more on the fresh and invigorating side, but there is an undertone of wood and musk. I think men are &#x27;musky&#x27; enough, you know what I&#x27;m saying? So this is perfect for individuals with a spring in their step, and a refined and humble demeanor.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what it said it would be.</li>
            <li> Ken Cole Reaction is the best, crisp, fresh scent that never overpowers or emits too light of a scent. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; as people know me.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite fragrances. It smells great and the price was great. No complaints here!</li>
            <li> Very good. Bought this years ago and have been sold ever since</li>
            <li> Ive been using this cologne for the past 8 years! this is the only cologne i have ever used! i know the way this is supposed to smell and boy did I get ripped off when i purchased it from amazon. I ordered 2 and both of them smell like rubbing alcohol. Go to a dept. store and buy it. Spend 20 bucks more and get the actual item.</li>
            <li> I like a lot of different colognes but this is one of if not the one I like the most.</li>
            <li> What are great deal this was!  I purchased the cologne all in for $36 which seemed about right until I actually got the product. The bottle was nearly double the size of my current bottle that I bought from Kohl&#x27;s (for the same price and I had a 30% off coupon). Not only was the bottle twice he size but it included two other products as well (a lotion and conditioner).</li>
            <li> Jus as i always expected nice scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looks like the real thing smells close but is a knock off. And the scent is gone in ten minutes. It&#x27;s cheaper for a reason!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent. On my third bottle. Ordered a bottle and got a gift pak instead... Even better!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne on Amazon because I had purchased some in the store and really liked it.  When seeing how much less Reaction was on amazon I was excited to order some.  I ordered it, sprayed some on, and very quickly noticed the smell did not last as long as the store bought version I had gotten.  In fact I would say the smell lasts maybe ten minutes if that.  I sprayed on a lot more to see if it would smell longer and it made no difference.  Unless Amazon corrects this issue, I won&#x27;t buy cologne from them again.  There is a very clear difference and this is a cheap imitation.  It&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s worth throwing out.  I really like Amazon so this was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to claim this is fake however, the scent is gone within 2-3 hours regardless of how much you put on. Smells like Reaction out of the bottle but seems like it might be watered down......</li>
            <li> Always loved reaction and you cannot beat this price for half of this bottle it cost more than the full bottle at Walmart and Walmart usually has great prices the 1.7 ounce cost $33 but on here the 3.4 ounce cost 27 do the math</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne! I get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> Father&#x27;s Days 🎁...nothing more attractive than a man that reeks of K.C. reaction...</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne. He used it up and needs/wants to get more.  Would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Purchased this online because of the price and it&#x27;s definitely my fav cologne at the moment. Beware, once purchased, there is no return and for some reason my bottle must be really old/expired as it does NOT smell the same as the bottles I have previously purchased at dept. stores. I have both bottles with me and did a side-by-side smell test (yes, seriously) and my friends can notice a difference as well so it&#x27;s not just me. Well one of them couldn&#x27;t but he doesn&#x27;t even wear cologne. The scent is just not as bright or fresh.. no other way to really describe it. I can&#x27;t return it so I&#x27;m thinking of giving this expired one away and keep buying from Macy&#x27;s even it if does cost more. At least it will smell right. It&#x27;s strange that they can mail it to you yet you cannot mail it back claiming it&#x27;s a dangerous good.</li>
            <li> this product is my favorite so far since it can be worn everyday and is not an overwhelming scent&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s really clean and citrus like</li>
            <li> Great buy for the box set</li>
            <li> Good smell, nice for a gift.</li>
            <li> Smooth , spicy an cool for about 30 min better put it in your pocket !!</li>
            <li> Much appreciated gift.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome deal.  Look forward to when I run out.  I just love this scent - sadly, it&#x27;s a scent that becoming difficult to find (if not impossible) in stores.  Got it fast and was impressed!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne for men that I have used for quite some time. It smells wonderful and I get alot of compliments from other people quite abit asking me what type of cologne i am wearing.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!! Will defi reorder soon and stock up!!</li>
            <li> Great cologne!! Love the smell and it arrived pretty quick too. I will note it can only ship ground but that is not listed by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but I was very happy with this purchase. The cologne smells great, really good price and received it on time. Great service!</li>
            <li> I order this product that was only listed as just the bottle, what I got in the mail was the gift set the bottle, body gel &amp; shampoo, and after shave lotion. I supect that what I had ordered had ran out of stock and they just wanted to fulfil my order, in this way I am glad I picked Amazon to place my order. Thank you again, also the colonge fits very well in my growing set of bottles in my collection, it smells great and last over 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Great subtle smell. Very light yet masculine. I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments since I&#x27;ve started wearing it and it had an unbeatable price. May be my new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband.  This is his all-time favorite cologne and it has become my favorite too!  Fragrance is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love this scent on my husband! I buy jim a bottle every year for his birthday. It is definitely an everyday casual dress down or up scent! He loves it as well, it is his favorite!  Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Got it for my boyfriend for Christmas, came on time and was packaged like I bought it at a department store! couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
            <li> Ordered this cologne for Christmas for my boyfriend. I love the scent!! Great price compared to store price. Glad that I ordered in off of Amazon.com,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaylie</li>
            <li> It smells great, my girlfriend loves every time I wear it. I&#x27;m planning on buying some more once I run out, which it has lasted me much longer than I expected.</li>

            <li> Great product, arrived as described/expected.</li>
            <li> Everyone tells me I smell great. I guess that&#x27;s all one can hope for in life!</li>
            <li> I always try to get different colognes for my hubs at Christmas time. He loves this one. It is right up there with Kenneth Cole Black. It is not over powering and smells very manly. I love it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000C1VYHU Kenneth Cole Reaction By Kenneth Cole For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::BOUGHT AND SOLD BY AMAZON::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was excited I found the product so cheap.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and was glad to have found a great price on it.  The package arrived quickly and I was surprised that it came with body wash and shower gel as well as I thought I was only ordering the cologne.  The smell is slightly off though, with all three of the products.  It&#x27;s rather light, wears off quickly and has a light alcohol scent.  I&#x27;m assuming one of two things happened:  1) It&#x27;s a knock off and I was taken or 2) It&#x27;s a legit gift set, but it has passed its expiration date.  So perhaps that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap?  It sort of sucks, I wish I would have known that before I bought it.  Just do yourself a favor and pick up a bottle at the mall for an extra twenty bucks.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance for my teenage son.</li>
            <li> Excellent and great price!!!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance,but doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li> It was shipped 3 days sooner than they said and all my friends love the smell!!! Some of them would even smell me for long amounts of time. Lol</li>
            <li> This is my top 3 favorite colognes. What a steal! It also came with a shower gel and deodorant which was a bonus! My wife loves this smell &amp; I would imagine all women do.</li>
            <li> Smells good but don&#x27;t last long @ all. Buy something else.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance.  It is not overwhelming and still is strong enough for a masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, been using this cologne for years now. Get asked on a daily basis what cologne I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! For some reason, Amazon is the only place I could find this cologne. Great price, too. Purchased this for my bf who used to wear this cologne when we first met. :)</li>
            <li> I love this scent on a man. It&#x27;s crisp and clean without overpowering. I like the subtle scent it leaves on clothing. It mixes well with a man&#x27;s natural scent. Only cologne my husband wears. :)</li>
            <li> Good price for a great scent!</li>
            <li> i will never get this stuff at the mall again. Big smell great and cheep.  I got one for everyone as a christmas presant</li>
            <li> Gave as gift, good price for this. Clean scent.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband all the time. Great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this fragrance in my Amazon Wish List for the longest time ever since I heard about it from a YouTube review. It actually arrived in 3 days from Cali to Texas once I ordered it! I was surprised that it also came in a box 4 times as large as the display box, and that&#x27;s because Amazon was so generous in sending me the Gift Set that came with Body Wash and Aftershave Balm. I was so happy about this! I guess, as another reviewer stated, they ran out of the stand alone fragrance, so to fulfill their customer&#x27;s satisfaction, they sent us something more :) Ok ok, now to the actual smell. IT IS AMAZING! It has a sharp fruity smell when you first get a whiff of it, but then you start to smell all kinds of great things. Forgive me, as I do not know the \\&quot;ingredients\\&quot; of it, but I have to say...this will be my favorite for a while. I usually wear Givenchy&#x27;s Play Summer Vibrations as a casual cologne, but not it has been replaced! :) So if you&#x27;re looking for something casual but stunning, get this! It&#x27;s so cheap too!!! And if you&#x27;re lucky, you might get the gift set too!!!!! Go for it dude or dudette!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and primary cologne. I use it on a regular basis. Not too strong but lasts usually most of the day. Great size bottle lasts for a very long time with a few sprays a day. Price is great too. Gotten many compliments over the few years i&#x27;ve used it. For any age guy, I&#x27;m in my early 20s, been using for almost 5 years now and not a single complaint.</li>
            <li> My favorite mens cologne. Not too strong, with a nice, fresh scent. A very nice daytime cologne. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Cheap price. Showed up quick. Smells amazing.  I love Kenneth cole reaction. They had it for half tge price of macys and it was the same exact thing</li>
