            <li>My favorite eyeliner!  </li>
            <li>Also, I was doing massages at the office  in a warm room</li>
            <li>but I still think it looks really nice</li>
            <li>Was thrilled to find it again.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and easy to undo if you don&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cake eyeliner...</li>
            <li>So Glad that I am still able to get this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many others, ie....liquid, gel, pencils,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I remembered this and bought it again and LOVE it...</li>
            <li>I was glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much better than the gels.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner and wish that Clinique had not discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>I have found that it is best applied after a layer of  eye shadow is brushed on the eyelid.</li>
            <li>Such a great eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about 9 years now and still love it.</li>
            <li>Came as promised and easy to make a very fine tip on the brush.  </li>
            <li>For great looks, I highly recommend Clinique Water Resistant Eyeliner</li>
            <li>some how I got a pack with a light black.so not fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and it was 85 yesterday, kind of warm, but still stayed.  </li>
            <li>goes on really easily</li>
            <li>Hands down, best eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different kinds of liquid liners but nothing works as good as this cake liner.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it lasts very well and is economical to buy in the long run.  </li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner - so much easier to use than a pencil and it doesn&#x27;t flake off or smudge.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a perfect delicate line that doesn&#x27;t fade all day.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and so glad Clinique put it back on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a cake eyeliner for what seems like forever, and this is definitely a worthy replacement.</li>
            <li>Thanks Clinique for making such a great product for my whole life!</li>
            <li>This is the best eyeliner for me because the brush is so thin and gets the liner on without smearing.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t go on as dark or as easily as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, and will literally last for years.</li>
            <li>Because it is in a flat case with the liner and brush tucked into a drawer that you pull out, you can keep it securely in a purse and find it easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, even for the young beginner.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy even on old eyelids.</li>
            <li>Easy application, easy removal, just wet the brush</li>
            <li>and it makes a nice thin line, wears well, very easy to remove at night.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the price is a lot more than when Clinique sold it.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted..love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to apply than pencils, gel, etc.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>You can increase or decrease the intensity of the color depending on how much water you mix it with, and it stays put ALL day without smudging at all.</li>
            <li>The brush is very manageable even if your eyesight and/or hand steadiness is imperfect.</li>
            <li>This product will last a very long time, so it&#x27;s much more economical than using eyeliner pencils.</li>
            <li>I paid less and it was more convenient.  </li>
            <li>It goes on really easy and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Stays on as long as you need and washes right off.  </li>
            <li>The only thing reason I don&#x27;t give it a 5 star, is because it&#x27;s more of a dark slate color then a rich black.</li>
            <li>Because you add water and can control the amount of eyeliner that goes on the brush and because the brush is a brush and not an awkward stick or greasy pencil, you can create a line that is smooth and aesthetically appealing.</li>
            <li>For the review saying &amp;#34;not dark enough,&amp;#34; it may require more layers to achieve darker, as Clinique is a subtler eyeliner, not stark &amp; dark if that is what you are expecting.</li>
            <li>$15.00 when you buy from Clinique; not sure why so expensive here?&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous product!!  </li>
            <li>This is the best eyeliner because it comes with a soft brush that you wet and you can line your eyes as thin or thick as you want.</li>
            <li>I will literary last for years!</li>
            <li>It does require a dab of water but the trouble is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>So much easier to apply then other eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Not dark enough,  and you do need to do touch-ups.</li>
            <li>The color is more of a dark grey instead of black</li>
            <li>It is not true black, more of a dark gray.</li>

            <li> Have used this product for years and love it! Doesn&#x27;t chip or dry out!</li>
            <li> Loved the eyeliner!! had used it in the past and was not able to get a replacement at Kohl&#x27;s. However, was delighted to find it on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this eyeliner. Hard to use and not visible enough for me.</li>
            <li> Have been using this liner for thirty years.  The only one I use.  Stays put all day without smudges.  A wonderful buy!</li>
            <li> Used to sell cosmetics 25 yrs ago. While I sold for a different company, everyone in our cosmetic dept.  used the Clinique cake liner. I will literary last for years! No worry about bacteria growing here. It stays put all day long.No flaking off or smudging. Easy to use, even for the young beginner. They had discontinued it once but brought it back because of customer demand!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t go on as dark or as easily as I would have liked.  Still a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and so glad Clinique put it back on the market.  So much easier to apply then other eyeliners.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and easy to undo if you don&#x27;t get it right. Use cotton swabs to make corrections.</li>
            <li> Stays on, thank god, finally a liner that stays. The only thing reason I don&#x27;t give it a 5 star, is because it&#x27;s more of a dark slate color then a rich black. I live in Florida and it was 85 yesterday, kind of warm, but still stayed.  Also, I was doing massages at the office  in a warm room and I was sweating, it stayed and I did 40 min of cardio and it stayed.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d found it 40 years ago....but enjoying it now! So easy...lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Goes on easy even on old eyelids.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner - so much easier to use than a pencil and it doesn&#x27;t flake off or smudge.  The color is more of a dark grey instead of black but I still think it looks really nice - just use some black mascara.  I do use a different brush than the one that came with the eyeliner.  This product will last a very long time, so it&#x27;s much more economical than using eyeliner pencils.</li>
            <li> Not dark enough,  and you do need to do touch-ups.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency and ease of application.  It is not true black, more of a dark gray. I would still recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will always buy this product. it also lasts A LONG TIME  Thanks Clinique for making such a great product for my whole life!</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner! I&#x27;ve been looking for this for a couple of years and was ecstatic when I found it. So happy I bought two!</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner!  I have tried many different kinds of liquid liners but nothing works as good as this cake liner.  I&#x27;ve used this brand for years!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cake eyeliner...I hope they don&#x27;t stop selling it.</li>
            <li> Actually I was looking for dark black color but some how I got a pack with a light black.so not fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> So Glad that I am still able to get this product.  I have tried many others, ie....liquid, gel, pencils,&lt;br /&gt;but none of them do the job as well as this one!</li>
            <li> My friend worked Clinique as a makeup artist when we were in college and told me to buy this back then...I used the same one for years as it lasts forever.  Through the years I forgot about it, and recently got sick of having to sharpen my eyeliner...I remembered this and bought it again and LOVE it...goes on really easily and it makes a nice thin line, wears well, very easy to remove at night.  I recommend</li>
            <li> Delivered in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Been looking for this for a while.  Came as promised and easy to make a very fine tip on the brush.  Happy camper.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I was glad I found it.  I like it so much better than the gels.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner and wish that Clinique had not discontinued it.  It&#x27;s so much easier to apply than pencils, gel, etc.  I was happy to see it offered on Amazon.  The only drawback is that the price is a lot more than when Clinique sold it.</li>
            <li> For the review saying &amp;#34;not dark enough,&amp;#34; it may require more layers to achieve darker, as Clinique is a subtler eyeliner, not stark &amp; dark if that is what you are expecting. Hands down, best eyeliner.</li>
            <li> When this product was unavailable at a local store, I turned to Amazon and had it delivered to the house.  I paid less and it was more convenient.  This eyeliner is painted on with a tiny brush mixing water and the liner. It gives me a perfect delicate line that doesn&#x27;t fade all day.  I have found that it is best applied after a layer of  eye shadow is brushed on the eyelid. It is water based and has worked well even when you are wearing contact lenses because it doesn&#x27;t migrate to the eye.  I have never had any allergic reactions to this make up.  Best of all, it lasts very well and is economical to buy in the long run.  Because it is in a flat case with the liner and brush tucked into a drawer that you pull out, you can keep it securely in a purse and find it easily.  The silver finish on the case can be used as a mirror too. For great looks, I highly recommend Clinique Water Resistant Eyeliner</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner!! Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Because you add water and can control the amount of eyeliner that goes on the brush and because the brush is a brush and not an awkward stick or greasy pencil, you can create a line that is smooth and aesthetically appealing.</li>
            <li> Used to use this product in the 90s and then it was discontinued! Was thrilled to find it again.  Its the easiest liner I have ever used.  Stays on as long as you need and washes right off.  Don&#x27;t  discontinue it again Clinique!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner because it comes with a soft brush that you wet and you can line your eyes as thin or thick as you want. It goes on really easy and last a long time.</li>
            <li> $15.00 when you buy from Clinique; not sure why so expensive here?&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous product!!  Easy application, easy removal, just wet the brush and you control how light or heavy, thick or thin your lines are.</li>
            <li> Such a great eyeliner! I&#x27;d been looking for a cake eyeliner for what seems like forever, and this is definitely a worthy replacement. You can increase or decrease the intensity of the color depending on how much water you mix it with, and it stays put ALL day without smudging at all. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, and will literally last for years. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best eyeliner! I&#x27;ve used it for about 9 years now and still love it. It takes the best of liquid and pencil and mixes them into the perfect liner. Once you use this you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted..love it</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner for me because the brush is so thin and gets the liner on without smearing. I used other brands for awhile because Clinique stopped selling it so I&#x27;m so happy to find it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> If you have trouble&lt;br /&gt;controlling liner pens you should try this system.  The brush is very manageable even if your eyesight and/or hand steadiness is imperfect. It does require a dab of water but the trouble is well worth it.  Clinique quality plus ease of use  equals get this product.</li>
