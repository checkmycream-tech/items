            <li>Glad i purchase them</li>
            <li>I started using Sigma brushes after seeing many makeup artists on youtube use them.</li>
            <li>so I wanted something slightly more affordable.</li>
            <li>I love my sigma brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and feel incredible on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I simply love it.</li>
            <li>Everything was packaged great, including a beautiful black organza drawstring bag which had the brushes + a travel-size E35 (MAC</li>
            <li>but so happy i did very strong and soft well but together</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t washed the brushes yet as the instructions mention, but am excited to start using this set soon!</li>

            <li>The brushes are very nice and work amazingly so far.</li>
            <li>I already knew when i ordered these brushes that they were wildly popular and loved by regular people, as well as makeup artists</li>
            <li>was super quick!!</li>
            <li>They shipped quickly and arrived before the estimated date of arrival!</li>
            <li>They seem professional, have nice long handles and are a great price!</li>
            <li>they are super soft and this is a great started kit</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE my new brushes :)</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>These brushes are absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>It feels so good using professional brushes rather than</li>
            <li>those cheap stuff.it is absolutely worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li>I looked most forward to the F60 because I still don&#x27;t have a really good flat foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for decent brushes for ages now on a student&#x27;s budget and was so thrilled to find these.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all incredibly soft and leave an amazing finish.</li>
            <li>I have a few Sigma brushes already and I have loved most of them.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, soft and natural.</li>
            <li>and i received them super quick.</li>
            <li>so I am having to use more than I normally would.</li>
            <li>It is easy to keep clean,and is very durable.</li>
            <li>the contouring blush brush was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>And the different kind of brushes helps me create a variety of looks.</li>
            <li>It kind of smelled strange too.</li>
            <li>The handles are nice and long.</li>
            <li>The F50 has a smell too but not as strong since it is a mix of synthetic and natural.</li>
            <li>Such good quality and so professional.</li>
            <li>This product make make up easy to apply with its soft silky but dense bristles.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying the Eye Beauty Kit very soon!</li>
            <li>the brushes are so soft and makes my make up smooth on my face.</li>
            <li>I actually think the brushes are better than any I have owned before.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I ordered this kit via the actual Sigma site b/c</li>
            <li>only thing to say about this set is the fact that I think this set needs a stippling brush to just top it all</li>
            <li>well love them so much they are worth every dime i spent ....</li>
            <li>Just as good as MAC brushes if not better.</li>
            <li>The large face brush exceeds my expectations in size and</li>
            <li>I had heard so much about the Sigma brushes, and decided that I would try them out and see what all the hype was about.</li>
            <li>They work really well whether yo are contouring, applying foundation, blush, powder, etc.</li>
            <li>I had a 10% off code and essentially got free shipping.</li>
            <li>I really hope this goes away with repeated washings.</li>
            <li>I have had bleeding with some brushes before but not as much as the F30.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend !</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller, who was very helpful.</li>
            <li>They even arrived days before they were supposed to much to my delight.</li>
            <li>I always deep clean my new brushes and that is exactly what I did.</li>
            <li>The F70 concealer brush is a really nice small size for certain areas where I have acne scars.</li>
            <li>know i finally have them and it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to finally have some high-quality makeup applicators!  </li>
            <li>Not only do they look super high quality, they feel like it too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice brush set and spent a deal of time researching the different brands.</li>
            <li>The ones that come in this Face Kit are probably the ones I use most because they are essential to my daily makeup routine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I washed all these brushes using L&#x27;oreal Kids shampoo (got the extra conditioning shampoo) and let them dry upside down and in order to prevent fraying, I left their brush guard on (the brushes all had plastic guards on them which were perfect for preventing fraying).    </li>
            <li>Again, I really hope this does go away because it really is soft.</li>
            <li>They are definitely quality products, the brissels are soft and apply the product consistently and very well.</li>
            <li>and they still look new.</li>
            <li>The brushes are clearly marked for their respective uses and they arrived right no time, i truly recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li>I (and my countless sorority sisters) would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>(SO amazingly soft!)</li>
            <li>The same with F30 the large powder brush</li>
            <li>so I decided that I needed to complete my set with the face kit.</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace some old MAC brushes, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the steep prices.</li>
            <li>It seems that it is the natural fiber brushes that have this problem with the smell.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend these brushes to anyone who is starting with their makeup collection.</li>
            <li>Finally when I got using them, all I can say is these are some AMAZINGLY HIGH quality brushes.</li>
            <li>Another important note is that the powder brush also bled black dye during deep washes.</li>
            <li>The duo fiber, powder brush and free blending brush keep shedding since I bought them, but only a few hairs at a time.</li>
            <li>These look like high quality brushes compared to other high rate brands.</li>
            <li>I had Bare Minerals brushes before, and I always had to pick hairs off my face after putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li>These brushes feel so incredibly soft, and their quality is equal to that of M.A.C.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with the few MAC brushes I have but they are quite expensive</li>
            <li>I placed my order earlier this week and was surprised to see my package in the mail 3 days later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in a sorority and am around makeup lovers every day, most of my friends spend outrageous amounts on MAC brushes but when they find out how little I spent on my brushes and how great they are, they become converts.</li>

            <li> These look like high quality brushes compared to other high rate brands.</li>
            <li> I had Bare Minerals brushes before, and I always had to pick hairs off my face after putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> These brushes feel so incredibly soft, and their quality is equal to that of M.A.C.  </li>
            <li> I was happy with the few MAC brushes I have but they are quite expensive</li>
            <li> I placed my order earlier this week and was surprised to see my package in the mail 3 days later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a sorority and am around makeup lovers every day, most of my friends spend outrageous amounts on MAC brushes but when they find out how little I spent on my brushes and how great they are, they become converts.</li>
            <li> Absolutely MAC-quality, if not better and a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I wash mine everyday and they still act brand new .</li>
            <li> She informed me that although that the powder brush is indeed made of natural hair, they do dye them a uniform black color.</li>
            <li> i have been wanting these brushes for a long time</li>
            <li> Other brushes that I bought earlier by the long drop.</li>
            <li> Then a few days later (3 at max)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these for a few days</li>
            <li> I was very anxious to receive these brushes because I haven&#x27;t bought brushes in such a long time.</li>
            <li> I was blown away by the quality, they are heavy duty and have long durable handles.</li>
            <li> I was confused because I thought it was made of natural black hair and only used translucent powder with this brush, which did not explain where the black run off was coming from.</li>
            <li> I was in need of new brushes but didn&#x27;t want to buy crappy ones because they always fall apart and leave bristles behind</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I spent money on my previous brushes.</li>
            <li> but now that I have two, I can use one for stippling liquid or cream foundation and the other for applying blush or bronzer!</li>
            <li> The brush set arrived in a neat little organza bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a few months and they wash up well.</li>
            <li> I can not stand it when brushes are stiff, and hurt to use.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because it seems like the foundation brush sucks up a lot of the product</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with Sigma.</li>
            <li> Ill always buy sigma brushes</li>
            <li> I purchased their \\&quot;eyes kit\\&quot; and am obsessed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had heard so much about the Sigma brushes, and decided that I would try them out and see what all the hype was about. I was extremely pleased when they arrived, (They got here in 4 days... Which was very nice!). They are the softest brushes I have ever used for once. I can not stand it when brushes are stiff, and hurt to use. They work really well whether yo are contouring, applying foundation, blush, powder, etc. They are also very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend these brushes. I plan on buying the Eye Beauty Kit very soon!</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks ago i bought sigma beauty face kit and i absolutely love it. the brushes are so soft and makes my make up smooth on my face.It feels so good using professional brushes rather than those cheap stuff.it is absolutely worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li> I purchased their \\&quot;eyes kit\\&quot; and am obsessed! The brushes are great quality so I decided that I needed to complete my set with the face kit. Awesome products and great value. I&#x27;m in a sorority and am around makeup lovers every day, most of my friends spend outrageous amounts on MAC brushes but when they find out how little I spent on my brushes and how great they are, they become converts. I (and my countless sorority sisters) would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice brush set and spent a deal of time researching the different brands. Sigma is always well reviewed so I gave them a try.  The brushes are very nice and work amazingly so far. I&#x27;m looking forward to adding to my collection!</li>
            <li> I placed my order earlier this week and was surprised to see my package in the mail 3 days later. The brush set arrived in a neat little organza bag. The large face brush exceeds my expectations in size and the contouring blush brush was exactly what I was looking for! I haven&#x27;t washed the brushes yet as the instructions mention, but am excited to start using this set soon! They seem professional, have nice long handles and are a great price! I would recommend this set to anyone looking for a set of face brushes!</li>
            <li> Great makeup brushes! I was looking to replace some old MAC brushes, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the steep prices. This set was a perfect compromise! I actually think the brushes are better than any I have owned before. I even went back and bought the travel size set!</li>
            <li> Brushes of excellent quality for a makeup. Enjoy. I really enjoyed. Other brushes that I bought earlier by the long drop.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I ordered this kit via the actual Sigma site b/c I had a 10% off code and essentially got free shipping. Then a few days later (3 at max) I got my kit. Everything was packaged great, including a beautiful black organza drawstring bag which had the brushes + a travel-size E35 (MAC #217) brush.     I always deep clean my new brushes and that is exactly what I did. I washed all these brushes using L&#x27;oreal Kids shampoo (got the extra conditioning shampoo) and let them dry upside down and in order to prevent fraying, I left their brush guard on (the brushes all had plastic guards on them which were perfect for preventing fraying).    Finally when I got using them, all I can say is these are some AMAZINGLY HIGH quality brushes. Absolutely MAC-quality, if not better and a fraction of the price. Totally recommended.</li>
            <li> Your products are amazing! i have been wanting these brushes for a long time know i finally have them and it was worth the wait! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend after she seen many makeup reviews recomending it. She loved the product. All five brush are made with quality and in an affordable price.</li>
            <li> the best brushes in the world of womens and it made of good materials and stay for years i yhink</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes and am so glad that I bought them. They&#x27;re all incredibly soft and leave an amazing finish. I&#x27;d definately recomend these brushes, I haven&#x27;t used anyones like them before.</li>
            <li> I was very anxious to receive these brushes because I haven&#x27;t bought brushes in such a long time. I have a few Sigma brushes already and I have loved most of them. I looked most forward to the F60 because I still don&#x27;t have a really good flat foundation brush. I think this brush is the perfect density and size for applying liquid foundations. I already have a Mac 187 which is similar to the duo fibre F50 but now that I have two, I can use one for stippling liquid or cream foundation and the other for applying blush or bronzer! It seems that the F40, the contour one has a really overwhelming stench. I really hope this goes away with repeated washings. The same with F30 the large powder brush but that one bled a darkish black/gray/blue color. I have had bleeding with some brushes before but not as much as the F30. Again, I really hope this does go away because it really is soft. It seems that it is the natural fiber brushes that have this problem with the smell. The F50 has a smell too but not as strong since it is a mix of synthetic and natural. The F70 concealer brush is a really nice small size for certain areas where I have acne scars. I took off one star because of the smell of F40 and F30 and the bleeding of F30. Overall I like this set.</li>
            <li> These brushes are better than my Bobbi Brown ones. The brushes do not shed at all. I wash mine everyday and they still act brand new . I highly recommend !</li>
            <li> these brushes are beautiful  i bought them as a gift and they are perfect.  they are super soft and this is a great started kit</li>
            <li> I already knew when i ordered these brushes that they were wildly popular and loved by regular people, as well as makeup artists but i wanted to try them out for myself. They are definitely quality products, the brissels are soft and apply the product consistently and very well. The brushes are clearly marked for their respective uses and they arrived right no time, i truly recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li> I will never regret buying these brushes. I had Bare Minerals brushes before, and I always had to pick hairs off my face after putting on my makeup. Now, no mess, just perfect. And the different kind of brushes helps me create a variety of looks. Oh, and I shopped around--they are the best priced brushes I could find as well. This is a value purchase, all the way.</li>
            <li> These Sigma eyeshadow brushes were great ....I work for a well known cosmetic line ,and i must say these brushes compare well love them so much they are worth every dime i spent ....Glad i purchase them was alittle nervous about purchase but so happy i did very strong and soft well but together can,t express enough.</li>
            <li> I started using Sigma brushes after seeing many makeup artists on youtube use them. I looked up online on how they compare to MAC and people said they were very similar. I was happy with the few MAC brushes I have but they are quite expensive so I wanted something slightly more affordable. The Sigma brushes are holding up great so far, I wash them once a week and they still look new. The ones that come in this Face Kit are probably the ones I use most because they are essential to my daily makeup routine. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go back to another brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had theses brushes over a year now and thought the shedding would stop. The duo fiber, powder brush and free blending brush keep shedding since I bought them, but only a few hairs at a time. The angled, foundation and concealer brushes are the only ones that have no problems. Another important note is that the powder brush also bled black dye during deep washes. It kind of smelled strange too. I was confused because I thought it was made of natural black hair and only used translucent powder with this brush, which did not explain where the black run off was coming from. I contacted the seller, who was very helpful. She informed me that although that the powder brush is indeed made of natural hair, they do dye them a uniform black color.</li>
            <li> After reading MANY great reviews about these brushes, I ordered my own set &amp; these are by far the best quality brushes I have ever used! The quality is amazing!! I would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone looking for make up brushes. I am very pleased with the product &amp; the shipping was super quick!!</li>
            <li> I received this order fast and it was packaged nicely with desciptions of each brush and what they work best for applying (foundation, powder, blush, etc.) I was in need of new brushes but didn&#x27;t want to buy crappy ones because they always fall apart and leave bristles behind but I also didn&#x27;t want to go to Sephora and pay $30+ for each brush so this Sigma set was somewhere in the middle. I was blown away by the quality, they are heavy duty and have long durable handles. The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because it seems like the foundation brush sucks up a lot of the product so I am having to use more than I normally would. I&#x27;ve only had these for a few days but I am more than happy with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely fantastic. Not only do they look super high quality, they feel like it too! (SO amazingly soft!) I had been looking for decent brushes for ages now on a student&#x27;s budget and was so thrilled to find these. It was a makeup artist at Sephora that actually recommended these and then when I saw all the great reviews online, I ordered them. They even arrived days before they were supposed to much to my delight.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, soft and natural. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These brushes feel so incredibly soft, and their quality is equal to that of M.A.C.  I&#x27;m so excited to finally have some high-quality makeup applicators!  They shipped quickly and arrived before the estimated date of arrival!</li>
            <li> I love this product! This kit is perfect ,exactly what I needed for my makeup routine. I don&#x27;t know why I spent money on my previous brushes.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with Sigma. These brushes are awesome. I love my sigma brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy these brushes always.</li>
            <li> these brushes are great.  the foundation brush and powder brush work great and they make your foundation look flawless!  great price for the quality and i received them super quick.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and feel incredible on my skin. They provide even coverage of my beauty product. I will never use another brand. These look like high quality brushes compared to other high rate brands. For five brushes these are priced inexpensive. I would really recommend these brushes to anyone who is starting with their makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes for a great price. After reading such great reviews i decided to by these, and they&#x27;re awesome. Exceeded my expectations and i won&#x27;t ever by a different brand. Such good quality and so professional. LOVE LOVE my new brushes :)</li>
            <li> It is made of great quality and have not had it shed yet. Used daily and I simply love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes I got them as a gift for my best friend who is a make up artist, she absolutely fell in love. Great quality, size , and brushes are well labeled to know what each brush does. Just as good as MAC brushes if not better.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! The foundation brush is awesome! and my makeup looks flawless.&lt;br /&gt;My only thing to say about this set is the fact that I think this set needs a stippling brush to just top it all off!&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This product make make up easy to apply with its soft silky but dense bristles. It is easy to keep clean,and is very durable. Ill always buy sigma brushes</li>
            <li> The quality is really great for the price. I&#x27;ve had these for a few months and they wash up well. The handles are nice and long. Glad I tried these!</li>
