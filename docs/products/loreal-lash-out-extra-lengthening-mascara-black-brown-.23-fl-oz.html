            <li>This brush seems to hug each lash and take the mascara all the way from the bottom lash to the tip top of the lashes.</li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE mascara and my store stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply, no lumps or clumps and washes off very easily.</li>
            <li>I know this product has been continued, but I have been able to get it before from other places and it has been great!  </li>
            <li>Easy to take off.</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump and is easy to wash off with soap and water.</li>

            <li>Would strongly suggest it for volume and length extension!mi don&#x27;t know why Loreal discontued it?</li>
            <li>&amp; I am a makeup \\&quot;junky\\&quot;), the best mascaras that I have used &amp; always stick to or go back to are: Loreal Lash Out Mascara (regular original formula), CoverGirl Remarkable Washable Waterproof Mascara, and Avon Mark Scanda-Lash Mascara (all of which I always purchase in Black/Brown).  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly without clumping.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clean &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t clump for me, keeps them separated, and nice and long, and most importantly, doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this at all.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why such a good product has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>They did ship it quickly though.</li>
            <li>The mascara goes on smoothly and without clumping until it collects on the brush too much after using for a while.</li>
            <li>I found this product nearly 30 years ago and still love it.  </li>
            <li>So far after trying many I have found nothing that works, this item included.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to warn others that if may not be as fresh as you&#x27;re expecting.</li>
            <li>Has the right size brush to satisfy me plus make my lashes even longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the mascara is applied, it doesn&#x27;t dry immediately, so I&#x27;m able to brush my lashes so that they look more natural.</li>
            <li>Funny how no one asks me what mascara I use, which is this one and the Max Factor 2000</li>
            <li>And sure enough, there it was.</li>
            <li>The only mascara which is okay with my contacts as it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li>My mother buys this all the time, I&#x27;ve used it a few times, It&#x27;s really good mascara.</li>
            <li>love how it lengthens my already long lashes.</li>
            <li>So while it was unopened, it was old and not too fresh.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are light and short - until I use this mascara...</li>
            <li>I also really really like the brush to this one.  </li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers here,  I was overjoyed to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Lengthens better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The mascara goes on smoothly, no clumps, and is incredible at giving long, natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>Also able to get a brown/black instead of just black.</li>
            <li>I have used this mascara since I was in high school, and with all of the other lengthening mascaras that have come out in the last 15 years, Lash Out is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for over 20 years because it doesn&#x27;t clump, it lengthens and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>First I ordered two and only got one mascara.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why these have been removed from shelves in stores, but this has always been my favorite mascara...</li>
            <li>I like this mascara, light application but long lasting and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>The only positive remark I can make Is the product was on time.</li>
            <li>I love that I can at least find this mascara online, since it is not longer for sale in the stores</li>
            <li>packages were faded and looked old.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear that while this is a discontinued product, what this seller has was old to begin with.  </li>
            <li>Especially if you have very wimpy lashes&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>what I ordered)  and the mascara is old.</li>
            <li>I apply it 2 to 3 times because I love how thick it makes my lashes too.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This mascara is the only one I&#x27;m not allergic to as well as the only one that doesn&#x27;t come rub off/run off onto your face all day long!</li>
            <li> One of the packages was stapled togther and one sealed when I opened it had a long hair on the brush.  </li>
            <li> I guess I should have expected that or read reviews prior to purchasing.  </li>
            <li> If you want long lashes then this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using it for a long time and she likes it.</li>
            <li> It then goes on much easier and not so thickly that it clumps - and extends the life of the mascara for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although probably not recommended, I wash the brush off with soap and water periodically (since mine is not waterproof) and replace it dry.</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes, partly due to an eye medication, and partly due to the way I care for my eyelashes (which I&#x27;ve been wanting to write an e-book</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is a pity is getting harder and harder to get it.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is when things become hard to find sellers really elevate the prices, sad for us consumers.</li>
            <li> even tried the other mascaras in the L&#x27;Oreal line to no avail.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and purchased this mascara.  </li>
            <li> The other options they sell do not work as a replacement.</li>
            <li> I tried other products</li>
            <li> I work in extreme heat and misters and this mascara has never given me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Too drippy and too black</li>
            <li> I tried more expensive mascaras that may come close but are way too expensive to continue purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Black is too harsh on me.</li>
            <li> Second - I feel like this was a very old product - the mascara was very thick, the wand was slightly bent - not impressed</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with other L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> lashes never feel dried out.</li>
            <li> This time, the packaging was yellowed and the product is dried out.  </li>
            <li> I have long thin lashes.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure they still manufacture it or I am just buying leftovers...</li>
            <li> Not sure what else to say, It hasn&#x27;t arrived in the mail yet so when it does if there&#x27;s any problems I&#x27;ll mention them.</li>
            <li> The product is dried out and not good quality.  </li>
            <li> it is soooo hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is a tough item to find and it is disappointing to find it and pay a high price for poor quality.</li>
            <li> Used to be a thin brush.</li>
            <li> Was too fat for my thin eye lashes.</li>
            <li> but I was not happy.</li>
            <li> I am unable to find this product in any of the stores in Houston, TX.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone asks if I have on fake lashes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so difficult to fins in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Not what I expected. They discontinued this brand in the store. Used to be a thin brush. Was too fat for my thin eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I am unable to find this product in any of the stores in Houston, TX.  I have used this mascara prioduct for several years and find it to be the best.  I do wish Loreal still continued to sell it.  Thank goodness I found it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> This mascara is the only one I&#x27;m not allergic to as well as the only one that doesn&#x27;t come rub off/run off onto your face all day long! Great stuff  - just don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;ll buy it once I&#x27;ve ordered ALL of it from Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Too drippy and too black</li>
            <li> First I ordered two and only got one mascara.  Second - I feel like this was a very old product - the mascara was very thick, the wand was slightly bent - not impressed</li>
            <li> I love that I can at least find this mascara online, since it is not longer for sale in the stores</li>
            <li> One of the packages was stapled togther and one sealed when I opened it had a long hair on the brush.  For this reason I give it a 2 star.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for many, many years and love it. It has become very difficult to locate at the stores. But I am still able to purchase through Amazon. I am so pleased. Has the right size brush to satisfy me plus make my lashes even longer. I constantly have comments. Also able to get a brown/black instead of just black. Black is too harsh on me.</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on smoothly and without clumping until it collects on the brush too much after using for a while. Although probably not recommended, I wash the brush off with soap and water periodically (since mine is not waterproof) and replace it dry. It then goes on much easier and not so thickly that it clumps - and extends the life of the mascara for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the mascara is applied, it doesn&#x27;t dry immediately, so I&#x27;m able to brush my lashes so that they look more natural. I like the texture of it and haven&#x27;t found any that I like better.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best mascara on the market. It is a pity is getting harder and harder to get it. I am not sure they still manufacture it or I am just buying leftovers...</li>
            <li> My mother buys this all the time, I&#x27;ve used it a few times, It&#x27;s really good mascara. Not sure what else to say, It hasn&#x27;t arrived in the mail yet so when it does if there&#x27;s any problems I&#x27;ll mention them.</li>
            <li> I am going to try and find more of these since i have been searching in vain for a mascara that comes close to this one! The brush is perfect for grabbing every lash, there is no smudging or clumping and it washes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;I even tried the other mascaras in the L&#x27;Oreal line to no avail. I tried more expensive mascaras that may come close but are way too expensive to continue purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;Please, L&#x27;Oreal, bring back this mascara!</li>
            <li> I found this product nearly 30 years ago and still love it.  The only draw back is when things become hard to find sellers really elevate the prices, sad for us consumers.</li>
            <li> This is my face OTC mascara, but must be discontinued. Can only occasionally find it on amazon.  Would strongly suggest it for volume and length extension!mi don&#x27;t know why Loreal discontued it?</li>
            <li> The product is dried out and not good quality.  packages were faded and looked old.  Not impressed.  This is a tough item to find and it is disappointing to find it and pay a high price for poor quality.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for about 19 years. It is my &amp;#34;Go To&amp;#34; Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how it lengthens my already long lashes. I apply it 2 to 3 times because I love how thick it makes my lashes too.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone asks if I have on fake lashes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes never feel dried out. There&#x27;s no spider eyes. No clumping or balling and it never leaves flakes under my eyes. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this and pray they don&#x27;t stop making it until after I&#x27;m gone!!</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, looks great, doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, light application but long lasting and doesn&#x27;t clump. Too bad it&#x27;s a discontinued Lóreal product</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara since I was in high school, and with all of the other lengthening mascaras that have come out in the last 15 years, Lash Out is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mascara that lengthens my lashes. So far after trying many I have found nothing that works, this item included. It works the same as my go to Maybeline. Nothing special about this at all.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara it is awesome it never clumbs</li>
            <li> It appears Loreal doesn&#x27;t make this product anymore.  So while it was unopened, it was old and not too fresh.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara ever!  Don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so difficult to fins in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many others and none compare.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara of all time.  Used it since the 80s. Still love it. I bought a couple of these yo stock up.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless mascaras. I often try the latest and greatest simply because this mascara is not carried at the store I happen to be in. I always go back to this one in brown/black. It is the most natural looking and best lengthening mascara I have ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t clump and I can even get the lower lashes with the tip. I hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> Not sure why these have been removed from shelves in stores, but this has always been my favorite mascara...for many, many years.  Glad I could find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and purchased this mascara.  It&#x27;s really a great Mascara, better than Maybelline.  I will purchase this again.  The mascara goes on smoothly, no clumps, and is incredible at giving long, natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I know this product has been continued, but I have been able to get it before from other places and it has been great!  This time, the packaging was yellowed and the product is dried out.  It&#x27;s clear that while this is a discontinued product, what this seller has was old to begin with.  They did ship it quickly though.</li>
            <li> Goes on clean &amp; smooth. Easy to take off.</li>
            <li> I have used many, many kinds of mascara, both drug store brands as well as department store brands.  Of ALL of the mascaras that I have tried in my life, (which is about 20 years now, &amp; I am a makeup \\&quot;junky\\&quot;), the best mascaras that I have used &amp; always stick to or go back to are: Loreal Lash Out Mascara (regular original formula), CoverGirl Remarkable Washable Waterproof Mascara, and Avon Mark Scanda-Lash Mascara (all of which I always purchase in Black/Brown).  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers here,  I was overjoyed to find this on Amazon.  I have never found mascara that lengthens and separates like this one.  My sister told me about it years ago and she and I were both so upset when it was discontinued.  I bought five of these immediately when I found them here.  I was going to send her two.  I have only opened one so far but found it is a bit old and dried out.  I guess I should have expected that or read reviews prior to purchasing.  I will still keep them all because even in this state this mascara is better than any others I have tried.  Just wanted to warn others that if may not be as fresh as you&#x27;re expecting.</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes, partly due to an eye medication, and partly due to the way I care for my eyelashes (which I&#x27;ve been wanting to write an e-book about).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I get compliments alot - \\&quot;..are your eyelashes real?\\&quot; is what someone asked me last night. Yes, they are. Funny how no one asks me what mascara I use, which is this one and the Max Factor 2000 Calorie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t clump for me, keeps them separated, and nice and long, and most importantly, doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years.  People comment on my lashes and ask me what I use. The brush curls my lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on smooth. Hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> This is a really Great product.  Especially if you have very wimpy lashes&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it&#x27;s been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;Meets all my needs and expectations.</li>
            <li> I was quite upset to find that it&#x27;s been discontinued as it&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  And I loved that it came in color black/brown and not just black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t clump and curls my lashes with having to use a curler.  I can&#x27;t understand why such a good product has been discontinued.  Anyway...I was happy to have found it on Amazon and hope that I can purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I was so sad when L&#x27;Oreal discontinued this product.  It has left me with no replacement. The other options they sell do not work as a replacement. I wish they would bring it back, 115.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for more than 20 years and now I can&#x27;t find it in any stores. I was very relieved to find it on Amazon and for a great price. It is one of the few mascaras that really works to lengthen your lashes, rather than to just thicken them. If you want long lashes then this is the way to go. I also have a sensitivity to many mascaras and I am not bothered by this one at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 10 years.  Goes on smoothly without clumping.  Lengthens better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  I get compliments on a regular basis on how it makes my eyelashes stand out.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough!</li>
            <li> The only positive remark I can make Is the product was on time. However, it was the WRONG color(not what I ordered)  and the mascara is old. I will not order from this supplier again.Purchased from edrugstore.</li>
            <li> I have used Lash Out by L&#x27;oreal for more years than I can remember, but it has been discontinued. I searched online and found some here on Amazon and bought 6. My eyelashes are light and short - until I use this mascara... but when the ones I bought are gone, that&#x27;s all there is. I emailed L&#x27;Oreal expressing my dismay, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe they discontinued this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Glad I found it here .... I stocked up :)</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara and it is soooo hard to find. I found it here!! Thank you for saving me from shopping in stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many, many years. All of a sudden, I cannot find it in any stores. I tried other products but I was not happy. Then I thought why not look on Amazon. And sure enough, there it was. I bought two. I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product and you can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. It doesn&#x27;t clump and is easy to wash off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with other L&#x27;Oreal products. I do not know what is wrong with that but that is not comparable to what I got before from the same brand but in store.</li>
            <li> I could not find this in the local stores. Very glad to have found it. The only mascara which is okay with my contacts as it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t find it at any of the local stores so I order it here for her on Amazon. She&#x27;s been using it for a long time and she likes it. I believe it&#x27;s a discontinued product now though.</li>
            <li> I work in extreme heat and misters and this mascara has never given me raccoon eyes. It never smears or smudges in rain too. Combine it with L&#x27;Oreal lash serum booster before bed and you&#x27;ll have amazing lashes! I&#x27;ve used it for over 20 years because it doesn&#x27;t clump, it lengthens and is very natural looking. Removing it is easy with Mary Kay face cream cleanser. So many women love this mascara and wonder why it was discontinued!</li>
            <li> Great mascara, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> love this mascara, glad i found it here. I hate that they don&#x27;t sell it in stores anymore. gives great length and definittion</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and this product works great!  I also really really like the brush to this one.  I have not found another brush like this one. I have long thin lashes.  This brush seems to hug each lash and take the mascara all the way from the bottom lash to the tip top of the lashes.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE mascara and my store stopped carrying it. So thankful for online! No problems with purchase and will shop again.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply, no lumps or clumps and washes off very easily. No problem to remove, definatley a keeper.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t flake off or smear when I rub my eyes, yet washes off in the shower.</li>
