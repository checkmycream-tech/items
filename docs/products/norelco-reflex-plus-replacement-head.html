            <li>Great business experience.</li>
            <li>Good price, good quality.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be a good solution</li>
            <li>After searching to find the right model replacement heads, I searched for the best price, under $20 ppd.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to have a replacement part in this throw away world.</li>
            <li>Just as described, fits my husband&#x27;s older razor perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to change, good price, and are functioning well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it came very quickly and was sp easy to put on, took seconds, works great.</li>
            <li>better than buying a new shaver.hubby happy!!</li>
            <li>I did not feel that this razor blade had the great quality that I have experienced in other Philips razor products</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain about this product, since it does exactly what it is supposed to do:  provide a good shave and extend the life of the razor.  </li>
            <li>What a great shave with new blades.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>Works as good as new.</li>
            <li>My shaver works fine, but the blades were worn out.  </li>
            <li>IT WORKS JUST FINE.</li>
            <li>and the blades didn&#x27;t fit my razor.  </li>
            <li>Once it was &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34; it gave a clean shave with or without face preparation.</li>
            <li>the way, I did this one too when you asked the first time!</li>
            <li>My shaver is running like new again, and my face is as clean as can be.</li>

            <li>I did check out new shavers but wasn&#x27;t ready to fork out $100+ for the same features I have with the one I have.</li>
            <li>WHY BUY ANOTHER COMPLETE SHAVER</li>
            <li>we tend to forget about our electric razors, because they are so trouble free and dependable,but the rotating blades get dull and it is cheaper to get replacement heads than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>I am a bit perturbed to pay so much for three little wheels.  </li>

            <li> Be careful , Norelco makes number of different&lt;br /&gt;shavers and seems like each one requires a different kit...</li>
            <li> No way I&#x27;m gonna use razors that are not new.</li>
            <li> The blades I selected did not fit properly to my razor, and returns are NOT accept.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> Purchased the incorrect replacement head  it was not worth the expense of returning</li>
            <li> I suspect that my irritation will be short lived, since these expensive little doohickies need be replaced only once per year.</li>
            <li> My razor had started performing poorly, leaving hairs uncut and pulling on the hairs as it cut them.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pictures and description were inadaquate.  I had to open the package to actually see what was inside and the blades didn&#x27;t fit my razor.  Since the package was opened and the product was &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; it was not accepted for return.</li>
            <li> I found this product online only, because of the shaver&#x27;s age. My shaver works fine, but the blades were worn out.  After searching to find the right model replacement heads, I searched for the best price, under $20 ppd.  My shaver is running like new again, and my face is as clean as can be. I did check out new shavers but wasn&#x27;t ready to fork out $100+ for the same features I have with the one I have.</li>
            <li> Just as described, fits my husband&#x27;s older razor perfectly.  It is nice to have a replacement part in this throw away world.</li>
            <li> Works great with my shaver.  Good price, good quality.  Delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.  Be careful , Norelco makes number of different&lt;br /&gt;shavers and seems like each one requires a different kit...</li>

            <li> Best cost around on Norelco shaver replacments.</li>
            <li> Purchased the incorrect replacement head  it was not worth the expense of returning so I&#x27;ll keep it until I can find a razor it fits.</li>
            <li> Order was received promptly and just what I needed.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The blades I selected did not fit properly to my razor, and returns are NOT accept. A warning to all potential purchasers.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS JUST FINE. NO PROBLEM AT ALL. IF THIS SHAVER HOLDS UP, I&#x27;LL GET ANOTHER ONE. WHY BUY ANOTHER COMPLETE SHAVER IF IT ONLY NEEDS A REPLACEMENT HEAD ?</li>
            <li> it came very quickly and was sp easy to put on, took seconds, works great. better than buying a new shaver.hubby happy!!</li>
            <li> I Recieved a open package, with razor heads plastic open. No way I&#x27;m gonna use razors that are not new.</li>
            <li> Not much to say. I bought this as a replacement. Once it was &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34; it gave a clean shave with or without face preparation. Easy to install. It came within the allowed time. Recommended by me.</li>
            <li> we tend to forget about our electric razors, because they are so trouble free and dependable,but the rotating blades get dull and it is cheaper to get replacement heads than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> What a great shave with new blades. You will be happy that you did.  Change every 5 - 8 months for the best shave.</li>

            <li> Easy to change, good price, and are functioning well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this to my son and son-inlaw who are looking for the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I did this one too when you asked the first time!</li>
            <li> Usable shaver. Great and close cut. No damage skin.</li>
            <li> Everything I could want and expect from a replacement blade. I would definitely buy again. Works as good as new.</li>
            <li> Amazing to go from a dull electric razor to fresh and sharp, easyto install and to clean well worth the money. I&#x27;m saving lots of money on shaving soap and razor bades, not to mention saving water.</li>
            <li> Received on scheduled date and product was as stated. Great business experience. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I did not feel that this razor blade had the great quality that I have experienced in other Philips razor products</li>
