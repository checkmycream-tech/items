            <li>This stuff works fast and awesome</li>
            <li>It is healing it quite nicely.</li>
            <li>takes awhile to work but one of best i think!&lt;br /&gt;Always fast shipping...</li>
            <li>The price is attractive and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The price is attractive and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Ok this is an amazing product - but it takes time to work.</li>
            <li>I tried many products and by far this is the BEST.  </li>
            <li>very* important that you apply it correctly, though.</li>
            <li>a very important note</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, nonsmelling and effective.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, nonsmelling and effective.</li>
            <li>but it makes it look alittle better but did not get rid of the fungus!&lt;br</li>
            <li>You may avoid a trip to the dermatologist/doctor who would cost much more.  </li>
            <li>Remember to call you doctor at some point in this ... might need more than over the counter assistance.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The idea is to get the stuff INSIDE the nail, not on top of it.</li>
            <li>Use it every day until there&#x27;s no sign of any more fungus.  </li>
            <li>I have used it before and love it</li>
            <li>OK this stuff works.</li>
            <li>I am going to try one more product and then go to the podiatrist to try laser.</li>
            <li>(By the way, I did not have any pedicures during my time of agony keeping customers safe.)  </li>
            <li>I love this product my friends had introduced me to it do to my nail fungus.</li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;ve never used the product before.</li>
            <li>I promise it will work. :)</li>
            <li>no results better off using vapor rub thats working better than this stuff</li>
            <li>Though you have to purchase more than one bottle.</li>
            <li>The seller wrote to me, simly told me to use it, they acknowledged that the bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed but insisted it safe to use.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s an RN, so he&#x27;s pleased</li>
            <li>, we are pleased.</li>
            <li>This was just okay ..</li>
            <li>Should know for sure in 3-4 months if it clears up the fungus.</li>
            <li>Mostly alcohol and water....</li>
            <li>&amp; I can make sure the problem is under control.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay value to get started treating nail fungus.</li>
            <li>The ZetaClear that I had bought before seemed to work better, but I believe NOTHING will be the cure (as many others have already said).</li>
            <li>The nails get better and you feel better too.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products with no results.</li>
            <li>but it surely does.</li>
            <li>Great product and it really works.  </li>
            <li>Cure my foot like magic.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Do it after your feet are washed and clean!</li>
            <li>best money spent</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>SO EASY</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Strong stuff.</li>
            <li>and I am happy to say that my toenails have cleared and the fungus is barely noticeable, now I can wear sandals and not feel like people are looking at my toes</li>
            <li>fine by me, it needed to be gone.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working fine.  </li>
            <li>Next to 100% pure tea tree the stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>and I have seen HUGE progress.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>and I also was happy to receive it shortly after I placed my order.</li>
            <li>He is fungus free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m free of fungus</li>
            <li>I got this from a Nail Salon initially, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>will defintly order more but just rember it take about 6 moths for it to heal and grow on new healthy nail.</li>
            <li>I originally got this product from a nail salon and haven&#x27;t found it until now.</li>
            <li>Order this RIGHT Now!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be wise to use a knife blade to cut back on the damaged nail as well.</li>
            <li>Fighting it is a full time job.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it was liquid and not a messy ointment or cream.</li>
            <li>For the last 2 weeks I have been using no miss after soaking my feet in pedifix tea tree soaking crystals foot bath, and my toe nail is already looking better. :)</li>
            <li>If you are diligent and put two drops on the effected area twice a day, you will see tremendous results.  </li>
            <li>Bottle seemed to go quickly though....</li>
            <li>Consistent use yields very good results and brings the nail back to normal color and growth, along with killing the fungus.</li>
            <li>less is more, 1 drop is more than sufficient!</li>
            <li>You just need to be consistent!</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>For the price, I figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>For the price its worth to try it.</li>
            <li>She seen her new clean toe nail growing out within 2 months!</li>
            <li>You see results right away .</li>
            <li>I put it right where the skin meets my toenail and sometimes in between toes.</li>
            <li>Love the application but not sure how effective it is.</li>
            <li>I still need to use it to completely allow the nails to grow out healthy, but I&#x27;m glad I bought several bottles.</li>
            <li>Its also important that you treat  under the nail as well as at the cuticle area ( new growth).</li>
            <li>Fungus lives in warm moist places so toenail must be dry.</li>
            <li>but my nail has completely thinned out and is looking healthier and more normal!</li>
            <li>But the new growth appears to be coming in healthy and I will try going natural if I can stand it!  </li>
            <li>Fungal nails take a while to resolve, and there is more to the process than just this with changing socks and shoes and such.</li>
            <li>Takes time and consistent care to resolve.</li>
            <li>So working pretty well.</li>
            <li>Toe nail started getting better but didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Be aware that if you have an athlete&#x27;s foot style fungus that is on the nail, but didn&#x27;t originate there-</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is better than what my nail tech is charging for the same product.</li>
            <li>Its an okay product/good starting point.</li>
            <li>This product worked within the first week.  </li>
            <li>If theres any pockets under the nail, it will only hold more moisture , which contributes to the problem.</li>
            <li>I recommend also taking a hair dryer to it first to remove all the moisture before you treat it.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as recommended and began to see the results after the first bottle.  </li>
            <li>I was told that I needed to be consistent</li>
            <li>I tried this product for several months I think I gave it more than a chance to prove itself.</li>
            <li>but I still have him use this on a daily basis to keep his feet healthy.</li>
            <li>He tried so many different types of medicine for his feet</li>
            <li>I got my first bottle of this at a nail salon thinking that it would not help foot fungus</li>
            <li>Hubby loves it -- saw results after the first 2 uses.</li>
            <li>My fungus-infected nail is more than half grown out with clean nail after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li>I used as directed, and it made my big toes nice and clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the fungus for a few years and it amazes me that I&#x27;ve been able to cure it for such a cheap cost!!</li>
            <li>SO happy to find it on Amazon...used it a few times &amp; the tiny bit of fungus disappeared.</li>
            <li>it was a huge set back.  </li>
            <li>Give this product a try, as it&#x27;s very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works fast.  </li>
            <li>was hopeful to have found a reasonable priced solution but will have to go to podiatrist</li>
            <li>I was so much encouraged by the 1st review that I shipped this item by one day shipping.</li>
            <li>I really needed help...</li>
            <li>but my pedicurist has also noticed a real improvement too.</li>
            <li>To the seller thanks again.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Applying this for over a month did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Also that the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Really wanted something without steroids so tried this</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing</li>
            <li>I used a whole bottle and figured I would never find it again but lo and behold</li>
            <li>Are these real reviews?</li>
            <li>Have been using fungus killer on my toe nails and it has helped to decrease the amount of fungus on my toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciated the fast service of my order.</li>
            <li>we will see when the damaged nails are completely gone if they will grow!!!  </li>
            <li>This is natural and it works!!!</li>
            <li>After 20 years of acrylic nails I developed a fungus in my right thumb...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s only $5, worth the shot!</li>
            <li>They finally gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li>I guess i was ready to live with sweaty, bumpy, itchy feet (yuck btw).</li>
            <li>Nail fungus is like acne, its never goes away forever, but is more or less controlled with treatment.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it for anyone</li>
            <li>After a little online research however I&#x27;ve found there are some home remedies that work just as well and are, for the most part, already in the kitchen or the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>It didnt really do anything as far as having an impact on my fungus so</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had much luck with this</li>
            <li>I have used the whole bottle and am almost clear of the fungus...</li>
            <li>Got rid of the fungus but keep using it a few times a week to make sure it stays gone.</li>
            <li>I used this same product many years ago when I had a minor nail fungus</li>
            <li>and my nail is normal again after almost two years.  </li>
            <li>product did not do anything to may fungus, I used it for more than 45 days and just wasted my time.</li>
            <li>item received promptly, starting using right away.</li>
            <li>Be consistent and keep your toenails short, clean, and dry.</li>
            <li>newly recommended for nail fungus.  </li>
            <li>It took about a year to clear it up but it worked when nothing else did!</li>
            <li>cuz I had such pretty touchable feet.</li>
            <li>One drop, perhaps followed by another drop in the same place once the first drop has soaked in, twice a day, is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my under nail fungal treatment - which I usually get whenever I&#x27;ve been to a nail salon.</li>
            <li>- I should have thrown away all my old shoes!</li>
            <li>It took about 6 mo to a year to completely heal, but you could never tell that I had that problem now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of nail fungus remedies, and this stuff is the only one that really really really works!  </li>
            <li>too bad- was too good to be true</li>
            <li>I,ve cut it down many times to see if it would grow back correct</li>
            <li>IF half your nail or more has lifted back, this will be the case.</li>
            <li>The positives are that it did clear my nail in a matter of a week.</li>
            <li>This product is advertised on Amazon as a cure for fungus under the nails, yet a warning on the package clearly states that it is not to be used on the nails.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working and the nail is growing out clear without fungus.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost three months and my nail issue is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised that the package doesn&#x27;t include instructions like these.</li>
            <li>It took about a month to completely cure the fungus, but it did its job.</li>
            <li>I did have to use three bottles (using it twice a day), but I promise the fungus went away completely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve continued to use it once a day for preventative measures until my toenails completely grow out</li>
            <li>Only flares up once and a while now and very controllable.</li>
            <li>I did put it directly on the nail which caused the nail to come off --</li>
            <li>My nail came off so much, it was so gross and discolored and flaky!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After missing a dose it came back and my doctor gave me Formula 3 and that&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li>It is very important that you cut the loose or detached part of the  nail down to where it is attached.</li>
            <li>When I opened the bottle it was half full?</li>
            <li>If this product comes half full they should disclose that information.</li>
            <li>it was I still cut it down a use this product but each time it looks better slow process but worth it</li>
            <li>They offer a partial refund beccause the bottle arrived only 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li>I truly can tell a difference, no new discoloration appearing or spreading no more foul odor, very easy to apply</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t stop using because you don&#x27;t see results right away, like any other fungus medicine, it is a process and does not happen over night.</li>
            <li>I purchase this product frequently because it is a small bottle, but very powerful.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend No Miss, but caution that it must be applied religiously twice a day to get the desired results.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for only about three months, but I can see definite positive results.</li>
            <li>First, I got pink eyes and the doctor gave me an antifungal prescription that cured it.</li>
            <li>I can finally see a clear regrowth coming in.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;d purchase to clear up a fungus.</li>
            <li>There was no seal and the box was not wet like any of the medicine leaked out.</li>
            <li>But I believe it&#x27;s been the No Miss treatment that&#x27;s restoring and returning my toenails back to complete normalcy.</li>
            <li>bought this product for first time 4 years ago  store closed and could not find again until recently.</li>
            <li>finger nail is not growing and is pretty much dead.</li>
            <li>At the first sign this year, I also applied No Miss to it &amp; it dried it up in 2 applications.  </li>
            <li>My manicurist gave me my first bottle of this stuff and it works better that any of the 3 prescription products I&#x27;ve used - and is much less expensive.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;m using this product for my toenails, but my second go round using the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product i have really bad problems with fungus with my large toe</li>

            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> This stuff works good</li>
            <li> But good to have in the house .</li>
            <li> Once again,a good product that is taking time to do its work.</li>
            <li> Great product and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> very pleased</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> In fact, many of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; said product worked great on nails.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> and this has been the most effective in treatment!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing price.</li>
            <li> That gets the juice in to where it will do the most good.</li>
            <li> This stuff works fast and awesome</li>
            <li> It is healing it quite nicely.</li>
            <li> takes awhile to work but one of best i think!&lt;br /&gt;Always fast shipping...</li>
            <li> The price is attractive and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The price is attractive and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Ok this is an amazing product - but it takes time to work.</li>
            <li> I tried many products and by far this is the BEST.  </li>
            <li> very* important that you apply it correctly, though.</li>
            <li> a very important note</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, nonsmelling and effective.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, nonsmelling and effective.</li>
            <li> but it makes it look alittle better but did not get rid of the fungus!&lt;br</li>
            <li> You may avoid a trip to the dermatologist/doctor who would cost much more.  </li>
            <li> Remember to call you doctor at some point in this ... might need more than over the counter assistance.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The idea is to get the stuff INSIDE the nail, not on top of it.</li>
            <li> Use it every day until there&#x27;s no sign of any more fungus.  </li>
            <li> I have used it before and love it</li>
            <li> OK this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I am going to try one more product and then go to the podiatrist to try laser.</li>
            <li> (By the way, I did not have any pedicures during my time of agony keeping customers safe.)  </li>
            <li> I love this product my friends had introduced me to it do to my nail fungus.</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve never used the product before.</li>
            <li> I promise it will work. :)</li>
            <li> no results better off using vapor rub thats working better than this stuff</li>
            <li> Though you have to purchase more than one bottle.</li>
            <li> The seller wrote to me, simly told me to use it, they acknowledged that the bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed but insisted it safe to use.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s an RN, so he&#x27;s pleased</li>
            <li> , we are pleased.</li>
            <li> This was just okay ..</li>
            <li> Should know for sure in 3-4 months if it clears up the fungus.</li>
            <li> Mostly alcohol and water....</li>
            <li> &amp; I can make sure the problem is under control.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay value to get started treating nail fungus.</li>
            <li> The ZetaClear that I had bought before seemed to work better, but I believe NOTHING will be the cure (as many others have already said).</li>
            <li> The nails get better and you feel better too.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products with no results.</li>
            <li> but it surely does.</li>
            <li> Great product and it really works.  </li>
            <li> Cure my foot like magic.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Do it after your feet are washed and clean!</li>
            <li> best money spent</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> SO EASY</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Strong stuff.</li>
            <li> and I am happy to say that my toenails have cleared and the fungus is barely noticeable, now I can wear sandals and not feel like people are looking at my toes</li>
            <li> fine by me, it needed to be gone.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working fine.  </li>
            <li> Next to 100% pure tea tree the stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> and I have seen HUGE progress.</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> and I also was happy to receive it shortly after I placed my order.</li>
            <li> He is fungus free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m free of fungus</li>
            <li> I got this from a Nail Salon initially, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> will defintly order more but just rember it take about 6 moths for it to heal and grow on new healthy nail.</li>
            <li> I originally got this product from a nail salon and haven&#x27;t found it until now.</li>
            <li> Order this RIGHT Now!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be wise to use a knife blade to cut back on the damaged nail as well.</li>
            <li> Fighting it is a full time job.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it was liquid and not a messy ointment or cream.</li>
            <li> For the last 2 weeks I have been using no miss after soaking my feet in pedifix tea tree soaking crystals foot bath, and my toe nail is already looking better. :)</li>
            <li> If you are diligent and put two drops on the effected area twice a day, you will see tremendous results.  </li>
            <li> Bottle seemed to go quickly though....</li>
            <li> Consistent use yields very good results and brings the nail back to normal color and growth, along with killing the fungus.</li>
            <li> less is more, 1 drop is more than sufficient!</li>
            <li> You just need to be consistent!</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> For the price, I figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> For the price its worth to try it.</li>
            <li> She seen her new clean toe nail growing out within 2 months!</li>
            <li> You see results right away .</li>
            <li> I put it right where the skin meets my toenail and sometimes in between toes.</li>
            <li> Love the application but not sure how effective it is.</li>
            <li> I still need to use it to completely allow the nails to grow out healthy, but I&#x27;m glad I bought several bottles.</li>
            <li> Its also important that you treat  under the nail as well as at the cuticle area ( new growth).</li>
            <li> Fungus lives in warm moist places so toenail must be dry.</li>
            <li> but my nail has completely thinned out and is looking healthier and more normal!</li>
            <li> But the new growth appears to be coming in healthy and I will try going natural if I can stand it!  </li>
            <li> Fungal nails take a while to resolve, and there is more to the process than just this with changing socks and shoes and such.</li>
            <li> Takes time and consistent care to resolve.</li>
            <li> So working pretty well.</li>
            <li> Toe nail started getting better but didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Be aware that if you have an athlete&#x27;s foot style fungus that is on the nail, but didn&#x27;t originate there-</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is better than what my nail tech is charging for the same product.</li>
            <li> Its an okay product/good starting point.</li>
            <li> This product worked within the first week.  </li>
            <li> If theres any pockets under the nail, it will only hold more moisture , which contributes to the problem.</li>
            <li> I recommend also taking a hair dryer to it first to remove all the moisture before you treat it.</li>
            <li> I used it exactly as recommended and began to see the results after the first bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was told that I needed to be consistent</li>
            <li> I tried this product for several months I think I gave it more than a chance to prove itself.</li>
            <li> but I still have him use this on a daily basis to keep his feet healthy.</li>
            <li> He tried so many different types of medicine for his feet</li>
            <li> I got my first bottle of this at a nail salon thinking that it would not help foot fungus</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it -- saw results after the first 2 uses.</li>
            <li> My fungus-infected nail is more than half grown out with clean nail after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> I used as directed, and it made my big toes nice and clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the fungus for a few years and it amazes me that I&#x27;ve been able to cure it for such a cheap cost!!</li>
            <li> SO happy to find it on Amazon...used it a few times &amp; the tiny bit of fungus disappeared.</li>
            <li> it was a huge set back.  </li>
            <li> Give this product a try, as it&#x27;s very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works fast.  </li>
            <li> was hopeful to have found a reasonable priced solution but will have to go to podiatrist</li>
            <li> I was so much encouraged by the 1st review that I shipped this item by one day shipping.</li>
            <li> I really needed help...</li>
            <li> but my pedicurist has also noticed a real improvement too.</li>
            <li> To the seller thanks again.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Applying this for over a month did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Also that the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Really wanted something without steroids so tried this</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing</li>
            <li> I used a whole bottle and figured I would never find it again but lo and behold</li>
            <li> Are these real reviews?</li>
            <li> Have been using fungus killer on my toe nails and it has helped to decrease the amount of fungus on my toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciated the fast service of my order.</li>
            <li> we will see when the damaged nails are completely gone if they will grow!!!  </li>
            <li> This is natural and it works!!!</li>
            <li> After 20 years of acrylic nails I developed a fungus in my right thumb...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only $5, worth the shot!</li>
            <li> They finally gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li> I guess i was ready to live with sweaty, bumpy, itchy feet (yuck btw).</li>
            <li> Nail fungus is like acne, its never goes away forever, but is more or less controlled with treatment.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it for anyone</li>
            <li> After a little online research however I&#x27;ve found there are some home remedies that work just as well and are, for the most part, already in the kitchen or the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> It didnt really do anything as far as having an impact on my fungus so</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had much luck with this</li>
            <li> I have used the whole bottle and am almost clear of the fungus...</li>
            <li> Got rid of the fungus but keep using it a few times a week to make sure it stays gone.</li>
            <li> I used this same product many years ago when I had a minor nail fungus</li>
            <li> and my nail is normal again after almost two years.  </li>
            <li> product did not do anything to may fungus, I used it for more than 45 days and just wasted my time.</li>
            <li> item received promptly, starting using right away.</li>
            <li> Be consistent and keep your toenails short, clean, and dry.</li>
            <li> newly recommended for nail fungus.  </li>
            <li> It took about a year to clear it up but it worked when nothing else did!</li>
            <li> cuz I had such pretty touchable feet.</li>
            <li> One drop, perhaps followed by another drop in the same place once the first drop has soaked in, twice a day, is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my under nail fungal treatment - which I usually get whenever I&#x27;ve been to a nail salon.</li>
            <li> - I should have thrown away all my old shoes!</li>
            <li> It took about 6 mo to a year to completely heal, but you could never tell that I had that problem now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of nail fungus remedies, and this stuff is the only one that really really really works!  </li>
            <li> too bad- was too good to be true</li>
            <li> I,ve cut it down many times to see if it would grow back correct</li>
            <li> IF half your nail or more has lifted back, this will be the case.</li>
            <li> The positives are that it did clear my nail in a matter of a week.</li>
            <li> This product is advertised on Amazon as a cure for fungus under the nails, yet a warning on the package clearly states that it is not to be used on the nails.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working and the nail is growing out clear without fungus.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost three months and my nail issue is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised that the package doesn&#x27;t include instructions like these.</li>
            <li> It took about a month to completely cure the fungus, but it did its job.</li>
            <li> I did have to use three bottles (using it twice a day), but I promise the fungus went away completely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve continued to use it once a day for preventative measures until my toenails completely grow out</li>
            <li> Only flares up once and a while now and very controllable.</li>
            <li> I did put it directly on the nail which caused the nail to come off --</li>
            <li> My nail came off so much, it was so gross and discolored and flaky!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After missing a dose it came back and my doctor gave me Formula 3 and that&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> It is very important that you cut the loose or detached part of the  nail down to where it is attached.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle it was half full?</li>
            <li> If this product comes half full they should disclose that information.</li>
            <li> it was I still cut it down a use this product but each time it looks better slow process but worth it</li>
            <li> They offer a partial refund beccause the bottle arrived only 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li> I truly can tell a difference, no new discoloration appearing or spreading no more foul odor, very easy to apply</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stop using because you don&#x27;t see results right away, like any other fungus medicine, it is a process and does not happen over night.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product frequently because it is a small bottle, but very powerful.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend No Miss, but caution that it must be applied religiously twice a day to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only about three months, but I can see definite positive results.</li>
            <li> First, I got pink eyes and the doctor gave me an antifungal prescription that cured it.</li>
            <li> I can finally see a clear regrowth coming in.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;d purchase to clear up a fungus.</li>
            <li> There was no seal and the box was not wet like any of the medicine leaked out.</li>
            <li> But I believe it&#x27;s been the No Miss treatment that&#x27;s restoring and returning my toenails back to complete normalcy.</li>
            <li> bought this product for first time 4 years ago  store closed and could not find again until recently.</li>
            <li> finger nail is not growing and is pretty much dead.</li>
            <li> At the first sign this year, I also applied No Miss to it &amp; it dried it up in 2 applications.  </li>
            <li> My manicurist gave me my first bottle of this stuff and it works better that any of the 3 prescription products I&#x27;ve used - and is much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m using this product for my toenails, but my second go round using the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product i have really bad problems with fungus with my large toe</li>
            <li> I used two bottles back to back, every single day as directed.</li>
            <li> I have not been using the product long enough to see if it will get rid of the fungus.  </li>
            <li> Its just going to be ugly for awhile, but I promise you it will get better with time!</li>
            <li> With both active ingredients- make sure you are constantly cutting the nail back so that it can have a total effect instead of just treating the outer-most area.</li>
            <li> and you have to be patient, which is why I bought the second bottle - hope to see results when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Spent ten years with a foot fungus before I found this!</li>
            <li> Depending on how long you have had the fungal infection , it may take up to 6 months to get grown out.</li>
            <li> Getting rid of a toenail fungus is a long process.  </li>
            <li> This product I have been useing for a long time, and</li>
            <li> Useless, nothing happened, if anything, my previous medicine was better.</li>
            <li> And toenail must be dry..</li>
            <li> my mom used a blowdry to dry quicker.</li>
            <li> I changed the way i do my nails and also used this on the few days i had my fake nails off and it looks much better.</li>
            <li> have tried atleast a dozen other products ,have spent several hundred at dermatoligist over the years.</li>
            <li> , the bottle looked like it&#x27;s been opened with less than 3/4 left.  </li>
            <li> The negatives is the the bottle is tiny and finished in a week in a half.</li>
            <li> I had a few of my nails become very discolored dark green color from my acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li> , the Amazon pic only shows the front of the little pink box.  </li>
            <li> this is day 11, bottle is almost empty and no result.</li>
            <li> This product cured the itching and burning on my feet within a few short weeks.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have solar nails and invariably get a fungus spot under one during the wet summer months.  </li>
            <li> Comes out each summer but this year, not nearly as much.</li>
            <li> If you are experiencing a toenail infection, cut your nails down (careful regarding too short for ingrown toenails!), rough up the top surface with an Emory board, and then apply a drop of this at the base and at the tip of each nail.</li>
            <li> By that evening, the treated area was almost normal pink from the angry red</li>
            <li> Working well; hard to find in my area - therefore ordered online; no other product that I&#x27;ve used has worked this well.</li>
            <li> You only need to apply very little.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this at first, but it&#x27;s doing the job.</li>
            <li> I have used all other kinds that seem to take months to even start to work.  </li>
            <li> I even noticed that is was beginning to infect my other nails.</li>
            <li> I will reoder this product and place other oders with this company due to the customer service.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> Keeping the nail(s) short is key, as you don&#x27;t want to case harm to the already weak nail(s).</li>
            <li> Who knows if this works its such a small bottle that you would have to buy a vat of this to handle the toenail infection.</li>
            <li> but it was not evident until acquired that it is not meant for nail fungus....</li>
            <li> The quality works for me especially since I have used it in the past.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has cleared up one and my other is so close to being cleared.  </li>
            <li> If you have the other types of foot &amp; hand fungi- look for Undecylenic Acid as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Read active ingredients before you buy.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and at least six months of use</li>
            <li> Even though the nail has been filed down with a rotary file and all the infection removed, this product had no effect.  </li>
            <li> nails down.</li>
            <li> I mean I tried foot spray, washed and washed constantly.</li>
            <li> The price of this was 45% less than the one I bought at a nail salon.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still slight discoloration</li>
            <li> No greasy feel and can put socks and shoes on within 5 minutes or less.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works for someone who has had this problem for a long period of time, but it worked for my seriously infected toe that I noticed RIGHT away, within a month of my pedicure that something was seriously wrong!</li>
            <li> Inside the box the little bottle also came unsealed.  </li>
            <li> A little goes along way...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month since starting to apply it and two days ago I was shocked to see the improvement in my nails when she removed my colored nail polish for a new pedicure.</li>
            <li> It killed fungus on my toenails within 5 days</li>
            <li> I have had a discolored big toe for years and it had continually gotten worse by chipping/flaking and practically disentegrating on my foot.</li>
            <li> They will credit my account, in this economy I do not want to waste any money.</li>
            <li> every few days (2x/week) and cured my infected pinky toe nail and foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too</li>
            <li> Use this when you get that yuck green on your nails and use it as it says.  </li>
            <li> Works well, however like all fungus killers you have to use it everyday for weeks until you see results.</li>
            <li> no fungus comin&#x27; &#x27;round here.</li>
            <li> Right now my hands are so ugly without nails</li>
            <li> My current nail tech believed my lifted nail was due to injury not fungus, but after having this issue over a year, was skeptical this product would work, but it did.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottles are so small and I cannot find the product locally, thus, having to rely in mail-order sources which can become very expensive with S&amp;H charges.</li>
            <li> there was very little in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money, it was sold to me for $4.00 and then they added another $5.00 for shipping!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE on 7/31/14:  So it looked like selling the product in an unsealed / unsecured bottle is the usual practice for this seller in China.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star rating because the bottle is really small for the price.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> It smells completely awful and on top of that it doesnt work.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t resolve toenail fungas but in saying that, not many products will, even Rx didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> ; fungus is usually gone in about a month.</li>
            <li> The staggered EKG-looking line and dead cartoon-fungus shows they mean business.</li>
            <li> I can hardly stand it...</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t use it as often as she should have, at least 2ce a day, but it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> but its product is not effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use at least 2 times per day.</li>
            <li> You should apply the no miss, at least once a day, preferably at night, when you don&#x27;t wash your hands.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few months and it seems to have gotten worse.</li>
            <li> He says it works slowly, just as it should.</li>
            <li> Slow but works</li>
            <li> It is a slow process but is working</li>
            <li> It appears to be working but slowly.</li>
            <li> USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION!!!!</li>
            <li> After 2 years of dermatologists and expensive prescriptions that followed other OTC products, my nail technician applied this to a part of my foot.  </li>
            <li> and I got tired of the slow process.  </li>
            <li> the toenail is still black and has thick white spots and edges and still looks horrible.</li>
            <li> I was mislead by comments posted about it before I purchased it: it is useless for using on your toes, so I am not sure how someone could post that it worked so well on their toes?</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product, but the seller did ship it fast, so thats the one star rating.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m really tough on my feet.</li>
            <li> but it was a very slow process; and if I skipped a couple of days and started again</li>
            <li> No more problems!!</li>
            <li> I MEAN BAAAD!</li>
            <li> Please give this product approximately three months to work.  </li>
            <li> My toe got worse after using it.</li>
            <li> My nail beds are so damaged from 20 years of acrylic they are paper thin.  </li>
            <li> His feet weren&#x27;t that bad to begin with, but he still needed a little bit of help with them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not fix the toe nail problem.</li>
            <li> I had an expensive laser procedure performed to eliminate the fungus in my toenails that had been diagnosed by my podiatrist.</li>
            <li> My next step would have been a prescription medication with horrible side effects</li>
            <li> Bad service bottle was leaky bottle halfway does not work</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really hate it cause I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> And it was BAD!</li>
            <li> I thought I was doomed to have an ugly toenail!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used for my &amp;#34;sometimes&amp;#34; toenail fungus issues and recommend for all.  Will be reordering once I need it again.</li>
            <li> This product shows signs of progress in 2 weeks of use. It is easy to use, nonsmelling and effective. The price is attractive and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Which it would have worked as my finger nail is brown.&lt;br /&gt;Used alot but it makes it look alittle better but did not get rid of the fungus!&lt;br /&gt;My finger nail is not growing and is pretty much dead.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not fix the toe nail problem. Would not ever buy again. Not for me. Good luck if you buy this, hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> have tried atleast a dozen other products ,have spent several hundred at dermatoligist over the years. bought this product for first time 4 years ago  store closed and could not find again until recently. doctor said nothing he could do ,just kept saying keep hands out of water. (impossible,I tend bar)buy it will not be disapointed!!! best money spent</li>
            <li> This product doesnt work!  Waste of money, it was sold to me for $4.00 and then they added another $5.00 for shipping!  Dont buy this product!!</li>
            <li> did nothing to cure fungus. save your money</li>
            <li> This product has worked wonders.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost three months and my nail issue is almost completely gone.  My current nail tech believed my lifted nail was due to injury not fungus, but after having this issue over a year, was skeptical this product would work, but it did.  Give this product a try, as it&#x27;s very inexpensive.  You may avoid a trip to the dermatologist/doctor who would cost much more.  P.S.  Please give this product approximately three months to work.  You will probably notice a difference in a shorter amount of time, but continue to use it til issue is gone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only about three months, but I can see definite positive results.</li>
            <li> Cheap And works great!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t use it as often as she should have, at least 2ce a day, but it didn&#x27;t work at all. don&#x27;t have any alternatives to suggest, as nothing has helped yet.</li>
            <li> If you are experiencing a toenail infection, cut your nails down (careful regarding too short for ingrown toenails!), rough up the top surface with an Emory board, and then apply a drop of this at the base and at the tip of each nail. Fungal nails take a while to resolve, and there is more to the process than just this with changing socks and shoes and such. This ointment will definitely help. Takes time and consistent care to resolve. Remember to call you doctor at some point in this ... might need more than over the counter assistance. Good luck!  :)</li>
            <li> I guess i was ready to live with sweaty, bumpy, itchy feet (yuck btw). I mean I tried foot spray, washed and washed constantly. It was embarrassing and I did all I could so they would never come into contact with another human being. It was a darn shame cuz I had such pretty touchable feet. And then one day in an unrelated search I found this product. It works people! Strong stuff. You only need to apply very little. Buy it. Love it. And say goodbye to the fungi!</li>
            <li> This product shows signs of progress in 2 weeks of use. It is easy to use, nonsmelling and effective. The price is attractive and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this at first, but it&#x27;s doing the job. My fungus-infected nail is more than half grown out with clean nail after 2 months of use. It&#x27;s *very* important that you apply it correctly, though. Don&#x27;t just brush it on the nail. You need to put ONE DROP on the edge of the nail, where the fungus has cracked and fractured the nail, and get it to soak in. The idea is to get the stuff INSIDE the nail, not on top of it. You&#x27;d be wise to use a knife blade to cut back on the damaged nail as well. That gets the juice in to where it will do the most good. As noted, you don&#x27;t need a lot of this fluid. One drop, perhaps followed by another drop in the same place once the first drop has soaked in, twice a day, is the way to go. I&#x27;m really surprised that the package doesn&#x27;t include instructions like these.</li>
            <li> It killed fungus on my toenails within 5 days</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and at least six months of use but I have seen no progress.  I know treating toe nail fungus is a looooong time project and you have to be patient, which is why I bought the second bottle - hope to see results when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works fast.  I used it on toe nails with fungus under nails.. Use it every day until there&#x27;s no sign of any more fungus.  I have tried everything else, and nothing worked.  Linda</li>
            <li> this product does not work does not say how it works but its product is not effective.</li>
            <li> This stuff works good I have used it before and love it and I will use it again and again love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Fighting it is a full time job. What a pain. It has spread. I have used all other kinds that seem to take months to even start to work.  Now I have found one that works quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After missing a dose it came back and my doctor gave me Formula 3 and that&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> I found this has kept my problem in check.  Got rid of the fungus but keep using it a few times a week to make sure it stays gone.</li>
            <li> item received promptly, starting using right away. this is day 11, bottle is almost empty and no result. the toenail is still black and has thick white spots and edges and still looks horrible. was hopeful to have found a reasonable priced solution but will have to go to podiatrist it seems. too bad- was too good to be true</li>
            <li> IT WORKS!!!! I wear combat boots 14+ hours a day. And I&#x27;m really tough on my feet. So my big toe is always cracked, yellow, and seems fungus-y. THIS STUFF WORKED ON ME IN TWO WEEKS. I used as directed, and it made my big toes nice and clear. It also seemed to strengthen them. I originally got this product from a nail salon and haven&#x27;t found it until now. definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> So working pretty well. Some improvement noted short term.  Excellent shipping and easy transaction.</li>
            <li> I was so much encouraged by the 1st review that I shipped this item by one day shipping. Useless, nothing happened, if anything, my previous medicine was better.</li>
            <li> Spent ten years with a foot fungus before I found this! It took about a year to clear it up but it worked when nothing else did!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really hate it cause I haven&#x27;t used it. When I ordered it I misunderstood what it is for.  It says on the bottle do not use on nails and that&#x27;s what I bought it for.  I guess it&#x27;s for skin fungus ailments like ringworm. And that&#x27;s not what i suffer from.  So I will be returning it this coming week.</li>
            <li> I used this same product many years ago when I had a minor nail fungus and it worked perfectly. SO happy to find it on Amazon...used it a few times &amp; the tiny bit of fungus disappeared. Great product!!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> I really needed help...something that would work. For the price, I figured it was worth a shot. I have tried everything I could find before and had no results. I have had a discolored big toe for years and it had continually gotten worse by chipping/flaking and practically disentegrating on my foot. I even noticed that is was beginning to infect my other nails. This product in combination with ZetaClear worked wonders. Not only have my toenails cleared up but my pedicurist has also noticed a real improvement too. I am looking forward to summer again. Great product and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product worked well. It took about a month to completely cure the fungus, but it did its job. A couple drops at night and a couple in the morning and in not time my nails were looking very nice again! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> OK this stuff works. A nail technician recommended it. I cannot believe the results. My nail looks flawless!! For the price its worth to try it.</li>
            <li> Even though the nail has been filed down with a rotary file and all the infection removed, this product had no effect.  I am going to try one more product and then go to the podiatrist to try laser.</li>
            <li> No Miss cured the fungus that started on my feet &amp; spread to the trunk of my body. After 2 years of dermatologists and expensive prescriptions that followed other OTC products, my nail technician applied this to a part of my foot.  By that evening, the treated area was almost normal pink from the angry red I&#x27;d grown used to.  This product cured the itching and burning on my feet within a few short weeks. Now I know why my nail folks use it themselves and recommend it. (By the way, I did not have any pedicures during my time of agony keeping customers safe.)  Only used this on my feet but once they got under control, the rest of me responded to the prescriptions.  Great product!</li>
            <li> If used faithfully morning and night. But you must be patient, results don&#x27;t happen overnight. May take several weeks of application.</li>
            <li> I love this product my friends had introduced me to it do to my nail fungus. Let me tell your it works miracles no sooner it touch the infected area it&#x27;s doing what it suppose to do. To the seller thanks again.</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve never used the product before. But my mom has and she says it does wonders!! She did it twice a day, morning and night. Do it after your feet are washed and clean! And toenail must be dry.. my mom used a blowdry to dry quicker. Fungus lives in warm moist places so toenail must be dry. No matter what. That&#x27;s probably why alot of ppl think it doesn&#x27;t work. She seen her new clean toe nail growing out within 2 months! It does work! You just need to be consistent! Don&#x27;t stop using because you don&#x27;t see results right away, like any other fungus medicine, it is a process and does not happen over night. Be consistent and keep your toenails short, clean, and dry. I promise it will work. :)</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected. When I opened the bottle it was half full? There was no seal and the box was not wet like any of the medicine leaked out. If this product comes half full they should disclose that information.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work used it religiously and nothing no results better off using vapor rub thats working better than this stuff</li>
            <li> I love this product i have really bad problems with fungus with my large toe I,ve cut it down many times to see if it would grow back correct but it never does. i finally tried this product it doesn&#x27;t work over night. im on my third bottle but i can see a big differences.  I can finally see a clear regrowth coming in.  I,m going to keep using it until i see the nail grow in the way it was I still cut it down a use this product but each time it looks better slow process but worth it</li>
            <li> The instruction says don&#x27;t apply on nails. And if you still do, as it was advertised for nails, it doesn&#x27;t work anyway.</li>
            <li> Great fungus killer. You see results right away . Though you have to purchase more than one bottle. But good to have in the house .</li>
            <li> A family member needed something to treat toenail fungus.  I found this and read through the reviews before ordering it.  It arrived just this afternoon in an unsealed box.  Inside the box the little bottle also came unsealed.  Not only that, the bottle looked like it&#x27;s been opened with less than 3/4 left.  I thought all food and medicine products were supposed to be sealed for safety?  Worried that the content has been tempered with, none of us dare to use it.  I sent the seller a return request.  Waiting to see how the seller respond and will write an update later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a very important note, the Amazon pic only shows the front of the little pink box.  On the back of the box, the instruction actually has a warning says DO NOT USE ON NAILS.  I thought this was supposed to be treatment for toenail fungus?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE on 7/31/14:  So it looked like selling the product in an unsealed / unsecured bottle is the usual practice for this seller in China.  The seller wrote to me, simly told me to use it, they acknowledged that the bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed but insisted it safe to use.  They offer a partial refund beccause the bottle arrived only 3/4 full.  I told them here in the US, all medicinal and food products should be sealed for sale.  They finally gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li> I have solar nails and invariably get a fungus spot under one during the wet summer months.  A drop a day and it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> The price of this was 45% less than the one I bought at a nail salon. It is helping me with fungus in my big toe.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any improvement</li>
            <li> Ordered this product about 5months ago and I&#x27;m going on my third bottle now. I use it faithfully and generously to the nail bed and underneath my toenail and I have seen HUGE progress. There&#x27;s still slight discoloration but my nail has completely thinned out and is looking healthier and more normal! I&#x27;ve had the fungus for a few years and it amazes me that I&#x27;ve been able to cure it for such a cheap cost!! Good product!! Every fungus is difference but it&#x27;s only $5, worth the shot!</li>
            <li> Has anyone else noticed that it says not to use on your nails?  Why would this product say that?  I took a risk anyway anf used it.  I had a few of my nails become very discolored dark green color from my acrylic nails.  I changed the way i do my nails and also used this on the few days i had my fake nails off and it looks much better.</li>
            <li> I used two bottles back to back, every single day as directed. Seemed to be working while I was using it. Toe nail started getting better but didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it didn&#x27;t work for me. I have used this for a few months and it seems to have gotten worse.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this for years my husband and I notice a difference after the second day and this is the tenth day and I am happy to say that my toenails have cleared and the fungus is barely noticeable, now I can wear sandals and not feel like people are looking at my toes also I can polish my toes and not have to use five to ten coats just to cover up the fungus on my toes. you are reading a review from very happy feet. thanks AMAZON/ FUNGUS KILLER.</li>
            <li> We ordered this product for my son who has a fungus problem. He says it works slowly, just as it should. This is the second time we have purchased this product for him. He&#x27;s an RN, so he&#x27;s pleased, we are pleased.Thank You.</li>
            <li> I have the type that grows under the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying this for over a month did absolutely nothing. I cleaned the area and used it generously.</li>
            <li> While the product seemed to work well there was very little in the bottle.  I did not notice this until my second time using. I contacted them and I received an almost immediant response.  They will credit my account, in this economy I do not want to waste any money. I will reoder this product and place other oders with this company due to the customer service.</li>
            <li> I had a fungal infection in one toe nail that I fought for two years WITH a dermatologist.  I took oral medication, which made it go away over time, but as soon as I stopped the medication, the fungus came back.  The nail tech at the salon suggested this to me and I bought it for $10 a bottle at the nail salon.  I did have to use three bottles (using it twice a day), but I promise the fungus went away completely and my nail is normal again after almost two years.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Works really well. I have 2 teenagers.</li>
            <li> I used this on my partner&#x27;s feet and it works amazingly!! Within a week he noticed that his toenails had improved in appearance and thickness. His feet weren&#x27;t that bad to begin with, but he still needed a little bit of help with them. But it immediately helped with his ingrown toenails, and the color and overall appearance to his nails. I think that even with someone who has a severe problem could benefit from this, although probably not with the immediate results I have witnessed. But I will be buying this product again for him!</li>
            <li> This was just okay .. it did start to kill the fungus but it was a very slow process; and if I skipped a couple of days and started again it was a huge set back.  You have to keep using it every day for several months.  It took about two bottles of this per month for me and I got tired of the slow process.  So, I decided to try something else.  Would not buy it again .. I need something stronger for me.</li>
            <li> Works great! Was buying it at the salon for 4x price. Used it initially to get rid of fungus, now use it weekly to avoid fungus under gel nails. No more problems!!</li>
            <li> This product used as directed cured my nail fungus in about two months. I would recommend No Miss Fungus Killer if you have a nail fungus. I used this on my finger nails.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that this was 100% the cure used in addition to apple cider vinegar soaks and cleared up my fungus within 6-7 weeks!</li>
            <li> Once again,a good product that is taking time to do its work. But that&#x27;s nothing for me as have had this foot problem since time served in Vietnam. Comes out each summer but this year, not nearly as much. very pleased</li>
            <li> I like this product, it makes yoru nails clearer and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use at least 2 times per day.</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t taken away my warts yet !</li>
            <li> It didnt really do anything as far as having an impact on my fungus so</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my under nail fungal treatment - which I usually get whenever I&#x27;ve been to a nail salon. Be aware that if you have an athlete&#x27;s foot style fungus that is on the nail, but didn&#x27;t originate there- it probably won&#x27;t work. Read active ingredients before you buy. This has Miconazole Nitrate. If you have the other types of foot &amp; hand fungi- look for Undecylenic Acid as the active ingredient. With both active ingredients- make sure you are constantly cutting the nail back so that it can have a total effect instead of just treating the outer-most area.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my nail tech for a toenail fungus. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 1 month and it seems to be working. I apply it twice a day. Should know for sure in 3-4 months if it clears up the fungus. If the fungus goes away, I&#x27;ll upgrade my rating to 5 stars. The price on Amazon is better than what my nail tech is charging for the same product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months and I find it to be very effective and I also was happy to receive it shortly after I placed my order.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as other reviewers said. Used it continuously for weeks and saw no result.</li>
            <li> Bad service bottle was leaky bottle halfway does not work only used what ever was left won&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star rating because the bottle is really small for the price.The positives are that it did clear my nail in a matter of a week.Also that the shipping was fast.The negatives is the the bottle is tiny and finished in a week in a half.Its an okay product/good starting point.</li>
            <li> my wife used two bottles on a toe that was forming fungus and it went away. I have a nail that has been messed up for years I may try it on that one but I doubt it will work</li>
            <li> This stuff works fast and awesome</li>
            <li> I believe this stuff infected my toe. My toe got worse after using it. USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION!!!!</li>
            <li> This works for my toe nails.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  It works.</li>
            <li> This product worked within the first week.  My toe nail was turning brown now it&#x27;s white again...back to my french pedicures ;o)!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued with a fungus on my big toenails for longer than I can remember. The lady at the spa where I have my pedicures told me about this product and I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully every day as she said. It&#x27;s been a month since starting to apply it and two days ago I was shocked to see the improvement in my nails when she removed my colored nail polish for a new pedicure. I still need to use it to completely allow the nails to grow out healthy, but I&#x27;m glad I bought several bottles.</li>
            <li> newly recommended for nail fungus.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this, don&#x27;t buy anything else.  Order this RIGHT Now!</li>
            <li> I have been a nail tech for over 26 years and this is the best product around for controlling nail fungus.  It is very important that you cut the loose or detached part of the  nail down to where it is attached. If theres any pockets under the nail, it will only hold more moisture , which contributes to the problem. Its just going to be ugly for awhile, but I promise you it will get better with time! Its also important that you treat  under the nail as well as at the cuticle area ( new growth). I recommend my clients to dap a bit of petroleum jelly on the end of their fingertips before using this, as its drying to the skin!  You should apply the no miss, at least once a day, preferably at night, when you don&#x27;t wash your hands. I recommend also taking a hair dryer to it first to remove all the moisture before you treat it. A little goes along way...less is more, 1 drop is more than sufficient! Depending on how long you have had the fungal infection , it may take up to 6 months to get grown out. IF half your nail or more has lifted back, this will be the case. Keeping the nail(s) short is key, as you don&#x27;t want to case harm to the already weak nail(s). Nails grow at about 1/2-1 cm a month, so it does take time. Nail fungus is like acne, its never goes away forever, but is more or less controlled with treatment. After you start to see your nails come back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot; , I recommend using the treatment, once a week, or so , as a preventative . Hope this information helps you!</li>
            <li> Who knows if this works its such a small bottle that you would have to buy a vat of this to handle the toenail infection. Mostly alcohol and water....</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me.  I used it exactly as recommended and began to see the results after the first bottle.  I&#x27;ve continued to use it once a day for preventative measures until my toenails completely grow out &amp; I can make sure the problem is under control.  I&#x27;ve also had Eczema for years which flares up when the weather warms up.  At the first sign this year, I also applied No Miss to it &amp; it dried it up in 2 applications.  What welcomed relief!  My only complaint is that the bottles are so small and I cannot find the product locally, thus, having to rely in mail-order sources which can become very expensive with S&amp;H charges.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Slow but works</li>
            <li> I was taking a water aerobics class and acquired recurring fungal infections. First, I got pink eyes and the doctor gave me an antifungal prescription that cured it. Next, I got a ringworm and used an over-the-counter antifungal ointment to get rid of it. Then I noticed my fingernails were leaving their beds. I stopped at a local nail salon and they sold me this \\&quot;No Miss\\&quot; fungus killer. I follow the directions and in just 4 weeks my fingernails are 90 percent reattached to their beds. Excellent product !!!</li>
            <li> My husband had a nail fungus. This product is almost saved him from that. We are still continuing treatment. Let&#x27;s see what will be the outcome in the end. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Been battling a toe fungus I got in the philippines. Got a cream from the doctor that worked but it had steroids. Really wanted something without steroids so tried this and it clears my fungus up in a week with immediate relief from itching and burning. Only flares up once and a while now and very controllable.</li>
            <li> This product had great reviews....but it was not evident until acquired that it is not meant for nail fungus....which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I have fungus on one of my toes. It is healing it quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Ok this is an amazing product - but it takes time to work. 2 weeks to start seeing an effect and 2 months or so to cure. I soak in the pedifix soaking crystal bath (tea tree) every few days (2x/week) and cured my infected pinky toe nail and foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too bad I&#x27;ll need it again as it came back after 4 months - I should have thrown away all my old shoes!</li>
            <li> my husband uses this, he swears by it. i dont see any fungus on his nails so i guess it does work!</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money! It smells completely awful and on top of that it doesnt work. Very disappointed with this product, but the seller did ship it fast, so thats the one star rating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay value to get started treating nail fungus. After a little online research however I&#x27;ve found there are some home remedies that work just as well and are, for the most part, already in the kitchen or the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had much luck with this but I&#x27;m not giving up yet.  The ZetaClear that I had bought before seemed to work better, but I believe NOTHING will be the cure (as many others have already said).</li>
            <li> It is a slow process but is working</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works as well as the prescription stuff.  I did put it directly on the nail which caused the nail to come off -- fine by me, it needed to be gone.  The nail is growing back without the disfigurement of fungus.  Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> Works great if you keep using it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002WTGCE No Miss Fungus Killer Antifungel 1/4oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not do anything to may fungus, I used it for more than 45 days and just wasted my time. I was told that I needed to be consistent and I was using the fungus killer twice a day, but still did not do anything. I wont recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> Use this when you get that yuck green on your nails and use it as it says.  The nails get better and you feel better too.</li>
            <li> Used on big toe nail does help given time</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products with no results. For the last 2 weeks I have been using no miss after soaking my feet in pedifix tea tree soaking crystals foot bath, and my toe nail is already looking better. :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t resolve toenail fungas but in saying that, not many products will, even Rx didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It does its job! I recommend it to anyone that has problems with their nails which is hands or toes</li>
            <li> This product is advertised on Amazon as a cure for fungus under the nails, yet a warning on the package clearly states that it is not to be used on the nails.  It&#x27;s basically just an athlete&#x27;s foot remedy like Tinactin or Lamasil, which don&#x27;t claim to cure nail fungus.</li>
            <li> This product is intended to be used on skin fungus and not toe-nails; it says so on the back of the package.  I was mislead by comments posted about it before I purchased it: it is useless for using on your toes, so I am not sure how someone could post that it worked so well on their toes?</li>
            <li> I tried this product for several months I think I gave it more than a chance to prove itself. There has been no change in the problem toe nails are still a disaster. it takes 1 year for the toe nail to grow out I should have seen a reduction in the infected area. None this product does not do what it says. Yes I used it twice a day every day scraping the problem area to no avail. Thanks for nothing</li>
            <li> I have not been using the product long enough to see if it will get rid of the fungus.  Check back in another month of two.  Sometimes it takes six months to see any results.</li>
            <li> I truly can tell a difference, no new discoloration appearing or spreading no more foul odor, very easy to apply</li>
            <li> Next to 100% pure tea tree the stuff is awesome. I got this for my hubby who had a problem with athletes foot and this fungus killer worked wonders on his feet and nails. He is fungus free but I still have him use this on a daily basis to keep his feet healthy.</li>
            <li> Love the application but not sure how effective it is.</li>
            <li> SPECIFICALLY IF USED WITH DR.CLEAR&lt;br /&gt;DOES THE JOB WELL&lt;br /&gt;USE IT FOR 4 WEEKS,YOU WILL SEE RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE IT</li>
            <li> My dad has used these for several years now. He tried so many different types of medicine for his feet and this has been the most effective in treatment!</li>
            <li> The quality works for me especially since I have used it in the past.  Would highly recommend it for anyone</li>
            <li> Does nothing I bought 2 bottles Used about 1 1/2 already and it didn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;Wasting money!!!</li>
            <li> After 20 years of acrylic nails I developed a fungus in my right thumb...My manicurist took my nails off and gave me a bottle of this.  I have used the whole bottle and am almost clear of the fungus...but like someone else said I had to peel off the damaged nail and treat.  My nail beds are so damaged from 20 years of acrylic they are paper thin.  But the new growth appears to be coming in healthy and I will try going natural if I can stand it!  Right now my hands are so ugly without nails I can hardly stand it...we will see when the damaged nails are completely gone if they will grow!!!  Anyway, I am coming back for my second bottle.  If you have a fungus nail you need to peel off the damaged part and then this product will work.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Getting rid of a toenail fungus is a long process.  This stuff has cleared up one and my other is so close to being cleared.  This is the only product I&#x27;d purchase to clear up a fungus.</li>
            <li> IT  IS GREAT  I GOT FUNGIS IN MY FINGERNAILS FROM USEING TIPS AND FUNGIS KILLER IS CLEARING IT &#x27;  SO EASY</li>
            <li> Does the job.  My husband had some fungus on his toe nail.  Couldn&#x27;t get rid of it.  Started using this and it&#x27;s working fine.  This is my 3rd of 4th bottle.  Like to keep it on hand just in case.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> I got my first bottle of this at a nail salon thinking that it would not help foot fungus but it surely does. I put it right where the skin meets my toenail and sometimes in between toes. If you use as directed it does work. I used a whole bottle and figured I would never find it again but lo and behold I found it on Amazon. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Great product and it really works.  This is the only thing that has worked for me. This is an amazing price.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of pedicures and found that I was getting toe fungus a lot.  I tried many products and by far this is the BEST.  If you are diligent and put two drops on the effected area twice a day, you will see tremendous results.  I purchase this product frequently because it is a small bottle, but very powerful.</li>
            <li> This is natural and it works!!!</li>
            <li> I had a pedicure done and got a fungus on my big toe! I thought I was doomed to have an ugly toenail! Thank GOD I found this! It took about 6 mo to a year to completely heal, but you could never tell that I had that problem now! And it was BAD! I MEAN BAAAD! My nail came off so much, it was so gross and discolored and flaky! I felt so embarassed! I don&#x27;t know if it works for someone who has had this problem for a long period of time, but it worked for my seriously infected toe that I noticed RIGHT away, within a month of my pedicure that something was seriously wrong! Lesson learned though, I will NEVER get a pedicure anywhere else but my own home again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of nail fungus remedies, and this stuff is the only one that really really really works!  Simple to apply; fungus is usually gone in about a month.</li>
            <li> It appears to be working but slowly.</li>
            <li> This is not for nail fungus; but for foot fungus.</li>
            <li> Fungus killer did not work for me</li>
            <li> Works well, however like all fungus killers you have to use it everyday for weeks until you see results.</li>
            <li> This product I have been useing for a long time, and it reality kills toe nail Fungus.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she says it works so there...</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it -- saw results after the first 2 uses. Bottle seemed to go quickly though....going to order another!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t use this. did not work for husband and he finally went to the doctor for meds. that&#x27;&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m using this product for my toenails, but my second go round using the product. Consistent use yields very good results and brings the nail back to normal color and growth, along with killing the fungus. I had an expensive laser procedure performed to eliminate the fungus in my toenails that had been diagnosed by my podiatrist. But I believe it&#x27;s been the No Miss treatment that&#x27;s restoring and returning my toenails back to complete normalcy. I would highly recommend No Miss, but caution that it must be applied religiously twice a day to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all, but does work for my daughter.</li>
            <li> The best fungus killer in the market. Cure my foot like magic. Thank you fungus killer I&#x27;m free of fungus</li>
            <li> This is the best fungus killer I have used. Both my husband and I used this product for our hands and feet.</li>
            <li> My manicurist gave me my first bottle of this stuff and it works better that any of the 3 prescription products I&#x27;ve used - and is much less expensive.  If you have to use an antifungal - this is the best.</li>
            <li> Working well; hard to find in my area - therefore ordered online; no other product that I&#x27;ve used has worked this well.</li>
            <li> I wanted this for a nail fungus and nowhere in the online info did it say not to use on nails. In fact, many of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; said product worked great on nails. Are these real reviews?</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my Pedicurist.  Seems to be working and the nail is growing out clear without fungus.  Easy to use.  Put on in morning after shower with eye dropper and again in the evening before bed.  No greasy feel and can put socks and shoes on within 5 minutes or less.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Have been using fungus killer on my toe nails and it has helped to decrease the amount of fungus on my toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciated the fast service of my order.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to.  I have used it before.</li>
            <li> I had tried several products over the counter from my local drug store/pharmacy.  None of them worked.  I got this from a Nail Salon initially, and it worked great.  My next step would have been a prescription medication with horrible side effects listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use is according to the directions, and you don&#x27;t have a sever case of fungus, it should work wonders!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I liked the fact that it was liquid and not a messy ointment or cream. Used every night before bed on a problem nail. Took a while but it worked. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for 3 months, still have not seen the problem resolved.</li>
            <li> takes awhile to work but one of best i think!&lt;br /&gt;Always fast shipping...thank you!</li>
            <li> I swear I bought this for my mom although if I had the fungus it would be in my cabinet. The staggered EKG-looking line and dead cartoon-fungus shows they mean business. Ain&#x27;t no fungus comin&#x27; &#x27;round here. What a great word...Fungus.</li>
            <li> so i has two problem toes my big one and pinky toe. i put 1 drop in the morning then one at night. it worked beautifuly the pinky toe is almost all gone with one bottle the big toe is about 40% gone. will defintly order more but just rember it take about 6 moths for it to heal and grow on new healthy nail. oh yeah i didnt cut either of the toe nails down.</li>
