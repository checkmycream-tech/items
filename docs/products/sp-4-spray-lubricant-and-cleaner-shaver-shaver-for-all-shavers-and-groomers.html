            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was able to return the razor but still have the lubricant.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you bought this product.</li>
            <li>do not pay more then $5  better to buy in bulk</li>
            <li>Shaver Saver has been around for many, many years.</li>
            <li>It lubricates better than it cleans though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>better than using my braun cleaning unit</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions and received the best shaves that I have received in recent months.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using this product for many years, to clean/protect his razor.</li>
            <li>Seems like could be more product in container.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;The can I received has a sticker on the cap that says &amp;#34;New with more lubricant&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to keep this razor in top condition</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find it at walmart but can&#x27;t now</li>
            <li>Please clean your razor according to its own directions, using provided brushes, etc.</li>
            <li>it cleans pretty good</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it is really doing any good but better than not doing anything.</li>
            <li>It works great with my old shaver.</li>
            <li>my old man says it works great</li>
            <li>It keeps his shaver in good condition, which is what he wants.</li>
            <li>Tried other products but like this one the best.</li>
            <li>but I wish it smelled more like the Norelco Jet Clean solution.</li>
            <li>lubricant has strong smell.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet, expect it to be fine as I have used it in the past\.</li>
            <li>Works well and doesn&#x27;t require a huge amount of spray.</li>
            <li>This Shaver Saver Cleaner/ Lubrication is a great product and does last for a while.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>After using it regularly I found it helps keep the razor running great.  </li>
            <li>This is clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I hope it extends the life of my blades and continues to give smooth shaves.</li>
            <li>Comes properly packaged and does the job great on any electric razor.</li>
            <li>Testing it, so far so good.</li>
            <li>It’s a simple product that’s very effective at serving its intended purpose of cleaning and lubricating your shaver.</li>
            <li>Remington  Shaver Saver is a very economical way to keep shaver heads clean .</li>
            <li>Getting this razor clean is super easy with just water and a touch of soap.</li>
            <li>Getting this razor clean is super easy with just water and a touch of soap.</li>
            <li>Improves significantly shaving quality and feel.</li>
            <li>keeps shaver lubed and clean</li>
            <li>keeps your shaver lubricated and clean, after you rinse it off under the spigot.  </li>
            <li>My husband has used this product for years to keep his shaver clean.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t brush it as clean as this spray gets it clean.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know how to clean my remington, until i bought this product.</li>
            <li>I use it every time i clean the razor and it helps the blade to run soothly.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clean off my electric razor or ease my shave.  </li>
            <li>Makes shaver clean after use.  </li>
            <li>Your razor manual tells you how to clean it.</li>
            <li>I think is anything special.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li>This lubricant helps reduce friction and so allows the blades to spin faster and stay cool.     </li>
            <li>Keeps the shaver clean and lubricated so the screen doesn&#x27;t wear out too quickly.  </li>
            <li>After two years, my shaver saver can is still over 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>It keeps all three electric shavers lubricated and operating smoothly which is good because they are models that are about twenty years old or older.  </li>
            <li>Just a quick spray on the shaving heads after blowing or shaking out the cut whiskers after each shave keeps my razor running in like-new condition.</li>
            <li>Cleans shaver quick.</li>
            <li>a good shaver lubricant but not cheap  not too many alternatives on market....</li>
            <li>Seems to be a decent product, I&#x27;m using it &amp; all seems OK.</li>
            <li>The fine dust kind of gets stuck in the shaver I use so be sure to get a small brush to clean it out.</li>
            <li>As long as it cleans and lubes my razor without having to tear it apart, I am good...</li>
            <li>A VERY SHAVING CREAM SMOOTH AND SOOTHING</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment</li>
            <li>A nice touch is the byproduct of the propellent, it cools of the razor head instantly.</li>
            <li>However, it does the same thing that the old stuff did, it just doesn&#x27;t smell as nice (not that I liked the old &amp;#34;Mennen&amp;#34; aftershave smell, but it was better than the new &amp;#34;lubricating oil&amp;#34; smell).</li>
            <li>If you can keep the razor clean and kept, it will last longer and will preform better.</li>
            <li>about the product is that the spray is broad and easy to use up quickly.</li>
            <li>My husband would rather replace heads than buy new because the older models are better designed and built.  </li>
            <li>This is a good lubricant for electric razors and I like the fact that it does not leave too much oil on the razor and it does not gunk it up like other oils.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do anything useful.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as offered.  </li>
            <li>The only way you can get it, as the Stores do not carry it any more.</li>
            <li>notice first the lemony odor when spraying, and if I keep trying to smell then I can detect a lubricant smell.</li>
            <li>I got the Braun at a very good price but regardless of what you pay for your shaver you want to keep it running like new and long lasting: This is the stuff!!!  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, for economical electric shaving, this stuff is the &amp;#34;Bee&#x27;s Knees&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>Using Shaver Saver to clean and lubricate the shaving cartridge, after a little blast of compressed air from a computer duster can, both before and after a shave provides me with the best shave and extends the life of the cartridge just as well, if not better, than the Braun products.  </li>
            <li>SP-5, this Shaver Saver used to be readily available, not too long ago, in most major department and drug stores but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case anymore.</li>
            <li>Remington  shaver saver does not leave a residue that I&#x27;ve seen with other brands, but instead leaves the shaver heads with a light (non-viscous) coating that helps the heads glide smoothly across my skin.</li>
            <li>It works but the smell of WD-40 is a bit strong, but the same results.  </li>
            <li>i read about products like this extending the life of razor blades and they certainly do.</li>
            <li>When my most recent can of spray began to run out after depleting my remaining inventory on hand, I began looking to purchase some new ones.</li>
            <li>It came in a completely different can than pictures, and with one use filled up the entire apartment with a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>REALLY WELL.</li>
            <li>and it really helped make it run smoother.</li>
            <li>we had to send for the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well.  </li>
            <li>It cleans it very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Remington for extending my Norelco blades.</li>
            <li>Sadly, much like the Remington Face Saver, Pre-Shave Powder Stick, Model</li>
            <li>This spray lubricant plus a facial powder stick also purchased from Amazon are both items I use routinely to ensure a smooth, non-irritating shave,</li>
            <li>, so did I am very staticky with it</li>
            <li>no competitors and only available online for some reason.</li>
            <li>If you use an electric razor cleaning and lubricating regularly really extends the life of the razor.</li>
            <li>It keeps your shaver clean, lubricates well with not too much gooey oil, and works in an instant.</li>
            <li>I give a quick shpritz once a week when I do a very thorough cleaning of the combs and blades, and everything seems to last longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as it&#x27;s available.  </li>
            <li>cleaned no better than warm water.</li>
            <li>I have a new shaver and wanted to extend the life of it as much as I could.</li>
            <li>so-so product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to clean my Braun shaver, since the Braun&#x27;s Clean &amp; Renew cleaning unit died and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to get a new unit since I&#x27;ve had the shaver quite a few years now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it on my hubby&#x27;s older razor</li>
            <li>A couple short, quick blast is all it takes.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The spray lubricant is  just fine as I expected.</li>
            <li>i shave my head also and notice a big improvement over other products in providing a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>A quick spray on the cutters after shaving, and the next time I use it, it runs like new.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a small paint brush as it covers more area in less time and gets out more shavings faster.</li>
            <li>Great lubricant for shavers and other small items.</li>
            <li>I brought this product with a new razor.</li>
            <li>I bought a Braun 3Series 320S-4 Shaver here at Amazon and another user commented on this razor that using Remington SP-4 Spray lubricant has protected his investment and keeps his electric shaver running like new...</li>
            <li>Keeps razor like new.</li>
            <li>This new stuff smells like an industrial oil (3 in 1 anyone?).</li>
            <li>At the same time, I&#x27;m saving a good deal of money on a new unity (hard to find) and cleansing fluids.  </li>
            <li>product, it was exactly the same when they both arrived.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Best thing, no shipping and less expensive than the online store brands.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it after every single shave, it works very well for me when I spray my razor about every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>My newest razor shows me a little &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; icon when it&#x27;s time to clean it, which is pretty much every 3 weeks or every other charge.</li>
            <li>I use to use a similar product that I bought locally but the product is no longer available locally.</li>
            <li>Does not eliminate the need for periodic thorough cleanings with a natural all purpose surface cleaner.</li>
            <li>The next shave is ready and it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>The blades are cleaned and \\&quot;lubed\\&quot; ready for the next shave!</li>
            <li>It makes my blades last much longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly thirty years.</li>
            <li>I had their old formula (had a hint of aftershave fragrance in it) stored for a number of years.</li>
            <li>; a razor, the spray is too wide and doesn&#x27;t have enough force to clean out hair.</li>
            <li>However, on a whim this evening, I took a very rare trip to Kmart where I just happened to find this product hanging from its product packaging among all of the other Remington products in the ‘Personal Care/HBA’ department, this Shaver Saver spray... for its gloriously-low MSRP to boot.</li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>I know a few people who try to duplicate what this does by using alcohol with a toothbrush (which is one of the ingredients of Shaver Saver) to clean the blades, then use WD-40 to lubricate them.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t not mean you can skip a proper cleaning and lubrication of your shaver.</li>
            <li>My first can isn&#x27;t empty yet and I&#x27;ve had it over a year.</li>
            <li>It is my experience that, on average, I have to replace blades and screens on my Remington electric shaver more frequently than once every 3 months; in fact, my last set while using Shaver Saver only lasted 3 weeks before holes began to open up on the screens.</li>
            <li>A little messy but effective</li>
            <li>On the contrary, I have never had a set of blades and screens last less than a full year before needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I use a small head tooth brush and cleaner to clean the guides and blades a couple times a month.</li>
            <li>fast last really a long time</li>
            <li>I bought this for an old friend who could not find it locally anymore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had purchased it an the old Fedco store here in the San Diego, CA area back in the day.</li>
            <li>Especially after you washed the blades out with scolding hot water and left them to dry.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used this for several years and finally bought it for my new unit.</li>
            <li>It has become increasingly hard to find anything to clean the razor heads.</li>
            <li>Although thankful that Amazon carries this product, I was further dismayed by the high prices I found on this site and others for either a single can or multiple ones.</li>

            <li> He was very pleased with it and said it was what he had been using for many years.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Another strong product from Remington!</li>
            <li> Keeps things clean and it even smells good.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff to spray on your shaver a couple times a week to keep it working fine and to give a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I was able to return the razor but still have the lubricant.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you bought this product.</li>
            <li> do not pay more then $5  better to buy in bulk</li>
            <li> Shaver Saver has been around for many, many years.</li>
            <li> It lubricates better than it cleans though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> better than using my braun cleaning unit</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions and received the best shaves that I have received in recent months.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using this product for many years, to clean/protect his razor.</li>
            <li> Seems like could be more product in container.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;The can I received has a sticker on the cap that says &amp;#34;New with more lubricant&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to keep this razor in top condition</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find it at walmart but can&#x27;t now</li>
            <li> Please clean your razor according to its own directions, using provided brushes, etc.</li>
            <li> it cleans pretty good</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it is really doing any good but better than not doing anything.</li>
            <li> It works great with my old shaver.</li>
            <li> my old man says it works great</li>
            <li> It keeps his shaver in good condition, which is what he wants.</li>
            <li> Tried other products but like this one the best.</li>
            <li> but I wish it smelled more like the Norelco Jet Clean solution.</li>
            <li> lubricant has strong smell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, expect it to be fine as I have used it in the past\.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t require a huge amount of spray.</li>
            <li> This Shaver Saver Cleaner/ Lubrication is a great product and does last for a while.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> After using it regularly I found it helps keep the razor running great.  </li>
            <li> This is clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I hope it extends the life of my blades and continues to give smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> Comes properly packaged and does the job great on any electric razor.</li>
            <li> Testing it, so far so good.</li>
            <li> It’s a simple product that’s very effective at serving its intended purpose of cleaning and lubricating your shaver.</li>
            <li> Remington  Shaver Saver is a very economical way to keep shaver heads clean .</li>
            <li> Getting this razor clean is super easy with just water and a touch of soap.</li>
            <li> Getting this razor clean is super easy with just water and a touch of soap.</li>
            <li> Improves significantly shaving quality and feel.</li>
            <li> keeps shaver lubed and clean</li>
            <li> keeps your shaver lubricated and clean, after you rinse it off under the spigot.  </li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for years to keep his shaver clean.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t brush it as clean as this spray gets it clean.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know how to clean my remington, until i bought this product.</li>
            <li> I use it every time i clean the razor and it helps the blade to run soothly.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clean off my electric razor or ease my shave.  </li>
            <li> Makes shaver clean after use.  </li>
            <li> Your razor manual tells you how to clean it.</li>
            <li> I think is anything special.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li> This lubricant helps reduce friction and so allows the blades to spin faster and stay cool.     </li>
            <li> Keeps the shaver clean and lubricated so the screen doesn&#x27;t wear out too quickly.  </li>
            <li> After two years, my shaver saver can is still over 2/3 full.</li>
            <li> It keeps all three electric shavers lubricated and operating smoothly which is good because they are models that are about twenty years old or older.  </li>
            <li> Just a quick spray on the shaving heads after blowing or shaking out the cut whiskers after each shave keeps my razor running in like-new condition.</li>
            <li> Cleans shaver quick.</li>
            <li> a good shaver lubricant but not cheap  not too many alternatives on market....</li>
            <li> Seems to be a decent product, I&#x27;m using it &amp; all seems OK.</li>
            <li> The fine dust kind of gets stuck in the shaver I use so be sure to get a small brush to clean it out.</li>
            <li> As long as it cleans and lubes my razor without having to tear it apart, I am good...</li>
            <li> A VERY SHAVING CREAM SMOOTH AND SOOTHING</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment</li>
            <li> A nice touch is the byproduct of the propellent, it cools of the razor head instantly.</li>
            <li> However, it does the same thing that the old stuff did, it just doesn&#x27;t smell as nice (not that I liked the old &amp;#34;Mennen&amp;#34; aftershave smell, but it was better than the new &amp;#34;lubricating oil&amp;#34; smell).</li>
            <li> If you can keep the razor clean and kept, it will last longer and will preform better.</li>
            <li> about the product is that the spray is broad and easy to use up quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband would rather replace heads than buy new because the older models are better designed and built.  </li>
            <li> This is a good lubricant for electric razors and I like the fact that it does not leave too much oil on the razor and it does not gunk it up like other oils.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything useful.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as offered.  </li>
            <li> The only way you can get it, as the Stores do not carry it any more.</li>
            <li> notice first the lemony odor when spraying, and if I keep trying to smell then I can detect a lubricant smell.</li>
            <li> I got the Braun at a very good price but regardless of what you pay for your shaver you want to keep it running like new and long lasting: This is the stuff!!!  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, for economical electric shaving, this stuff is the &amp;#34;Bee&#x27;s Knees&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Using Shaver Saver to clean and lubricate the shaving cartridge, after a little blast of compressed air from a computer duster can, both before and after a shave provides me with the best shave and extends the life of the cartridge just as well, if not better, than the Braun products.  </li>
            <li> SP-5, this Shaver Saver used to be readily available, not too long ago, in most major department and drug stores but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case anymore.</li>
            <li> Remington  shaver saver does not leave a residue that I&#x27;ve seen with other brands, but instead leaves the shaver heads with a light (non-viscous) coating that helps the heads glide smoothly across my skin.</li>
            <li> It works but the smell of WD-40 is a bit strong, but the same results.  </li>
            <li> i read about products like this extending the life of razor blades and they certainly do.</li>
            <li> When my most recent can of spray began to run out after depleting my remaining inventory on hand, I began looking to purchase some new ones.</li>
            <li> It came in a completely different can than pictures, and with one use filled up the entire apartment with a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> REALLY WELL.</li>
            <li> and it really helped make it run smoother.</li>
            <li> we had to send for the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> Worked very well.  </li>
            <li> It cleans it very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Remington for extending my Norelco blades.</li>
            <li> Sadly, much like the Remington Face Saver, Pre-Shave Powder Stick, Model</li>
            <li> This spray lubricant plus a facial powder stick also purchased from Amazon are both items I use routinely to ensure a smooth, non-irritating shave,</li>
            <li> , so did I am very staticky with it</li>
            <li> no competitors and only available online for some reason.</li>
            <li> If you use an electric razor cleaning and lubricating regularly really extends the life of the razor.</li>
            <li> It keeps your shaver clean, lubricates well with not too much gooey oil, and works in an instant.</li>
            <li> I give a quick shpritz once a week when I do a very thorough cleaning of the combs and blades, and everything seems to last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as it&#x27;s available.  </li>
            <li> cleaned no better than warm water.</li>
            <li> I have a new shaver and wanted to extend the life of it as much as I could.</li>
            <li> so-so product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to clean my Braun shaver, since the Braun&#x27;s Clean &amp; Renew cleaning unit died and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to get a new unit since I&#x27;ve had the shaver quite a few years now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it on my hubby&#x27;s older razor</li>
            <li> A couple short, quick blast is all it takes.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The spray lubricant is  just fine as I expected.</li>
            <li> i shave my head also and notice a big improvement over other products in providing a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> A quick spray on the cutters after shaving, and the next time I use it, it runs like new.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a small paint brush as it covers more area in less time and gets out more shavings faster.</li>
            <li> Great lubricant for shavers and other small items.</li>
            <li> I brought this product with a new razor.</li>
            <li> I bought a Braun 3Series 320S-4 Shaver here at Amazon and another user commented on this razor that using Remington SP-4 Spray lubricant has protected his investment and keeps his electric shaver running like new...</li>
            <li> Keeps razor like new.</li>
            <li> This new stuff smells like an industrial oil (3 in 1 anyone?).</li>
            <li> At the same time, I&#x27;m saving a good deal of money on a new unity (hard to find) and cleansing fluids.  </li>
            <li> product, it was exactly the same when they both arrived.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Best thing, no shipping and less expensive than the online store brands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it after every single shave, it works very well for me when I spray my razor about every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My newest razor shows me a little &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; icon when it&#x27;s time to clean it, which is pretty much every 3 weeks or every other charge.</li>
            <li> I use to use a similar product that I bought locally but the product is no longer available locally.</li>
            <li> Does not eliminate the need for periodic thorough cleanings with a natural all purpose surface cleaner.</li>
            <li> The next shave is ready and it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> The blades are cleaned and \\&quot;lubed\\&quot; ready for the next shave!</li>
            <li> It makes my blades last much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly thirty years.</li>
            <li> I had their old formula (had a hint of aftershave fragrance in it) stored for a number of years.</li>
            <li> ; a razor, the spray is too wide and doesn&#x27;t have enough force to clean out hair.</li>
            <li> However, on a whim this evening, I took a very rare trip to Kmart where I just happened to find this product hanging from its product packaging among all of the other Remington products in the ‘Personal Care/HBA’ department, this Shaver Saver spray... for its gloriously-low MSRP to boot.</li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> I know a few people who try to duplicate what this does by using alcohol with a toothbrush (which is one of the ingredients of Shaver Saver) to clean the blades, then use WD-40 to lubricate them.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t not mean you can skip a proper cleaning and lubrication of your shaver.</li>
            <li> My first can isn&#x27;t empty yet and I&#x27;ve had it over a year.</li>
            <li> It is my experience that, on average, I have to replace blades and screens on my Remington electric shaver more frequently than once every 3 months; in fact, my last set while using Shaver Saver only lasted 3 weeks before holes began to open up on the screens.</li>
            <li> A little messy but effective</li>
            <li> On the contrary, I have never had a set of blades and screens last less than a full year before needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I use a small head tooth brush and cleaner to clean the guides and blades a couple times a month.</li>
            <li> fast last really a long time</li>
            <li> I bought this for an old friend who could not find it locally anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had purchased it an the old Fedco store here in the San Diego, CA area back in the day.</li>
            <li> Especially after you washed the blades out with scolding hot water and left them to dry.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used this for several years and finally bought it for my new unit.</li>
            <li> It has become increasingly hard to find anything to clean the razor heads.</li>
            <li> Although thankful that Amazon carries this product, I was further dismayed by the high prices I found on this site and others for either a single can or multiple ones.</li>
            <li> It might just be my experience, but it seems clear to me that Shaver Saver is having a corrosive effect on blades, screens and perhaps even other electric shaver components.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, a single can of this stuff will last me MONTHS, whereas each of the Braun cleaning solution tanks will last maybe a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> and I can see my shaver will work and last a long time-</li>
            <li> Having used this product previously, I knew to expect that it would do well what I expected it to do, namely, lubricate my electric shaver so it performs to my high expectations.</li>
            <li> So, I clean it, leave it all open to dry, and come back later and spray this Shaver Saver on the foil, cutting head blades, and the trimmer, put it all together, let it run for 10 seconds, and put it away until the next shave.</li>
            <li> So, I clean it, leave it all open to dry, and come back later and spray this Shaver Saver on the foil, cutting head blades, and the trimmer, put it all together, let it run for 10 seconds, and put it away until the next shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 30 years and still get it at my local military exchange.  </li>
            <li> Usually 2 to 3 times a week seems to be sufficient and your shaver will continue to perfrom like new.</li>
            <li> I noticed about a week later for under $4 plus tax for the same little 3+</li>
            <li> Other lubricants like WD-40 have such spray straws.</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time, all you need is a squirt, and that does the job.</li>
            <li> use as directed; on a cleaned and dry shaver foil and heads, then reassemble and run the razor for 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> cleans and lubricates just as described... has a slightly awkward scent, but other than that I love this product.</li>
            <li> Spray cans of lubricant could use a straw in the nozzle to direct the spray to a small area.</li>
            <li> Actually, my other half loves it &amp; we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, a single can used after perhaps every few shaves or so (rather than after each shave as recommended by the product directions) seems to last forever.  </li>
            <li> Not much.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time, works as expected, cheaper than competitors.  </li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> You can add a step of blowing out harder to reach places with compressed air if you</li>
            <li> I do this each time I recharge my shaver to keep the cutting heads sharp and providing me with a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The next day when I grab the shaver and use it right under my nose, I don&#x27;t smell anything unpleasant.</li>
            <li> keeps the foils and cutters sharp.</li>
            <li> The packaging is different but seems to be what I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> Does what it claims to do, which is to keep electric razor blades sharp.</li>
            <li> and it does it extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Works on my other electric products as well.</li>
            <li> This razor is wet-dry and even has an ultrasonic cleaning mode by holding the power on button down for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I do this once or twice a week.ng mode by holding the power on button down for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> It also is less messy than rubbing oil on with fingers.</li>
            <li> I use this about every 2-3 weeks, a little spray on the blades, foil, and trimmer.</li>
            <li> A very slight lemony scent, and a slight lubricant scent.</li>
            <li> I switched to an electric shaver a few years ago and was introduced to the \\&quot;Shaver Saver\\&quot; as something that would lengthen the life of my shaver&#x27;s replaceable parts (combs and blades).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money or time to buy and discard.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the Shaver Saver for just a few dollars a can.  </li>
            <li> Have not had any trouble with my Braun razor since using this product.  </li>
            <li> Why use a messy oil to lubricate your electric shaver if you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
            <li> It would waste a lot of the can even trying.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday before shaving with my electric razor.</li>
            <li> Oils and other shaver lubricants are real messy.  </li>
            <li> Instead of using the expensive Braun cleaning &amp; lubrication solution tanks that must frequently be replaced, I have been using this stuff exclusively for years for a small fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the Remington product does spray and does smell somewhat lemon-like, it is not a particularly good cleaning product and is not very good at lubricating the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not much competition in shaver cleaners/lubricants, and if there was, I&#x27;d want to give it a try over the Remington product.</li>
            <li> showed small amount of lubricating improvement.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past.</li>
            <li> I would usually go through three or four.</li>
            <li> maybe some Norelco items but hard too find...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one product that is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> hard to find item, and need to disinfect the electric razor, an lubricate them as well, this works,</li>
            <li> Remington recommends that you replace your blades at least once a year.</li>
            <li> Works well with getting rid of facial oils that build up on the foil and cutting block.</li>
            <li> Simply remove the foil and spray the cutting heads with this Remington product.</li>
            <li> at least this item does not leave any bad smell afterward.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the razor I purchased that required this lubricant didn&#x27;t pan out for me.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I am using this instead of Braun&#x27; expensive cleaner and lube machine and tubs.</li>
            <li> knew I should lube the cutting heads but didn&#x27;t notice it at the store.&lt;br /&gt;would</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just a quick spray on the shaving heads after blowing or shaking out the cut whiskers after each shave keeps my razor running in like-new condition.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Walm**t but can no longer find it.  Works great on my husband&#x27;s hair clippers. He has used this product for several years.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT CLEANS AND LUBRICATES AN ELECTRIC SHAVER REALLY WELL.</li>
            <li> Used this for a while. The oil lubes up the shaver well and the jet of air blows the crud out of it. Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  This is our third order of this product.  It keeps all three electric shavers lubricated and operating smoothly which is good because they are models that are about twenty years old or older.  My husband would rather replace heads than buy new because the older models are better designed and built.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This Shaver Saver Cleaner/ Lubrication is a great product and does last for a while.  It works best with a water proof/ resistant shaver.  You dont need to buy a self-cleaning shaver if you get a water proof one and use the Shaver Saver.</li>
            <li> This is a good lubricant for electric razors and I like the fact that it does not leave too much oil on the razor and it does not gunk it up like other oils. It is very easy to use and it lubricates effectively. This lubricant helps reduce friction and so allows the blades to spin faster and stay cool.     I don&#x27;t really use it after every single shave, it works very well for me when I spray my razor about every 2 weeks. It lasts a while and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Cleans shaver quick. No mess.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  Now if find that CVS purchased Longs Drug Stores and CVS no longer is carrying this product. Neither is Rite Aid or Walgreens.  This was the only way I could get this product and I am delighted that I can still get it.</li>
            <li> works well...keeps shaver lubed and clean</li>
            <li> Does what&#x27;s described.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product - After trying everything to keep the blades on my electric shaver clean at least this item does not leave any bad smell afterward. Especially after you washed the blades out with scolding hot water and left them to dry. No need for this procedure any longer.  Well worth the investment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a while for clippers and shavers. I think I used to get it at Target, but ordered my last can off Amazon. Has always worked well.</li>
            <li> It has become increasingly hard to find anything to clean the razor heads. If you can keep the razor clean and kept, it will last longer and will preform better.</li>
            <li> Instead of using the expensive Braun cleaning &amp; lubrication solution tanks that must frequently be replaced, I have been using this stuff exclusively for years for a small fraction of the cost.  Furthermore, a single can of this stuff will last me MONTHS, whereas each of the Braun cleaning solution tanks will last maybe a couple of weeks.  Using Shaver Saver to clean and lubricate the shaving cartridge, after a little blast of compressed air from a computer duster can, both before and after a shave provides me with the best shave and extends the life of the cartridge just as well, if not better, than the Braun products.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, for economical electric shaving, this stuff is the &amp;#34;Bee&#x27;s Knees&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I switched to an electric shaver a few years ago and was introduced to the \\&quot;Shaver Saver\\&quot; as something that would lengthen the life of my shaver&#x27;s replaceable parts (combs and blades).  I give a quick shpritz once a week when I do a very thorough cleaning of the combs and blades, and everything seems to last longer. It will be quite a while until I need to replace the combs and blades and I attribute that to the Shaver Saver.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I also use it on my Hair Clippers. Very easy to use. I use to use a similar product that I bought locally but the product is no longer available locally. I found this product by accident on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> keeps your shaver lubricated and clean, after you rinse it off under the spigot.  keeps the foils and cutters sharp.</li>
            <li> it cleans pretty good</li>
            <li> The product works good; just as advertised. I like the fact that it has low order and does not leaving an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the razor I purchased that required this lubricant didn&#x27;t pan out for me.  I was able to return the razor but still have the lubricant.</li>
            <li> I bought this for an old friend who could not find it locally anymore. He was very pleased with it and said it was what he had been using for many years. It keeps his shaver in good condition, which is what he wants. Although the photo differs from the Remington Shaver 81626 3.8 oz. product, it was exactly the same when they both arrived.</li>
            <li> Only used it a couple of times, but seems to work well, as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted. The packaging is different but seems to be what I&#x27;ve had in the past.  Use extends the time between battery charges.  And it reduces wear on the screen.</li>
            <li> My cleaning unit broke after 3 years or so of use and I was in search of a replacement when I came across this lubricant. I bought it and have been using it in lieu of the cleaning unit. IT DOES THE JOB!! At the same time, I&#x27;m saving a good deal of money on a new unity (hard to find) and cleansing fluids.  Warmly recommended.</li>
            <li> I brought this product with a new razor. After using it regularly I found it helps keep the razor running great.  &lt;br /&gt;Used it on my hubby&#x27;s older razor and it really helped make it run smoother. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with my MS2-200BPT Shaver. I saw a review that said that it kept the shaver running well. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1 month and I couldn&#x27;t agree more. A quick spray on the cutters after shaving, and the next time I use it, it runs like new. I can tell the difference in the smoothness and speed of the shaver since I&#x27;ve started using it. As a bonus, it seems to last quite a while. Another strong product from Remington!</li>
            <li> Tried to get another brand of lubricant in our local store but NOOOO  we had to send for the real stuff.  He&#x27;s happy so that makes me happy :)</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for quite some time. Does what it claims to do, which is to keep electric razor blades sharp. Remington recommends that you replace your blades at least once a year. With this product, I can extend it to once every two years.</li>
            <li> Product as described.&lt;br /&gt;I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> cleans and lubricates just as described... has a slightly awkward scent, but other than that I love this product. I use this in a WHAL &amp;#34;Balder&amp;#34; trimmer, and shave about 2x per week</li>
            <li> A must have with razors, gotta keep &#x27;re lubes/clean.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for years to keep his shaver clean.  We can only get it online now.</li>
            <li> This lubricant and cleaner is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found to keep my shaver working at its best.  It does not get gummy and you can hear the shaver speed increase as you spray on the running blades.</li>
            <li> cleaned no better than warm water. showed small amount of lubricating improvement. Tried to find Sterling lube, but to no avail. That stuff was the _hit!</li>
            <li> A good in between cleaner. Does not eliminate the need for periodic thorough cleanings with a natural all purpose surface cleaner. I use a small head tooth brush and cleaner to clean the guides and blades a couple times a month. I feel the lubricant does help to keep the blades sharper longer.</li>
            <li> Works well with getting rid of facial oils that build up on the foil and cutting block.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> I switched to an electric Shaver this year after I was put on blood thinners by my doctor following surgery for occlusion of my femoral artery and nicked myself shaving and had a blood bath.  I bought a Braun 3Series 320S-4 Shaver here at Amazon and another user commented on this razor that using Remington SP-4 Spray lubricant has protected his investment and keeps his electric shaver running like new...he&#x27;s right!  I got the Braun at a very good price but regardless of what you pay for your shaver you want to keep it running like new and long lasting: This is the stuff!!!  I can&#x27;t brush it as clean as this spray gets it clean.  You&#x27;ll be glad you bought this product.</li>
            <li> a good shaver lubricant but not cheap  not too many alternatives on market....maybe some Norelco items but hard too find...do not pay more then $5  better to buy in bulk</li>
            <li> Worked very well.  Could not find this in my area.  Even sent some to my grandson.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything useful.  Don&#x27;t waste the money or time to buy and discard.  It is a good idea, it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington&#x27;s Shaver Saver for 20 years. It keeps your shaver clean, lubricates well with not too much gooey oil, and works in an instant. I use a Remington MS2-100 Microscreen 2, and after a Shaver Saver treatment the shaver glides smoother over my face and shaves quicker and closer. A treatment seems to last for a while and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to use it every day. Usually 2 to 3 times a week seems to be sufficient and your shaver will continue to perfrom like new.</li>
            <li> Shaver Saver has been around for many, many years. I have a new shaver and wanted to extend the life of it as much as I could. I hadn&#x27;t used this for several years and finally bought it for my new unit. WOW! After simple cleaning of the shaver after each use, I just spray it on the blades, run the shaver for 5 seconds and done. The next shave is ready and it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to. The blades are cleaned and \\&quot;lubed\\&quot; ready for the next shave! Do it! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Great lubricant for shavers and other small items.</li>
            <li> It works great with my old shaver. It cleans it very well. It even caused it to shave a lot closer.</li>
            <li> just what we wanted.couldn&#x60;t find it here</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past. It does a great job of lubricating my blades and giving me a great shave. It makes my blades last much longer. Thanks Remington for extending my Norelco blades.</li>
            <li> I have started using it, but my skin became irritated. This might be the blades and had nothing to do with the lubricant that I applied</li>
            <li> This product is two in one...it cleans debris and facial oils your whiskers leave in the cutter, and it lubricates the blades for longer life...and it does it extremely well.  I&#x27;ve used it for 30 years and still get it at my local military exchange.  I know a few people who try to duplicate what this does by using alcohol with a toothbrush (which is one of the ingredients of Shaver Saver) to clean the blades, then use WD-40 to lubricate them.  It works but the smell of WD-40 is a bit strong, but the same results.  I use Shaver Saver on both Braun and Remington.  Now, Braun provides shaver oil in bottles with some of their shavers, that is only helpful for the foil, not the cutters unless you use a brush and put the oil on the cutters.  I prefer the Shaver Saver for just a few dollars a can.  It&#x27;s one product that is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this aerosol spray cleaner for 20+ years. It’s a simple product that’s very effective at serving its intended purpose of cleaning and lubricating your shaver. As other reviewers have noted, a single can used after perhaps every few shaves or so (rather than after each shave as recommended by the product directions) seems to last forever.  When my most recent can of spray began to run out after depleting my remaining inventory on hand, I began looking to purchase some new ones. Sadly, much like the Remington Face Saver, Pre-Shave Powder Stick, Model SP-5, this Shaver Saver used to be readily available, not too long ago, in most major department and drug stores but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case anymore. Although thankful that Amazon carries this product, I was further dismayed by the high prices I found on this site and others for either a single can or multiple ones. However, on a whim this evening, I took a very rare trip to Kmart where I just happened to find this product hanging from its product packaging among all of the other Remington products in the ‘Personal Care/HBA’ department, this Shaver Saver spray... for its gloriously-low MSRP to boot. Hallelujah!</li>
            <li> knew I should lube the cutting heads but didn&#x27;t notice it at the store.&lt;br /&gt;would have rated it higher but knew from past experience it should make a difference</li>
            <li> This is good stuff to spray on your shaver a couple times a week to keep it working fine and to give a close smooth shave. A couple short, quick blast is all it takes.  Not much.  I do it after I brush out all the whiskers.  I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as it&#x27;s available.  Cheaper here than in local stores.</li>
            <li> It works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> It works as described. It lubricates better than it cleans though. The fine dust kind of gets stuck in the shaver I use so be sure to get a small brush to clean it out. I would recommend a small paint brush as it covers more area in less time and gets out more shavings faster. I would even try a can of air to blow it out.</li>
            <li> Actually, my other half loves it &amp; we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally &amp; we looked, just cleaners that he wasn&#x27;t real happy with.  Just a hint, it works well on stubborn zippers too!</li>
            <li> Keeps razor like new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. Don&#x27;t know if it is really doing any good but better than not doing anything.</li>
            <li> The spray lubricant is  just fine as I expected. Would recommend it.  I have used them before but ran out. George</li>
            <li> This spray lubricant plus a facial powder stick also purchased from Amazon are both items I use routinely to ensure a smooth, non-irritating shave,</li>
            <li> Have been using this lubricant and cleaner for years.  Does an excellent job of keeping my electric razor in&lt;br /&gt;the best working order.  Have not had any trouble with my Braun razor since using this product.  Only&lt;br /&gt;complaint about the product is that the spray is broad and easy to use up quickly.</li>
            <li> It work good. Didn&#x27;t know how to clean my remington, until i bought this product. Works on my other electric products as well.</li>
            <li> My shaver run smoother now.</li>
            <li> Why use a messy oil to lubricate your electric shaver if you don&#x27;t have to? Simply remove the foil and spray the cutting heads with this Remington product. I do this each time I recharge my shaver to keep the cutting heads sharp and providing me with a smooth shave. My first can isn&#x27;t empty yet and I&#x27;ve had it over a year.</li>
            <li> It is what I have been looking for theist 3 months at all kinds of store.one of the stores tolde to try amoOn, so did I am very staticky with it</li>
            <li> Thank you for product......all arrived well.......v.ricks</li>
            <li> Remington&#x27;s Shaver Saver is only a so-so product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to clean my Braun shaver, since the Braun&#x27;s Clean &amp; Renew cleaning unit died and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to get a new unit since I&#x27;ve had the shaver quite a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;While the Remington product does spray and does smell somewhat lemon-like, it is not a particularly good cleaning product and is not very good at lubricating the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not much competition in shaver cleaners/lubricants, and if there was, I&#x27;d want to give it a try over the Remington product.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores. Bought if for my Dad. Used it and said it was good stuff. Best thing, no shipping and less expensive than the online store brands.</li>
            <li> Improves significantly shaving quality and feel. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> this product works great for electric shavers, for both cleaning &amp; lubricating them!</li>
            <li> i dont have an electric shaver but simply spray this on my razor after shaking off the rinse water and&lt;br /&gt;tap drying. i read about products like this extending the life of razor blades and they certainly do. i get about&lt;br /&gt;3 wks from mine.</li>
            <li> better than using my braun cleaning unit</li>
            <li> Over decades of use and non-use, I have had occasion to test four cans of Remington SP-4 Shaver Saver. It is my experience that, on average, I have to replace blades and screens on my Remington electric shaver more frequently than once every 3 months; in fact, my last set while using Shaver Saver only lasted 3 weeks before holes began to open up on the screens. On the contrary, I have never had a set of blades and screens last less than a full year before needing to be replaced. It might just be my experience, but it seems clear to me that Shaver Saver is having a corrosive effect on blades, screens and perhaps even other electric shaver components.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, works as expected, cheaper than competitors.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Since Amazon split my order of two items for shipment I had to pay additional shipping charges through yet another supplier just to get the Shaver Saver.  Subtotal of Items:  1 ea. Shaver Saver was $7.68 (appeared to be a larger can than local retail; no description of size was indicated and the picture misled me!), Shipping &amp; Handling:  $5.95, Total for this Order:   $13.63.  Darn!!  Walmart had it back in stock I noticed about a week later for under $4 plus tax for the same little 3+ ounce can.</li>
            <li> works well, have used beore</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions and received the best shaves that I have received in recent months.  Tried other products but like this one the best.</li>
            <li> I think is anything special.</li>
            <li> Testing it, so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff.  It cleans, lubes, smells great.  Oils and other shaver lubricants are real messy.  This is clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have gotten closer shaves since using this after cleaning my razor. I hope it extends the life of my blades and continues to give smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> Great product no competitors and only available online for some reason.</li>
            <li> Exactly as offered.  Good deal.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a decent product, I&#x27;m using it &amp; all seems OK.</li>
            <li> Cleans well. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Keeps the shaver clean and lubricated so the screen doesn&#x27;t wear out too quickly.  Been using this brand for 25 years!</li>
            <li> Get some in will bring your razor back.</li>
            <li> Got for an elderly friend, as we could not find anything locally.  He&#x27;s been using this product for many years, to clean/protect his razor.</li>
            <li> The only way you can get it, as the Stores do not carry it any more.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else! Comes properly packaged and does the job great on any electric razor.</li>
            <li> This can does wonders- it is a great lubricant and I can see my shaver will work and last a long time-</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone that has an electric razor. I&#x27;ve had the same screen and blade for a year now. I would usually go through three or four.</li>
            <li> Works great, a noticeable difference when used, minimizes wearing!</li>
            <li> Price was low and I didn&#x27;t look at shipping costs.  Seems like could be more product in container.  Does help to lubricate shaver and seems to be extending the life of the foil.</li>
            <li> hard to find item, and need to disinfect the electric razor, an lubricate them as well, this works, fast last really a long time</li>
            <li> A Must have for any Electric Hair Care users .</li>
            <li> I buy a can of this lubricant about every four years. Works well and doesn&#x27;t require a huge amount of spray. I use it every time i clean the razor and it helps the blade to run soothly. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I looked for this products in several stores in my area. Only found it online. If you use an electric razor cleaning and lubricating regularly really extends the life of the razor.</li>
            <li> I am using this instead of Braun&#x27; expensive cleaner and lube machine and tubs. It can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, it took over a week for the vendor to deliver.</li>
            <li> Having used this product previously, I knew to expect that it would do well what I expected it to do, namely, lubricate my electric shaver so it performs to my high expectations.</li>
            <li> I would give this a zero if I could.  It came in a completely different can than pictures, and with one use filled up the entire apartment with a strong chemical smell.  It didn&#x27;t clean off my electric razor or ease my shave.  My dogs and I were both running around sneezing every time I used it.  I eventually just threw it away.  If anyone could recommend one that actually works I would appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Bought to lubricate an electric shaver.  It sprays on and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel.  Does the job and I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for years but I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  It is excellent to help extend the life of your shaver.  It should be noted that this product helps extend the life of your shaver between proper cleaning and lubrications but it doesn&#x27;t not mean you can skip a proper cleaning and lubrication of your shaver. I personally use it after every time I use my shavers.</li>
            <li> works well with a norelco</li>
            <li> Best deal of all shaver lubriants!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly thirty years. It is getting harder to find. A very good balance of lubricant, cleaner and scent.  It also is less messy than rubbing oil on with fingers. A nice touch is the byproduct of the propellent, it cools of the razor head instantly.</li>
            <li> Remington  Shaver Saver is a very economical way to keep shaver heads clean . I use the spray twice a week cause i shave my head also and notice a big improvement over other products in providing a nice, close shave. Remington  shaver saver does not leave a residue that I&#x27;ve seen with other brands, but instead leaves the shaver heads with a light (non-viscous) coating that helps the heads glide smoothly across my skin.</li>
            <li> Spray cans of lubricant could use a straw in the nozzle to direct the spray to a small area. Other lubricants like WD-40 have such spray straws.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I am always buying it to provide excellent lubrication to my shaver; I believe that it extends the life of the shaver.</li>
            <li> only giving it a 4 star rating because i don&#x27;t use it. my old man says it works great but i myself do not know</li>
            <li> Makes shaver clean after use.  Very good</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, expect it to be fine as I have used it in the past\.</li>
            <li> This Shaver Saver is very good to lubercate and clean you razor aor electric razor, it is good for both, and smells good also. It lasts a very long time, all you need is a squirt, and that does the job. Irecommend the Shaver Saver, Jim in Ohio.</li>
            <li> 2 year update: After two years, my shaver saver can is still over 2/3 full. I use this about every 2-3 weeks, a little spray on the blades, foil, and trimmer. My newest razor shows me a little &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; icon when it&#x27;s time to clean it, which is pretty much every 3 weeks or every other charge. This one can will probably last me 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;The can I received has a sticker on the cap that says &amp;#34;New with more lubricant&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice first the lemony odor when spraying, and if I keep trying to smell then I can detect a lubricant smell. If you use it at arms length and aren&#x27;t trying to bend over and smell it, you may not ever notice the lubricant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use as directed; on a cleaned and dry shaver foil and heads, then reassemble and run the razor for 10 seconds. The next day when I grab the shaver and use it right under my nose, I don&#x27;t smell anything unpleasant. A very slight lemony scent, and a slight lubricant scent. It&#x27;s barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot imagine anyone trying to use this to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; a razor, the spray is too wide and doesn&#x27;t have enough force to clean out hair. It would waste a lot of the can even trying. Please clean your razor according to its own directions, using provided brushes, etc. IF it is wet-dry then use water and a touch of soap as directed. Your razor manual tells you how to clean it. You can add a step of blowing out harder to reach places with compressed air if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a problem cleaning my razors. I got this because my Panasonic Arc3 ES-LT41-K http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES-LT41-K-Electric-Flexible-Pivoting/dp/B005DKKBRY doesn&#x27;t have any directions mentioning lubrication at all. The similar ES-LT41 products use cleaning cartridges which would lubricate it while cleaning. I wanted to keep this razor in top condition and so I wanted to add a lubricating step to my maintenance. This razor is wet-dry and even has an ultrasonic cleaning mode by holding the power on button down for a few seconds. Getting this razor clean is super easy with just water and a touch of soap. So, I clean it, leave it all open to dry, and come back later and spray this Shaver Saver on the foil, cutting head blades, and the trimmer, put it all together, let it run for 10 seconds, and put it away until the next shave. I do this once or twice a week.ng mode by holding the power on button down for a few seconds. Getting this razor clean is super easy with just water and a touch of soap.

            <li> Works great. Makes shaver last longer.</li>
            <li> A VERY SHAVING CREAM SMOOTH AND SOOTHING</li>
            <li> A little messy but effective</li>
            <li> good for lubing up the shaver</li>
            <li> lubricant has strong smell.</li>
            <li> Another great Remington product.  Keeps things clean and it even smells good.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job lubing my electric razor.  No issues.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday before shaving with my electric razor.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and it is easy to use but I wish it smelled more like the Norelco Jet Clean solution.</li>
            <li> this stuff helps keep your razor heads lasting longer....I used to be able to find it at walmart but can&#x27;t now</li>
            <li> I have used this for years with my Norelco shavers with good results. Faster, quieter shaves and long-lasting cutters.</li>
            <li> I had their old formula (had a hint of aftershave fragrance in it) stored for a number of years. I finally ran out. I had purchased it an the old Fedco store here in the San Diego, CA area back in the day. This new stuff smells like an industrial oil (3 in 1 anyone?). However, it does the same thing that the old stuff did, it just doesn&#x27;t smell as nice (not that I liked the old &amp;#34;Mennen&amp;#34; aftershave smell, but it was better than the new &amp;#34;lubricating oil&amp;#34; smell). As long as it cleans and lubes my razor without having to tear it apart, I am good...</li>
            <li> great for my Norelco shaver. Runs cooler and faster</li>
