            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I love smoke, but as a seller and a user I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to any beginner tanners or anyone with fair skin.</li>
            <li>really dissapointed because if it didn&#x27;t do that it was the perfect color!</li>
            <li>The product smells nice and covers well but doesn&#x27;t work to my expectations.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about the orange staining on my hands (even after wiping my hands with a baby wipe after applying the lotion).</li>
            <li>kind.</li>
            <li>This has a great smell doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy and tans you quick.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is by far the BEST lotion out there.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried many lotions but this is by far the best i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>i honestly am wondering if i didnt get the right product i see all good reviews.</li>
            <li>Just wash your hands immediately and you will be just fine!</li>
            <li>I am very light skinned, and</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it,</li>
            <li>Also make sure you wash your hands after your apply it, it will leave your hands a orange color.</li>
            <li>This seemed more to me like a self tanner.</li>
            <li>For those who love self tanners, mystic or airbrush will love this lotion because it contains a bit of self tanner in it.</li>
            <li>I love the color that it provides.  </li>
            <li>You need to make sure you rub it in well.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion because of the bronzers.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have a smell after tanning, not sticky, thats why its not a problem not take a shower up to 4-7 hours, to have a better tan.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this lotion and received it in about 2 days with free shipping!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion...</li>
            <li>I just keep buying more.</li>
            <li>i absolutly love it.  </li>
            <li>Seller did an AWESOME job getting out my product the next day.</li>
            <li>Nevwe tried this product before but its on the top list for tanning lotions</li>
            <li>It smells okay, but when you apply it make sure to exfoliate BEFORE tanning and rub in well.</li>
            <li>Literally:)</li>
            <li>It was more of a hint of orange.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you rub it in all the way and to either wear gloves or wipe hands off before tanning</li>
            <li>I was better off using no lotion</li>
            <li>I would say smoke is in my top 3 of favorites.</li>
            <li>Definately allows alot more oxygen in to get a better tan.</li>
            <li>It also gets streaky easily since it doesnt go on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered faster than i had expected and it worked great!</li>
            <li>so it MUST be good haha</li>
            <li>be sure to clean your hands after every application to avoid orange stains though.  </li>
            <li>It has a light scent and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>, it is because this is designed for advanced tanners.</li>
            <li>I was a light bronze</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for such a great product!</li>
            <li>I usually tan at night, so I just take my morning shower and that works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Now I just spray the cleaner that I clean the tanning bed with on my hands and wipe them off before I get in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>and the next morning i had a nice healthly glow :)&lt;</li>
            <li>But really wipe them with it, over and over to make sure you got it off.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin soft and with a great tan. :)</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite bronzer.</li>
            <li>This lotion got me tan quick</li>
            <li>Bottom line: a great lotion for the experienced tanner who wants to up their tan to the next level of dark.</li>
            <li>The results you get from this is unbelievable and it smells really good too, GET IT!</li>
            <li>The only thing nice bout</li>
            <li>i dont look orange and my skin is soft its a great lotion and the only one i will use because i know it works!</li>
            <li>It is well worth the $....</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re golden..</li>
            <li>well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>it gets you a nice brown color in a short amount of time</li>
            <li>and it will be noticeable right away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and expected a little more color out of this product then what it has produced over many tanning sessions.</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t burn, tingle or make your skin cool, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>and the shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It does give you a instant tan, but if you forget to apply it in a place you will be able to see.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do exactly what the bottle says it does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of lotions, and decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on ...</li>
            <li>The first day I used it</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>and I have used So many different types of lotions.</li>
            <li>that you turn orange looking...not a nice colour compared to other lotions i have used.  </li>
            <li>i liked this tanning lotion at first because it ggets you dark fast.</li>
            <li>I work at a tanning salon myself and let me tell you these lotions do run pretty high in price.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Their is so much bronzers in there</li>
            <li>It leaves me with a brown color that looks real.  </li>
            <li>Also, you really need to wash it off your hands and from underneath your fingernails, or they will turn an orange/brown color from the excess lotion that is on them.  </li>
            <li>really see that this lotion helps speed up my tanning process.  </li>
            <li>This lotion worked well but was very orange and made my hands change color.</li>
            <li>I dont even think its a real tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>last long i love it !</li>
            <li>I have tried other lotions, and I haven&#x27;t found one good enough to switch to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s kind of an orangy, spray-tan looking color that doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>I purchased from this seller and it arrived super early and was completely legit</li>
            <li>I have a pretty good base tan going, but am naturally very light without tanning, which may be why this product wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I thought id buy this, it seemed like it had decent reviews.  </li>
            <li>My older sister got me into this stuff.</li>
            <li>good result u can see after at least 1 hour!</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t bathe directly after using it, so that way the color really shows.  </li>
            <li>Plus, you got to make sure you spread it evenly or you will notice uneven tan.  </li>
            <li>very natural (u r not going to look like orange chiken)).</li>
            <li>First off ive tried numerous tanning lotions out there.  </li>
            <li>the first use and only 10 min in the bed</li>
            <li>first off all when i ordered it there was a shipping charge i had second thoughts should have not bought it then.</li>
            <li>The initial scent is kind of orangey/citrussy which I found a little ironic, since it&#x27;s the same effect it had on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who has a hard time tanning as this lotion is white and lightweight, it goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>No orange color, looks natural.</li>
            <li>It darkens my skin considerably when I use it in a tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally olive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning on and off for several years and been tanning consistently since summer of last year.</li>
            <li>With this lotion, I feel like you&#x27;re not really getting a tan, just a quick blast of color that won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that this lotion will turn someone VERY dark.  </li>
            <li>when you get out of the tanning bed it barely smells like you have been in it.</li>
            <li>Makes you dark fast!</li>
            <li>I started using this lotion after already having a pretty good base tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with streaking or orange spots because I already have a pretty good base tan.</li>
            <li>When you first apply it the scent is light and fruity but seriously has a slight \\&quot;smokey\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does get pretty orangey, I would only suggest this to tanners who are around a medium to dark level, and with a olive based skin color.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>maybe this works better on people with naturally dark skin who tan, and I&#x27;d imagine it would give you a painless boost, but if you&#x27;re naturally pale like me, DON&#x27;T do it!</li>
            <li>It gives you a fast dark tan.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I bought this lotion was cause it said that it gives you a rich and dark tan after a few times.</li>

            <li> Bottom line: a great lotion for the experienced tanner who wants to up their tan to the next level of dark.</li>
            <li> The results you get from this is unbelievable and it smells really good too, GET IT!</li>
            <li> The only thing nice bout</li>
            <li> i dont look orange and my skin is soft its a great lotion and the only one i will use because i know it works!</li>
            <li> It is well worth the $....</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re golden..</li>
            <li> well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> it gets you a nice brown color in a short amount of time</li>
            <li> and it will be noticeable right away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and expected a little more color out of this product then what it has produced over many tanning sessions.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t burn, tingle or make your skin cool, which I really like.  </li>
            <li> and the shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It does give you a instant tan, but if you forget to apply it in a place you will be able to see.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do exactly what the bottle says it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of lotions, and decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on ...</li>
            <li> The first day I used it</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> and I have used So many different types of lotions.</li>
            <li> that you turn orange looking...not a nice colour compared to other lotions i have used.  </li>
            <li> i liked this tanning lotion at first because it ggets you dark fast.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon myself and let me tell you these lotions do run pretty high in price.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> Their is so much bronzers in there</li>
            <li> It leaves me with a brown color that looks real.  </li>
            <li> Also, you really need to wash it off your hands and from underneath your fingernails, or they will turn an orange/brown color from the excess lotion that is on them.  </li>
            <li> really see that this lotion helps speed up my tanning process.  </li>
            <li> This lotion worked well but was very orange and made my hands change color.</li>
            <li> I dont even think its a real tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> last long i love it !</li>
            <li> I have tried other lotions, and I haven&#x27;t found one good enough to switch to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s kind of an orangy, spray-tan looking color that doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased from this seller and it arrived super early and was completely legit</li>
            <li> I have a pretty good base tan going, but am naturally very light without tanning, which may be why this product wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I thought id buy this, it seemed like it had decent reviews.  </li>
            <li> My older sister got me into this stuff.</li>
            <li> good result u can see after at least 1 hour!</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t bathe directly after using it, so that way the color really shows.  </li>
            <li> Plus, you got to make sure you spread it evenly or you will notice uneven tan.  </li>
            <li> very natural (u r not going to look like orange chiken)).</li>
            <li> First off ive tried numerous tanning lotions out there.  </li>
            <li> the first use and only 10 min in the bed</li>
            <li> first off all when i ordered it there was a shipping charge i had second thoughts should have not bought it then.</li>
            <li> The initial scent is kind of orangey/citrussy which I found a little ironic, since it&#x27;s the same effect it had on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has a hard time tanning as this lotion is white and lightweight, it goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> No orange color, looks natural.</li>
            <li> It darkens my skin considerably when I use it in a tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally olive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning on and off for several years and been tanning consistently since summer of last year.</li>
            <li> With this lotion, I feel like you&#x27;re not really getting a tan, just a quick blast of color that won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that this lotion will turn someone VERY dark.  </li>
            <li> when you get out of the tanning bed it barely smells like you have been in it.</li>
            <li> Makes you dark fast!</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion after already having a pretty good base tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with streaking or orange spots because I already have a pretty good base tan.</li>
            <li> When you first apply it the scent is light and fruity but seriously has a slight \\&quot;smokey\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does get pretty orangey, I would only suggest this to tanners who are around a medium to dark level, and with a olive based skin color.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> maybe this works better on people with naturally dark skin who tan, and I&#x27;d imagine it would give you a painless boost, but if you&#x27;re naturally pale like me, DON&#x27;T do it!</li>
            <li> It gives you a fast dark tan.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I bought this lotion was cause it said that it gives you a rich and dark tan after a few times.</li>
            <li> Not so hard to fix that problem right?</li>
            <li> , be sure to wipe down your hands and feet before you get in the bed, it leaves behind some orange streaks.</li>
            <li> I already had a really good base tan before I started to use it and thought that it would make me look so much more darker, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I would rather use a lotion that tans you more gradually than one that gets you dark fast, but just with fake orange bronzers that fade within a few days.</li>
            <li> The lotion is white, so you don&#x27;t think that it can give you much bronzing effects, but in fact it does, and you may want to use it every other session as if you are pale, it can cause an orange tint..</li>
            <li> I get very dark from the bronzer and it lasts for much longer than other lotions.</li>
            <li> Turned everything dark orange within hours, especially my face and hands, which was totally embarrasing.</li>
            <li> Failure to do this will will certainly result in orange spots.  </li>
            <li> Only recommendation is that you wash your hands after applying it and use it every other tan switching with another lotion</li>
            <li> and you should definitely use a wet wipe for your palms and finger nails, but a little bit goes a long way, so it may seem smaller than some others, but it lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> my skin gets SOO itchy from tanning because it gets dry</li>
            <li> This lotion is not that way i look dark and only after a couple times!</li>
            <li> The only down side that I have for this lotion is the smell.</li>
            <li> At first, I was shocked at how dark I got right out of the bed...</li>
            <li> Only use this if you are already tan, because it is dark!</li>
            <li> I could tan everyday for a year and still look white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to be careful when putting it on.  </li>
            <li> I always used a wet wipe and a towel to remove the lotion from my hands after applying.</li>
            <li> You HAVE to put this lotion on carefully and evenly</li>
            <li> It is a little deceiving since the lotion is completely white and makes you this dark.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after using some other bronzing lotions thinking this could help make my established tan look even darker.  </li>
            <li> and I didnt smell any funky after tan smell that was mentioned in other reviews</li>
            <li> this lotion made me extremely streaky and orange tented with all the self tanner in it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried the billion other ones</li>
            <li> Avoid your face, stay dry mext few hours</li>
            <li> Im a red head, so its hard for me to get a tan and other lotions</li>
            <li> So yes, you do get dark almost immediately with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have an instant tan, a tan that would usually take a few days to get...  </li>
            <li> This product makes you dark</li>
            <li> It gets me really dark with one application.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lotion that would get me dark and the lady there suggested this lotion to me.</li>
            <li> and this bronzer makes me look dark brown, not orange.</li>
            <li> i would NEVER use any other lotion!</li>
            <li> If you have missed a few days going tanning</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t so bad, and definately left a deep bark brown color, which is why I give this 2 stars instead of just one.  </li>
            <li> The bronzes are very heavy</li>
            <li> Develop a base tan first then use Smoke.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to this lotion is it does leave an after tan odor though it&#x27;s not as bad as some others I have used.</li>
            <li> The smell is so bad i was ashamed to be in public after use, people could smell you from feet away, not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> This one is probably the worse.  </li>
            <li> now i&#x27;m stuck with an entire bottle of stuff i hate.  </li>
            <li> And since using this lotion, I feel like my base tan I had before starting is gone.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced streaking or orangeness with this...</li>
            <li> Also not pleasant when your husband doesnt want to get close to you due to that &#x27;weird smell&#x27; even after a shower :(</li>
            <li> this was the worst by far.</li>
            <li> There just a bit expensive at the salon</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I wouldn&#x27;t use this lotion until there is an established base tan.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT use if you don&#x27;t have a base tan...</li>
            <li> I hate going to the tanning salon and having them try to pressure you to</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and once i used the lotion i was very unhappy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li> BUT, after you tan you have that awful burnt smell.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This lotion wasn&#x27;t good at all. It leaves an orange color! It looks unatural, smells gross and stains your body. If you don&#x27;t apply evenly it will leave streaks! It&#x27;s the worst lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li> It smells really good!! But this is not a self tanner u need to go in the sun or in a tanning bed for it to work!! I used it with the lighting of the sun and it worked!!</li>
            <li> The lotion is white, so you don&#x27;t think that it can give you much bronzing effects, but in fact it does, and you may want to use it every other session as if you are pale, it can cause an orange tint.. so don&#x27;t over use it!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months.  Excellent!!!  No orange color, looks natural.</li>
            <li> My friend bought a couple bottle of this stuff. He swears buy it and still uses it to this day. I had to try it out and it is amazing. The results you get from this is unbelievable and it smells really good too, GET IT!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. I bought it because of the good reviews it had. I love the smell of it, when you get out of the tanning bed it barely smells like you have been in it. It does give you a instant tan, but if you forget to apply it in a place you will be able to see. The one thing that I bought this lotion was cause it said that it gives you a rich and dark tan after a few times. But it doesn&#x27;t do that for me. I already had a really good base tan before I started to use it and thought that it would make me look so much more darker, but I was wrong. It does give you a tan but it doesn&#x27;t do exactly what the bottle says it does. Also make sure you wash your hands after your apply it, it will leave your hands a orange color. I use baby wipes but after a while them don&#x27;t even work. Now I just spray the cleaner that I clean the tanning bed with on my hands and wipe them off before I get in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of lotions, and decided to give this one a try. The initial scent is kind of orangey/citrussy which I found a little ironic, since it&#x27;s the same effect it had on my skin.  I have a pretty good base tan going, but am naturally very light without tanning, which may be why this product wasn&#x27;t for me. Turned everything dark orange within hours, especially my face and hands, which was totally embarrasing. After I showered the following day it mellowed out to a orange-brownish color and then by day 3 it wasn&#x27;t so bad, and definately left a deep bark brown color, which is why I give this 2 stars instead of just one.  My guess it maybe this works better on people with naturally dark skin who tan, and I&#x27;d imagine it would give you a painless boost, but if you&#x27;re naturally pale like me, DON&#x27;T do it!</li>
            <li> I thought id buy this, it seemed like it had decent reviews.  First off ive tried numerous tanning lotions out there.  This one is probably the worse.  The only thing nice bout this is the bottle.  Their is so much bronzers in there that you turn orange looking...not a nice colour compared to other lotions i have used.  It also gets streaky easily since it doesnt go on very smoothly.  and it will be noticeable right away.  This seemed more to me like a self tanner. I gave it a try twice and have stop using it since.  The smell is so bad i was ashamed to be in public after use, people could smell you from feet away, not pleasant.  Also not pleasant when your husband doesnt want to get close to you due to that &#x27;weird smell&#x27; even after a shower :(</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon myself and let me tell you these lotions do run pretty high in price. I love smoke, but as a seller and a user I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to any beginner tanners or anyone with fair skin. Develop a base tan first then use Smoke. For those who love self tanners, mystic or airbrush will love this lotion because it contains a bit of self tanner in it. For the people who said it streaks and they don&#x27;t like it, it is because this is designed for advanced tanners. You must apply evenly and for best results leave in on your body for a minimum of 2 hours. I purchased from this seller and it arrived super early and was completely legit and I know my products. There just a bit expensive at the salon I work at even with my discount. I  hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after using some other bronzing lotions thinking this could help make my established tan look even darker.  Boy was I wrong! It just left me looking orange, and i had streaks in some spots and orange between my fingers (and i even bring along wipes to wash my hands off before i get into the bed AND wash with soap and water as soon as I get out).  i wish that i would have tried it the day i got it, then i could have a chance at sending it back.  now i&#x27;m stuck with an entire bottle of stuff i hate.  And at this price...</li>
            <li> i liked this tanning lotion at first because it ggets you dark fast. but i swear to you it rubs off! i noticed places on my arm and chest where my clothes were and then when i showered later that night my towel was rubbing it off! really dissapointed because if it didn&#x27;t do that it was the perfect color!</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m so fair and don&#x27;t tan well I researched \\&quot;best tanning bronzer\\&quot;. This is the result of my search result. The product smells nice and covers well but doesn&#x27;t work to my expectations. I&#x27;m fair skinned and expected a little more color out of this product then what it has produced over many tanning sessions. I will NOT be buying this product again when I&#x27;m done with this bottle.</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion after already having a pretty good base tan. At first, I was shocked at how dark I got right out of the bed...but I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about the orange staining on my hands (even after wiping my hands with a baby wipe after applying the lotion). So yes, you do get dark almost immediately with this lotion. However, it&#x27;s kind of an orangy, spray-tan looking color that doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I would have to tan 4-5 times a week to maintain my color with this lotion, which is totally unpractical for me. The color fades within 3 days and then you&#x27;re back to where you started. And since using this lotion, I feel like my base tan I had before starting is gone. After the color I get from this lotion fades, I feel white. I would rather use a lotion that tans you more gradually than one that gets you dark fast, but just with fake orange bronzers that fade within a few days. With this lotion, I feel like you&#x27;re not really getting a tan, just a quick blast of color that won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I could tan everyday for a year and still look white. Im a red head, so its hard for me to get a tan and other lotions make me look orange. This lotion is not that way i look dark and only after a couple times! this stuff is amazing and last long i love it ! i dont look orange and my skin is soft its a great lotion and the only one i will use because i know it works!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  It darkens my skin considerably when I use it in a tanning bed.  It has a light scent and is easy to apply.  It goes on like a lotion and isn&#x27;t greasy or oily.  I love the color that it provides.  I am very light skinned, and even at my palest, this lotion doesn&#x27;t turn me orange at all!  It leaves me with a brown color that looks real.  I doesn&#x27;t burn, tingle or make your skin cool, which I really like.  I have tried other lotions, and I haven&#x27;t found one good enough to switch to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be careful when putting it on.  If you leave gloppy areas, you will see streaks.  You need to make sure you rub it in well.  Also, you really need to wash it off your hands and from underneath your fingernails, or they will turn an orange/brown color from the excess lotion that is on them.  The color will stain your fingernails and remain until they grow out.  If I can&#x27;t wash my hands, I use a handy wipe, and that works perfectly.  But really wipe them with it, over and over to make sure you got it off.  Also, I don&#x27;t bathe directly after using it, so that way the color really shows.  I usually tan at night, so I just take my morning shower and that works perfectly.  I think if you bathe too soon after putting it on, it washes some of the bronzing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really see that this lotion helps speed up my tanning process.  I tried tanning without lotion, versus tanning with this lotion, during different years and using this accelerated my tanning about 50 percent.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!!  If you have missed a few days going tanning and you feel like you have lost some color, this lotion is perfect. As soon as I get out the bed I have an instant tan, a tan that would usually take a few days to get...  It is well worth the $....</li>
            <li> This product makes you dark yes, but over time even after washing hands after coming out of the tanning bed, my hands still had a tint of orange. Plus, you got to make sure you spread it evenly or you will notice uneven tan.  I don&#x27;t know if I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I had the winter translucent look to my skin&lt;br /&gt;I used Smoke with my salon tanning package and&lt;br /&gt;after the first use and only 10 min in the bed I was a light bronze&lt;br /&gt;color and the next morning i had a nice healthly glow :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rub it in good&lt;br /&gt;and wipe your palms and finger with a moist nap as it will&lt;br /&gt;slightly discolor your hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smells like oranges  and I didnt smell any funky after tan smell that was mentioned in other reviews&lt;br /&gt;would definitly recommend this product !!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has great prices on tanning lotions and after care lotions</li>
            <li> I love this lotion because of the bronzers. Yes, if you do not wash your hands it will stain between your fingers, but otherwise it&#x27;s great! It left my skin soft and with a great tan. :)</li>
            <li> Its a very good product! Don&#x27;t have a smell after tanning, not sticky, thats why its not a problem not take a shower up to 4-7 hours, to have a better tan.  good result u can see after at least 1 hour! It gives u a good tan color, very natural (u r not going to look like orange chiken)). Good luck with ur tan)</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion and received it in about 2 days with free shipping! I was totally pleased! Where to begin this will break your tanning plateau! The bronzers are incredible! It does have a lot of sunless DHA in it but it doesn&#x27;t make you orange what so ever! Just wash your hands immediately and you will be just fine! When you first apply it the scent is light and fruity but seriously has a slight \\&quot;smokey\\&quot; scent. It is a little deceiving since the lotion is completely white and makes you this dark. Very impressed. The after scent is another story, smells like I just had a spray tan. I can tolerate it because I know the results will be amazing! I love this stuff perfect for if you an event to go to! Happy Tanning!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion...I just keep buying more. It gets me really dark with one application. Never had a problem with it turning me orange but I always wash my hands as soon as I&#x27;m done tanning.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing bronzer! be sure to clean your hands after every application to avoid orange stains though.  i absolutly love it.  and the shipping was super fast (:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that this lotion will turn someone VERY dark.  HOWEVER, I wouldn&#x27;t use this lotion until there is an established base tan.  Even with mine, I still ended up with streaking on my legs.  I ended using a different lotion below my knees, while still using SMOKE everywhere else.  Another note:  I always used a wet wipe and a towel to remove the lotion from my hands after applying. Failure to do this will will certainly result in orange spots.  Bottom line: a great lotion for the experienced tanner who wants to up their tan to the next level of dark.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great! Makes you dark fast! DO NOT use if you don&#x27;t have a base tan... It will streak you! The only down side that I have for this lotion is the smell. When you first put it on ... it has an orange smell...... BUT, after you tan you have that awful burnt smell.</li>
            <li> Seller did an AWESOME job getting out my product the next day. Nevwe tried this product before but its on the top list for tanning lotions so it MUST be good haha</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite bronzer. The lotion is white and smells citrusy. It goes on so smooth and turns into a beautiful tan. Only use this if you are already tan, because it is dark! I have never experienced streaking or orangeness with this...it&#x27;s a quality bronzer at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> My older sister got me into this stuff. Amazing. Best tanning lotion ever. It smells okay, but when you apply it make sure to exfoliate BEFORE tanning and rub in well. I like to take some baby wipes with me to wipe my hands off as the bronzers in this get orange like self tanner on your hands. Avoid your face, stay dry mext few hours and you&#x27;re golden.. Literally:)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used. Been using this stuff for 3+ years now, and will probally never go back! I&#x27;ve never had a problem with streaking or orange spots because I already have a pretty good base tan. Thanks Amazon for such a great product!</li>
            <li> Before buying this lotion, I bought a sample packet a couple of times at my tanning salon. I was looking for a lotion that would get me dark and the lady there suggested this lotion to me. I&#x27;ve been tanning on and off for several years and been tanning consistently since summer of last year. It does the job that&#x27;s for sure! I&#x27;ve noticed myself getting darker in one session and others notice it too. The only drawback to this lotion is it does leave an after tan odor though it&#x27;s not as bad as some others I have used. The smell of this lotion from the bottle is pleasant and kinda like a nice coconut fruity cocktail.     I should note I have olive toned skin and for me this lotion works well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for years! It is by far the BEST lotion out there. my skin gets SOO itchy from tanning because it gets dry but when i use this lotion it prevents my skin from drying out. I get very dark from the bronzer and it lasts for much longer than other lotions. i would NEVER use any other lotion! well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> this lotion made me extremely streaky and orange tented with all the self tanner in it. i would not recomment it</li>
            <li> This lotion worked well but was very orange and made my hands change color. It also left me smelling funky after tanning. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This lotion got me tan quick but it wasn&#x27;t a brown tan. It was more of a hint of orange. You have to make sure you rub it in all the way and to either wear gloves or wipe hands off before tanning so they don&#x27;t discolor.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion. I hate going to the tanning salon and having them try to pressure you to but something by designer skin or with a blouson bronzers. This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried the billion other ones that our out there. This has a great smell doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy and tans you quick. The first day I used it I was noticeably tanner. I reccomend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what i wanted. It was delivered faster than i had expected and it worked great! I got a really good tan in no time! I would recommend this product to anyone who has a hard time tanning as this lotion is white and lightweight, it goes on smooth and dries quickly. It turns tan almost as soon as you are in the sun or the booth! It smells great too!</li>
            <li> Hemp lotion is the only type I will use when tanning.&lt;br /&gt;It also works just as well on a sunny day outside the tanning salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get pretty orangey, I would only suggest this to tanners who are around a medium to dark level, and with a olive based skin color.&lt;br /&gt;Also, be sure to wipe down your hands and feet before you get in the bed, it leaves behind some orange streaks.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST bronzer I have ever used. I used to work as a tanning consultant and I never had a customer dislike this lotion. I have naturally olive skin and this bronzer makes me look dark brown, not orange. You HAVE to put this lotion on carefully and evenly and you should definitely use a wet wipe for your palms and finger nails, but a little bit goes a long way, so it may seem smaller than some others, but it lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried many lotions but this is by far the best i&#x27;ve used. it gets you a nice brown color in a short amount of time</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and once i used the lotion i was very unhappy! first off all when i ordered it there was a shipping charge i had second thoughts should have not bought it then. I used it once and i wish i could be refunded my money because i did not seem any darker it did not leave a bronzer look on my skin nothing. When i put it on it felt and looked like lotion i honestly am wondering if i didnt get the right product i see all good reviews. I was better off using no lotion then this SMOKE..kind. i tan all the time im always changing up my lotions this was the worst by far. I dont even think its a real tanning lotion. People are fooled!</li>
            <li> I have been Tanning for years and I have used So many different types of lotions. I would say smoke is in my top 3 of favorites. Great product. I have heard and have seen for myself about buying tanning lotion online bottle looks the same but product in bottle is not the same! I bought mine from the tan man on here and at La Tan I would have pain $45 for the bottle but I got on here for $22 bucks. Great Tanning lotion yes it will stain your hands very simple fix after you apply it just take the towel they provide you in the tanning salon and wipe your hands. Not so hard to fix that problem right? Lol If your pail skin this lotion is not meant for you! The bronzes are very heavy and I believe will leave you spotty so use something else. Over all the lotion rocks! Nothing in this world deserves a 5 lol</li>
            <li> Definately works for sure! Very satisfied. Very reasonable price. Definately allows alot more oxygen in to get a better tan.</li>
            <li> I bought this a week or so before I went on vacation. It gives you a fast dark tan. Only recommendation is that you wash your hands after applying it and use it every other tan switching with another lotion so you don&#x27;t get to &amp;#34;orange-y&amp;#34;.</li>
