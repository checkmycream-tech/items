            <li>I tried this Argan shampoo since I&#x27;ve used and loved the Sage shampoo by this company.</li>
            <li>It smells great and lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I ordered a bottle of Argan Oil Shampoo and we both loved it.</li>
            <li>it was a good experience.</li>

            <li>Rest everything is good about this product.</li>
            <li>Good combo.</li>
            <li>I also like that the smell (although very pleasant) isn&#x27;t so strong or too lingering.</li>
            <li>and tangled.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I liked about it is that it lathers very nicely</li>
            <li>It has a calming affect and the lather while usage is perfect to give you the satisfaction of a good clean wash.</li>

            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed and happy with my purchase of this shampoo!</li>

            <li>I am happy :)</li>
            <li>This Argan Oil Shampoo is OK, but not that great.  </li>
            <li>I experienced that  works well to keep my hair look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>but with all the botanicals in the ingredients, it should have some kind of good smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m washing my hair with a product that is good for it.</li>
            <li>good size shampoo bottle, nice packaging and label.</li>

            <li>This is a LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li>Afterwards I love it!</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty neutral: no perfumey scents so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, probably best to stick with the Herbal Essences.</li>

            <li>lather feels amazing and between the shampoo and the conditioner  </li>
            <li>I bought it because of the amazing reviews but this shampoo dries the hair out a lot.</li>
            <li>and that makes my hair smell amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo although I enjoy shampoo that is sudsier.</li>
            <li>However their customer service is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I use this in addition to the Silk 18 Conditioner which is also amazing.</li>
            <li>I use this in addition to the aveenoo conditioner which is also amazing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the product quality is amazing but there is always a room for improvement.</li>
            <li>I m loving my hair.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and nicely combed condition.</li>
            <li>smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I have never been nice to my hair and thought it was time for a change.</li>
            <li>The scent is kind of a soapy scent, not like honey/vanilla at all, but the smell does not stay in my hair.</li>
            <li>For 2 years, I experimented with making my own shampoos and conditioners in an attempt to limit my exposure to chemicals in my home.  </li>
            <li>It has the lather that I missed for those 2 years of my own concoctions, and it cleaned my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>Well in the meantime a rep from maple holistic had sent me an email asking how I liked</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just picky, but in the description/ingredients it says it contains vanilla scents to give it a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I had an issue and they resolved it immediately and with the kind of c/s stores used to have 40 years ago.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>also use it on my 5 year daught &#x27;s hair, she loves  it , love the smell.1 great buy , and must buy, just love it</li>
            <li>honestly would not buy it again</li>
            <li>But I can honestly say that I&#x27;m probably gonna stick with these products.</li>
            <li>I like having strong-scented shampoos that leave my hair smelling nice</li>
            <li>just...boring and kind of ugh.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner also smells something like warm vanilla sugar, so once I use that I forget all about the cardboard shampoo smell.    </li>
            <li>so I can give an honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>When my hair is thoroughly rinses, it feel nice.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li>I never used it before,but when i got it,I liked</li>
            <li>I liked how it</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>This feels nice on your hair and hope it will thicken it up.</li>
            <li>After trying the ACV and BS technique and going no-poo, i was not as thrilled with the transition as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I liked this in combination with their conditioner.</li>
            <li>But it smells wonderful and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews about this product that i gave it a try.</li>
            <li>It has a nice lather too.</li>
            <li>I didnt like the smell though as it smelled more like a medicine(tonic), but the good thing is after the wash it didnt linger around.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that finally I found a perfect hair products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that massaging it into your scalp and even letting it sit for awhile before rinsing is nice.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li>and everyone expects a shampoo to make you hair smell nice.</li>
            <li>, seems to be a nice buy.</li>
            <li>Honestly I have no idea about Argan oil or its advantages, but I like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Fragrant and kind to my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I do really like these products; they work and smell wonderful!!</li>
            <li>I honestly believe it makes all the difference</li>
            <li>I can honestly say my hair is softer and shinier after using both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely but not overly-so.</li>
            <li>We liked the product because it is cruelty-free and fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>I know that I can count on honest information from people about their experiences.  </li>
            <li>It kind of just smells like what I imagine sodium cocoyl isethionate or sodium laurel glucoside carboxylate (ingredients) would smell like.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try this instead of making my own or going &amp;</li>
            <li>It lathers up really nice without having to use a ton of it.</li>
            <li>Really liked it-</li>
            <li>i liked the silk 18 conditioner</li>
            <li>but I liked</li>
            <li>I often use a moisturizing shampoo on its own, and follow up with a leaving in conditioning spray or styling cream.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a nice shampoo since I moved to USA</li>
            <li>I’ve been using this shampoo for about a week now, and I am loving it.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, I like that no toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is no longer fried looking and I have nice curls.</li>
            <li>I very rarely do more with it than wash it and put it in a bun because it just never looks or feels good.</li>
            <li>I use the amount it states on the bottle and it foams up nicely which was a surprise.</li>
            <li>It smells like some kind of rubber or adhesive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be completely honest and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maple Holistics contacted me after my purchase to see how I liked the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It even gets a nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It produces a nice creamy lather.</li>
            <li>It honestly reminds me of horse shampoo</li>
            <li>When paired with a nice smelling conditioner there&#x27;s no issue.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, out of habit (&amp; because it feels good:), I scratch at my scalp.</li>
            <li>Lathers great, hair feels clean, nice smell</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling very clean and has a good lather to it.  </li>
            <li>Great purchase and really worth a try!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try the shampoo after my mom had great results.</li>
            <li>It also made my scalp feel great and made my hair feel really clean afterward.</li>
            <li>However, it does a great job of getting my hair squeaky clean..</li>
            <li>This is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause problems for our family , decent lather, and seems to work well for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>These products are awesome and I highly recommend them.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t think that this shampoo have so many good and 5 star reviews because of the Free product card like i read in one comment!</li>
            <li>But overall, this product worked fairly well and is perfect for those who want softer hair.</li>

            <li>I do not know how the shampoo performs on its own, but I love the combination of the two.  </li>
            <li>( I loved that it was organic and sulfate free but just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>that u get a free bottle if u leave a good review...</li>
            <li>, this is perfect natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo works amazing</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the best, natural, organic, sulfate-free, and hypoallergenic hair product I have used.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST shampoo that I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better i still use my own formula which is the dr bronners + argan oil and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist/colourist commented on how healthy my hair is and co-workers have offered nice compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s natural and works perfectly!</li>
            <li>My hair is color treated &amp; this product leaves it soft &amp; silky &amp; the shine is incredible!</li>
            <li>It lathers surprisingly well, just as well as those shampoos filled with sulfates and whatnot.  </li>
            <li>Someone suggested the good reviews are because you can get a free product.  </li>
            <li>almost forgot - product delivery was seamlessly  arrived on time and perfectly packaged.</li>
            <li>This company makes a nice conditioner that has a lovely vanilla scent, and I was hoping this shampoo would be on par with that,</li>
            <li>I wanted sulfate free, they are, and are of good quality.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Nice refreshing tingle too.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a wonderful natural product for every one.</li>
            <li>Its the best shampoo I ever used it made my hair feel so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>With most shampoos, you have to use a lot of product to get a nice lather going.</li>
            <li>Paired with the Maple Holistics Silk 18 Conditioner, my hair is healthier, soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is natural and my hair feels and looks great!</li>
            <li>and I started looking for good sulfate free shampoos online.</li>
            <li>This came up; she gave it a try, and WOW great product!</li>
            <li>Amazing love this shampoo..</li>
            <li>Great for any type hair, very good for dry scalp, and is not anything as in the way of fragrance as I could tell.</li>
            <li>the dandruff that did fall today is very fine</li>
            <li>I have very fine and oily hair which always looked a bit frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, gives you incredible soft clean hair, no residue and no chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have very fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li>but it honestly ended up being a fabulous gel/shampoo like wash that I fell in love with!</li>
            <li>I originally bought the silk 18 conditioner, which I loved.</li>
            <li>Pleasant mild aroma.</li>
            <li>Because of the many good reviews, I decided to try this shampoo along with Maple Holistics&#x27; Silk 18 conditioner (also homeopathic &amp; BPA free).  </li>
            <li>Smell is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>so it takes a good amount to wash and clean thoroughly</li>
            <li>:) I would highly recommend this amazing shampoo to anyone with hair!!</li>
            <li>Nice clean product!</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great and really nourishes your hair root to tip!</li>
            <li>I totally endorse this product as one of the best, if not, the best, natural shampoo and conditioner manufacturer.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use a quarter sized amount, now I don’t get great lather on the first application.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I didn&#x27;t through it out the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I was so happy after my first use,  </li>
            <li>The bottle&#x27;s also much prettier :P I really love it!</li>
            <li>Super clean hair!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice shampoo, it has a very pleasant mild scent, nice thick lather, worked very nicely on my curly, sometimes frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I am happy I took the chance on a new product and am excited to try more!!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel great and my scalp feels clean and comfortable after use.</li>
            <li>My hair is very smooth</li>
            <li>When washing my hair, the product is very smooth to use.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light.</li>
            <li>This is the another reason why I liked as it does not have any strong odor.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but the scent is very mild, so</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, very light.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly it feels healthy!</li>
            <li>The product smells good, very light fresh secents and the shampoo</li>
            <li>very good feeling so far..</li>
            <li>I had tried this product before, it&#x27;s okay.. very natural, good smell!</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a huge plus!</li>
            <li>To Make it more understandable, I don&#x27;t have the habit of rinsing my hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Mapleholistics for making such a wonderful Product.</li>
            <li>My hair looked so much better after just one wash with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love that I am avoiding sulfates with this product as well.</li>
            <li>I was like okay, then you&#x27;re losing my business.</li>
            <li>Because of a recent illness, I&#x27;m doing my best to use homeopathic &amp; all-natural products.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but will look for something else.</li>
            <li>Fabulous Shampoo!  </li>
            <li>This product was ok...</li>
            <li>The smell of the shampoo isn&#x27;t that great, but that&#x27;s probably because there are no unnecessary chemicals-</li>
            <li>I decided to start using better, more hydrating shampoos.</li>
            <li>I love it -</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love the Argan oil treatment any way.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s why I bought their conditioner, which smells like vanilla! :)</li>
            <li>I really love the foam texture,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the perfumes in products can be overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I do love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Just ok... it does suds up</li>
            <li>but still I&#x27;ve had better shampoos...</li>
            <li>very happy with this entire line!</li>
            <li>After using this paired with a great condition it is so much easier to comb after.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels after and it has ingredients I love.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure what I&#x27;ll get from this.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of honey</li>
            <li>For the price we were hoping more results but</li>
            <li>I felt sure the company had changed something in the shampoo</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was the most drying shampoo I have ever used and even after using a salon-quality conditioner, I could still feel the roughness of my hair.</li>
            <li>It is okay, I guess.</li>
            <li>This is where the magic happened.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been this luscious, frizz free, so manageable!</li>
            <li>three words  LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>great shampoo, really works.  </li>
            <li>I believe I was expecting a lot more</li>
            <li>All in all, one of the better shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>and she told me to purchase two more bottles(along with the silk eighteen conditioner).</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo along with the hydrate shampoo and I love the smell of the hydrate shampoo but the Argan shampoo worked better for my hair.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use this product, highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser noticed that my hair was in better condition without my even mentioning anything.</li>
            <li>I genuinely endorse this one!</li>
            <li>I love how it feels in my hair.</li>
            <li>Lathers better than the others I have used.</li>
            <li>and I was noticing more and more hair loss in the shower.</li>
            <li>Many sulfate-free shampoos are still laden with chemicals, but this one isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It has more shine and body, and it feels thicker.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way this make my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li>My hair seems cleaner, but I&#x27;m not in love.</li>
            <li>This is now our favorite shampoo and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>

            <li>and my hair feels and looks so much better</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the smell of the shampoo, and like that it&#x27;s sulfate free!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and my hair just keeps on getting better and better.</li>

            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased</li>
            <li>I did see rave reviews but wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>This shampoo was okay.</li>
            <li>Most of the shampoo&#x27;s ranging from pantene/dove to bolage volumizing range</li>
            <li>I would love a bit more info on the ingredients in Maple Holistics products.</li>
            <li>It also, like I said, made my scalp feel much better than when I was using non-natural shampoos</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li>Thank You Maple Holistics for creating such an awesome shampoo.</li>
            <li>This was not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But this product worked better than I thought.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: I think this Argan shampoo is better for oily hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the richest most luxurious product I&#x27;ve ever used to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>but I also bought the conditioner which was magical.</li>

            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>What more can be asked?  </li>
            <li>I am so incredibly pleased.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has no smell in my opinion, but the silk 18 has a lovely vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smell is just ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still doing the baking soda thing mostly, but my son and I do love the way our hair feels when we use this shampoo.</li>

            <li>Love this product  </li>
            <li>and they surely did not overstate that all you need is a quarter sized amount.</li>
            <li>Also I am ordering more.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works better for me than the Soap Nuts shampoo does.</li>
            <li>It feels overall healthier which is great!</li>
            <li>Even then, that doesn&#x27;t take away from this overall great product!</li>
            <li>After using this product for almost a week, my hair looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>I love all the ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>I think it needs just a bit more vanilla and honey,</li>
            <li>Love this product, will buy again.</li>
            <li>I will keep ordering these two products for sure.  </li>

            <li>I could not believe it, OUTSTANDING customer service.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more bottles so my girls can start using it as well.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair has shine, shine and more shine.</li>
            <li>I am totally in love with this shampoo .</li>
            <li>and I really love the way it has made my hair feel and look thicker and more healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer, fuller, and more healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I immediately ordered more product from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li>My hair feels more moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Cleaned better than some organic shampoos I&#x27;ve tried before</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product for sure.</li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27; ok to use once a month.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t make me feel any better).</li>
            <li>I use the silk 18 conditioner with it and together they make my hair very shiny, it feels healthier, and I don&#x27;t even have to use a leave in conditioner after because it does a great job of detangling.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair feels smooth and silky and I have seen a decrease in hair loss!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>I know the value of healthy hair.</li>
            <li>But my experience shows that shampoos that contain no conditioner are healthier, because it is better if the conditioner does not reach the scalp.</li>
            <li>I love most about this shampoo</li>
            <li>I tried many hair products, but they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It is sulfate free and hypoallergenic !</li>
            <li>I bought this product a while ago and really love it.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair is improving with every shampoo -- it looks and feels so healthy, I love touching it.</li>
            <li>After purchasing this product and using it now for the 4th time, I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair look even more.  </li>
            <li>Used to use Organic Excellence, but like this better.</li>
            <li>I also like that it is sulfate free!</li>
            <li>I honestly ordered this shampoo because the ingredients sounded like they&#x27;d make my hair smell fabulous</li>
            <li>Great gentle shampoo to use often.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>but I will try again to see more results.</li>
            <li>My husband even likes it. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are completely satisfied with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>It gave me more body than any shampoo has before</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hairs looks more shinny, more dense.</li>
            <li>I am in love with shampoo now.</li>
            <li>I had practically given up on my hair ever looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>After trying this shampoo, it works well to keep my hair look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>It seems to make more volume to my hair, since the hair must have some nutrition from it.</li>
            <li>I like it! :)</li>
            <li>OK girl&#x27;s this is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My mom actually recommended this to me.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my hair</li>
            <li>And I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Giving it more time made a difference.</li>
            <li>Glad I found a winner.</li>
            <li>nice light scent.</li>
            <li>Sulfate free hair products have made my hair so soft and healthy,  but this one is THEORY best.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Sage better if you like earthy smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li>but I think I like it. :)</li>
            <li>Even though it is sulfate free, I get a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>I also ordered the Silk 18, and together, these products have made my hair a bit more manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a month now and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>good thing about this is that it is fully natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, it is good for your hair follicles for stimulation and cessation of hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>With the conditioner it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li>Overall great product!</li>
            <li>Their customer service receives a 5 star for sure.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I mostly bought this because I&#x27;m allergic to sulfate</li>
            <li>but I thought a light scent would be nice.</li>
            <li>Root Booster and hair spray on top of shampoo and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through many, many.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it&#x27;s ingredients, and this company.</li>
            <li>I seriously LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the lather and scent of this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It also has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I wish that more companies would pay attention to their business model!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great and it cleanses my scalp and hair really well.</li>
            <li>So glad I switched to it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Even though it is sulfate free it lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the smell and thought I wouldn&#x27;t be happy with it</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this shampoo overall.</li>
            <li>I love the neutral scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I will defiantly be buying more and recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Love it&lt;br</li>
            <li>latest order is their dandruff shampoo to have another family member try.  </li>
            <li>Not only was the shampoo excellent on my hair, the smell was nice and the shampoo rich.  </li>
            <li>It has a lovely scent and it&#x27;s very rich.</li>
            <li>For being sulfate free, you still get a nice lather and my hair feels very clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet very effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light nutty fragrance and rich lather produce a very nice calming effect that anyone can appreciate and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and it dries out easily with styling.</li>
            <li>I searched amazon for a a natural and organic shampoo that had good reviews and found Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It is full, shiny, and healthy!</li>
            <li>The sulfate free aspect keeps my color vibrant and the oils keep my hair nice and healthy!!</li>
            <li>Good natural shampoo...doesn&#x27;t really have a strong smell and lathers great!  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo, first time using a sulfate free product</li>
            <li>and it does a nice job making your hair feel clean without drying out.  </li>
            <li>After rinsing, it leaves my hair and beard nice and clean, but, it doesn&#x27;t have that squeaky, over-dry feeling.</li>
            <li>The Silk conditioner has a wonderful vanilla scent and I wish the shampoo could incorporate the same type of pleasant scent!&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I really do like this product.</li>
            <li>I notified Amazon and received a prompt refund for that particular product, great customer service.  </li>
            <li>There is no smell to this shampoo, and though it does not foam, it still gets my hair nice and clean every time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>think that this is a great product, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and shiny and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>It felt very clean as well as moisturized.</li>
            <li>Has a very clean smell and gives plenty of slip.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are quite benign and the results are pretty good.</li>
            <li>It lathers pretty good.</li>
            <li>My hair and I are very happy and looking forward to a long relationship with Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li>best shampoo i have ever used, will not stop using this product as long as it is work for me.</li>
            <li>Now , my hair looks so soft and beautiful  .</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m willing to ignore it for the good effects.</li>
            <li>Impressed with how soft hair felt after the first wash and not stripped at all!</li>
            <li>love this very good for my curly frizzy coarse hair</li>
            <li>I was so excited and relieved when I found this!  </li>
            <li>This very light fragrance is fine for men and women.</li>
            <li>It works great - my hair feels better after washing &amp; conditioning with their Silk18 Natural Conditioner, and it&#x27;s prettier.  </li>
            <li>Smelled great, and love that is all natural.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is wonderful, and it works well with the shampoo (and I also apply a leave in conditioner and some finishing serum after I blow dry).</li>
            <li>I love this product and the way it makes the hair shine and is easy to style.</li>
            <li>My wife who requires a mild shampoo because of a scalp condition also liked  this product.</li>
            <li>It does not leave a strong smell after use (which is ok).</li>
            <li>It has a strong soapy smell that isn&#x27;t appealing to me.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos on the market have extremely strong aromas.</li>

            <li>and you&#x27;ll spend more if you buy two 8oz bottles here on Amazon, although the Amazon price is a bit cheaper than the website price and shipping&#x27;s free if you have prime or do the $35+ purchase thing.</li>

            <li>There is no odor to it at all, so if you&#x27;re looked for a great natural product, I&#x27;d recommend this one.</li>
            <li>help keep it from drying out or becoming damaged.</li>
            <li>Loreal sulfate free is way better</li>

            <li>This shampoo smells great and naturally conditions the hair without making it oily or leaving build up.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good sulfate free shampoo and this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>After searching online about my problem I have read that sulfate free shampoo will help with my problems :)</li>
            <li>Works surprisingly great for a shampoo made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>A great natural product.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this product so much better than Wen shampoo.</li>
            <li>Reasonable and just a good product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use that much product in order to get a good coverage</li>
            <li>We loved this so much we ordered the shampoo again and this time got the conditioner to go with it.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the Whole Foods shampoo and conditioner which was good</li>
            <li>Argan oil works really well in my hair and this is a good brand.</li>
            <li>I looked up all the ingredients and they&#x27;re all gentle and of good quality</li>

            <li>Super fast shipping and great communication.</li>
            <li>Although I liked the product I do not think it is right for me.</li>
            <li>hair feels very nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Since I have had such good luck with Maple Holistics shampoo, I hope to now pair it with the Silk Conditioner!</li>
            <li>If you prefer a more sleek and rich shampoo, you would like the argan oil shampoo.</li>
            <li>Is an overall good Shampoo!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also observed that it does not foam significantly unless you lather more than once.</li>
            <li>I plan on trying their other shampoos and alternating to see what works best.</li>
            <li>Hair happy and light and natural.</li>
            <li>I especially want to give huge kudos to the company, Maple Holistics, for incredible customer service.</li>
            <li>Next time, I will probably use some sort of detangling product, but this shampoo is great by itself and I have never been as pleased by using a shampoo alone.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the shampoo is like a thinner lotion, so it&#x27;s fairly easy to apply all over the head.</li>
            <li>I love how clean my hair feels and paired with Silk 18</li>
            <li>My hair has seemed to change over the years,  Drier and not as easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to rinse ...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t strip your color away, yet you feel like your hair is clean and healthy after use.</li>
            <li>We love the neutral scent, It just feels completely clean..</li>
            <li>My scalp feels clean afterwards and my hair holds conditioner better.</li>
            <li>I ordered a couple of products, which were delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>This makes my scalp itch and my hair break easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to rinse it off too.</li>
            <li>Her hair is curly, frizzy, and gets split ends easily.</li>
            <li>Not too strong of a scent, so it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It feels so strong and shiny now.</li>
            <li>there isn&#x27;t a strong smell.</li>
            <li>so I mainly use this to keep my scalp feeling refreshed and smelling good.</li>
            <li>does nt a have strong overbearing smell.</li>
            <li>so i strongly recommend it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a strong perfume smell</li>
            <li>It foams up surprisingly well (very well) for a sulfate- free shampoo.</li>
            <li>grey and product is very good for colored hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many years of searching for the right product for me, thank you Maple Holistics, I believe I have found it!</li>
            <li>It really does make your hair very smooth and it eliminates frizz!  </li>
            <li>The only improvement that would make this product perfect (for me, anyway) would be the scent - it smells &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but kind of like old vanilla or something.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of organic ingredients and that in combination with the sulfate free component have made it great for maintaining red hair.  </li>
            <li>I have always been a Pantene/Herbal Essence kind of girl, but using this shampoo has shown me the benefits of using a higher quality product.  </li>
            <li>the first bottle I really liked.</li>
            <li>I honestly would highly recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s on the fence about it because it will go beyond your expectations!!</li>
            <li>The best part is that it&#x27;s free of sulfates, paraben and other chemicals.</li>

            <li>I have fine wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The product worked wonderful my hair feels softer and less fizzy.</li>

            <li>It lathers nicely without having to use very much and does a nice job gently cleansing my hair.</li>

            <li>It has a nice clean smell and it does not take much about a nickel size for my hair</li>
            <li>lathered up greatly and left my hair clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good but makes my hair really clean and soft.</li>
            <li>originally bought this because of the reviews, but it was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>I originally made this purchase because it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li>Super shine and full of body!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair squeaky clean, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair squeaky clean, smooth, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the argan oil shampoo and silk 18 conditioner about a  month and a half ago and wanted to make sure to use it for a while before reviewing to make sure I had a good idea.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that this shampoo has made my hair better than normal as it had been a while since my hair had felt healthy.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered this product as it was sulphate free and am amazed how much I liked it!</li>
            <li>Ok, so this is my first go at using a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>She has Never requested a particular product before and always just shrugs when I ask her if she liked something</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t a smell, but that&#x27;s ok, as I&#x27;ve paired it with the Silk 18 and that has a pleasant natural vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>All natural, sulfate free (great for hair that has been straightened) and my hair feels so soft :)</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo because it&#x27;s organic and very gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this argan shampoo and honestly could tell a difference right away with my first wash.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s great, though I would love if it had a slight scent.</li>
            <li>but I expected a more pleasant smell given the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I loved the conditioner, but this was less popular.</li>
            <li>It surprising foams up better than other brands and doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume.</li>
            <li>Overall, amazing brand!</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and light, and I haven&#x27;t experienced an oily scalp or dry ends.  </li>
            <li>This is, without doubt, the best product that I have ever used and no more itchy scalp...</li>
            <li>Astonishingly, my hair started falling after first use.</li>
            <li>I have seen a significant decrease in scalp buildup and my hair stays cleaner for a longer amount of time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>I may be a small purchaser, but I still want to support them by purchasing their products in gratitude for the great way their c/s worked with me!</li>
            <li>Smells so fresh!</li>
            <li>When it came I was excited and scared to try it.</li>
            <li>I have used this for about three weeks and am very pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fresh fragrance!  </li>
            <li>I was excited when it arrived to try it out.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s worth it to me for the results I get!</li>
            <li>Fell in love with Argan Oil Shampoo from the first time.</li>
            <li>am very pleased and I recommend you guys with natural coily 4a/b/c hair textures to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Love the part that its sulfate free and 100% all natural ingredients :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;  Worth trying!  </li>
            <li>so i originally bought both.</li>
            <li>Satisfied first time customer.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>I like that it is sulfate free, it has a nice light scent, makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased it and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>originally bought this shampoo , along with the silk 18 conditioner for one of my guest bathrooms.</li>
            <li>I was attracted to this product because it seemed like it was a standalone moisturizing shampoo with a lot of rich</li>
            <li>Thus far I&#x27;ve been very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am excited about this product and how it is helping my hair.</li>
            <li>Was excited to receive this in the mail yesterday and rushed to wash my hair with this and Silk 18 conditioner.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair for the first time, I noticed how my hair had more body.</li>
            <li>she was so excited</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair; I use a small amount of Argan Oil Shampoo and follow up with the Silk 18 conditioner (scent is awesome!).  </li>
            <li>and it gets a lot better with time, the second time was already ok!</li>
            <li>Their emails were always friendly and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am excited to see how it keeps doing wonders to her hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product: surely become  one  regular customer!</li>
            <li>While I like how clean this leaves my hair feeling, and it looks very healthy and soft in combination with the Silk conditioner, I do want to say one thing: I would not claim that this shampoo is color friendly.  </li>
            <li>The product cut right through the oil and dirt in my hair and agin made my hair squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to find a natural shampoo that has good performance and is much lower cost than Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li>My hair feels truly clean after using the argan shampoo</li>
            <li>My hair has volume, feels clean, and my scalp isn&#x27;t irritated BC of no sulfate.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair clean but doesn&#x27;t strip your hair.</li>
            <li>It does clean well.</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean and I didn&#x27;t get itchy.</li>
            <li>I realize without sulfates, there won&#x27;t be much lather (I have experienced this with Burt&#x27;s Bees), but I have had no trouble getting this shampoo to lather.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use a lot either, because my hair is shiny and clean just after one shampoo.</li>
            <li>After one wash my hair already feels clean and not caked with product.</li>
            <li>After shampooing, my hair feels clean, without any residue.  </li>
            <li>Makes it clean and clarifies along with nourishment.</li>
            <li>I tried many natural hair products but this brand is my favorite now.  </li>
            <li>Great wih my hair, didn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li>I love that they&#x27;ve included all of the ingredients and natural oils that have been proven to promote hair growth and maintain healthy hair in this shampoo.</li>
            <li>After shampooing, I use the Silk 18 Conditioner; and my hair feels so clean afterward.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy, it has volume and feels clean.  </li>
            <li>scalp felt clean without and residue and dryness.</li>
            <li>the clean feeling lasts all day and night.</li>
            <li>I have used the same cheap shampoo for years and years, with good results...</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is that I wish I liked the scent more.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean.  </li>
            <li>Even though I eat clean, use organic hair products</li>
            <li>clean.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning products like laundry detergent, dish washing detergent, wipes, products to clean the shower and the floors.</li>
            <li>It smells good, lathers up just enough, and rinses out leaving my hair feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance and my hair feels really clean after washing with it.  </li>
            <li>I find it has qualities of a conditioner as well as keeping the hair clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but still soapy enough to get a good wash.</li>
            <li>I love how nice it makes my hair, especially in used in tandem with the SILK conditioner!</li>
            <li>, my hair always felt clean after I used it instead of cowashing.</li>
            <li>It is light, gently washes heir and leaves it shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>literally, squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>Their bottles are filled to the brim, the shampoo is unscented with no harmful additives what so ever and leaves my scalp feeling super clean after a wash.  </li>
            <li>I approve of the ingredient list, both of our scalps feel clean and not itchy and there is no leftover residue.</li>
            <li>The smell of this is not great, but that is OK because the conditioner smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Before She found maple holistic products she had gone through so many shampoo and conditioning products and had not been able to find one that made her hair as soft and manageable as these do.</li>
            <li>3 times before  clean.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is nice, but the end result does not leave your hair either soft, shiny, or frizz free.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean my hair well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly sensitve to chemicals and whatever else gets tossed into the cooker with standard shampoos, and everything from the ends of my hair to my scalp has responded very well to this.  </li>
            <li>but my hair still comes out just as clean.  </li>
            <li>those of you who like that clean chemical shampoo feeling but want to ditch the chemicals I would also recommend this</li>
            <li>my scalp gets really clean  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>leave hair feeling clean revitalized</li>
            <li>squeaky clean feeling (Compaired to salon brands),</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my scalp feel clean and cleanses the hair well.  </li>
            <li>and I am noticing thicker, squeaky clean hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sitting here with my morning coffee, running my fingers through my luscious locks, appreciating the fact that my hair is super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo for two weeks and have noticed a huge difference documented in pictures.</li>
            <li>ordered my own the same day, and then ordered more for my daughters</li>
            <li>My scalp feels squeaky clean and it is on the mend.  </li>
            <li>just feels completely clean</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to get my hair really clean, without stripping it.  </li>
            <li>The only downside to this is that it doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant scent that you expect from hair care products.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, and the positive health attributes it has for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never heard of this line but there were so many positive reviews I made a purchase.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this shampoo and felt it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to post a review without actually trying this AMAZING Shampoo!</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the shampoo and left it in my hair like it said I felt a tingling sensation which felt kind of nice.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair nice and soft!</li>
            <li>and my hair has never felt this soft and healthy!  </li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and healthy!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants soft, beautiful, healthy shiny hair ♡</li>
            <li>and my hair felt full and clean.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was not too rich, it feels like its just enough to keep the good stuff in the hair without the greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>and my hair felt full and clean.</li>
            <li>this year I wanted to try something more natural, I&#x27;m super glad</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I would most certainly re-order it again.</li>
            <li>It feels good knowing I&#x27;m using all natural ingredients and will definitely buy more products of maple holistics!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would be good on my color treated hair, clean, add moisture, and would feel like it was actually cleaning my hair without stripping it..  </li>
            <li>for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s with straight, fine, flyaway hair--I don&#x27;t even need to brush my hair anymore :)</li>
            <li>Super excited.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s all natural, no chemicals or sulfates, I would highly recommend everyone should try this shampoo, and the price is great too.</li>
            <li>so far so good, this shampoo is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li>This shampoo rates as the best I have ever found, ending a years long search for a natural shampoo that likes my hair.</li>
            <li>This product not only feels healthy, but it also does a great job at keeping my hair soft and moist.</li>
            <li>Its it nice shampoo, but i felt my hairs started to turn more grey</li>
            <li>The product is really amazing and natural.</li>
            <li>Because the shampoo was such a success, I purchased the Silk 18 conditioner, and let me tell you--this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d absolutely buy in bulk :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell and my hair is very manageable.</li>
            <li>Nice natural product.</li>
            <li>Sweet smell, makes my hair appear smoother and shiner.</li>
            <li>And it makes my hair full and bouncy...</li>
            <li>So I emailed him back saying I loved my two bottles that I got correctly</li>
            <li>It cleans your hair and scalp thoroughly, so be prepared to use a good conditioner afterward (such as their Silk 18).</li>
            <li>yes its true</li>
            <li>If the product holds true to what it says, then you got what you paid for.</li>
            <li>Already, my hair has more body, shine and texture to it - and is looking like real hair - not frizzy-foam.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand what many people are writing here regarding the lather feeling and what not.</li>
            <li>One day in the shower as I was using my Herbal Essence, I read the ingredients out of curiosity and had an idea: “I should invest in some actual good shampoo’s”.</li>
            <li>I am a true beleiver and will be stock piling this stuff.</li>
            <li>Much recommended. :]</li>
            <li>how fast it work I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet smelling but not the scent</li>
            <li>Good product , will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also such a good price.</li>
            <li>It also builds a nice lather, which I was concerned about since I hadn&#x27;t used a natural shampoo before.</li>
            <li>Not only Argan oil shampoo is sulfate free, it smells nice and the convination of the keratin treatment (now available in amazon too:</li>
            <li>I bought this with the Silk 18 Conditioner and actually prefer the shampoo as I have to use a TON of the conditioner to get good results.</li>
            <li>we really love this shampoo and my husband said it really helped his scalp.  </li>
            <li>I did not buy it up front because, frankly, I didn&#x27;t have much hope it would be any better than all the others.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells good too, will definitely will buy it again</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thought i have not seen drastic change after using this product but its good for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I expected my hair to be more silkier after using it, but maybe you&#x27;re supposed to use it with the same conditioner for best results.</li>
            <li>I decided to go full Maple Holistic force and use their Argan oil shampoo along with the silk vanilla conditioner.</li>
            <li>Now I know why they get such good reviews</li>
            <li>sulfates which I understand strip your hair of its own natural oils.  </li>
            <li>It would just be nice for there to be a simpler ingredients listed instead of the first two-thirds of the list looking like gibberish lol or for the bottle to come with a small info sheet on ALL the ingredients that you see in the list.</li>
            <li>She loved the smell, and the way the product left her hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is for sure my absolute favorite!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving the results, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>One day in the shower as I was using my Herbal Essence, I read the ingredients out of curiosity and had an idea: “I should invest in some actual good shampoo’s”.</li>
            <li>Like the conditioner, I cannot say enough good about this product.  </li>
            <li>Good simple shampoo that cleanses as it moisturizes.</li>
            <li>My wife recently came to the U.S. and she was looking for a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>Such a good find!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I noticed the shampoo and conditioner leaves no residue as my hair looks good even the next morning,.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hesitant to write &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; until the 6th or 7th date, being a modern woman and all.  </li>
            <li>All in all, leaves my hair clean, is mild so</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells as sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li>It lathered nicely, rinsed out easily and left my hair feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair about twice a week, if that, and always with cool water.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is really nice, it cleans the hair well but does not strip off natural hair oil (cause it contains argan oil).</li>
            <li>And you truly only need a quarter size amount to get good lather.</li>
            <li>I have tried many shampoos for her, and ordered her the Degreaser because her scalp is always very itchy.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m having good feed back....</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair really nice and soft, but it still has body.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very moisturizing and healthy.</li>
            <li>, I ordered the Silk 18 conditioner and can’t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell...</li>
            <li>First time trying Argan oil and so Far so good.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that I have to wash daily, sometimes more.</li>
            <li>new shampoo and making sure my ordering process went smoothly.</li>
            <li>The next time I used it, I used my normal styling products after shampooing, and was excited to see beautiful, full, shiny hair under control.  </li>
            <li>The ends of my hair HAD been dry, making me want to cut off a good 4&amp;#34;, and after using this shampoo - it was smooth as a baby&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>I am very very pleased with their customer service and look forward to trying the latest version of the Argan Shampoo as well as other products.  </li>
            <li>Using very small amounts and it works great!  </li>
            <li>very soft very fine.</li>
            <li>in two days it made a huge difference and my hair is much more soft now.</li>
            <li>My hair is now super shiny and because I have an ombre, the sulfate-free aspect of the shampoo is also helpful.</li>
            <li>i like touching them now :) i would definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li>This is my second order of Argan shampoo and it leaves me feeling satisfied and safe.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily hair and this removes oil and keeps hair smooth, shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I love all the fact that it&#x27;s all natural, sulfate free.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great to clean my hair and leaves it less frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, soft, shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>I do find that when you rinse it out I get a straw like feeling in my hair, but with the Silk 18 conditioner that goes away quickly and leaves my hair silky</li>
            <li>I have noticed a big difference in softness, more shiny, more body.</li>
            <li>This stuff is quite mild.</li>
            <li>I started using this shampoo and quickly realized how well balanced it was for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love that this shampoo is sulfate free and completely natural.</li>
            <li>We have members of our household with chemical sensitivities, but most fragrance free or natural shampoos are lacking in quality.  </li>
            <li>In just one use this shampoo softened and smoothed my hair, making it super manageable--as if it were conditioner.</li>
            <li>The fragranes are mild which I like.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays cleaner longer and is super shiny.  </li>
            <li>I believe the &amp;#34;Silk&amp;#34; Conditioner would compliment this product well and would love to try that next!! :))</li>
            <li>Used this for 3 weeks, it feels great on the hair but leave the hair thin.&lt;br /&gt;OK as shampoo, but don&#x27;t expect anything more (i.e. not effective for hair-loss)</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m in love with this brand &amp; will definitely be purchasing more from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m guessing I have a mild allergic reaction to something.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers beautifully and a little does the job.</li>
            <li>I am sure it was do to the oils in it; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The argan oil makes it suitable for more dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li>The latter is a super traditional oil known for making hair nice and shiny in my culture, so I knew this shampoo would be good.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the fragrance would be overwhelming, as I am sensitive to perfumes, I was happy to discover that the scent, while not light, is not too strong</li>
            <li>Had to use a lot to get it to clean right.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty brittle, as a rule, because of all the cheap, supermarket shampoos.</li>
            <li>From the very first time I used this shampoo - my problem went away - I&#x27;m NOT exaggerating.</li>
            <li>It blows my mind that this took care of my problem with the very first use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal healthy state.</li>
            <li>This product is very gentle with my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using a shampoo product emphasizing on sulfate free.</li>
            <li>The silk 18 conditioner though is something I am willing to try and hopefully I will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Why would you want a free product if you didn&#x27;t like it in the first place?  </li>
            <li>A noticeable difference from the very first time.</li>
            <li>If you first ever trying sulfate free shampoo, I would recommend try this product from Maple Holistics</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it my hair stopped impersonating a bale of straw.</li>
            <li>My normal 3 dollar suave professionals shampoo is so much better.</li>
            <li>This product has assisted in calming down the frizz, smells great</li>
            <li>This shampoo might be good for someone with super dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>I love Herbal Essence and all of the new scents, and products...</li>
            <li>The product itself does work its magic, after the first use my hair became very smooth and shine the next day.</li>
            <li>The lather feels silky and rich, and my hair is soft and very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>but if you leave it long enough and pair it with the silk 8 conditioner it works best with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel dry and brittle, gave it 2 stars because it made it on time, in good shape</li>
            <li>The scent is not as pleasant as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and full of body it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>It did last a lot longer than expected and is the perfect for taking on a trip, but for my at home bathroom I would definitely love a bigger bottle and even better if it had a pump.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon to tell the long term effects, but I can say that it sure lathers up well for a sulfate free product!</li>
            <li>It tends to dry out my hair,so I use a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>I did some research not too long ago to find the best product for my hair, that will not build up and that will make my hair come back to life after years of coloring.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo as it can be used for color treated hair and leaves it very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>We love all that is natural and that comes from nature!</li>
            <li>I love that this shampoo is all natural!</li>
            <li>/&gt;cost is slightly high for me, but I will invest the money if the product does what it says!!!</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this product and the fact that my hair was shining after the first use!</li>
            <li>I used this product for the third time tonight and still love it!</li>
            <li>Thanks Maple Holistics!!</li>
            <li>I am totally going to buy more!</li>
            <li>I assure you that you will be happy you made the jump.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Not a paid spokesperson or relative of Maple Holistics&amp;#34; - just a new customer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s hair products that make the top of my head itch, not dandruff or the like, but this shampoo would probably help a lot of scalp or dry hair problems.</li>
            <li>Together with the conditioner, which I also love, my hair is super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had more natural hair than I thought</li>
            <li>this is a very nice shampoo I use sulfate free shampoo for the past 5 years and my hair has increased in volume.</li>
            <li>It lathers better than most natural shampoos do, which is refreshing after using non-lathering shampoos for so long.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very smooth, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it makes it feel so much thicker.</li>
            <li>This one works good for me, my hair didn&#x27;t feel as dry before I applied the condition, so I&#x27;ll keep using!</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair that gets oily after a day.</li>
            <li>the hair moisturized nice thick consistency and has a tropical fruity smell wonder if there is an matching conditioner because it would be a perfect combo and most likely give you the full benefit of the shampoo that&#x27;s the only downside in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The shampoo works into a very nice lather even when using the recommended amount or less.</li>
            <li>For the amount you need you get a pretty decent lather, and I haven&#x27;t found that I&#x27;ve needed more than the recommended amount.</li>
            <li>I loved that it is sulfate free, I like the smell of it, but I had a little problem with the bottle, when I traveled the shampoo leaked, although I wrapped it well.</li>
            <li>The first wash did nothing special to my hair.</li>
            <li>No heaviness, no frizz, nice subtle scent, and best of all you don&#x27;t need half a cup full to get your hair clean.  </li>
            <li>(free of the &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; etc.), yet the ingredients list shows that it contains &amp;#34;Acrylates Copolymer&amp;#34; which is definitely NOT natural and I highly doubt it is good for you or your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was really shiny and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>Great product, while some of the reviews I read found it to be a negative that the product is virtually unscented, it&#x27;s a huge boon for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair and skin feel nourished and calm.</li>
            <li>Love that it is completely natural and healthy for my natural wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see a huge difference</li>
            <li>What makes this shampoo amazing besides being sulfate-free is that it does not rob my hair of moisture, but actually hydrates it!</li>
            <li>I have semi-thick, wavy, oily hair and each wash leaves me hair feeling smooth and much dryer.</li>
            <li>My shampoo arrived March 6th, and by 4/17, I had gone through maybe 40% of the bottle; so it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but so worth it.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, soft shiny hair and no itchy scalp/</li>
            <li>I had some success, but I just never found a recipe that I was sold on.  </li>
            <li>Love this all natural product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of in the middle.</li>
            <li>This does the job and leaves my hair bouncy and fresh.</li>
            <li>Money is worth it</li>
            <li>it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I love this all natural product.  </li>
            <li>but I decided to change what I put on my head to something more natural and ended up with this product.</li>
            <li>So instead, I wanted to try a more natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>So many added benefits from the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>there are no heavy perfume smells and it makes my hair look so healthy.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>However, I do wish there was more of a natural moisturizer agent in it.</li>
            <li>I got it on time and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is an investment, but one that is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Good lather, however not much in the way of fragrance.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I love maple holistics and it&#x27;s natural glowing products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, their products contain no harmful ingredients such as sulfates.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price for what you get.</li>
            <li>As a male I love that this shampoo is also fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I love all the natural ingredients in the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>something else (more masculine).</li>
            <li>This is a lovely shampoo if you are looking for something natural that you can use every day.  </li>
            <li>Still, you get what you pay for, and I think this is worth it.</li>
            <li>Another cool thing is that you can see all this after your first use.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>so a bigger size would be nice.</li>
            <li>love that is natural.</li>
            <li>So far, so good after using it along with the natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a sulfate-free, more natural alternative to nourish my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to clarify that the Silk18 conditioner I used, from the same seller, is the nice smelling product.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this a week ago and so far have used it many times.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels soft and looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>, maple holistics had incidentally sent me an email asking how I like their products, I responded honestly that their conditioner was terrific, and explained what I didn&#x27;t like about their shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I can only give this shampoo 3 stars to reflect my own experience.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo recently after doing a lot of research on the internet for Sulfate Free and Natural (good for colored hair) shampoos.</li>
            <li>This made my hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>honestly feels like a deep cleansing treatment and</li>
            <li>think the shampoo is worth trying.</li>
            <li>I would defiantly recommend to others, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I started out by making my own recipes I had found on the internet from various health blogs, but never found one that worked for me.</li>
            <li>If you DONT condition afterward, like most natural shampoos, it WILL leave it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have noticed my hair feels healthier, my scalp is better (but its winter so not totally flake free)</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean, soft, and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a nice, subtle aroma (strong odors are more of a turn off</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if my hair is any shinier but it feels much better over my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, manageable, not frizzy and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>My complimentary sample from Maple Holistics will run out soon</li>
            <li>I love this product it&#x27;s made my hair really soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>Once in a while I use another natural shampoo that conditions more.</li>
            <li>Love this all natural product.</li>
            <li>I like that it has all natural ingredients and is color safe.  </li>
            <li>(lathers nicely, hair shiny and soft), but I started to notice my scalp was really itchy between washings</li>
            <li>Now her hair is soft, shiny, and her ends look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li>Overall, I appreciate that the argan oil shampoo has more natural ingredients and will see if I notice more significant results.</li>
            <li>just a small amount of product to do the job it did for me is worth the money, not to mention that it is simply more healthy for my hair all around!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to repair their hair or just want soft lovely hair!!</li>
            <li>this shampoo is wonderful, my scalp feels relieved and calm, thank you.&amp;#34; The next use was a confirmation the oils in the shampoo work to restore moisture in the scalp by eliminating in one the oily hair and the dryness on the other.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was relatively reasonable compared to a lot of other organic shampoos and it had great reviews.</li>
            <li>very smooth for the first use, and you can feel how natural it is after finishing washing your hair: no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>Decent product, but it didn&#x27;t work for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, Full list of ingredients (which i really appreciate), but did slightly dry my hair out (In all fairness everything drys my hair</li>
            <li>it left my hair nice and soft, shiny, and clean!</li>
            <li>First things first, this shampoo does its job by getting my hair clean.</li>
            <li>Love the clean fragrance of this shampoo but for my hair, it clarified a bit too much - left it</li>
            <li>This doea the job but follow up a second wash for better clean.</li>
            <li>It does not bubble as much as the regular brand of shampoo, but it bubbles plenty enough and smells very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s good to have this for about three time a week (if you was every day) or every other wash if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers very well and leaves my hair soft, shiny, frizz-less and beautiful overall.</li>
            <li>while it’s good, I find that my hair is greasier looking than it is from using other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I had to use about two quarter sizes of the argan oil shampoo (one for the first wash and slightly more for the repeat) and for the 100% Pure stuff I used an amount a bit bigger than a silver dollar on the first wash and again on the repeat wash before I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>this one just sounded right after reading the ingredients.</li>
            <li>This right amount will depend on everybody&#x27;s hair types, hair volume and hair condition.</li>
            <li>Right from the start</li>
            <li>This shampoo is just right.</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t believe the people who say the smell goes away right away.</li>
            <li>I ordered by mistake and and tried to cancel nearly right after the order, but I couldnt.  </li>
            <li>Has the right amount of lather and gentleness in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It shipped out right away and was on time.</li>
            <li>I had to try it out right away and was amazed.</li>
            <li>To my surprise I was pleased with the results for not following with a conditioner, I think that says a lot right there!</li>
            <li>Most of the time I loose my hair or feel that the product is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>First , there is way to much lather for a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is pretty much fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It became frizzy and unmanageable, and so I tried a digital perm which left my hair beautiful and wavy... for about 2 months.</li>
            <li>Wow this a no BS product it is great my long curly hair loves it</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly because of the sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I can really feel that my hair is clean after using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Lathers really well, hair is clean.</li>
            <li>This was the first all natural shampoo that I tried and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I am usually very sensitive to strong smells, perfumes, etc</li>
            <li>I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners over the years and more recently searching for something that would really help and not just mask what was really going on with my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is more manageable, less straw-like, and has more life to it.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it left my hair soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling amazing after a long day of swimming and exposing your hair to chlorine.</li>
            <li>The price is a tad higher than the run-of-the-mill shampoos - but it is worth it to avoid a bunch of chemicals wreaking havoc on your hair.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product mostly because it is vegan friendly and contains my favorite oils such as argan, jojoba, avocado, almond.</li>
            <li>When it was long, it had to be in a ponytail and even then the tail had a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling especially clean afterwards, and I felt like my hair texture was a little rougher after use.</li>
            <li>This product has lefty hair feeling clean, soft, and full.  </li>
            <li>It smells pretty good as well, not too strong as some other natural shampoos.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use just this shampoo on my daughters fine hair and forgo the conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, but does keep her fine hair tangle free.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so soft, silky, full, and no frizz!  </li>
            <li>I just squeeze off the excess with my hand and let the residue kind drip dry.</li>
            <li>you can easily notice the &#x27;natural&#x27; feeling you get from the shampoo.</li>
            <li>It has a mild smell, and a gentle lather.</li>
            <li>product leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>After one use my hair feels extremely clean, it&#x27;s soft, and it&#x27;s super shiny.</li>
            <li>I have to say I love thus product; it cleaned my hair and it DID NOT dry out my curls.</li>
            <li>It lingers enough to make my hair smell softly clean when I sniff it, but it doesn&#x27;t punch me in the nose with strong perfumes every time I brush it or take it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just easy to handle and last clean for a while</li>
            <li>I just ordered different kind this time because I want to try all of them:)I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t say that you&#x27;ll have earth-shattering, clean and healthy hair after using this, but it might very well be overall better than what you&#x27;re currently using and is worth a try if you&#x27;re in the market for a healthier shampoo.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfumed fragrance and feels like made from all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Similarly, you would deprive your body of important ingredients by choosing cheap food options.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft &amp; combs out easily.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t purchase again, any natural shampoo at whole foods would be better.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiney; plus, I really like that it is safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Also Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner leaves my hair shiny &amp; soft, easy to manage .</li>
            <li>I am a very natural, chemical free, and holistic person and this fits the bill for me.</li>
            <li>Does a good job as far as in cleaning but left my hair very very tangled and not moisturized.</li>
            <li>It actually lathers really well, which is something i haven&#x27;t found to be true with many shampoos.</li>
            <li>The 100% Pure shampoo was $25 for a 13oz bottle, and like I said, I had to use much more than the Maple Holistics shampoo, so it was more money for less product</li>
            <li>I have very super fine hair and damaged from blow dry.</li>
            <li>i love this product as it left my hair feeling lovely and soft and is really shiny</li>
            <li>Very much recommended.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo very much</li>
            <li>I got the Argan shampoo and it arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend trying this shampoo for yourself !</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every other day, and by the morning of the second day, my scalp would be incredibly oily and itchy.</li>
            <li>It sounds better than other products which use whatever chemicals available.</li>
            <li>so far it fine.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean, shiny, soft, very manageable, and smelling clean.  </li>
            <li>and so it works through very easy even on my long hair.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my hair was super soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li>We live a pretty simple life and don&#x27;t use many personal care products, but this is one that I am glad exists!</li>
            <li>My scalp is naturally oily, but this shampoo introduces just the right amount of oil to your hair and scalp that it leaves you with a clean finish.</li>
            <li>UNTIL I did some extensive research and finally decided on trying this amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>, it seems like my hair is softer and just feels better overall.  </li>
            <li>it just feels so light and soft.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews I am glad I purchased this product!</li>
            <li>First sulphate-free shampoo that has worked well</li>
            <li>I recently received the Silk 18 conditioner and fell in love with it</li>
            <li>It is, however, &amp;#34;Considered safe based on assumption of low absorption.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>At first it didnt seem to be working</li>
            <li>so it likely wouldnt get better overnight.  </li>
            <li>But I do use the Silk 18 from the same company and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I rinse with hot water on the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; days.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and so do my teen daughters.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the argan oil shampoo and tried it for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li>I have been searching for quality shampoo and conditioner for fine, dry hair when I found this shampoo that is Sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I tried a couple products that were semi-organic (as in, they used mostly organic ingredients but were not entirely organic).</li>
            <li>In a rush I began looking into organic shampoos again, and this is my first purchase.</li>
            <li>I definitely need a trim, but I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Even after the first time using this product I felt the difference.</li>
            <li>First time  </li>
            <li>Thanks Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li>I was always very self-conscious about my scalp problem - and the flaking even extended into my beard!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different and expensive products &amp; never received the kind of shine &amp; softness that these products have given my hair!!!</li>
            <li>i used it today for the first time along with the silk conditioner, and my hair feels AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before buying it looks bit expensive to me but after using it I can say this is one of the best shampoo for hair after keratin treatment and for hair fall problem too.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li>At first I was thinking this was a bit pricey -</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I began to read about many different products and decided to take a chance with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased enough that I can see ordering it again.</li>
            <li>The bottle seems to be a lot smaller than what I am used to getting, I was expecting somewhat more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2015 came around and of course I had the same resolutions as every one else “to be healthy, inside and out” and “taking care of myself”</li>
            <li>I saw instant improvement, my frizz was tamed, my hair was more manageable, I was ecstatic.</li>
            <li>I’ve used your product many times now, my hair can’t get enough of it.</li>
            <li>Moisture is absolutely necessary for hair to stay healthy.</li>
            <li>However, I apply more than the regular quantity when I want to take off the oil from my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also able to only wash my hair every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>This is the first organic shampoo that I&#x27;ve bought and it will most likely be what I use from now on.</li>
            <li>I am most definitely buying again</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>It is exactly how it&#x27;s described.</li>
            <li>Sulfate free and natural.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these products and will continue to buy them in the future.</li>
            <li>(I see that someone mentioned people getting offers for free products in return for reviews.....</li>
            <li>(Oh, it also comes in a pretty bottle...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is not for me.</li>
            <li>FIRST OFF</li>
            <li>It is sulfate free which does not damage hair of all types and helps retain the natural nutrients that are found in hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I just purchased this product for the first time and have been using it for about a week</li>
            <li>And unlike a lot of sulfate-free shampoos, this cleans and foams really well!</li>
            <li>Shipment is fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase and will definitely re-order the product.</li>
            <li>In short, I am hoping with love and care, restoration will happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the wash it was smooth  and soft.  </li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today, lathered well</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing this shampoo and didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try and used it first time today.</li>
            <li>ALONG WITH SILK18 CONDITIONER HAS LEFT MY SCALP BETTER THAN EVER.</li>
            <li>I am going to reorder soon because my wife love it too after only one wash.</li>
            <li>I felt a difference in my hair after the first wash but the overall look and appearance of my hair seems to continue getting better after each wash.</li>
            <li>well first, then shampoo your hair.</li>
            <li>There was barely any lather at all even on the repeat wash, and I felt like I had to use much more than the Maple Holistics shampoo just to cover my whole head.</li>
            <li>Actually I think it was more.</li>
            <li>The customer follow up is outstanding, Maple Holistics seems actually concerned about selling a quality product.</li>
            <li>It lathers well on first application and even better if you follow the instructions for the second application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I have oily hair, I think I should try the DeGrease shampoo first before giving this a 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick with the Sage shampoo even though I don&#x27;t have dandruff, because the Sage shampoo leaves my hair amazingly soft, smooth and shiny, without me adding any styling products.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and the Silk 18 conditioner too!</li>
            <li>No matter what conditioners and hair products you apply after, too many washings leave your hair stripped of essential oils and your hair will suffer.  </li>
            <li>My mom was the first person to use it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what happened the first time.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizerizing, untangled my hair (nice slip), and overall, conditioned very well.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling smooth with a natural shine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that much of a smell, but I use the Silk 18 conditioner afterwards which gives my hair a fresh vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>So this shampoo wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was thinking it was going to be....</li>
            <li>My hair is already pretty long, but I haven&#x27;t had any success getting more growth.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;2015 came around and of course I had the same resolutions as every one else “to be healthy, inside and out” and “taking care of myself”</li>
            <li>I saw instant improvement, my frizz was tamed, my hair was more manageable, I was ecstatic.</li>
            <li>I’ve used your product many times now, my hair can’t get enough of it.</li>
            <li>The first two times I used this my hair felt like straw after rinsing until I used conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wait until now to write this review because I want to make sure that my non-hair loss is credit for this shampoo and not only credit for my pregnancy&#x27;s hormones.</li>
            <li>A dime size portion is more than enough.  </li>
            <li>My only beef is that i wish there more of a fruity/peachy or avocado or almond scent to it as that was one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and did not need much for a nice lather.</li>
            <li>so it is important to me that this is all natural.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when the time comes.</li>
            <li>(Seborrheic dermatitis).I have been using this shampoo weekly and after the first 2 weeks I have not seen one flake.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>And so began my quest for the magic wand that would convert said straw back into silk.</li>
            <li>The first one I tried was one from Acure Organics.</li>
            <li>The only con is that I wish it smelled better</li>
            <li>I look forward to continuing my use of this product and purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>The natural extracts made my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Now I am interested in trying the Silk 18 conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is first time i am using Argon oil Shampoo</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for several weeks and it gets better each time.</li>
            <li>They really do have 100% satisfaction guaranteed!</li>
            <li>Great product especially for my long, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>It does produce suds, much more on the second wash  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First, I used sage shampoo.</li>
            <li>The biggest plus is the use of natural ingredients and sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>Her first application</li>
            <li>Its makes my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today,  lathered well</li>
            <li>Then I used blonde glam conditioner (which I love)</li>
            <li>so I would probably recommend only using the conditioner at most every two days.</li>
            <li>I received a discount coupon upon my first order and</li>
            <li>Would love if it came in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve definitely notice a change in my hair for the better.</li>
            <li>I just received this shampoo yesterday, so my first wash was this AM.  </li>
            <li>From the first use my hair is softer and shinier than it has been in years.  </li>
            <li>I recently was able to try your product over the holidays at a relatives house.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>My hair feels thicker within the first 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Love the shine it gave back to my hair and the fullness it has now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing....&amp; that one Paul Mitchell set I splurged on;).</li>
            <li>I wonder if the Sage shampoo for heavy dandruff has a good Spikenard smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thinner hair (which makes me super self-conscious since I&#x27;m only in my early 30s), but this shampoo has done a great done of providing moisture to my scalp without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>We even tried other types of sulfate free shampoos with no luck - he breaks out with many large sores on his scalp...except with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I do like the way it makes my hair feel and love that it barely has a smell to it as some shampoos have such a strong smell that can be over powering when you smell them.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo, my hair feel more smoothly and less fizzy. .</li>
            <li>This has an odd smell ... not quite as much vanilla as the conditioner, but it does not smell good to me.</li>
            <li>It works up into a nice thick lather and rinses out easily.</li>
            <li>If you write a positive review and email it to the company they will send a free gift, mine was another full size of the same Argon oil shampoo</li>
            <li>decided to chop off my perm damaged hair and just go natural!!!!</li>
            <li>it uses more natural ingredients than most other shampoos.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers nicely using only a very small amount of product, which makes it a good value.  </li>
            <li>Contrary to the many positive experiences I read about this method, it actually ended up damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>We usually never spend this much on a hair product since she gets them cheap since she coupons</li>
            <li>luckily, the smell isn&#x27;t present after the shower is over, but i guess you don&#x27;t get as much of the &amp;#34;ahhhh&amp;#34; clean feeling in the shower as with something that smells fresh and fragrant.</li>
            <li>I spent this much money in a natural product that would make my hair healthy and it made my hair break more.</li>
            <li>I will most certainly purchase again and make it my daily shampoo.  </li>
            <li>However, my hair feels and looks amazing and my scalp is not irritated like with 90% of other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I will never use any other kind of shampoo again</li>
            <li>I will try their other products since this one was quite nice.</li>
            <li>This shampoo  one the other hand visibly soothes your hair no matter what kind of hair you have</li>
            <li>Not sure why so many people had such a good experience with it.</li>
            <li>I sought a shampoo that does not use damaging chemicals or leave residue; I cannot attest to the truth of these claims, but thus far I have not noticed significant residue.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is rich and conditioning, and cleans without stripping the hair of its natural oils.  </li>
            <li>Maple Holistics has a new loyal customer &amp; that says a lot, since I am not the type of person to commit to 1 brand.</li>
            <li>Since it does such a great job on the dandruff, I can live with that, but I might try their conditioner on my next order.</li>
            <li>I was looking around Whole Foods one day and noticed many shampoos that were “sulfate free” and started to try out this new “hype”, I chose their 2Chic Avocado &amp; Olive Oil for dry, damaged hair shampoo/conditioner/mask.</li>
            <li>I was looking around Whole Foods one day and noticed many shampoos that were “sulfate free” and started to try out this new “hype”, I chose their 2Chic Avocado &amp; Olive Oil for dry, damaged hair shampoo/conditioner/mask.</li>
            <li>I was comfortable with the ingredient list, and then once I used it, I was happy with the lack of a fake fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend who has unprocessed hair experienced the same issues with this.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable as natural and sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised of how clean my scalp feels after using this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel irritated, and my hair is soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Clean, soft and shine.</li>
            <li>Using this combined with Silk 18 however my hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and clean; I like conditioner for smoothness.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and wavy, and my hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li>Make sure not to use too much, just the recommended use (a quarter-size), works just like a regular shampoo that&#x27;s foamy and bubbly.</li>
            <li>And at first it did - my hair was super shiny and soft after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only thing, I wish they had bigger bottles, BUT, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>I am only giving 4 stars because it&#x27;s going to taken more to see if there are real changes in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked the feel of my hair when it was wet, but it do much for the dryness.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it makes my hair feel so soft and like that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and clean without completely stripping it of its natural oils--this means I can go up to 4 days before another wash :)</li>
            <li>I really like this product with winter being so harsh this product makes my scalp feel good.</li>
            <li>Even though this is shampoo is more expensive than most the ones I have used before, but I think it is totally worthy!</li>
            <li>Super soft and manageable!  </li>
            <li>I am a fan of Amazon, so started searching around and stumbled upon maple holistics products and noticed plenty of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I had read all the positive reviews, and with the price, I thought...it cannot hurt....</li>
            <li>However, because there were positive comments from others, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Especially it is organic devoid of strong chemical in generic shampoos that one gets at superstores.&lt;br /&gt;Really happy with the finding and this product.</li>
            <li>It provides just the right amount of conditioning and my hair feels healthier with decent volume.</li>
            <li>At first I think it&#x27;s very sticky in my hair</li>
            <li>When in fact, very drying synthetic components are listed first.</li>
            <li>It really feels exactly the way a shampoo should...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much scentless</li>
            <li>I was searching for a good shampoo and tried lots before I decided to try a natural shampoo instead, so I started searching for a good natural shampoo and was really anxious to finally get to try this one.</li>
            <li>With this shampoo, I did not get much lather the first time I washed my hair, so I felt like I needed to repeat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using shampoo altogether</li>
            <li>Honestly, I thought there was nothing that could really solve the issue or return some of the natural texture of my hair back to what it once was till I tried this shampoo!!</li>
            <li>I decided to try some sulfate free shampoo to see if it would help to restore my hair back to smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and full looking...</li>
            <li>You know &amp;#34;good old soap&amp;#34; full of &amp;#34;good old&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Sometimes shampoo can be harsh for natural hair, but this leaves my hair feeling amazing and clean.</li>
            <li>I have normal hair and leaves my hair feeling and looking soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Just so the women know - my wife is very particular about her shampoo / hair care products so for her to switch products</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry and frizzy hair and have tried so many products to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I was worried because when I got out of the shower, my hair was super tangly but that is just how my hair is naturally.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I have really dry hair and wanted more moisture and shine.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks healthier, it has more shine and it doesn&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li>but whenever I use it, my hair stays clean for several days and seems extra healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased with this shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>I use this with Silk12, and my hair feels a lot better than when I used normal commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li>Since shampoo/conditioner is basically the only product in my hair, it&#x27;s easy for me to compare one shampoo brand with another.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I stated earlier, it is frizzy and damaged, but it also gets greasy easily.</li>
            <li>This shampoo along with the silk18 makes my hair super soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Most moisturizer shampoos ACTUALLY leave residues in the hair and DONT clean your hair, so if your shampoo leaves your hair with a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feeling then its ACTUALLY cleaning your hair.</li>
            <li>My only issue with this shampoo is the strong scent it has.</li>
            <li>I have allergies especially with smells that are too strong (perfume like).  </li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t like to use a sampoo with strong odor.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo following a strong keratin treatment of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin around the hair line that is easily irritated by harsh chemicals found in many shampoos.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or just want to use more natural products, I would HIGHLY recommend both the Argan Oil shampoo and the Silk 18 conditioner--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;ve only started using it, I can already tell it&#x27;s much more healthy than your conventional shampoo.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it claims to be color safe but washes off color every single time.   </li>
            <li>Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer has large molecules that do not penetrate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will however warn off people on using a large quantity of shampoo as it will still result in drying of hair and will take away all the moisture.</li>
            <li>but I certainly recommend it for others to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As claimed, my scalp and hair feels more alive and not feeling dry or freezy after only the first wash.&lt;br /&gt;hair feels fuller with better texture  after my 1st wash.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>for I could tell right away that my hair was squeaky clean; however, the real test came later on when I missed washing my hair one day!  </li>
            <li>My main reason for trying something new was to get away from the Shea buttery smell of Shea moisture, but I now realize how mild that shampoo is.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased the conditioner and was delighted by the yummy vanilla smell and natural qualities.</li>
            <li>I like that the ingredients are natural, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong and lingering smell, and I like the way it makes my hair sooo soft.  </li>
            <li>After I dried my hair, it was very soft and had good volume.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about this product but certainly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who colors their hair, uses a flat iron, and likes soft and silky hair with a nice shine and no residue.  </li>
            <li>The second one smelled like a baby shampoo and didn&#x27;t foam rich like the first one.</li>
            <li>I think that this is a very high quality product.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just called 100% Pure because that&#x27;s all it really says on the bottle</li>
            <li>I only has to use a very small amount to clean my hair, and the shampoo smells very nice.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty happy with this shampoo, rinses clean and does not leave a residue behind.</li>
            <li>I bought this at the same time as the Maple Holistics Silk18 Conditionera little over a month ago and will definitely order this product again but may try to pair it with another conditioner for the best results.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair much easier to comb and leaves it feeling soft and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>Amazing for those who need moisturizing properties for their everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most I&#x27;ve ever spent on shampoo is $25 for a 25.35oz bottle of TIGI Diamond Dreams shampoo at my salon (much cheaper here on Amazon).</li>
            <li>I just love how amazon time and again directs me to products that were not even remotely on my radar and then are so much of a contribution to a happier life.</li>
            <li>I tried the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; route for my hair but everything seems to make my hair really oily and eventually devolves into dandruff which I&#x27;ve never had before.</li>
            <li>It immediately stopped the dandruff and my hair feels so much softer and manageable.</li>
            <li>I like them both so much that I already ordered another pair.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for hair products that are also gentle to my skin; I seem to always break out when I use unnatural shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Well, yes, a woman did recommend this shampoo when she noticed me surreptiously scratching my itchy scalp ( very nonchalantly I thought )</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I found it leave residue on my scalp even though I carefully washed to make sure all of shampoo are off.  </li>
            <li>this product is very moisturizing, that is what I am looking for.</li>
            <li>I have to really scratch to get any dandruff to fall and</li>
            <li>Considering the results, I can’t really complain about the price, not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>and my hair was really suffering.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>, Thank you so much Maple Holistic,  please tray it</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth giving a shot if you want soft, shiny, manageable hair.</li>
            <li>Make the hair very greasy</li>
            <li>Using this product my hair has been very manageable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week, and I really do like it.</li>
            <li>It cleans your hair well and it also makes it feel very supple and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what ingredient, or synergy of ingredients, is responsible for curing my problem - but please never stop making this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though it doesn&#x27;t create much lather</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll really like it.</li>
            <li>MAke my hair so much easier to take care of</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is easier to comb my hair since it doesn&#x27;t take much to set it the way I want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was using L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate Free shampoo for the last few years, which smelled nice but wasn&#x27;t too hydrating.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but I can feel that my hair is gently cleansed.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care though since it really damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally very curly hair (3B).</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it, so that is appreciated.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo along with the Silk 18 conditioner about a month ago, and I can really see and feel a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>After so much research, I decide on this item.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo was the only one after hours of searching that fit all my requirements.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really foam well because of the non toxic ingredients</li>
            <li>It is also very shiny.</li>
            <li>VERY DECEPTIVE.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t go very well with it</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>It really did repair my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>but it has made my hair much softer and easier to handle while brushing.</li>
            <li>As much as this kills me I have to give 3 stars.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair moisturized and does not smell too much.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a neutral smell; it doesn&#x27;t give off much of an aroma.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Not a fan of the smell, since I really like the aroma of the Winter Blend Shampoo.</li>
            <li>He has very oily hair and his scalp often feels itchy.  </li>
            <li>I color my hair and needed something gentle that would leave my hair shiny and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I really like</li>
            <li>I really like the product and will continue to use it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>This shampoo really let my hair so shine.</li>
            <li>My hair is now back to where it was before the vacation, and I hope few more washes will make my hair much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Recently I had an keratin treatment on my hair and wanted to use a sulfate free sampoo.</li>
            <li>my scalp is not irritating and hair is silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>Its totally organic and free of harmful ingredients products.</li>
            <li>I did not find much difference, in fact, my hair started falling after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I just tried this shampoo and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Really like this shampoo.....</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very moist though.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>used it and wants to buy some as well.</li>
            <li>; straight, curly, wavy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair shining and it is much easier to style and control after washing it.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell</li>
            <li>The Silk 18 conditioner really makes your hair shine.</li>
            <li>My hair texture after felt much softer and not like</li>
            <li>that makes my hair very manageable pictures</li>
            <li>My problem however is that my hair is very oily, so much so that I must shampoo quite often, and when I miss my hair looks and feels so oily that I can&#x27;t wait to wash it.  </li>
            <li>I do not see as much hairfall or dryness.</li>
            <li>and I have very curl hair</li>
            <li>no matter how much I put oil on them, but</li>
            <li>It works very well with the silk 18 conditioner.  </li>
            <li>As much as I wanted to buy it again I don&#x27;t think I will be.</li>
            <li>and I had to use about twice as much shampoo per shot than the argan oil stuff.</li>
            <li>really is worth the price, so I do intend to buy this shampoo again when I run out - actually the bigger 16 oz bottle, and maybe 3 of them since there&#x27;s a discount on the website when you buy 2 or more -</li>
            <li>Really made my hair feel like straw.  </li>
            <li>My hair has improved so much, to begin with reduced hairfall and hair with some life.</li>
            <li>My scalp seems to really like something about this product.</li>
            <li>If I decide to skip a day or two of shampooing, I really don’t get that itchiness anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle on my hair/scalp</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really bother me, but it is a shampoo after all</li>
            <li>I started using this product along with a silk conditioner and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I am giving it three stars because my friend who I gave it too said she like it and appreciated the non-harsh ingredients (I didnt feel like going through the hassle of a return on an inexpensive item).</li>
            <li>Very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolute perfection.  </li>
            <li>Too slim and fast used up.</li>
            <li>but it works absolute WONDERS on my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has felt and looked so much healthier.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed that my hair is not falling as much.  </li>
            <li>May need conditioner along with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion, beside the fact that this is a sulfate free shampoo, I am not impress with the performance of this shampoo as of yet (used this shampoo for several weeks now).</li>
            <li>The shampoo, for me, didn&#x27;t translate very well.</li>
            <li>It lathers really really well.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleans really well.</li>
            <li>Not too much fragrance for those who are bothered by that.  </li>
            <li>My hair is softer and looks so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>So in addition to being sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be fragranced and is white</li>
            <li>Come to think of it, it didn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance.</li>
            <li>Cleans my hair well and makes it very shiny.</li>
            <li>It really does moisturize my hair, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any residue in it.</li>
            <li>As soon as you rinse it out, your hair feels like you have been in a pool with too much chlorine.</li>
            <li>Really didnt care for this product..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really improved the quality and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li>I can see a visible difference in the condition of my hair - it is so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Tried the much recommended Wen but got chemical burns on my ear tops.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much .</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I have have tried several sulfate free shampoos</li>
            <li>We did always use the Silk conditioner too which left us tangle free.</li>
            <li>As a side note, we cant really tell any difference between using the Nexus conditioner or the Silk conditioner after using the Argan shampoo.</li>
            <li>I do Keratin treatments on my hair, so I am very picky</li>
            <li>It is definitely a quality product and clearly it works very well for many people.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair straight and it gives shine!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wash my hair in the kitchen sink and set the timer for 3 minutes, masaging the whole time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Plus, it really cleans my hair and scalp, and my hair isn&#x27;t quite as frizzy.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo,  </li>
            <li>It is creamy and gentle</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t bubble too much</li>
            <li>Overall, I am excited to see how my hair feels and looks after using it a few more times!</li>
            <li>really well-</li>
            <li>Really like this Argan oil shampoo.</li>
            <li>u don&#x27;t need a whole lot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having very curly hair, I needed a shampoo that would keep my hair from frizzing, while not weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>wife and I really like the shampoo because of all the oils included.</li>
            <li>But using a shampoo for volume dries it out too much.  </li>
            <li>The combination of the Maple Holistics shampoo and conditioner works very well.</li>
            <li>very soothing; makes my scalp pain go away</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo and just used it once, but my hair feels real soft in the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i really like this.</li>
            <li>I am converting my entire house to chemical free and started in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>The combination of this shampoo and the Silk 18 purchase has really conditioned my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not too much lather, and rinses well.  </li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>&amp; I can tell you that my hair color lasts so much longer than it ever has.</li>
            <li>This all natural shampoo does the job and leaves my hair silky, bouncy and fresh.</li>
            <li>My hair looks fuller and is very shiny.</li>
            <li>so I am not ready to say I love it.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo to me really has no scent at all.</li>
            <li>so you feel like you are really cleaning your hair</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair though</li>
            <li>I wanted a gentle shampoo.</li>
            <li>and i really like it....</li>
            <li>It lathers up very well - unlike some sulfate-free shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li>I found that using this shampoo alone creates a very drying affect on my hair.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t have any scent to it, even a light scent.</li>
            <li>Easter Basket!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, and I appreciate the company emailing me to see if I like their product.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This shampoo is gentle and creamy.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo does wash very well.</li>
            <li>I think it really helps to leave the shampoo in your hair for a couple of minutes before rinsing.  </li>
            <li>but it lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>*! thanks.</li>
            <li>The company is very considerate of its patrons.</li>
            <li>thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m spoiling my hair, on the contrary it gently washes it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients sounded promising, but I would not buy this shampoo again because I do not like the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>It does, however, leave my fine, dry hair feeling soft and full.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my colored hair and rinses well.</li>
            <li>After researching and reading reviews for a dozen different natural shampoos, this was top 5 on my list, so I purchased it.</li>
            <li>But I am switching back to my old product, which worked better.</li>
            <li>I have used many different shampoos on my naturally wavy hair and this made it feel softer and cleaner than anything I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>so i am pleased with the result at such an early stage,</li>
            <li>Sometimes i felt the hair is soft but when i run my fingers through my hair it was kind of rough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the two sudsing method the directions say to, but with my short hair, one application gives me nice lather so next time</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend this natural shampoo to my girl :)./</li>
            <li>I love the smell and make my hear very smooth without being heavy or flat.  </li>
            <li>I love that my scalp is clean but is not dried out or &#x27;tight&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t last long; after applying Silk 18 conditioner my hair became smooth and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>He said this really helped soothe his scalp and it left his hair soft and very clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>She says her hair has never felt so soft and she is right</li>
            <li>Also, my hair is not &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; which used to be the case with other shampoos; it is glossy and has a nice natural sheen to it;  the color also seems to be brighter.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a really good shampoo, cleans the hair well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp unlike other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have combination hair, oily on the top and super dry from middle to the end.  </li>
            <li>There was no strong smell of any kind to the product which makes no difference to me.  </li>
            <li>It has made my hair very soft after the first use.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>However, she has requested I buy her the Argan shampoo and Silk 18 because they have made her long, fine hair so much easier to comb out.</li>
            <li>The reason I decided to try this shampoo was two-fold: I have suffered from eczema and psoriasis for most of my life, and as I am getting older, I&#x27;m finding that not only is my skin becoming more sensitive, but my flare-ups are much worse when I come in contact with chemicals and fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I figured maybe my shedding was due to something else, so I used this 3 more times over the course of two weeks, but my hair did not stop falling out.</li>
            <li>This means there are more of those ingredients in the product than the other oils advertised.</li>
            <li>But third wash onwards, the lumps of hair during hair wash just reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>But it is still more affordable than the other hair fall control shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>Simply it is a great product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but I have tried so many other shampoos including dove</li>
            <li>I ordered this shampoo because I enjoyed the other Maple Holistic shampoos.</li>
            <li>It does seem to need more than some other shampoos in order to lather.  </li>
            <li>I used the Argan Oil Shampoo for the first time today and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much better when I use this than other shampoos.</li>
            <li>My hair stays healthy looking and it helps balance the frizzy flyaways that I tend to get with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itchy like many other shampoos have done.</li>
            <li>After the first use my hair was as  soft and shiny as it is after leaving the salon!  </li>
            <li>Better than other brands Ive used.</li>
            <li>I’ve also noticed a significant decrease in the amount of frizz and a big improvement in shine.</li>
            <li>Especially using it in the winter I had major drying and static.  </li>
            <li>More moisturizing than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I looked up each and every ingredient, and Maple Holistics is true to its word: the most of chemicals used are from natural ingredients, none of it is harsh harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that in conjunction with spraying pure argan oil directly onto my scalp and the use of this shampoo I will be able to combat my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have previously used this brand&#x27;s sage shampoo and liked it for the subtle, pleasant, natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>Also, although it felt wonderful on my scalp, and left my scamp and hair clean, the first time I used it I did not follow up with a conditioner and my hair was very coarse and difficult to comb out after shampooing.</li>
            <li>I have bought several different natural shampoos in the past, and haven&#x27;t been overly impressed, but I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li>My hair actually feels clean...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a week now, and I have long, undyed fine hair.</li>
            <li>This just makes me feel clean, as simple as that.</li>
            <li>would either make it too dry that they can break easily or too silky to show any volume at all.</li>
            <li>I have fine long hair that has been colored.</li>
            <li>I have recently tried a co-wash shampoo/conditioner and don&#x27;t feel like my hair and scalp were really clean.  </li>
            <li>However, after several washings with this shampoo, my hair is now clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>this shampoo seems to have done as good a job as we could hope for, we&#x27;re assuming by not being so harsh on the hair (without all the sulfates and whatnot apparently).</li>
            <li>have been using sulfate free shampoo for years, part of a decision to live as organically as possible</li>
            <li>Both the Argan Oil shampoo and Silk 18 conditioner take very little to be effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely light feeling, but cleans my hair very well and doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all.</li>
            <li>for my dry, itchy skin, I believe it is too soon to see if natural products work, however it does seem to be getting a bit better.</li>
            <li>Including after the shower, my gel process, and air dry, my hair felt soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Paired with the silk conditioner, my hair felt much lighter, combed through easily in the shower and after applying my natural  products (I use pure argon oil and a bit of shea moisture curl milk then let air dry).</li>
            <li>Worked very well left my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a natural hair shampoo</li>
            <li>First, I like this shampoo for what it doesn&#x27;t contain, namely, a lot of harmful chemicals; second, I like it because it contains a lot of natural ingredients known to be good for hair, and third, I like the way it leaves my hair, shiny and soft, and fourth, I like the way it smells, a really pretty scent that&#x27;s not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It came out better the second time, but I think I would go back to using Aveeno shampoo unless Maple Holistics other shampoos works better.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the amount of lather, no it was not as much as my old shampoo, but more then enough!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>After just the first use my hair felt soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft and really shiny!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t shed as much hair as normal after use</li>
            <li>like I normally would so don&#x27;t know how it would affect that, but I really like the way my hair felt.</li>
            <li>After two bottles my hair went flat and felt un clean.</li>
            <li>You only need a little for it to give a good lather</li>
            <li>This is my new shampoo!  </li>
            <li>but brand new, as I could never wear it!</li>
            <li>Helped my hair gain new life again!</li>
            <li>I will buy again and use as my new routine!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try the product at first, fearing another breakout, but had high hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have a reaction to the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my long, fine, thin hair soft, full and with a nice shine.</li>
            <li>My dry, long hair is looking much better!  </li>
            <li>Apparently I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>This is a HUGE feat, considering I&#x27;ve been having itchy &amp; dry scalp for over 15 years now.</li>
            <li>After a month and a half I continue seeing improvement and feel much better.  </li>
            <li>but then we always expect a lot more for a lot less and that NEVER happens.</li>
            <li>My hair gets frizzly and dry during the winter time and this shampoo made my hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>importantly, hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using it.</li>
            <li>After using it my dry hair looked silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I recently dyed my hair red and purchased this product when it said it was color safe.  </li>
            <li>If you have a scalp problem, you know how super embarrassing it is to have to constantly brush away a pile of while powder from your shoulders.</li>
            <li>I am now a loyal customer -- this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li>That made it tempting enough for me to use a second time, but with another hunk of hair in the shower drain, I just could not use it again no matter how fabulous my hair looked!</li>
            <li>It clean my hair very well and won&#x27;t get it dry.  </li>
            <li>Also, all of my soaps, body and face lotion, and even hand sanitizers are now all chemical free and with either essential oils or natural products.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo ~ it only took one use of another product to send me back</li>
            <li>So, my older sister purchased this for me about a month ago</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been only using this shampoo and some argan oil, and my hair has definitely changed for the better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay,  not the best but not the worst.</li>
            <li>my main focus is products that won&#x27;t leave my hair looking like twine, corn husks or overcooked spaghetti by noon.  </li>
            <li>Scent is mild, doesn&#x27;t lather the way regular shampoos do...</li>
            <li>The main problem is my hair that it is overly frizzy.</li>
            <li>the older I get).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Water is the main ingredient</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Overall love the product and don&#x27;t plan on going back to the drug store brand junk.</li>
            <li>Very soft and lathers really well.</li>
            <li>It went from dry, tangled, and oily to silky soft, tangle-free, and beautifully clean!</li>
            <li>it definitely leaves my hair feeling clean, soft, and silky for days!</li>
            <li>My hair felt different after the very first wash.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft after wash!</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t need hair conditioner - the hair is very soft!</li>
            <li>Regular shampoos also lather right away, so you don&#x27;t REALLY need to wash your hair twice</li>
            <li>No dry ends, no limp hair, no bad scents, no chemicals.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest the argan shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you feel you need to know for yourself, like me, then buy this, otherwise I highly recommend Shea Moisture products.</li>
            <li>Will highly recommend it,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I will be ordering again and highly recommend both the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>We searched on amazon.com for shampoos with high rating and came across this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying Maple Holistic products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- 1 star because of its high price per volume.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It also has a very lovely subtle smell.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money buying other Shampoos - get this one, trust me, you will love your hair again.</li>
            <li>Compared to other natural shampoos I&#x27;ve seen and the one I bought, the price is definitely better.</li>
            <li>It does give me more volume and thicken hair, somehow I feel it little frizzy and tangle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I have a cute little Afro.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, but a little to pricey</li>
            <li>but it could use a little more potency though,</li>
            <li>Usually a little while after straightening it, my hair starts tangling and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d be able to get my fingers through it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fresh, clean and FLUFFY.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot fine, long blond hair and my old shampoo was too drying.</li>
            <li>Often I&#x27;ve tried natural shampoos being careful to steer clear of all the chemicals in most shampoos, and been less than satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Our hair is soft and feels very light - not weighted down.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this product to help my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I went back to my previous shampoo (Burt&#x27;s Bees baby shampoo) and continued using Maple Holistic&#x27;s Silk 18 conditioner (love it!)</li>
            <li>Left my hair super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>But this shampoo somehow does the trick for keeping my hair clean and shiny without weighing down or making my fine curls frizzy or flat</li>
            <li>I have been reading about the negative effects of SLS and similar sulfates, i.e. how it is used in many shampoos because it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>so far nothing that is noticeable really</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick going in</li>
            <li>So far really like this.  </li>
            <li>So far, I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was shocked; instead it curled then even more!!!!</li>
            <li>Natural Holistics keeps their products at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It Is soft and it just looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>Lauroamphoacetate is a gentle, amphoteric foaming and cleansing agent derived from natural and renewable resources.</li>
            <li>Made my hair really soft really shinny.</li>
            <li>It is really natural and you can&#x27;t really smell anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spare you the details of my long, arduous journey, of how many bottles I tried and discarded, how many dragons I slew, how often I was cast into despair.</li>
            <li>Hair feel clean but not stripped dry.  </li>
            <li>I really like the natural feel my hair has after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>But the one who really loves the combination is my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>but it made my hair very sticky and almost TOO soft.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone wanting to try a natural shampoo at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers really well (which you don&#x27;t expect from a natural product).  </li>
            <li>It has no smell, makes my hair feel soft and look straight.</li>
            <li>provide more update in a few days.</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite - it lasts a long time, so I only have to order about every six months.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>You normally buy products that either contain jojoba or argan or almond or avocado.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, didn&#x27;t have all the knots I normally do after my shower.  </li>
            <li>I can normally go 1-2 days without washing my hair but not with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>If you have keratine done and have some of normal to oily</li>
            <li>That price will get you a 16oz bottle of this shampoo at Maple Holistics&#x27;s website (the bottle is $23.35) plus a few more dollars for shipping</li>
            <li>Maple Holistics DOES try to cover the ingredients in the bottle on an information card I received with the shampoo, it just doesn&#x27;t go over the first two thirds of the list where the most complicated looking ingredients are that people would probably be most likely to suspect were made in a lab or something.</li>
            <li>Even rinsing out the shampoo, I could tell this shampoo wouldn&#x27;t have the same success as the Sage shampoo for me.</li>
            <li>After several shampoo-ings, I have found that my hair looks full and soft and prettier than it has ever looked.</li>
            <li>I use as directed, it doesn&#x27;t lather up much on the first wash but does lather up on the second wash.  </li>
            <li>I have normal hair...</li>
            <li>Towards the end of my long search I started to try the all natural, free of everything style of shampoos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a wash and go kind of girl, no styling for lazy me, and with naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li>I have almost normal hair, but in winter there&#x27;s no shampoo</li>
            <li>hair is long greasy curly/wavy and this shampoo tamed it better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.for those of you looking into the low poo trend</li>
            <li>I can go three days before I need to wash my hair again given normal day to day activities.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my long hair soft, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I just used this shampoo for a few days now and already my hair feels silkier and more moisturized.  </li>
            <li>First let me say that this is fantastic for african American natural hair.</li>
            <li>Normally I have oily hair</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather like a normal shampoo, but I don&#x27;t find that bothersome.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look and feel really healthy, soft and silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>However, I think having healthy hair and less exposure to harmful products in the long run is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It also does not dull it, which some products will do when they&#x27;re oil-heavy.</li>
            <li>I have wavy, dry, color-treated hair and my 8 year old daughter, who has very sensitive skin, has fine, oily hair and a scalp that is prone to flaking.</li>
            <li>After rinsing it out I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference at first compared to other shampoos, but the next morning my hair felt much softer.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure if it&#x27;s this or the batiste dry shampoo that&#x27;s giving me dandruff, which I NEVER get when using regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>I will probably try Maple Holistics&#x27; shampoo for dry hair and scalp next and see if that works better for my hair.</li>
            <li>It literally left my hair so dry and made it look more damaged then</li>
            <li>leave you feeling and definitely not coated like many of my shampoos for dry, damaged hair</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave hair dry though definitely needs more moisturizing ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s sulfate-free and herbal with several nourishing oils for my dry and damaged curly hair.</li>
            <li>I will lightly blow dry my hair and use about a pea size conditioner plus argan oil together to smooth it out; I can even flip my hair upside down and rake my fingers through it and it will be the smoothest hair (for days)</li>
            <li>I have dry curly hair, it frizzes when it dries, and I&#x27;ve tried many different products.  </li>
            <li>Though, I was skeptical about this since I have allergies and always have a reaction to natural products, so far so good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other argan oil product but they usually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Up until recently I had been using sulfate shampoos, but I recently learned that it has the capacity to strip good cultures from your head and other damage.</li>
            <li>Just bought this product on a whim looking for a nice natural shampoo to use daily or every other day.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair very soft, clean, and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>However I didn&#x27;t see drastic change in my hair growth (new hair growth) that is normal, but</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this stuff and suggest giving it time if you don&#x27;t see results right away.</li>
            <li>I finally found it right here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Both of them tried it right away the same day they received it.</li>
            <li>It does feel very thick and luxurious though, which I always enjoy in a shampoo, and it cleans just fine.</li>
            <li>Compared to the only other natural shampoo I tried (and many others according to other people), it lathers much better</li>
            <li>So for me it is very hard to find good natural products from head to toe.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily hair and a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, especially because it comes at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It felt just fine and actually softer than when I&#x27;ve had to use a regular shampoo without conditioner in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fragile fine blonde hair and this makes it feel so silky!</li>
            <li>It generates lather and feels moisturizing when your shampooing, once you rinse your hair feels squeaky clean, not fragile nor stiff like some sulfate free shampoos do.</li>
            <li>Honestly, at first I was a bit skeptical, for I really did not think that this shampoo with all its seemingly wild ingredients would really be able to get my hair clean enough without normal soap!  </li>
            <li>compared to non-natural shampoos, this shampoo is more expensive and may not be for people on a tight budget, but it gets my hair as clean, leaves my hair looking shinier, leaves my scalp feeling much better, and is healthier for my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Creamy shampoo, sulfate free, long lasting, made in the USA, reasonably priced and did what I got it for - seems to moisturizer my scalp, not so itchy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I intend to use the free product offer by Maple Holistics to see if this is the case for other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But when you first open the bottle it has an overwhelming scent (not a huge fan of that).</li>
            <li>I got this Argan Oil Shampoo because I wanted to try something a little more natural with not a lot added in there as sulfate and fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of scent sensitivities am always nervous about trying something new with added fragrances.  </li>
            <li>They refunded my money for the shampoo and offered to send me the new Argan Shampoo that just come out.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the argan shampoo with hopes that it would leave my hair feeling clean and healthy without the heavy or greasy residue that some other shampoos leave.  </li>
            <li>and it actually makes my hair feel amazing unlike this waste of money.</li>
            <li>I love how these shampoos are all natural and none of those harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>However, I think it is doing a decent job at keeping my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, but made my hair dry</li>
            <li>but this prove me wrong bit now software and mangerial and most important</li>
            <li>I have short thin hair and this product works great for me.</li>
            <li>The ONLY reason i took a star off is because i wish this product was available in a larger size...preferably with a pump!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m really just taking people&#x27;s word for it that it&#x27;s 100% natural and am still researching the ingredients a bit</li>
            <li>My hair is still coming out more than usual, but my doctor says this is normal after surgery (and being under anesthesia).</li>
            <li>and I like that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped of its natural oils but feels clean after I towel dry.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair super dry.</li>
            <li>I have a recommendation to Maple Holistics: if  it is possible  let the shampoo to be available in larger bottles.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t afford the higher price, but my hair has become really damaged from other no scent shampoos that have no oils or moisturizing benefits</li>
            <li>This does not weigh down my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and it didn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this shampoo again, and highly recommend it,especially if your scalp is sensitive or tends to be itchy.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can not change products AT ALL.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling very soft and fuller.</li>
            <li>I also use the Argan Oil Conditioner from the same line, and like it very much as well.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re very conscious about what we use in our house and what we put in our body.</li>
            <li>have tried several different brands and my favorite brand that works great is very expensive to ship</li>
            <li>I am very surprised of the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li>I find this shampoo keeps it very soft and silky while also adding a bit of volume to it.  </li>
            <li>However after 3 washings with this product I like it a lot, it leaves my hair very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair is very soft,</li>
            <li>The argan oil makes my hair very soft and fluffy-like.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean not weighed down, its very shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find good value for all natural, especially among shampoos.</li>
            <li>I started Argan Oil Shampoo by MapleHolistics, the rough hair started becoming smooth and no more stiffening in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>Being a guy I usually use a shampoo conditioner combo product which works ok for me.</li>
            <li>After ordering this shampoo as a gift for my sister in law who is very health -conscious and loves organic and natural products, my husband surprised me with a bottle as well.  </li>
            <li>NO ITCH so far!</li>
            <li>my hair has been incredibly soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, the bottle was small, but we just need a quarter size for first rinse and another quarter size for the second rinse.</li>
            <li>To me, for the most part, feels the same as any other shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo consistently for the last week and notice that my hair is a bit softer.</li>
            <li>Within the first week I noticed the massive change in my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not buying all natural hair stuff to save the planet, I&#x27;m buying it to save my hair!</li>
            <li>My husband and I eat organic and are switching slowly to other organic and/or safe products that we use in our daily lives...after all, have to take care of yourself.  </li>
            <li>It was okay, not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>No big difference, and much higher in price</li>
            <li>Bottle small but love the feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>I do find that a small amount like a nickel to a quarter size amount at most is all that is needed.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by smell!</li>
            <li>Use it for the first time today 07 25 2015, I will definite write as I use,</li>
            <li>In an effort to lower my families exposure to xenoestrogens such as sodium lauryl sulfate and other chemicals found in many shampoos and cleaning products I chose Maple Holistics.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels amazingly soft!</li>
            <li>This product helps ease my hair getting too greasy/oily in the first 48hrs, which is big change for me!!  </li>
            <li>One use of the Argan Oil Shampoo completely transformed my hair!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Was I ever surprised!  </li>
            <li>Without sulfates there is usually no &amp;#34;lather, but this shampoo lathers well.</li>
            <li>Recommended to anybody looking for a natural shampoo out there!</li>
            <li>So far this seems to be it!</li>
            <li>I noticed a considerable difference in my hair even after using this product ONE time!</li>
            <li>I have fine slightly wavy hair that is oily.</li>
            <li>My hair usually makes it through one day with most shampoos.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested.</li>
            <li>And I used to wash it nearly every day!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I received the item on time, and so far I like it!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair so shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a pretty solid product.</li>
            <li>my dry flaky scalp even more dry, made my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li>I have oily hair and was skeptical that this would be able to clean my hair well.</li>
            <li>You only need a quarter sized amount to clean an entire head of shoulder length medium hair thickness.</li>
            <li>This formula makes my hair smooth and shiny without weighing it down, so I still have all of my volume.</li>
            <li>simply apply first thing in the shower to very wet hair, leave it in while I clean the rest of me, then rinse.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair and scalp clean longer then other shampoos do.</li>
            <li>i had just stripped my hair of every nutrient in order to clean it like other chemical enhanced shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have very fine but thick hair.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing, my hair looks shinier, feels softer, and didn’t take as long to dry.</li>
            <li>Basically any product that our bodies will be in contact with or that we&#x27;ll be breathing the air filled with that product, we&#x27;re very intentional about getting a product that will not harm our bodies and have other side effects later in life.</li>
            <li>I love this shampo since my first time use,every time just apply a little bit for my long hair,then make my hair clean and healthy,also it Darken my black color.</li>
            <li>Also , this shampoo, for the first time ever of any shampoo (including other “natural” shampoos), actually made my hair feel CLEAN, too -- no gunkiness or build</li>
            <li>I tried the sample several times over the course of a week, just to see if I might develop a rash after the first attempt, but in fact, my skin started to clear up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to wash my fro now without the hassle of breakage and dry outs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I only used the argon shampoo once it left my hair soft, clean.</li>
            <li>I finally gave up the project and believed that I would have to settle for expensive, overly scented, toxic shampoos once again if I ever wanted to have beautiful and manageable hair.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m not totally blown away or anything, but I do really like it!</li>
            <li>The last time I used this shampoo I decided to use my old conditioner on my hair below my shoulders first and leave it in while i shampooed.</li>
            <li>Giving this 4 stars because I am not sure yet if this is that much better than my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>This one smells nice and I can tell from the lather, or lack of, that it actually may be missing the sulfates!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know the long lasting benefits but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Only have to use a small amount and using with the conditioner makes make treated hair nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li>After the first use the hair felt thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first use my hair felt thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>The 100% Pure shampoo I used had a relatively small and simple ingredient list, but the Maple Holistics shampoo does work much better, so</li>
            <li>It was very soft and shiny, but not fluffy.</li>
            <li>It smells yummy and leaves my hair very soft and alive.</li>
            <li>one thing I liked more about the 100% Pure shampoo was that on the ingredient list it had a laymen&#x27;s description in parentheses next to any ingredient that sounded complicated or foreign.</li>
            <li>There is little to no smell which is fine for me.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought this shampoo for me yesterday , my hair is kind of weak</li>
            <li>they actually refunded my money, and in ADDITION sent me a full bottle of the silk 18 conditioner that I loved to satisfy my disappointment in the shampoo</li>
            <li>So I hopped on Amazon.com to look for a new all natural shampoo that won&#x27;t bother my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The product lathers really well for not having any lathering agents (unnatural anyways), but it leaves my hair very squeaky dry like.</li>
            <li>A subtle fragrance that leaves my hair fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of a pleasant smell but it isn&#x27;t terrible either.  </li>
            <li>It did a good job with the natural part of my hair but as for the remainder it was just hard and dry.</li>
            <li>- Affordable: I don&#x27;t have to use much shampoo to get a good lather (long, thick hair).&lt;br /&gt;- Sulfate free, Natural/free of those funky hard to read chemical ingredients, Jojoba and almond oils</li>
            <li>I was born with pin-straight manageable hair, but when I entered my teens I started to mess around with many different shampoo’s and hair products</li>
            <li>This shampoo relieved my dry itchy scalp and left my hair really smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I was born with pin-straight manageable hair, but when I entered my teens I started to mess around with many different shampoo’s and hair products</li>
            <li>In addition to using these products, I also have a different brand of 100% Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>instead of worse like when I used the 100% Pure shampoo, and it made my hair look and feel better.</li>
            <li>and it’s a little more than a third gone, so</li>
            <li>They are inexpensive, leave my hair clean and soft, and last a long time.</li>
            <li>To give a little background on my purchase, I am allergic to most standard shampoos.</li>
            <li>I no longer need to use additional frizz free products that end up weighing my hair down and leaving it &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling!</li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel healthy not dry like other shampoo I did not have to use any conditioner later</li>
            <li>I never find it leaves my hair dry or brittle, which I can say has been the result with many other natural brands.</li>
            <li>Worth trying if you are tired of using $4 department store brands that do absolutely nothing but not expensive like the $20 high end stuff that may or may not work.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have tooooo much hair left on my head, so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell, but my hair seems to come out soft and healthy as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i personally don&#x27;t think it smells too bad, but i wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s especially pleasant compared to what we might be used to.</li>
            <li>After brushing my hair out, I thought it felt really dry and still tangled easily, but then I decided to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>They are way cheaper (not on Amazon though, they are cheaper at walmart) and have only natural ingredients and absolutely nothing else.</li>
            <li>You need less shampoo, and the clean hair lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I just started to focus on whole body wellness, so I wanted to go above and beyond just putting quality natural ingredients in my body.</li>
            <li>After rinsing shampoo off hair it felt clean, but slightly tangled.</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and arrived in a short amt. of time.</li>
            <li>my hair looks alive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, this shampoo is not color safe at least with Just for Men color.</li>
            <li>I like all the natural products they use in this product as well.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly without the frizz and feels so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo twice so far (along with the 18 silk conditioner) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>and it leaves your hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo not knowing what to expect since I&#x27;ve never used a homeopathic / all natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to products-like the canary in the coal mine.</li>
            <li>it made my hair feel so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>its too early)</li>
            <li>But, on the second application it really does lather up as well as a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was looking for a non-sulfate natural shampoo, when I found this one.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t order and wait until a later time to order the shampoo I really wanted.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much and only wash twice a week.</li>
            <li>And my hair has never felt this soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>Any product that claimed to be sulfate-free, all natural, blah blah, etc.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase a foam making machine from Amazon for my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>It feels soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I wanted an all natural shampoo for my family.</li>
            <li>I also dye my hair to cover the grays and this shampoo is gentle enough for color-treated hair.</li>

            <li>any more!My hair is soft and have volume -it</li>
            <li>I developed a habit of grabbing and shaking my collar vigorously before entering a store or restaurant to remove the pile I knew was there without looking.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My bleached &amp; highlighted hair came out soft &amp; shiny.</li>

            <li>I have been using this Argan Oil Shampoo combined with the Silk18 Natural Conditioner</li>

            <li>Lots of natural oils in it.</li>
            <li>, this shampoo completely revived my color and did a hair &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>Got Silk conditioner and Argan oil Shampoo a week ago, and so far I&#x27;ve used both in combination 3 times.</li>
            <li>I am in transition from perm damaged hair to natural hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways I remember commenting about this product and my difficulties with it, so I decided to try it again with just natural hair.</li>

            <li>Using it with Silk 18 natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Any shampoo now a days strips your hair of its natural oils</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the same price as biolage and I&#x27;d much rather buy that way</li>
            <li>I been scratching my scalp to see if dandruff or flakes gather under my nails, so far it sees to be taking care of that issue as well.</li>
            <li>I am looking for a product which cleans scalp as well as gives moisture and volume to hair naturally.</li>
            <li>eventhough after applying shampoo i used silk 18 conditioner but conditoner makes my hair soft doesnt give volume.</li>
            <li>Thought , huh looks natural , I might as well try it.</li>

            <li>Let&#x27;s try another natural shampoo I used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural and understand what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t look like it would be a natural ingredient!&amp;#34;, so I looked it up and after some reading found the simplest explanation on truthinaging.com:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>It is also used as a natural replacement for the ingredient known as sodium laureth sulfate, or SLES.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>So far I lIke it,</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if a natural shampoo helps speed up the process.</li>
            <li>Got it two days ago, and so far this has been</li>

            <li>I was pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>I paired it with the Silk 18 conditioner and my hair was so soft and shiny.  </li>

            <li>But the outer touch was soft.</li>
            <li>have used it for about a week now, and have no problems to report so far.</li>
            <li>all natural.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that this is a natural product</li>
            <li>I will definitely come back for more when my bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>I have transitioning 3c hair and my hair is so soft and manageable after I use this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, to the shampoo…  The reason that I bought it was because I had just gotten my hair professionally colored</li>
            <li>chemicals stripped all of that natural oiliness away.  </li>
            <li>I just recently purchased the conditioner and it REALLY conditions</li>
            <li>I have frizzy naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt surprisingly soft after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Im going to try with their conditioner to get a complete feel about it.</li>
            <li>Also using the Natural Conditioner Silk 18.  </li>
            <li>It is alive in touch, with glitter.</li>
            <li>I have since been experimenting with organic shampoos with partial success.</li>
            <li>with this one I found that it did balance the oils in my hair, my scalp is not as oily as it was and my ends get better with the oils I use to them, and I actually do not need to wash my hair everyday like I used to</li>
            <li>I was not surprised that it would&#x27;ve damaged my natural hair tone, but this product really does work wonders!</li>
            <li>But overall its a good product but thought it to be bit expensive as it really hasnt worked wonders.</li>
            <li>The texture of this shampoo is magnificent, not to thin, but not too thick.</li>
            <li>Also cost wise it is not like otjer products which are avaialble in market and are so expensive.</li>
            <li>My hair has been a mess while trying to find a natural shampoo that will clean and nourish my hair.</li>
            <li>With very little shampoo, you get lots of good suds and the conditioner detangles with just slight finger-work.  </li>
            <li>It made my dry hair soft after first use.altho it has no smell</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it, as I have used many different shampoos (some quite expensive) and have not found one that worked as well as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey for the size, but totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this shampoo to my family and friends as a permanent switch from their normal shampoo!</li>
            <li>Managing my long, thick hair can be overwhelming at times especially when I would like for it to be soft and pretty!</li>
            <li>Many oil shampoos leave my hair feeling heavy or flat, but this one leaves my hair conditioned but with a natural amount of body.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair as well, so the ingredient list of this shampoo interested me with all of the oils.</li>
            <li>I have white female hair; fine and long.</li>
            <li>my hair is pretty dry because I always bleach my hair for coloring and highlights .</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and am always on the lookout for good quality shampoo (and other haircare products) that will condition my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really did not think that the product would lather very much, but when I squeezed out just a little onto my hand and started to wash my hair</li>
            <li>I have coarse greying hair, and in recent months with more grey areas coming in, my hair has become totally unmagageable with cowlicks sticking up everywhere when I get up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is how much I have to use on my hair, but that&#x27;s my own problem for having super thick horse hair.</li>
            <li>Seems like it foams a little too much for me as I use it as my &amp;#34;second&amp;#34; wash after using a &#x27;cowash&#x27; the first time.  </li>
            <li>I knew it wouldn&#x27;t suds up a whole lot as there are no fake, artificial ingredients in the formula to produce more suds.  </li>
            <li>It is more pricey for the amount you get, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My hair felt flat without much body to it.</li>
            <li>Oh boy, just after few washes my hair loss reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>tried a lot of natural dandruff shampoos; very few of them actually give me a satisfying lather.</li>
            <li>Only used once so far but left my very long hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely serious and more thankful than anyone can ever realize.</li>
            <li>The Argan Shampoo smell is more like Elmer&#x27;s glue or rancid oil; neither are subtle or soothing.</li>
            <li>Plus the scent is subtle and not overpowering like so many products on the market.</li>
            <li>I gave it a second try this past weekend, and the results were much better.</li>
            <li>Hair products,in particular, have different effects, depending on hair type.</li>
            <li>That is amazing considering the amount of long thick hair I have.</li>
            <li>My hair dye used to wash out within 2 weeks with regular shampoo, and I&#x27;m already going on week 3 with vibrant color.  </li>
            <li>It is harsh at first, does not lather up quite as well, and leaves hair VERY stipped/</li>
            <li>First shampoo that suited my hair from the time I moved in states, I am giving 4* because I am  using it from just last one month, will update my rating and review as it goes further, But till now I like mildness, smell and after effects.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decently priced and last me about a couple of months on my medium/long hair.</li>
            <li>These products are WELL worth the money, &amp; I will continue to purchase Argoil, so long as the formula stays the same.</li>
            <li>Their products are easy and have made my super thick long blonde hair shinier, longer</li>
            <li>I used to have nice thick long hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain this is why I can go for so long between washings.</li>
            <li>The first time my hair felt very dry...</li>
            <li>Other than that, I washed my hair right away</li>
            <li>This product was reviewed highly and in my personal opinion thinks the ratings were spot on.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone else with similar issues!</li>
            <li>Throughout my middle school days into my high school days, I straightened my hair every day, i’m</li>
            <li>I was just about to give this product only four stars, just because of the slightly high price, but</li>
            <li>I recently tried this shampoo for my dry,damaged hair along with the conditioner,my hair is soft,manageable, I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Throughout my middle school days into my high school days, I straightened my hair every day, i’m</li>
            <li>Recently got high lights.</li>
            <li>For one, I ran around emitting a high pitched wheeee at regular intervals.</li>
            <li>i love this , also bought Natural Conditioner By Maple Holistics - Sulfate Free Treatment for Dry and Damaged , i have dry ,thin fuzzy hair, always knotted, after this , no more knotted hair , only leave me smooth ,shinny!</li>
            <li>The only downside for me is that it&#x27;s not necessarily color-safe, so I have to get my roots done a little more often.</li>
            <li>Next time I use it I will cut back a little because I had more lather than needed for my length hair.</li>
            <li>This means I&#x27;ll be paying up to twice as much for less product and be using twice as much product each time I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does the trick and leaves my hair feeling super soft, once it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a pleasant subtle scent, slightly nutty.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil shampoo has helped my dry scalp more than any of the other dandruff shampoos, such as T-GEL, head AND SHOULDERS AND PERT ANTI-DANDRUFF.</li>
            <li>She has long straight hair and swears by it.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling soft and rehydrated I don&#x27;t even need conditioner with this product it naturally tamed my wild curly hair</li>
            <li>In the past one year +, I&#x27;ve changed all of my house products to all chemical free products.</li>
            <li>My scalp also has skin problems sometimes, quite sensitive to shampoos in general.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fantastic and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>you really need a small quantity and leaves the hair soft thanks to the Argan oil, almond, jojoba,peach kernel, camelia seed ,avocado and botanical keratin !</li>
            <li>It is not completely a anti dandruff shampoo but it really reduced hair fall.</li>
            <li>My scalp is getting back to normal.</li>
            <li>after using this shampoo my hair did actually feel thicker than it normally does</li>
            <li>Also, I only like to get my hair cut every few months (4-5), so I try to keep it as healthy as possible in between cuts.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like having products around the house that are full of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>It also made my scalp dry and flaky which never happens and certainly did NOT happen with the argan oil shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying very hard to find a more natural shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li>As an active male with short hair, my scalp tends to get itchy with most shampoos on the market; especially if I skip a day.</li>
            <li>But unlike before, I only have few flakes appearing on my jet black hair, which can be easily removed with the flick of a wrist.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as a very-much-in-debt college student, I don&#x27;t have a large amount of funds appropriated for pricier beauty supplies such as this (compared to the large bottles of Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes and was confident I was buying an all natural, high quality product, but it turned out to be a bad experience.</li>
            <li>I love them and it was hard for me to change back to liquid shampoo.</li>
            <li>Left my blonde color treated hair clean, nourished, soft and extremely shiny without leaving it greasy feeling or a residue.</li>
            <li>I finally got into the college of my dreams and decided to create a new look</li>
            <li>I have been searching and trying new products constantly.</li>
            <li>I finally got into the college of my dreams and decided to create a new look</li>
            <li>There is no distinct smell but who cares right?</li>
            <li>My hair had been getting dry and this shampoo really helps.</li>
            <li>They both work very well on my dry hair which make my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>At age 50 with dry, highlighted hair I really needed to find a shampoo &amp; conditioner that would revive my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo also doesnt dry out my hair, and has restored it so much.</li>
            <li>I have long, wavy,  fine, slightly oil hair.</li>
            <li>Really wish it softened my dry hair .</li>
            <li>I have very curly dry hair</li>
            <li>I do not have to use my dry shampoo as much or at all.</li>
            <li>Was looking for something for dry and tinted hair, something gentle and moisturizing and that I could use every day without worrying.</li>
            <li>I left it on about 5 minutes and for the first time in a long time I did not use conditioner because I wanted to see what the shampoo did for my hair without conditioner.</li>
            <li>I could not believe that my hair actually was manageable, straight, and not frizzy after only a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair in the front and coarse curly hair in the back.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many shampoos and was never happy with anything thus far.</li>
            <li>I am an African American and I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Sometimes natural shampoos just don&#x27;t do the job in cleaning the hair, but this definitely does all while keeping it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Approximately one year ago I made the switch to more natural shampoo in an attempt to limit my exposure to chemicals.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t like how the label obscured the shampoo bottle so the only way I could tell how much was left was by the weight of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought the shampoo expecting the same pleasant experience, but was immediately disappointed when I first used it and realized it smells like old food and herbs smashed up together.</li>
            <li>It left my hair very soft and shiny which my wife and daughter even commented about.</li>
            <li>No other shampoo has allowed me to do this.  </li>
            <li>After having major surgery on my ear that involved an incision in my scalp, my hair was falling out dramatically.</li>
            <li>I wish I discovered this product sooner, but better late than never!</li>
            <li>No other shampoo could do this.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many shampoos and usually get an over dry scalp &amp; end up using oils and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other argan-oil-based shampoos before and some of them had a strong smell due to the oil.</li>
            <li>It does leave your hair &amp;#34;Squeeky clean&amp;#34; with only a small amount but that Squeek means pretty much all of the natural oils were stripped from my hair.</li>
            <li>I have &#x27;fine&#x27;, delicate and color treated hair</li>
            <li>Usually I have to do 3-4 shampoos until it feels squeaky clean but with this Argan oil shampoo</li>
            <li>I wash twice with a small amount like it says and my hair always feels clean.  </li>
            <li>I would mind trying other products since the company really focuses on using all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other sulfate-free shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>I figure if some of it sits there all day, that’s fine with me, my hair is thick</li>
            <li>nicely fine with my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have very long ( past waist ) thin Asian hair &amp; this shampoo was perfect!</li>
            <li>&amp; it gets greasy/oily pretty fast, especially using my previous shampoos, like the next day after a wash (Head &amp; Shoulders/Pantene)!  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m lucky, my hair will last a day and a half before looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>I received an email back within 24 hours saying they were so sorry for the situation and that they were going to refund the amount for the original bottle, let me keep the one that was sent in error and send me the actual product I ordered free of charge as well.</li>
            <li>so well it&#x27;s hard to believe it is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I am in my late 50&#x27;s and my hair is thinning so I am trying supplements and new more natural shampoos that are less damaging to the scalp.</li>
            <li>(well, I only bought an 8oz bottle here on Amazon, but 100% Pure is still more expensive)</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of it to feel like my hair is even getting clean, but it also leaves my hair very dried out and tangly.</li>
            <li>In the end, I highly recommend you try the product because the ingredients are each necessary to properly enriching your hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I see it&#x27;s mostly woman who have left reviews on this product, so here&#x27;s a little something for the fellas curious about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Not just my scalp, but my skin in general.</li>
            <li>Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to some ingredient.</li>
            <li>I have been researching about the chemical effects of shampoo on our body and since only used natural products.</li>
            <li>I am a perpetual hair straightener (daily) and this product has completely changed my hair.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a handful of times but so far I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started using sulfate-free shampoos because they help sustain the natural oils found in my hair.</li>
            <li>The product itself works like a shampoo, conditioner, leave in oil, and de-frizzer because of all the natural components.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is a milky white almost translucent color.</li>
            <li>so I ofter use baby shampoo, as natural as possible.</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t contain sulfate and contains several natural oils.</li>
            <li>I do not have dandruff, but an extra sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I use only natural or organic products on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the only natural shampoo I have purchased that my husband likes.  </li>
            <li>The entire family uses it and it leaves our hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember any such offers</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing the conditioner in the near future.</li>
            <li>During this time I have developed a severe skin sensitivity, especially on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an advocate of using all natural personal care products (</li>
            <li>This Shampoo made my hair amazingly soft and actually makes it shiner and healthier.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product twice so far.</li>
            <li>Even without a conditioner I could feel that my hair was stripped of its natural oils which us brown girls definitely don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>Not only can I stand the smell, my hair is so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Made my coarse, curly hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>does not feel soft after shampooing with this product (even after a second use of this shampoo).</li>
            <li>I would say that I never gave my hair or skin that same treatment with quality natural ingredient shampoos.</li>
            <li>I also like that I&#x27;m now using a shampoo with natural ingredients and so not doing further damage to my scalp and hair with chemicals.</li>
            <li>This is literally the only shampoo so far that hasn&#x27;t caused him to break out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This Shampoo made my hair amazingly soft and actually makes it shiner and healthier.</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo and it left my hair feeling really soft and luscious.</li>
            <li>In recent months, I have changed my routine to use far fewer cleanser products on my hair.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft, manageable and it was soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>My sensitive facial skin was irritated by a product used and the skin started to burn.  </li>
            <li>I was also surprised to see how long my hair held up till next wash, it did not oil up like it normally does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find shampoos that are not harsh to the hair, and Maple Holistics not only met my expectations, but also exceeded it.</li>
            <li>and it has a nice faint smell to me.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and lathers well without harsh sulfites and parabens.</li>
            <li>My hair was beginning to thin out on top.  </li>
            <li>I need to keep a &#x27;poofy&#x27; style to disguise how thin my hair is, but most shampoos that offer help with body are also drying.  </li>
            <li>My family and friends have noticed that I keep my hair down more often now rather then in a messy bun.</li>
            <li>I have gotten into organic and chemical free products lately and was looking for a new shampoo and most were way too expensive.</li>
            <li>but as I am certainly no expert on holistics or organics, they may very well be something truly organic.</li>
            <li>And it left my hair soft after my normal blow dry routine.  </li>
            <li>I flew home fromHI (where I live)  to CA for winter break, and on my way back as I was unpacking, I realized I left my shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>I flew home fromHI (where I live)  to CA for winter break, and on my way back as I was unpacking, I realized I left my shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>but my hair is no longer falling out, is so soft, and my curls are much softer and less brillo-pad like.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>I take a large amount of steroids for a medical condition and my hair is very dry.</li>
            <li>I have hair that gets dry and unmanageable and this shampoo has changed all that my hair is left soft and shiny without looking weighed down like so many other shampoos.</li>
            <li>After my first use I had less itching and irritations.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normal to dry.</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job, but no better than other (better smelling) shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li>Maple Holistics does this with the last several ingredients, but mostly the ingredients list on this Maple Holistics shampoo is difficult to read and requires research if you want to really want to know</li>
            <li>It may work better with other colors, but I strongly do not recommend those with red hair to use this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not particularly into the whole organic movement, but it did concern me a bit that I still don&#x27;t know what some of the listed ingredients actually are...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really messed up my hair with other products including the baking soda</li>
            <li>I find that this shampoo is much easier to distribute evenly throughout the hair than other brands.</li>
            <li>(you don&#x27;t need to use as much as some other shampoos).</li>
            <li>other than that didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I was loosing quite a bit of hair due to stress and I have noticed that it is not happening as much since I have been using the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure about this product as I have not had much luck with natural products.</li>
            <li>a quarter size amount in your hand goes a long way, I used as much as I would with a normal shampoo and the suds were poring down my head.</li>
            <li>Even though it was a moisturizing hair care treatment, those other products left my hair super dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>Makes my very long, thick and naturally curly hair super soft.</li>
            <li>It actually does foam, cleans amazingly, and my hair-fall has been reduced by at least half after using this and their Silk Conditioner for about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>Has natural essential oils such as tea tree,lavender,and argan oil and vanilla and honey!!love</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair and if left it feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really believed that different shampoos would make that much of a difference on hair.  </li>
            <li>reference, I have very low-maintenance undyed, thick straight hair that doesn&#x27;t need to be washed every day.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does not dry out our hair while cleansing and it does not leave it oily.  </li>
            <li>I am Asian with black, thick and strong straight hair.</li>
            <li>It tangles easily and usually feels very dry.</li>
            <li>First to tell you a little bit about my hair history.</li>
            <li>First to tell you a little bit about my hair history.</li>
            <li>This bottle will last longer than I originally thought because, you only use a small amount.</li>
            <li>I just bought a second bottle, even though I still have about half of the first bottle to go.  </li>
            <li>This bothered me at first, but now that I’m seeing such an improvement in my hair’s health, I could care less.</li>
            <li>I have spent many of wasted money on salon products only to find out that they make my hair greasy or dry.</li>
            <li>My scalp itches like crazy and I haven&#x27;t experienced this with any other product.</li>
            <li>So, I decided maybe I&#x27;d try a sulfate free shampoo as I&#x27;ve heard sulfates are not good for hair.</li>
            <li>, I used to wash my hair daily because I have very oily scalp, with other shampoos</li>
            <li>am an African American male, 48 years old, and I rock a mini “fro”.</li>
            <li>Leaves my corse grey colored hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The same thing applied to the second time I used it (I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far).</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair that grows fast and thick, and I color my hair all the time, and this revitalized my hair to almost like baby soft.</li>
            <li>I know a product can do wonders on your hair in the first few days/ weeks</li>
            <li>not a good product which is a bummer since it has so many good oils :(</li>
            <li>First, I used the shampoo which made my head a bit itch, but the itching feeling are gone after few weeks continues using.</li>
            <li>I expected my hair to at minimum be a bit shinier or softer than normal.</li>
            <li>But I found it to be too harsh, it faded my hair color from the first wash</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it I thought it was working well</li>
            <li>Been trying to find a product that would help moisturize my hair in the very dry climate where I live.</li>
            <li>So it seems expensive but it lasts a while if you do not  wash your hair every day and with this shampoo I can easily go 3 days without needing to shampoo!</li>
            <li>As an older woman hair gets drier due to years of coloring and age.</li>
            <li>Honestly it was hard to get past the smell.</li>
            <li>Obviously this shampoo won&#x27;t do the whole shabang for your hair and you&#x27;ll use other products that&#x27;ll manage your hair further to what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve only been using this a week, but I swear, my hair feels much softer than it did with any of the other standard brands of shampoo (probably because all of them have sulfates)!</li>
            <li>By using these shampoo, my hair is shiny and soft all day long!</li>
            <li>I usually take just the right amount of shampoo required for me.</li>
            <li>but i dont feel dry any more..and they have become soft as well...</li>
            <li>It relieved some of my dry, flaky scalp and made my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li>but my dry hair stuck out like a sore thumb, it was time to take action.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic with no harsh chemicals and does not make my hair dry to comb.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this for my 8 year old son whose hair is quite dry and stringy.</li>
            <li>but this shampoo just made my hair stringy and dry; however, it did wonders for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>but my dry hair stuck out like a sore thumb, it was time to take action.</li>
            <li>I have boob-length, straight, black hair.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for natural solutions for frizzy hair as well as dry hair problems.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone with dry hair and a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>my easy to manage hair became brittle, greasy, and seriously thin.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I blow dried my hair and was left with my hair looking as it always does, just a bit drier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian American and had thick, black, straightish-wavy-ish hair until after my pregnancy, when sections of my hair started curling more and other sections became stick straight.</li>
            <li>I was surprised such small amount generates so much lather.</li>
            <li>I only shampoo a couple of times a week so as not to dry out my naturally curly salt and pepper hair.  </li>
            <li>I recently started growing facial hair and used this on my beard and it did not dry out my face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair and rarely use hair products (maybe a few times a year).  </li>
            <li>I have had this problem for the last few years, and tried many other shampoos, ranging from expensive to cheap (as prices denote) and from all-natural to regular formulations.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worse than normal dandruff and over the years I&#x27;ve tried numerous herbal shampoos and was using a prescription shampoo with 2% Ketoconazole right up to the time I tried this Argan Oil Shampoo from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li>I have tried several natural shampoos in the last six months, I have been looking for one that doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to become dry.  </li>
            <li>Dry Hair!&lt;br /&gt;OK, so this is the only real issue I have,  This shampoo really dries out my hair and makes it hard.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>I have been using different kinds of shampoo, but most of them leave my hair dry and look unhealthy.</li>
            <li>I was forced to wear white and light shirts but have dug up a black polo shirt that must be 10 years old</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and used a quarter-sized amount which was actually a little too much as my hair is medium length.</li>
            <li>I have noticed, and so have other people, new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Left with dry, life-less, and coarse feeling hair, I returned back to my old commercial products.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, hair and this product has totally transformed it!!</li>
            <li>I have waist length baby soft but thick hair that has tangled ALL of my life!!!, have never been able to find a shampoo that would detangle it till now</li>
            <li>I think it is a good shampoo but a little expensive for the bottle size.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using argan oil shampoo, my hair has never been dry and looks much healthier compared to other shampoos I have used.</li>
            <li>The Shampoo wasn&#x27;t too bad it did smell good</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t find the scent of this shampoo to be bad, it just isn&#x27;t good.</li>

            <li> I experienced that  works well to keep my hair look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> but with all the botanicals in the ingredients, it should have some kind of good smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m washing my hair with a product that is good for it.</li>
            <li> good size shampoo bottle, nice packaging and label.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, nice smell</li>
            <li> Love, Love Maple Holistics!!</li>
            <li> This is a LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li> Afterwards I love it!</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty neutral: no perfumey scents so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, probably best to stick with the Herbal Essences.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> lather feels amazing and between the shampoo and the conditioner  </li>
            <li> I bought it because of the amazing reviews but this shampoo dries the hair out a lot.</li>
            <li> and that makes my hair smell amazing.</li>
            <li> amazing feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo although I enjoy shampoo that is sudsier.</li>
            <li> However their customer service is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I use this in addition to the Silk 18 Conditioner which is also amazing.</li>
            <li> I use this in addition to the aveenoo conditioner which is also amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the product quality is amazing but there is always a room for improvement.</li>
            <li> I m loving my hair.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and nicely combed condition.</li>
            <li> smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I have never been nice to my hair and thought it was time for a change.</li>
            <li> The scent is kind of a soapy scent, not like honey/vanilla at all, but the smell does not stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> For 2 years, I experimented with making my own shampoos and conditioners in an attempt to limit my exposure to chemicals in my home.  </li>
            <li> It has the lather that I missed for those 2 years of my own concoctions, and it cleaned my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li> Well in the meantime a rep from maple holistic had sent me an email asking how I liked</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just picky, but in the description/ingredients it says it contains vanilla scents to give it a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I had an issue and they resolved it immediately and with the kind of c/s stores used to have 40 years ago.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> also use it on my 5 year daught &#x27;s hair, she loves  it , love the smell.1 great buy , and must buy, just love it</li>
            <li> honestly would not buy it again</li>
            <li> But I can honestly say that I&#x27;m probably gonna stick with these products.</li>
            <li> I like having strong-scented shampoos that leave my hair smelling nice</li>
            <li> just...boring and kind of ugh.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner also smells something like warm vanilla sugar, so once I use that I forget all about the cardboard shampoo smell.    </li>
            <li> so I can give an honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> When my hair is thoroughly rinses, it feel nice.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li> I never used it before,but when i got it,I liked</li>
            <li> I liked how it</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> This feels nice on your hair and hope it will thicken it up.</li>
            <li> After trying the ACV and BS technique and going no-poo, i was not as thrilled with the transition as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I liked this in combination with their conditioner.</li>
            <li> But it smells wonderful and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews about this product that i gave it a try.</li>
            <li> It has a nice lather too.</li>
            <li> I didnt like the smell though as it smelled more like a medicine(tonic), but the good thing is after the wash it didnt linger around.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that finally I found a perfect hair products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that massaging it into your scalp and even letting it sit for awhile before rinsing is nice.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li> and everyone expects a shampoo to make you hair smell nice.</li>
            <li> , seems to be a nice buy.</li>
            <li> Honestly I have no idea about Argan oil or its advantages, but I like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fragrant and kind to my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I do really like these products; they work and smell wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I honestly believe it makes all the difference</li>
            <li> I can honestly say my hair is softer and shinier after using both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely but not overly-so.</li>
            <li> We liked the product because it is cruelty-free and fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> I know that I can count on honest information from people about their experiences.  </li>
            <li> It kind of just smells like what I imagine sodium cocoyl isethionate or sodium laurel glucoside carboxylate (ingredients) would smell like.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try this instead of making my own or going &amp;</li>
            <li> It lathers up really nice without having to use a ton of it.</li>
            <li> Really liked it-</li>
            <li> i liked the silk 18 conditioner</li>
            <li> but I liked</li>
            <li> I often use a moisturizing shampoo on its own, and follow up with a leaving in conditioning spray or styling cream.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a nice shampoo since I moved to USA</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this shampoo for about a week now, and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, I like that no toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is no longer fried looking and I have nice curls.</li>
            <li> I very rarely do more with it than wash it and put it in a bun because it just never looks or feels good.</li>
            <li> I use the amount it states on the bottle and it foams up nicely which was a surprise.</li>
            <li> It smells like some kind of rubber or adhesive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be completely honest and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maple Holistics contacted me after my purchase to see how I liked the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It even gets a nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It produces a nice creamy lather.</li>
            <li> It honestly reminds me of horse shampoo</li>
            <li> When paired with a nice smelling conditioner there&#x27;s no issue.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, out of habit (&amp; because it feels good:), I scratch at my scalp.</li>
            <li> Lathers great, hair feels clean, nice smell</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling very clean and has a good lather to it.  </li>
            <li> Great purchase and really worth a try!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try the shampoo after my mom had great results.</li>
            <li> It also made my scalp feel great and made my hair feel really clean afterward.</li>
            <li> However, it does a great job of getting my hair squeaky clean..</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause problems for our family , decent lather, and seems to work well for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> These products are awesome and I highly recommend them.</li>

            <li> am in love with this shampoo, it makes my hair so smooth silky and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that this shampoo have so many good and 5 star reviews because of the Free product card like i read in one comment!</li>
            <li> But overall, this product worked fairly well and is perfect for those who want softer hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is good shampoo, but I like shampoos and conditioners that smell clean and bright.</li>

            <li> I do not know how the shampoo performs on its own, but I love the combination of the two.  </li>
            <li> ( I loved that it was organic and sulfate free but just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> that u get a free bottle if u leave a good review...</li>
            <li> , this is perfect natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo works amazing</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best, natural, organic, sulfate-free, and hypoallergenic hair product I have used.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST shampoo that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better i still use my own formula which is the dr bronners + argan oil and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist/colourist commented on how healthy my hair is and co-workers have offered nice compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s natural and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated &amp; this product leaves it soft &amp; silky &amp; the shine is incredible!</li>
            <li> It lathers surprisingly well, just as well as those shampoos filled with sulfates and whatnot.  </li>
            <li> Someone suggested the good reviews are because you can get a free product.  </li>
            <li> almost forgot - product delivery was seamlessly  arrived on time and perfectly packaged.</li>
            <li> This company makes a nice conditioner that has a lovely vanilla scent, and I was hoping this shampoo would be on par with that,</li>
            <li> I wanted sulfate free, they are, and are of good quality.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Nice refreshing tingle too.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a wonderful natural product for every one.</li>
            <li> Its the best shampoo I ever used it made my hair feel so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> With most shampoos, you have to use a lot of product to get a nice lather going.</li>
            <li> Paired with the Maple Holistics Silk 18 Conditioner, my hair is healthier, soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> It is natural and my hair feels and looks great!</li>
            <li> and I started looking for good sulfate free shampoos online.</li>
            <li> This came up; she gave it a try, and WOW great product!</li>
            <li> Amazing love this shampoo..</li>
            <li> Great for any type hair, very good for dry scalp, and is not anything as in the way of fragrance as I could tell.</li>
            <li> the dandruff that did fall today is very fine</li>
            <li> I have very fine and oily hair which always looked a bit frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Great smell, gives you incredible soft clean hair, no residue and no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have very fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li> but it honestly ended up being a fabulous gel/shampoo like wash that I fell in love with!</li>
            <li> I originally bought the silk 18 conditioner, which I loved.</li>
            <li> Pleasant mild aroma.</li>
            <li> Because of the many good reviews, I decided to try this shampoo along with Maple Holistics&#x27; Silk 18 conditioner (also homeopathic &amp; BPA free).  </li>
            <li> Smell is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> so it takes a good amount to wash and clean thoroughly</li>
            <li> :) I would highly recommend this amazing shampoo to anyone with hair!!</li>
            <li> Nice clean product!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and really nourishes your hair root to tip!</li>
            <li> I totally endorse this product as one of the best, if not, the best, natural shampoo and conditioner manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use a quarter sized amount, now I don’t get great lather on the first application.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I didn&#x27;t through it out the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I was so happy after my first use,  </li>
            <li> The bottle&#x27;s also much prettier :P I really love it!</li>
            <li> Super clean hair!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice shampoo, it has a very pleasant mild scent, nice thick lather, worked very nicely on my curly, sometimes frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I am happy I took the chance on a new product and am excited to try more!!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel great and my scalp feels clean and comfortable after use.</li>
            <li> My hair is very smooth</li>
            <li> When washing my hair, the product is very smooth to use.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light.</li>
            <li> This is the another reason why I liked as it does not have any strong odor.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but the scent is very mild, so</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, very light.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly it feels healthy!</li>
            <li> The product smells good, very light fresh secents and the shampoo</li>
            <li> very good feeling so far..</li>
            <li> I had tried this product before, it&#x27;s okay.. very natural, good smell!</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a huge plus!</li>

            <li> Fabulous Shampoo!  </li>
            <li> This product was ok...</li>
            <li> The smell of the shampoo isn&#x27;t that great, but that&#x27;s probably because there are no unnecessary chemicals-</li>
            <li> I decided to start using better, more hydrating shampoos.</li>
            <li> I love it -</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love the Argan oil treatment any way.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s why I bought their conditioner, which smells like vanilla! :)</li>
            <li> I really love the foam texture,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the perfumes in products can be overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I do love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just ok... it does suds up</li>
            <li> but still I&#x27;ve had better shampoos...</li>
            <li> very happy with this entire line!</li>
            <li> After using this paired with a great condition it is so much easier to comb after.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels after and it has ingredients I love.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 2 more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what I&#x27;ll get from this.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of honey</li>
            <li> For the price we were hoping more results but</li>
            <li> I felt sure the company had changed something in the shampoo</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was the most drying shampoo I have ever used and even after using a salon-quality conditioner, I could still feel the roughness of my hair.</li>
            <li> It is okay, I guess.</li>
            <li> This is where the magic happened.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been this luscious, frizz free, so manageable!</li>
            <li> three words  LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> great shampoo, really works.  </li>
            <li> I believe I was expecting a lot more</li>
            <li> All in all, one of the better shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> and she told me to purchase two more bottles(along with the silk eighteen conditioner).</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo along with the hydrate shampoo and I love the smell of the hydrate shampoo but the Argan shampoo worked better for my hair.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use this product, highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser noticed that my hair was in better condition without my even mentioning anything.</li>
            <li> I genuinely endorse this one!</li>
            <li> I love how it feels in my hair.</li>
            <li> Lathers better than the others I have used.</li>
            <li> and I was noticing more and more hair loss in the shower.</li>
            <li> Many sulfate-free shampoos are still laden with chemicals, but this one isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It has more shine and body, and it feels thicker.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this make my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> My hair seems cleaner, but I&#x27;m not in love.</li>

            <li> This is definitely the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s toxin-free and not tested on animals.      </li>
            <li> My hair is glossy and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of shampoos but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I literally looked up every ingredient in this shampoo and found that everything was safe.</li>
            <li> this may not matter for most, but it appealed to my tastes).</li>
            <li> I also purchased the conditioner and it made it better</li>
            <li> I am still looking for more and more moisture.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> Personally I enjoyed the scent.</li>

            <li> While there&#x27;s a lot of unsettled science on many of the chemicals in our products, I&#x27;d rather not take a chance.</li>
            <li> I love how the Argan Oil shampoo makes my hair feel.</li>

            <li> if you do thise kind of treatment you need a shampoo that is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I use the silk18 conditioner with it for best results overall.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> will continue to use this, till i am getting any better than this.</li>

            <li> And shines even more just with the shampoo and conditioner from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> I researched a lot of different brands and felt that buying from this company I would get the best quality with a resonable price point.  </li>
            <li> and my hair feels and looks so much better</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the smell of the shampoo, and like that it&#x27;s sulfate free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and my hair just keeps on getting better and better.</li>
            <li> Bargain dish soap would have been better.  </li>

            <li> Also a more potent smell.   </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased</li>
            <li> I did see rave reviews but wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> This shampoo was okay.</li>
            <li> Most of the shampoo&#x27;s ranging from pantene/dove to bolage volumizing range</li>
            <li> I would love a bit more info on the ingredients in Maple Holistics products.</li>
            <li> It also, like I said, made my scalp feel much better than when I was using non-natural shampoos</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> And as I have heard of the many benefits of argan oil</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li> Thank You Maple Holistics for creating such an awesome shampoo.</li>
            <li> This was not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But this product worked better than I thought.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: I think this Argan shampoo is better for oily hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the richest most luxurious product I&#x27;ve ever used to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> but I also bought the conditioner which was magical.</li>

            <li> So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> What more can be asked?  </li>
            <li> I am so incredibly pleased.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has no smell in my opinion, but the silk 18 has a lovely vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smell is just ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still doing the baking soda thing mostly, but my son and I do love the way our hair feels when we use this shampoo.</li>

            <li> That seemed to work better.</li>

            <li> Now I use this shampoo to make my hair healthy again.</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo</li>
            <li> the most is that I don&#x27;t lose hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this and gladly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My receding hair line is getting remarkably better.  </li>
            <li> Love this product  </li>
            <li> and they surely did not overstate that all you need is a quarter sized amount.</li>
            <li> Also I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works better for me than the Soap Nuts shampoo does.</li>
            <li> It feels overall healthier which is great!</li>
            <li> Even then, that doesn&#x27;t take away from this overall great product!</li>
            <li> After using this product for almost a week, my hair looks better than ever.</li>
            <li> I love all the ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> I think it needs just a bit more vanilla and honey,</li>
            <li> Love this product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I will keep ordering these two products for sure.  </li>
            <li> Great product,  it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent</li>
            <li> I could not believe it, OUTSTANDING customer service.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more bottles so my girls can start using it as well.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair has shine, shine and more shine.</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this shampoo .</li>
            <li> and I really love the way it has made my hair feel and look thicker and more healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, fuller, and more healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I immediately ordered more product from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> My hair feels more moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Cleaned better than some organic shampoos I&#x27;ve tried before</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product for sure.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; ok to use once a month.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t make me feel any better).</li>
            <li> I use the silk 18 conditioner with it and together they make my hair very shiny, it feels healthier, and I don&#x27;t even have to use a leave in conditioner after because it does a great job of detangling.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair feels smooth and silky and I have seen a decrease in hair loss!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I know the value of healthy hair.</li>
            <li> But my experience shows that shampoos that contain no conditioner are healthier, because it is better if the conditioner does not reach the scalp.</li>
            <li> I love most about this shampoo</li>
            <li> I tried many hair products, but they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It is sulfate free and hypoallergenic !</li>
            <li> I bought this product a while ago and really love it.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is improving with every shampoo -- it looks and feels so healthy, I love touching it.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this product and using it now for the 4th time, I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair look even more.  </li>
            <li> Used to use Organic Excellence, but like this better.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is sulfate free!</li>
            <li> I honestly ordered this shampoo because the ingredients sounded like they&#x27;d make my hair smell fabulous</li>
            <li> Great gentle shampoo to use often.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> but I will try again to see more results.</li>
            <li> My husband even likes it. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are completely satisfied with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I really love it.  </li>
            <li> It gave me more body than any shampoo has before</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hairs looks more shinny, more dense.</li>
            <li> I am in love with shampoo now.</li>
            <li> I had practically given up on my hair ever looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> After trying this shampoo, it works well to keep my hair look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> It seems to make more volume to my hair, since the hair must have some nutrition from it.</li>
            <li> I like it! :)</li>
            <li> OK girl&#x27;s this is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My mom actually recommended this to me.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my hair</li>
            <li> And I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Giving it more time made a difference.</li>
            <li> Glad I found a winner.</li>
            <li> nice light scent.</li>
            <li> Sulfate free hair products have made my hair so soft and healthy,  but this one is THEORY best.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Sage better if you like earthy smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I think I like it. :)</li>
            <li> Even though it is sulfate free, I get a nice lather.  </li>
            <li> I also ordered the Silk 18, and together, these products have made my hair a bit more manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a month now and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> good thing about this is that it is fully natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, it is good for your hair follicles for stimulation and cessation of hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> With the conditioner it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> Overall great product!</li>
            <li> Their customer service receives a 5 star for sure.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this because I&#x27;m allergic to sulfate</li>
            <li> but I thought a light scent would be nice.</li>
            <li> Root Booster and hair spray on top of shampoo and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through many, many.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I wish that more companies would pay attention to their business model!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells great and it cleanses my scalp and hair really well.</li>
            <li> So glad I switched to it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>

            <li> I am very happy with this shampoo overall.</li>
            <li> I love the neutral scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I will defiantly be buying more and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br</li>
            <li> latest order is their dandruff shampoo to have another family member try.  </li>
            <li> Not only was the shampoo excellent on my hair, the smell was nice and the shampoo rich.  </li>
            <li> It has a lovely scent and it&#x27;s very rich.</li>
            <li> For being sulfate free, you still get a nice lather and my hair feels very clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet very effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light nutty fragrance and rich lather produce a very nice calming effect that anyone can appreciate and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and it dries out easily with styling.</li>
            <li> I searched amazon for a a natural and organic shampoo that had good reviews and found Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It is full, shiny, and healthy!</li>
            <li> The sulfate free aspect keeps my color vibrant and the oils keep my hair nice and healthy!!</li>
            <li> Good natural shampoo...doesn&#x27;t really have a strong smell and lathers great!  </li>
            <li> Great shampoo, first time using a sulfate free product</li>
            <li> and it does a nice job making your hair feel clean without drying out.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing, it leaves my hair and beard nice and clean, but, it doesn&#x27;t have that squeaky, over-dry feeling.</li>
            <li> The Silk conditioner has a wonderful vanilla scent and I wish the shampoo could incorporate the same type of pleasant scent!&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> I notified Amazon and received a prompt refund for that particular product, great customer service.  </li>
            <li> There is no smell to this shampoo, and though it does not foam, it still gets my hair nice and clean every time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> think that this is a great product, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and shiny and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> It felt very clean as well as moisturized.</li>
            <li> Has a very clean smell and gives plenty of slip.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are quite benign and the results are pretty good.</li>
            <li> It lathers pretty good.</li>
            <li> My hair and I are very happy and looking forward to a long relationship with Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> best shampoo i have ever used, will not stop using this product as long as it is work for me.</li>
            <li> Now , my hair looks so soft and beautiful  .</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m willing to ignore it for the good effects.</li>
            <li> Impressed with how soft hair felt after the first wash and not stripped at all!</li>
            <li> love this very good for my curly frizzy coarse hair</li>
            <li> I was so excited and relieved when I found this!  </li>
            <li> This very light fragrance is fine for men and women.</li>
            <li> It works great - my hair feels better after washing &amp; conditioning with their Silk18 Natural Conditioner, and it&#x27;s prettier.  </li>
            <li> Smelled great, and love that is all natural.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is wonderful, and it works well with the shampoo (and I also apply a leave in conditioner and some finishing serum after I blow dry).</li>
            <li> I love this product and the way it makes the hair shine and is easy to style.</li>
            <li> My wife who requires a mild shampoo because of a scalp condition also liked  this product.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a strong smell after use (which is ok).</li>
            <li> It has a strong soapy smell that isn&#x27;t appealing to me.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos on the market have extremely strong aromas.</li>
            <li> I think it would be excellent used in dry hair...  </li>
            <li> It lathered nicely, rinsed well and most importantly my scalp and hair felt clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased that this shampoo makes my hair cooperative and easy to style as I want, while also making it feel healthier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking quite awhile for a mild but effective shampoo....</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this product, has good lather and doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> This product is great: it is soft and I love using it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling very soft and it has great lather for a sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair look great after using it, very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This is great for a natural shampoo!</li>
            <li> and i liked it in very first time.</li>
            <li> However, my hair is fine and it does give it more texture and body.</li>
            <li> Shiny, clean hair!</li>
            <li> I also love that it actually smells good!</li>
            <li> A surprising dense foam that leaves your hair feeling remarkably clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and it&#x27;s nice and smooth after a wash followed with the Silk conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product, however, left my hair feeling so clean and it styles great!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and used to look oily about 15 hours after shampooing, but now it looks clean for over 24 hours after washing.  </li>
            <li> I use this with Argan Oil conditioner, love the combo, smooth, silky hair, no sulfates</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients make me feel great about using it</li>
            <li> , the dandruff is so much better, she says she’s never seen it this dandruff free before.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo, which makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I have had many compliments on the fragrance which is light.</li>
            <li> Love that the smell is so light.</li>
            <li> As I was creating a healthier regime for myself, I started to notice how well my complexion was becoming</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Hair felt more hydrated and smooth after blow drying.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased just after my first shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to know it&#x27;s all natural too.</li>

            <li> This is a great Natural Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Well I was pleasantly surprised how great my hair and scalp felt.</li>
            <li> this is a great shampoo for natural hair also</li>
            <li> I was happy with it for a while since it was natural</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll spend more if you buy two 8oz bottles here on Amazon, although the Amazon price is a bit cheaper than the website price and shipping&#x27;s free if you have prime or do the $35+ purchase thing.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot and it better for your hair because its sulfur free...</li>
            <li> , i tried this for the first time and I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>

            <li> As I was creating a healthier regime for myself, I started to notice how well my complexion was becoming</li>
            <li> There is no odor to it at all, so if you&#x27;re looked for a great natural product, I&#x27;d recommend this one.</li>
            <li> help keep it from drying out or becoming damaged.</li>
            <li> Loreal sulfate free is way better</li>
            <li> Argan&#x27;s shampoo couldn&#x27;t have filled my needs better.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and naturally conditions the hair without making it oily or leaving build up.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good sulfate free shampoo and this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> After searching online about my problem I have read that sulfate free shampoo will help with my problems :)</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly great for a shampoo made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> A great natural product.</li>
            <li> Enjoy this product so much better than Wen shampoo.</li>
            <li> Reasonable and just a good product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to use that much product in order to get a good coverage</li>
            <li> We loved this so much we ordered the shampoo again and this time got the conditioner to go with it.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the Whole Foods shampoo and conditioner which was good</li>
            <li> Argan oil works really well in my hair and this is a good brand.</li>
            <li> I looked up all the ingredients and they&#x27;re all gentle and of good quality</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT shampoo if you have very sensitive skin like myself, but still want a clean fresh feeling in your hair without any harshness or strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and great communication.</li>
            <li> Although I liked the product I do not think it is right for me.</li>
            <li> hair feels very nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> Since I have had such good luck with Maple Holistics shampoo, I hope to now pair it with the Silk Conditioner!</li>
            <li> If you prefer a more sleek and rich shampoo, you would like the argan oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> Is an overall good Shampoo!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also observed that it does not foam significantly unless you lather more than once.</li>
            <li> I plan on trying their other shampoos and alternating to see what works best.</li>
            <li> Hair happy and light and natural.</li>
            <li> I especially want to give huge kudos to the company, Maple Holistics, for incredible customer service.</li>
            <li> Next time, I will probably use some sort of detangling product, but this shampoo is great by itself and I have never been as pleased by using a shampoo alone.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the shampoo is like a thinner lotion, so it&#x27;s fairly easy to apply all over the head.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my hair feels and paired with Silk 18</li>
            <li> My hair has seemed to change over the years,  Drier and not as easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to rinse ...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t strip your color away, yet you feel like your hair is clean and healthy after use.</li>
            <li> We love the neutral scent, It just feels completely clean..</li>
            <li> My scalp feels clean afterwards and my hair holds conditioner better.</li>
            <li> I ordered a couple of products, which were delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> This makes my scalp itch and my hair break easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to rinse it off too.</li>
            <li> Her hair is curly, frizzy, and gets split ends easily.</li>
            <li> Not too strong of a scent, so it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It feels so strong and shiny now.</li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t a strong smell.</li>
            <li> so I mainly use this to keep my scalp feeling refreshed and smelling good.</li>
            <li> does nt a have strong overbearing smell.</li>
            <li> so i strongly recommend it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a strong perfume smell</li>
            <li> It foams up surprisingly well (very well) for a sulfate- free shampoo.</li>
            <li> grey and product is very good for colored hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many years of searching for the right product for me, thank you Maple Holistics, I believe I have found it!</li>
            <li> It really does make your hair very smooth and it eliminates frizz!  </li>
            <li> The only improvement that would make this product perfect (for me, anyway) would be the scent - it smells &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but kind of like old vanilla or something.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of organic ingredients and that in combination with the sulfate free component have made it great for maintaining red hair.  </li>
            <li> I have always been a Pantene/Herbal Essence kind of girl, but using this shampoo has shown me the benefits of using a higher quality product.  </li>
            <li> the first bottle I really liked.</li>
            <li> I honestly would highly recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s on the fence about it because it will go beyond your expectations!!</li>
            <li> The best part is that it&#x27;s free of sulfates, paraben and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt happier or more full of body.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is so great my hair felt so clean and soft</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean, but more importantly it seems fuller.</li>

            <li> It is sulphate free and full of moisturizing oils which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself works just fine.</li>

            <li> I have fine wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The product worked wonderful my hair feels softer and less fizzy.</li>

            <li> It lathers nicely without having to use very much and does a nice job gently cleansing my hair.</li>
            <li> Firstly I would like to say their after sales team/customer service team needs a huge applause because they really try to do everything in their power to make the purchase a great one.</li>
            <li> People hug me and then comment on how much they love the smell of my hair all the time!  </li>

            <li> I have noticed huge  reduction in hair fall also.</li>
            <li> After just a couple weeks use I can see a huge improvement in the health of my hair and scalp.</li>

            <li> I find it bizarre that this product claims to be natural and good for your hair</li>
            <li> would expect a shampoo made from all these natural ingredients to have a nice healthy smell, but Argan doesn’t seem to have any smell at all.</li>
            <li> Good product, cleans hair well and is natural.</li>
            <li> hello natural good for me</li>
            <li> For the cost, it is a good product; in comparison I used to pay more than $30 for shampoo, with lesser results.</li>
            <li> but she wanted to try something more natural and effective but after about 3 months now of using she told me</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t have a lot of smell as such which is good as I sometimes apply oil to my hear whose smell I love</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve already using this product for a few weeks, and it seems to me that my hear looks much better, much brilliant.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get my hair to look and feel this good unless I&#x27;ve just come back from the hair salon.</li>
            <li> I like it so far and the felling of using something that has no chemicals make me feel good.</li>

            <li> I will definitely be buying more products from this company!!</li>
            <li> Really!!!</li>
            <li> This product left my hair very nice and was used with Silk 18 conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice clean smell and it does not take much about a nickel size for my hair</li>
            <li> lathered up greatly and left my hair clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good but makes my hair really clean and soft.</li>
            <li> originally bought this because of the reviews, but it was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li> I originally made this purchase because it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li> Super shine and full of body!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair squeaky clean, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair squeaky clean, smooth, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the argan oil shampoo and silk 18 conditioner about a  month and a half ago and wanted to make sure to use it for a while before reviewing to make sure I had a good idea.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this shampoo has made my hair better than normal as it had been a while since my hair had felt healthy.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product as it was sulphate free and am amazed how much I liked it!</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is my first go at using a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> She has Never requested a particular product before and always just shrugs when I ask her if she liked something</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t a smell, but that&#x27;s ok, as I&#x27;ve paired it with the Silk 18 and that has a pleasant natural vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> All natural, sulfate free (great for hair that has been straightened) and my hair feels so soft :)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because it&#x27;s organic and very gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this argan shampoo and honestly could tell a difference right away with my first wash.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s great, though I would love if it had a slight scent.</li>
            <li> but I expected a more pleasant smell given the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I loved the conditioner, but this was less popular.</li>
            <li> It surprising foams up better than other brands and doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume.</li>
            <li> Overall, amazing brand!</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and light, and I haven&#x27;t experienced an oily scalp or dry ends.  </li>
            <li> This is, without doubt, the best product that I have ever used and no more itchy scalp...</li>
            <li> Astonishingly, my hair started falling after first use.</li>
            <li> I have seen a significant decrease in scalp buildup and my hair stays cleaner for a longer amount of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> I may be a small purchaser, but I still want to support them by purchasing their products in gratitude for the great way their c/s worked with me!</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh!</li>
            <li> When it came I was excited and scared to try it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about three weeks and am very pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fresh fragrance!  </li>
            <li> I was excited when it arrived to try it out.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s worth it to me for the results I get!</li>
            <li> Fell in love with Argan Oil Shampoo from the first time.</li>
            <li> am very pleased and I recommend you guys with natural coily 4a/b/c hair textures to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Love the part that its sulfate free and 100% all natural ingredients :)</li>

            <li> I purchased it and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> originally bought this shampoo , along with the silk 18 conditioner for one of my guest bathrooms.</li>

            <li> she was so excited</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair; I use a small amount of Argan Oil Shampoo and follow up with the Silk 18 conditioner (scent is awesome!).  </li>
            <li> and it gets a lot better with time, the second time was already ok!</li>
            <li> Their emails were always friendly and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am excited to see how it keeps doing wonders to her hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product: surely become  one  regular customer!</li>
            <li> While I like how clean this leaves my hair feeling, and it looks very healthy and soft in combination with the Silk conditioner, I do want to say one thing: I would not claim that this shampoo is color friendly.  </li>
            <li> The product cut right through the oil and dirt in my hair and agin made my hair squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to find a natural shampoo that has good performance and is much lower cost than Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> My hair feels truly clean after using the argan shampoo</li>
            <li> My hair has volume, feels clean, and my scalp isn&#x27;t irritated BC of no sulfate.</li>

            <li> It does clean well.</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean and I didn&#x27;t get itchy.</li>
            <li> I realize without sulfates, there won&#x27;t be much lather (I have experienced this with Burt&#x27;s Bees), but I have had no trouble getting this shampoo to lather.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use a lot either, because my hair is shiny and clean just after one shampoo.</li>
            <li> After one wash my hair already feels clean and not caked with product.</li>
            <li> After shampooing, my hair feels clean, without any residue.  </li>

            <li> The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is that I wish I liked the scent more.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean.  </li>

            <li> Their bottles are filled to the brim, the shampoo is unscented with no harmful additives what so ever and leaves my scalp feeling super clean after a wash.  </li>
            <li> I approve of the ingredient list, both of our scalps feel clean and not itchy and there is no leftover residue.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is not great, but that is OK because the conditioner smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Before She found maple holistic products she had gone through so many shampoo and conditioning products and had not been able to find one that made her hair as soft and manageable as these do.</li>
            <li> 3 times before  clean.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is nice, but the end result does not leave your hair either soft, shiny, or frizz free.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean my hair well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly sensitve to chemicals and whatever else gets tossed into the cooker with standard shampoos, and everything from the ends of my hair to my scalp has responded very well to this.  </li>

            <li> My scalp feels squeaky clean and it is on the mend.  </li>
            <li> just feels completely clean</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to get my hair really clean, without stripping it.  </li>
            <li> The only downside to this is that it doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant scent that you expect from hair care products.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, and the positive health attributes it has for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of this line but there were so many positive reviews I made a purchase.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this shampoo and felt it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to post a review without actually trying this AMAZING Shampoo!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the shampoo and left it in my hair like it said I felt a tingling sensation which felt kind of nice.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice and soft!</li>
            <li> and my hair has never felt this soft and healthy!  </li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants soft, beautiful, healthy shiny hair ♡</li>
            <li> and my hair felt full and clean.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was not too rich, it feels like its just enough to keep the good stuff in the hair without the greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> and my hair felt full and clean.</li>
            <li> this year I wanted to try something more natural, I&#x27;m super glad</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I would most certainly re-order it again.</li>
            <li> It feels good knowing I&#x27;m using all natural ingredients and will definitely buy more products of maple holistics!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would be good on my color treated hair, clean, add moisture, and would feel like it was actually cleaning my hair without stripping it..  </li>
            <li> for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s with straight, fine, flyaway hair--I don&#x27;t even need to brush my hair anymore :)</li>
            <li> Super excited.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s all natural, no chemicals or sulfates, I would highly recommend everyone should try this shampoo, and the price is great too.</li>
            <li> so far so good, this shampoo is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo rates as the best I have ever found, ending a years long search for a natural shampoo that likes my hair.</li>
            <li> This product not only feels healthy, but it also does a great job at keeping my hair soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Its it nice shampoo, but i felt my hairs started to turn more grey</li>
            <li> The product is really amazing and natural.</li>
            <li> Because the shampoo was such a success, I purchased the Silk 18 conditioner, and let me tell you--this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d absolutely buy in bulk :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell and my hair is very manageable.</li>
            <li> Nice natural product.</li>
            <li> Sweet smell, makes my hair appear smoother and shiner.</li>
            <li> And it makes my hair full and bouncy...</li>
            <li> So I emailed him back saying I loved my two bottles that I got correctly</li>
            <li> It cleans your hair and scalp thoroughly, so be prepared to use a good conditioner afterward (such as their Silk 18).</li>
            <li> yes its true</li>
            <li> If the product holds true to what it says, then you got what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Already, my hair has more body, shine and texture to it - and is looking like real hair - not frizzy-foam.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand what many people are writing here regarding the lather feeling and what not.</li>
            <li> One day in the shower as I was using my Herbal Essence, I read the ingredients out of curiosity and had an idea: “I should invest in some actual good shampoo’s”.</li>
            <li> I am a true beleiver and will be stock piling this stuff.</li>
            <li> Much recommended. :]</li>
            <li> how fast it work I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet smelling but not the scent</li>
            <li> Good product , will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also such a good price.</li>
            <li> It also builds a nice lather, which I was concerned about since I hadn&#x27;t used a natural shampoo before.</li>
            <li> Not only Argan oil shampoo is sulfate free, it smells nice and the convination of the keratin treatment (now available in amazon too:</li>
            <li> I bought this with the Silk 18 Conditioner and actually prefer the shampoo as I have to use a TON of the conditioner to get good results.</li>
            <li> we really love this shampoo and my husband said it really helped his scalp.  </li>
            <li> I did not buy it up front because, frankly, I didn&#x27;t have much hope it would be any better than all the others.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells good too, will definitely will buy it again</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thought i have not seen drastic change after using this product but its good for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I expected my hair to be more silkier after using it, but maybe you&#x27;re supposed to use it with the same conditioner for best results.</li>
            <li> I decided to go full Maple Holistic force and use their Argan oil shampoo along with the silk vanilla conditioner.</li>
            <li> Now I know why they get such good reviews</li>
            <li> sulfates which I understand strip your hair of its own natural oils.  </li>
            <li> It would just be nice for there to be a simpler ingredients listed instead of the first two-thirds of the list looking like gibberish lol or for the bottle to come with a small info sheet on ALL the ingredients that you see in the list.</li>
            <li> She loved the smell, and the way the product left her hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is for sure my absolute favorite!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving the results, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> One day in the shower as I was using my Herbal Essence, I read the ingredients out of curiosity and had an idea: “I should invest in some actual good shampoo’s”.</li>
            <li> Like the conditioner, I cannot say enough good about this product.  </li>
            <li> Good simple shampoo that cleanses as it moisturizes.</li>
            <li> My wife recently came to the U.S. and she was looking for a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> Such a good find!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I noticed the shampoo and conditioner leaves no residue as my hair looks good even the next morning,.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesitant to write &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; until the 6th or 7th date, being a modern woman and all.  </li>
            <li> All in all, leaves my hair clean, is mild so</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells as sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li> It lathered nicely, rinsed out easily and left my hair feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair about twice a week, if that, and always with cool water.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really nice, it cleans the hair well but does not strip off natural hair oil (cause it contains argan oil).</li>
            <li> And you truly only need a quarter size amount to get good lather.</li>
            <li> I have tried many shampoos for her, and ordered her the Degreaser because her scalp is always very itchy.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m having good feed back....</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair really nice and soft, but it still has body.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very moisturizing and healthy.</li>
            <li> , I ordered the Silk 18 conditioner and can’t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell...</li>
            <li> First time trying Argan oil and so Far so good.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that I have to wash daily, sometimes more.</li>
            <li> new shampoo and making sure my ordering process went smoothly.</li>
            <li> The next time I used it, I used my normal styling products after shampooing, and was excited to see beautiful, full, shiny hair under control.  </li>
            <li> The ends of my hair HAD been dry, making me want to cut off a good 4&amp;#34;, and after using this shampoo - it was smooth as a baby&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> I am very very pleased with their customer service and look forward to trying the latest version of the Argan Shampoo as well as other products.  </li>
            <li> Using very small amounts and it works great!  </li>
            <li> very soft very fine.</li>
            <li> in two days it made a huge difference and my hair is much more soft now.</li>
            <li> My hair is now super shiny and because I have an ombre, the sulfate-free aspect of the shampoo is also helpful.</li>
            <li> i like touching them now :) i would definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of Argan shampoo and it leaves me feeling satisfied and safe.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily hair and this removes oil and keeps hair smooth, shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I love all the fact that it&#x27;s all natural, sulfate free.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great to clean my hair and leaves it less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, soft, shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> I do find that when you rinse it out I get a straw like feeling in my hair, but with the Silk 18 conditioner that goes away quickly and leaves my hair silky</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big difference in softness, more shiny, more body.</li>
            <li> This stuff is quite mild.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo and quickly realized how well balanced it was for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love that this shampoo is sulfate free and completely natural.</li>
            <li> We have members of our household with chemical sensitivities, but most fragrance free or natural shampoos are lacking in quality.  </li>
            <li> In just one use this shampoo softened and smoothed my hair, making it super manageable--as if it were conditioner.</li>
            <li> The fragranes are mild which I like.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays cleaner longer and is super shiny.  </li>
            <li> I believe the &amp;#34;Silk&amp;#34; Conditioner would compliment this product well and would love to try that next!! :))</li>
            <li> Used this for 3 weeks, it feels great on the hair but leave the hair thin.&lt;br /&gt;OK as shampoo, but don&#x27;t expect anything more (i.e. not effective for hair-loss)</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m in love with this brand &amp; will definitely be purchasing more from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m guessing I have a mild allergic reaction to something.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers beautifully and a little does the job.</li>
            <li> I am sure it was do to the oils in it; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The argan oil makes it suitable for more dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> The latter is a super traditional oil known for making hair nice and shiny in my culture, so I knew this shampoo would be good.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the fragrance would be overwhelming, as I am sensitive to perfumes, I was happy to discover that the scent, while not light, is not too strong</li>
            <li> Had to use a lot to get it to clean right.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty brittle, as a rule, because of all the cheap, supermarket shampoos.</li>
            <li> From the very first time I used this shampoo - my problem went away - I&#x27;m NOT exaggerating.</li>
            <li> It blows my mind that this took care of my problem with the very first use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal healthy state.</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle with my hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a shampoo product emphasizing on sulfate free.</li>
            <li> The silk 18 conditioner though is something I am willing to try and hopefully I will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Why would you want a free product if you didn&#x27;t like it in the first place?  </li>
            <li> A noticeable difference from the very first time.</li>
            <li> If you first ever trying sulfate free shampoo, I would recommend try this product from Maple Holistics</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it my hair stopped impersonating a bale of straw.</li>
            <li> My normal 3 dollar suave professionals shampoo is so much better.</li>
            <li> This product has assisted in calming down the frizz, smells great</li>
            <li> This shampoo might be good for someone with super dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I love Herbal Essence and all of the new scents, and products...</li>
            <li> The product itself does work its magic, after the first use my hair became very smooth and shine the next day.</li>
            <li> The lather feels silky and rich, and my hair is soft and very clean after using it.</li>
            <li> but if you leave it long enough and pair it with the silk 8 conditioner it works best with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel dry and brittle, gave it 2 stars because it made it on time, in good shape</li>
            <li> The scent is not as pleasant as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and full of body it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> It did last a lot longer than expected and is the perfect for taking on a trip, but for my at home bathroom I would definitely love a bigger bottle and even better if it had a pump.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell the long term effects, but I can say that it sure lathers up well for a sulfate free product!</li>
            <li> It tends to dry out my hair,so I use a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I did some research not too long ago to find the best product for my hair, that will not build up and that will make my hair come back to life after years of coloring.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo as it can be used for color treated hair and leaves it very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> We love all that is natural and that comes from nature!</li>
            <li> I love that this shampoo is all natural!</li>
            <li> /&gt;cost is slightly high for me, but I will invest the money if the product does what it says!!!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product and the fact that my hair was shining after the first use!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the third time tonight and still love it!</li>
            <li> Thanks Maple Holistics!!</li>
            <li> I am totally going to buy more!</li>
            <li> I assure you that you will be happy you made the jump.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Not a paid spokesperson or relative of Maple Holistics&amp;#34; - just a new customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s hair products that make the top of my head itch, not dandruff or the like, but this shampoo would probably help a lot of scalp or dry hair problems.</li>
            <li> Together with the conditioner, which I also love, my hair is super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had more natural hair than I thought</li>
            <li> this is a very nice shampoo I use sulfate free shampoo for the past 5 years and my hair has increased in volume.</li>
            <li> It lathers better than most natural shampoos do, which is refreshing after using non-lathering shampoos for so long.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very smooth, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it makes it feel so much thicker.</li>
            <li> This one works good for me, my hair didn&#x27;t feel as dry before I applied the condition, so I&#x27;ll keep using!</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair that gets oily after a day.</li>
            <li> the hair moisturized nice thick consistency and has a tropical fruity smell wonder if there is an matching conditioner because it would be a perfect combo and most likely give you the full benefit of the shampoo that&#x27;s the only downside in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works into a very nice lather even when using the recommended amount or less.</li>
            <li> For the amount you need you get a pretty decent lather, and I haven&#x27;t found that I&#x27;ve needed more than the recommended amount.</li>
            <li> I loved that it is sulfate free, I like the smell of it, but I had a little problem with the bottle, when I traveled the shampoo leaked, although I wrapped it well.</li>
            <li> The first wash did nothing special to my hair.</li>
            <li> No heaviness, no frizz, nice subtle scent, and best of all you don&#x27;t need half a cup full to get your hair clean.  </li>
            <li> (free of the &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; etc.), yet the ingredients list shows that it contains &amp;#34;Acrylates Copolymer&amp;#34; which is definitely NOT natural and I highly doubt it is good for you or your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was really shiny and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> Great product, while some of the reviews I read found it to be a negative that the product is virtually unscented, it&#x27;s a huge boon for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair and skin feel nourished and calm.</li>
            <li> Love that it is completely natural and healthy for my natural wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a huge difference</li>
            <li> What makes this shampoo amazing besides being sulfate-free is that it does not rob my hair of moisture, but actually hydrates it!</li>
            <li> I have semi-thick, wavy, oily hair and each wash leaves me hair feeling smooth and much dryer.</li>
            <li> My shampoo arrived March 6th, and by 4/17, I had gone through maybe 40% of the bottle; so it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, soft shiny hair and no itchy scalp/</li>
            <li> I had some success, but I just never found a recipe that I was sold on.  </li>
            <li> Love this all natural product.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of in the middle.</li>
            <li> This does the job and leaves my hair bouncy and fresh.</li>
            <li> Money is worth it</li>
            <li> it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love this all natural product.  </li>
            <li> but I decided to change what I put on my head to something more natural and ended up with this product.</li>
            <li> So instead, I wanted to try a more natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> So many added benefits from the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> there are no heavy perfume smells and it makes my hair look so healthy.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> However, I do wish there was more of a natural moisturizer agent in it.</li>
            <li> I got it on time and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is an investment, but one that is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Good lather, however not much in the way of fragrance.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I love maple holistics and it&#x27;s natural glowing products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, their products contain no harmful ingredients such as sulfates.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price for what you get.</li>
            <li> As a male I love that this shampoo is also fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I love all the natural ingredients in the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> something else (more masculine).</li>
            <li> This is a lovely shampoo if you are looking for something natural that you can use every day.  </li>
            <li> Still, you get what you pay for, and I think this is worth it.</li>
            <li> Another cool thing is that you can see all this after your first use.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> so a bigger size would be nice.</li>
            <li> love that is natural.</li>
            <li> So far, so good after using it along with the natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sulfate-free, more natural alternative to nourish my hair.  </li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to clarify that the Silk18 conditioner I used, from the same seller, is the nice smelling product.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this a week ago and so far have used it many times.</li>
            <li> and my hair feels soft and looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> , maple holistics had incidentally sent me an email asking how I like their products, I responded honestly that their conditioner was terrific, and explained what I didn&#x27;t like about their shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I can only give this shampoo 3 stars to reflect my own experience.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo recently after doing a lot of research on the internet for Sulfate Free and Natural (good for colored hair) shampoos.</li>
            <li> This made my hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> honestly feels like a deep cleansing treatment and</li>
            <li> think the shampoo is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I would defiantly recommend to others, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I started out by making my own recipes I had found on the internet from various health blogs, but never found one that worked for me.</li>
            <li> If you DONT condition afterward, like most natural shampoos, it WILL leave it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have noticed my hair feels healthier, my scalp is better (but its winter so not totally flake free)</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean, soft, and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a nice, subtle aroma (strong odors are more of a turn off</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if my hair is any shinier but it feels much better over my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, manageable, not frizzy and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> My complimentary sample from Maple Holistics will run out soon</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s made my hair really soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> Once in a while I use another natural shampoo that conditions more.</li>
            <li> Love this all natural product.</li>
            <li> I like that it has all natural ingredients and is color safe.  </li>
            <li> (lathers nicely, hair shiny and soft), but I started to notice my scalp was really itchy between washings</li>
            <li> Now her hair is soft, shiny, and her ends look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li> Overall, I appreciate that the argan oil shampoo has more natural ingredients and will see if I notice more significant results.</li>
            <li> just a small amount of product to do the job it did for me is worth the money, not to mention that it is simply more healthy for my hair all around!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to repair their hair or just want soft lovely hair!!</li>
            <li> this shampoo is wonderful, my scalp feels relieved and calm, thank you.&amp;#34; The next use was a confirmation the oils in the shampoo work to restore moisture in the scalp by eliminating in one the oily hair and the dryness on the other.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was relatively reasonable compared to a lot of other organic shampoos and it had great reviews.</li>
            <li> very smooth for the first use, and you can feel how natural it is after finishing washing your hair: no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> Decent product, but it didn&#x27;t work for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, Full list of ingredients (which i really appreciate), but did slightly dry my hair out (In all fairness everything drys my hair</li>
            <li> it left my hair nice and soft, shiny, and clean!</li>
            <li> First things first, this shampoo does its job by getting my hair clean.</li>
            <li> Love the clean fragrance of this shampoo but for my hair, it clarified a bit too much - left it</li>
            <li> This doea the job but follow up a second wash for better clean.</li>
            <li> It does not bubble as much as the regular brand of shampoo, but it bubbles plenty enough and smells very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s good to have this for about three time a week (if you was every day) or every other wash if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers very well and leaves my hair soft, shiny, frizz-less and beautiful overall.</li>
            <li> while it’s good, I find that my hair is greasier looking than it is from using other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I had to use about two quarter sizes of the argan oil shampoo (one for the first wash and slightly more for the repeat) and for the 100% Pure stuff I used an amount a bit bigger than a silver dollar on the first wash and again on the repeat wash before I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> this one just sounded right after reading the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This right amount will depend on everybody&#x27;s hair types, hair volume and hair condition.</li>
            <li> Right from the start</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just right.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t believe the people who say the smell goes away right away.</li>
            <li> I ordered by mistake and and tried to cancel nearly right after the order, but I couldnt.  </li>
            <li> Has the right amount of lather and gentleness in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It shipped out right away and was on time.</li>
            <li> I had to try it out right away and was amazed.</li>
            <li> To my surprise I was pleased with the results for not following with a conditioner, I think that says a lot right there!</li>
            <li> Most of the time I loose my hair or feel that the product is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> First , there is way to much lather for a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is pretty much fragrance free.</li>
            <li> It became frizzy and unmanageable, and so I tried a digital perm which left my hair beautiful and wavy... for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Wow this a no BS product it is great my long curly hair loves it</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly because of the sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can really feel that my hair is clean after using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Lathers really well, hair is clean.</li>
            <li> This was the first all natural shampoo that I tried and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I am usually very sensitive to strong smells, perfumes, etc</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners over the years and more recently searching for something that would really help and not just mask what was really going on with my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is more manageable, less straw-like, and has more life to it.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and it left my hair soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling amazing after a long day of swimming and exposing your hair to chlorine.</li>
            <li> The price is a tad higher than the run-of-the-mill shampoos - but it is worth it to avoid a bunch of chemicals wreaking havoc on your hair.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product mostly because it is vegan friendly and contains my favorite oils such as argan, jojoba, avocado, almond.</li>
            <li> When it was long, it had to be in a ponytail and even then the tail had a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling especially clean afterwards, and I felt like my hair texture was a little rougher after use.</li>
            <li> This product has lefty hair feeling clean, soft, and full.  </li>
            <li> It smells pretty good as well, not too strong as some other natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use just this shampoo on my daughters fine hair and forgo the conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, but does keep her fine hair tangle free.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft, silky, full, and no frizz!  </li>
            <li> I just squeeze off the excess with my hand and let the residue kind drip dry.</li>
            <li> you can easily notice the &#x27;natural&#x27; feeling you get from the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It has a mild smell, and a gentle lather.</li>
            <li> product leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> After one use my hair feels extremely clean, it&#x27;s soft, and it&#x27;s super shiny.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love thus product; it cleaned my hair and it DID NOT dry out my curls.</li>
            <li> It lingers enough to make my hair smell softly clean when I sniff it, but it doesn&#x27;t punch me in the nose with strong perfumes every time I brush it or take it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just easy to handle and last clean for a while</li>
            <li> I just ordered different kind this time because I want to try all of them:)I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say that you&#x27;ll have earth-shattering, clean and healthy hair after using this, but it might very well be overall better than what you&#x27;re currently using and is worth a try if you&#x27;re in the market for a healthier shampoo.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfumed fragrance and feels like made from all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Similarly, you would deprive your body of important ingredients by choosing cheap food options.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft &amp; combs out easily.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t purchase again, any natural shampoo at whole foods would be better.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiney; plus, I really like that it is safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Also Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner leaves my hair shiny &amp; soft, easy to manage .</li>
            <li> I am a very natural, chemical free, and holistic person and this fits the bill for me.</li>
            <li> Does a good job as far as in cleaning but left my hair very very tangled and not moisturized.</li>
            <li> It actually lathers really well, which is something i haven&#x27;t found to be true with many shampoos.</li>
            <li> The 100% Pure shampoo was $25 for a 13oz bottle, and like I said, I had to use much more than the Maple Holistics shampoo, so it was more money for less product</li>
            <li> I have very super fine hair and damaged from blow dry.</li>
            <li> i love this product as it left my hair feeling lovely and soft and is really shiny</li>
            <li> Very much recommended.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo very much</li>
            <li> I got the Argan shampoo and it arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend trying this shampoo for yourself !</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day, and by the morning of the second day, my scalp would be incredibly oily and itchy.</li>
            <li> It sounds better than other products which use whatever chemicals available.</li>
            <li> so far it fine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean, shiny, soft, very manageable, and smelling clean.  </li>
            <li> and so it works through very easy even on my long hair.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my hair was super soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li> We live a pretty simple life and don&#x27;t use many personal care products, but this is one that I am glad exists!</li>
            <li> My scalp is naturally oily, but this shampoo introduces just the right amount of oil to your hair and scalp that it leaves you with a clean finish.</li>
            <li> UNTIL I did some extensive research and finally decided on trying this amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> , it seems like my hair is softer and just feels better overall.  </li>
            <li> it just feels so light and soft.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I am glad I purchased this product!</li>
            <li> First sulphate-free shampoo that has worked well</li>
            <li> I recently received the Silk 18 conditioner and fell in love with it</li>
            <li> It is, however, &amp;#34;Considered safe based on assumption of low absorption.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> At first it didnt seem to be working</li>
            <li> so it likely wouldnt get better overnight.  </li>
            <li> But I do use the Silk 18 from the same company and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I rinse with hot water on the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; days.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and so do my teen daughters.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the argan oil shampoo and tried it for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li> I have been searching for quality shampoo and conditioner for fine, dry hair when I found this shampoo that is Sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple products that were semi-organic (as in, they used mostly organic ingredients but were not entirely organic).</li>
            <li> In a rush I began looking into organic shampoos again, and this is my first purchase.</li>
            <li> I definitely need a trim, but I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Even after the first time using this product I felt the difference.</li>
            <li> First time  </li>
            <li> Thanks Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> I was always very self-conscious about my scalp problem - and the flaking even extended into my beard!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different and expensive products &amp; never received the kind of shine &amp; softness that these products have given my hair!!!</li>
            <li> i used it today for the first time along with the silk conditioner, and my hair feels AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before buying it looks bit expensive to me but after using it I can say this is one of the best shampoo for hair after keratin treatment and for hair fall problem too.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li> At first I was thinking this was a bit pricey -</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I began to read about many different products and decided to take a chance with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased enough that I can see ordering it again.</li>
            <li> The bottle seems to be a lot smaller than what I am used to getting, I was expecting somewhat more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2015 came around and of course I had the same resolutions as every one else “to be healthy, inside and out” and “taking care of myself”</li>
            <li> I saw instant improvement, my frizz was tamed, my hair was more manageable, I was ecstatic.</li>
            <li> I’ve used your product many times now, my hair can’t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> Moisture is absolutely necessary for hair to stay healthy.</li>
            <li> However, I apply more than the regular quantity when I want to take off the oil from my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also able to only wash my hair every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> This is the first organic shampoo that I&#x27;ve bought and it will most likely be what I use from now on.</li>
            <li> I am most definitely buying again</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> It is exactly how it&#x27;s described.</li>
            <li> Sulfate free and natural.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products and will continue to buy them in the future.</li>
            <li> (I see that someone mentioned people getting offers for free products in return for reviews.....</li>
            <li> (Oh, it also comes in a pretty bottle...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is not for me.</li>
            <li> FIRST OFF</li>
            <li> It is sulfate free which does not damage hair of all types and helps retain the natural nutrients that are found in hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product for the first time and have been using it for about a week</li>
            <li> And unlike a lot of sulfate-free shampoos, this cleans and foams really well!</li>
            <li> Shipment is fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase and will definitely re-order the product.</li>
            <li> In short, I am hoping with love and care, restoration will happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the wash it was smooth  and soft.  </li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today, lathered well</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing this shampoo and didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try and used it first time today.</li>
            <li> ALONG WITH SILK18 CONDITIONER HAS LEFT MY SCALP BETTER THAN EVER.</li>
            <li> I am going to reorder soon because my wife love it too after only one wash.</li>
            <li> I felt a difference in my hair after the first wash but the overall look and appearance of my hair seems to continue getting better after each wash.</li>
            <li> well first, then shampoo your hair.</li>
            <li> There was barely any lather at all even on the repeat wash, and I felt like I had to use much more than the Maple Holistics shampoo just to cover my whole head.</li>
            <li> Actually I think it was more.</li>
            <li> The customer follow up is outstanding, Maple Holistics seems actually concerned about selling a quality product.</li>
            <li> It lathers well on first application and even better if you follow the instructions for the second application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I have oily hair, I think I should try the DeGrease shampoo first before giving this a 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick with the Sage shampoo even though I don&#x27;t have dandruff, because the Sage shampoo leaves my hair amazingly soft, smooth and shiny, without me adding any styling products.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and the Silk 18 conditioner too!</li>
            <li> No matter what conditioners and hair products you apply after, too many washings leave your hair stripped of essential oils and your hair will suffer.  </li>
            <li> My mom was the first person to use it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what happened the first time.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizerizing, untangled my hair (nice slip), and overall, conditioned very well.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling smooth with a natural shine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that much of a smell, but I use the Silk 18 conditioner afterwards which gives my hair a fresh vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> So this shampoo wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was thinking it was going to be....</li>
            <li> My hair is already pretty long, but I haven&#x27;t had any success getting more growth.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;2015 came around and of course I had the same resolutions as every one else “to be healthy, inside and out” and “taking care of myself”</li>
            <li> I saw instant improvement, my frizz was tamed, my hair was more manageable, I was ecstatic.</li>
            <li> I’ve used your product many times now, my hair can’t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> The first two times I used this my hair felt like straw after rinsing until I used conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wait until now to write this review because I want to make sure that my non-hair loss is credit for this shampoo and not only credit for my pregnancy&#x27;s hormones.</li>
            <li> A dime size portion is more than enough.  </li>
            <li> My only beef is that i wish there more of a fruity/peachy or avocado or almond scent to it as that was one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and did not need much for a nice lather.</li>
            <li> so it is important to me that this is all natural.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> (Seborrheic dermatitis).I have been using this shampoo weekly and after the first 2 weeks I have not seen one flake.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> And so began my quest for the magic wand that would convert said straw back into silk.</li>
            <li> The first one I tried was one from Acure Organics.</li>
            <li> The only con is that I wish it smelled better</li>
            <li> I look forward to continuing my use of this product and purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> The natural extracts made my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Now I am interested in trying the Silk 18 conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is first time i am using Argon oil Shampoo</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for several weeks and it gets better each time.</li>
            <li> They really do have 100% satisfaction guaranteed!</li>
            <li> Great product especially for my long, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> It does produce suds, much more on the second wash  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First, I used sage shampoo.</li>
            <li> The biggest plus is the use of natural ingredients and sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> Her first application</li>
            <li> Its makes my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today,  lathered well</li>
            <li> Then I used blonde glam conditioner (which I love)</li>
            <li> so I would probably recommend only using the conditioner at most every two days.</li>
            <li> I received a discount coupon upon my first order and</li>
            <li> Would love if it came in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve definitely notice a change in my hair for the better.</li>
            <li> I just received this shampoo yesterday, so my first wash was this AM.  </li>
            <li> From the first use my hair is softer and shinier than it has been in years.  </li>
            <li> I recently was able to try your product over the holidays at a relatives house.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> My hair feels thicker within the first 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Love the shine it gave back to my hair and the fullness it has now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing....&amp; that one Paul Mitchell set I splurged on;).</li>
            <li> I wonder if the Sage shampoo for heavy dandruff has a good Spikenard smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thinner hair (which makes me super self-conscious since I&#x27;m only in my early 30s), but this shampoo has done a great done of providing moisture to my scalp without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> We even tried other types of sulfate free shampoos with no luck - he breaks out with many large sores on his scalp...except with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I do like the way it makes my hair feel and love that it barely has a smell to it as some shampoos have such a strong smell that can be over powering when you smell them.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo, my hair feel more smoothly and less fizzy. .</li>
            <li> This has an odd smell ... not quite as much vanilla as the conditioner, but it does not smell good to me.</li>
            <li> It works up into a nice thick lather and rinses out easily.</li>
            <li> If you write a positive review and email it to the company they will send a free gift, mine was another full size of the same Argon oil shampoo</li>
            <li> decided to chop off my perm damaged hair and just go natural!!!!</li>
            <li> it uses more natural ingredients than most other shampoos.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers nicely using only a very small amount of product, which makes it a good value.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to the many positive experiences I read about this method, it actually ended up damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> We usually never spend this much on a hair product since she gets them cheap since she coupons</li>
            <li> luckily, the smell isn&#x27;t present after the shower is over, but i guess you don&#x27;t get as much of the &amp;#34;ahhhh&amp;#34; clean feeling in the shower as with something that smells fresh and fragrant.</li>
            <li> I spent this much money in a natural product that would make my hair healthy and it made my hair break more.</li>
            <li> I will most certainly purchase again and make it my daily shampoo.  </li>
            <li> However, my hair feels and looks amazing and my scalp is not irritated like with 90% of other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other kind of shampoo again</li>
            <li> I will try their other products since this one was quite nice.</li>
            <li> This shampoo  one the other hand visibly soothes your hair no matter what kind of hair you have</li>
            <li> Not sure why so many people had such a good experience with it.</li>
            <li> I sought a shampoo that does not use damaging chemicals or leave residue; I cannot attest to the truth of these claims, but thus far I have not noticed significant residue.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is rich and conditioning, and cleans without stripping the hair of its natural oils.  </li>
            <li> Maple Holistics has a new loyal customer &amp; that says a lot, since I am not the type of person to commit to 1 brand.</li>
            <li> Since it does such a great job on the dandruff, I can live with that, but I might try their conditioner on my next order.</li>
            <li> I was looking around Whole Foods one day and noticed many shampoos that were “sulfate free” and started to try out this new “hype”, I chose their 2Chic Avocado &amp; Olive Oil for dry, damaged hair shampoo/conditioner/mask.</li>
            <li> I was looking around Whole Foods one day and noticed many shampoos that were “sulfate free” and started to try out this new “hype”, I chose their 2Chic Avocado &amp; Olive Oil for dry, damaged hair shampoo/conditioner/mask.</li>
            <li> I was comfortable with the ingredient list, and then once I used it, I was happy with the lack of a fake fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend who has unprocessed hair experienced the same issues with this.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable as natural and sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised of how clean my scalp feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel irritated, and my hair is soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Clean, soft and shine.</li>
            <li> Using this combined with Silk 18 however my hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and clean; I like conditioner for smoothness.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and wavy, and my hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li> Make sure not to use too much, just the recommended use (a quarter-size), works just like a regular shampoo that&#x27;s foamy and bubbly.</li>
            <li> And at first it did - my hair was super shiny and soft after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing, I wish they had bigger bottles, BUT, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> I am only giving 4 stars because it&#x27;s going to taken more to see if there are real changes in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I liked the feel of my hair when it was wet, but it do much for the dryness.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it makes my hair feel so soft and like that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and clean without completely stripping it of its natural oils--this means I can go up to 4 days before another wash :)</li>
            <li> I really like this product with winter being so harsh this product makes my scalp feel good.</li>
            <li> Even though this is shampoo is more expensive than most the ones I have used before, but I think it is totally worthy!</li>
            <li> Super soft and manageable!  </li>
            <li> I am a fan of Amazon, so started searching around and stumbled upon maple holistics products and noticed plenty of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I had read all the positive reviews, and with the price, I thought...it cannot hurt....</li>
            <li> However, because there were positive comments from others, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Especially it is organic devoid of strong chemical in generic shampoos that one gets at superstores.&lt;br /&gt;Really happy with the finding and this product.</li>
            <li> It provides just the right amount of conditioning and my hair feels healthier with decent volume.</li>
            <li> At first I think it&#x27;s very sticky in my hair</li>
            <li> When in fact, very drying synthetic components are listed first.</li>
            <li> It really feels exactly the way a shampoo should...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much scentless</li>
            <li> I was searching for a good shampoo and tried lots before I decided to try a natural shampoo instead, so I started searching for a good natural shampoo and was really anxious to finally get to try this one.</li>
            <li> With this shampoo, I did not get much lather the first time I washed my hair, so I felt like I needed to repeat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using shampoo altogether</li>
            <li> Honestly, I thought there was nothing that could really solve the issue or return some of the natural texture of my hair back to what it once was till I tried this shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try some sulfate free shampoo to see if it would help to restore my hair back to smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and full looking...</li>
            <li> You know &amp;#34;good old soap&amp;#34; full of &amp;#34;good old&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Sometimes shampoo can be harsh for natural hair, but this leaves my hair feeling amazing and clean.</li>
            <li> I have normal hair and leaves my hair feeling and looking soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Just so the women know - my wife is very particular about her shampoo / hair care products so for her to switch products</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and frizzy hair and have tried so many products to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I was worried because when I got out of the shower, my hair was super tangly but that is just how my hair is naturally.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have really dry hair and wanted more moisture and shine.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks healthier, it has more shine and it doesn&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li> but whenever I use it, my hair stays clean for several days and seems extra healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with this shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this with Silk12, and my hair feels a lot better than when I used normal commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li> Since shampoo/conditioner is basically the only product in my hair, it&#x27;s easy for me to compare one shampoo brand with another.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I stated earlier, it is frizzy and damaged, but it also gets greasy easily.</li>
            <li> This shampoo along with the silk18 makes my hair super soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Most moisturizer shampoos ACTUALLY leave residues in the hair and DONT clean your hair, so if your shampoo leaves your hair with a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feeling then its ACTUALLY cleaning your hair.</li>
            <li> My only issue with this shampoo is the strong scent it has.</li>
            <li> I have allergies especially with smells that are too strong (perfume like).  </li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t like to use a sampoo with strong odor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo following a strong keratin treatment of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around the hair line that is easily irritated by harsh chemicals found in many shampoos.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or just want to use more natural products, I would HIGHLY recommend both the Argan Oil shampoo and the Silk 18 conditioner--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve only started using it, I can already tell it&#x27;s much more healthy than your conventional shampoo.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it claims to be color safe but washes off color every single time.   </li>
            <li> Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer has large molecules that do not penetrate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will however warn off people on using a large quantity of shampoo as it will still result in drying of hair and will take away all the moisture.</li>
            <li> but I certainly recommend it for others to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As claimed, my scalp and hair feels more alive and not feeling dry or freezy after only the first wash.&lt;br /&gt;hair feels fuller with better texture  after my 1st wash.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> for I could tell right away that my hair was squeaky clean; however, the real test came later on when I missed washing my hair one day!  </li>
            <li> My main reason for trying something new was to get away from the Shea buttery smell of Shea moisture, but I now realize how mild that shampoo is.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the conditioner and was delighted by the yummy vanilla smell and natural qualities.</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are natural, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong and lingering smell, and I like the way it makes my hair sooo soft.  </li>
            <li> After I dried my hair, it was very soft and had good volume.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this product but certainly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who colors their hair, uses a flat iron, and likes soft and silky hair with a nice shine and no residue.  </li>
            <li> The second one smelled like a baby shampoo and didn&#x27;t foam rich like the first one.</li>
            <li> I think that this is a very high quality product.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just called 100% Pure because that&#x27;s all it really says on the bottle</li>
            <li> I only has to use a very small amount to clean my hair, and the shampoo smells very nice.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty happy with this shampoo, rinses clean and does not leave a residue behind.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the same time as the Maple Holistics Silk18 Conditionera little over a month ago and will definitely order this product again but may try to pair it with another conditioner for the best results.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair much easier to comb and leaves it feeling soft and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li> Amazing for those who need moisturizing properties for their everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most I&#x27;ve ever spent on shampoo is $25 for a 25.35oz bottle of TIGI Diamond Dreams shampoo at my salon (much cheaper here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> I just love how amazon time and again directs me to products that were not even remotely on my radar and then are so much of a contribution to a happier life.</li>
            <li> I tried the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; route for my hair but everything seems to make my hair really oily and eventually devolves into dandruff which I&#x27;ve never had before.</li>
            <li> It immediately stopped the dandruff and my hair feels so much softer and manageable.</li>
            <li> I like them both so much that I already ordered another pair.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for hair products that are also gentle to my skin; I seem to always break out when I use unnatural shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Well, yes, a woman did recommend this shampoo when she noticed me surreptiously scratching my itchy scalp ( very nonchalantly I thought )</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I found it leave residue on my scalp even though I carefully washed to make sure all of shampoo are off.  </li>
            <li> this product is very moisturizing, that is what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I have to really scratch to get any dandruff to fall and</li>
            <li> Considering the results, I can’t really complain about the price, not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> and my hair was really suffering.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> , Thank you so much Maple Holistic,  please tray it</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth giving a shot if you want soft, shiny, manageable hair.</li>
            <li> Make the hair very greasy</li>
            <li> Using this product my hair has been very manageable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week, and I really do like it.</li>
            <li> It cleans your hair well and it also makes it feel very supple and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what ingredient, or synergy of ingredients, is responsible for curing my problem - but please never stop making this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it doesn&#x27;t create much lather</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll really like it.</li>
            <li> MAke my hair so much easier to take care of</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is easier to comb my hair since it doesn&#x27;t take much to set it the way I want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was using L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate Free shampoo for the last few years, which smelled nice but wasn&#x27;t too hydrating.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but I can feel that my hair is gently cleansed.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care though since it really damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very curly hair (3B).</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it, so that is appreciated.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo along with the Silk 18 conditioner about a month ago, and I can really see and feel a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> After so much research, I decide on this item.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo was the only one after hours of searching that fit all my requirements.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really foam well because of the non toxic ingredients</li>
            <li> It is also very shiny.</li>
            <li> VERY DECEPTIVE.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t go very well with it</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> It really did repair my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> but it has made my hair much softer and easier to handle while brushing.</li>
            <li> As much as this kills me I have to give 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair moisturized and does not smell too much.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has a neutral smell; it doesn&#x27;t give off much of an aroma.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the smell, since I really like the aroma of the Winter Blend Shampoo.</li>
            <li> He has very oily hair and his scalp often feels itchy.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair and needed something gentle that would leave my hair shiny and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I really like</li>
            <li> I really like the product and will continue to use it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li> This shampoo really let my hair so shine.</li>
            <li> My hair is now back to where it was before the vacation, and I hope few more washes will make my hair much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Recently I had an keratin treatment on my hair and wanted to use a sulfate free sampoo.</li>
            <li> my scalp is not irritating and hair is silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> Its totally organic and free of harmful ingredients products.</li>
            <li> I did not find much difference, in fact, my hair started falling after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just tried this shampoo and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo.....</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very moist though.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> used it and wants to buy some as well.</li>
            <li> ; straight, curly, wavy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair shining and it is much easier to style and control after washing it.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell</li>
            <li> The Silk 18 conditioner really makes your hair shine.</li>
            <li> My hair texture after felt much softer and not like</li>
            <li> that makes my hair very manageable pictures</li>
            <li> My problem however is that my hair is very oily, so much so that I must shampoo quite often, and when I miss my hair looks and feels so oily that I can&#x27;t wait to wash it.  </li>
            <li> I do not see as much hairfall or dryness.</li>
            <li> and I have very curl hair</li>
            <li> no matter how much I put oil on them, but</li>
            <li> It works very well with the silk 18 conditioner.  </li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to buy it again I don&#x27;t think I will be.</li>
            <li> and I had to use about twice as much shampoo per shot than the argan oil stuff.</li>
            <li> really is worth the price, so I do intend to buy this shampoo again when I run out - actually the bigger 16 oz bottle, and maybe 3 of them since there&#x27;s a discount on the website when you buy 2 or more -</li>
            <li> Really made my hair feel like straw.  </li>
            <li> My hair has improved so much, to begin with reduced hairfall and hair with some life.</li>
            <li> My scalp seems to really like something about this product.</li>
            <li> If I decide to skip a day or two of shampooing, I really don’t get that itchiness anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle on my hair/scalp</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really bother me, but it is a shampoo after all</li>
            <li> I started using this product along with a silk conditioner and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I am giving it three stars because my friend who I gave it too said she like it and appreciated the non-harsh ingredients (I didnt feel like going through the hassle of a return on an inexpensive item).</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolute perfection.  </li>
            <li> Too slim and fast used up.</li>
            <li> but it works absolute WONDERS on my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has felt and looked so much healthier.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that my hair is not falling as much.  </li>
            <li> May need conditioner along with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion, beside the fact that this is a sulfate free shampoo, I am not impress with the performance of this shampoo as of yet (used this shampoo for several weeks now).</li>
            <li> The shampoo, for me, didn&#x27;t translate very well.</li>
            <li> It lathers really really well.</li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleans really well.</li>
            <li> Not too much fragrance for those who are bothered by that.  </li>
            <li> My hair is softer and looks so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> So in addition to being sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be fragranced and is white</li>
            <li> Come to think of it, it didn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> Cleans my hair well and makes it very shiny.</li>
            <li> It really does moisturize my hair, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any residue in it.</li>
            <li> As soon as you rinse it out, your hair feels like you have been in a pool with too much chlorine.</li>
            <li> Really didnt care for this product..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really improved the quality and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I can see a visible difference in the condition of my hair - it is so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Tried the much recommended Wen but got chemical burns on my ear tops.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much .</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I have have tried several sulfate free shampoos</li>
            <li> We did always use the Silk conditioner too which left us tangle free.</li>
            <li> As a side note, we cant really tell any difference between using the Nexus conditioner or the Silk conditioner after using the Argan shampoo.</li>
            <li> I do Keratin treatments on my hair, so I am very picky</li>
            <li> It is definitely a quality product and clearly it works very well for many people.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair straight and it gives shine!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wash my hair in the kitchen sink and set the timer for 3 minutes, masaging the whole time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Plus, it really cleans my hair and scalp, and my hair isn&#x27;t quite as frizzy.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo,  </li>
            <li> It is creamy and gentle</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t bubble too much</li>
            <li> Overall, I am excited to see how my hair feels and looks after using it a few more times!</li>
            <li> really well-</li>
            <li> Really like this Argan oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> u don&#x27;t need a whole lot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having very curly hair, I needed a shampoo that would keep my hair from frizzing, while not weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> wife and I really like the shampoo because of all the oils included.</li>
            <li> But using a shampoo for volume dries it out too much.  </li>
            <li> The combination of the Maple Holistics shampoo and conditioner works very well.</li>
            <li> very soothing; makes my scalp pain go away</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and just used it once, but my hair feels real soft in the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i really like this.</li>
            <li> I am converting my entire house to chemical free and started in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> The combination of this shampoo and the Silk 18 purchase has really conditioned my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not too much lather, and rinses well.  </li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I can tell you that my hair color lasts so much longer than it ever has.</li>
            <li> This all natural shampoo does the job and leaves my hair silky, bouncy and fresh.</li>
            <li> My hair looks fuller and is very shiny.</li>
            <li> so I am not ready to say I love it.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo to me really has no scent at all.</li>
            <li> so you feel like you are really cleaning your hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair though</li>
            <li> I wanted a gentle shampoo.</li>
            <li> and i really like it....</li>
            <li> It lathers up very well - unlike some sulfate-free shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li> I found that using this shampoo alone creates a very drying affect on my hair.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t have any scent to it, even a light scent.</li>
            <li> Easter Basket!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, and I appreciate the company emailing me to see if I like their product.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> This shampoo is gentle and creamy.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo does wash very well.</li>
            <li> I think it really helps to leave the shampoo in your hair for a couple of minutes before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> but it lathers really well.  </li>
            <li> *! thanks.</li>
            <li> The company is very considerate of its patrons.</li>
            <li> thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m spoiling my hair, on the contrary it gently washes it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients sounded promising, but I would not buy this shampoo again because I do not like the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> It does, however, leave my fine, dry hair feeling soft and full.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my colored hair and rinses well.</li>
            <li> After researching and reading reviews for a dozen different natural shampoos, this was top 5 on my list, so I purchased it.</li>
            <li> But I am switching back to my old product, which worked better.</li>
            <li> I have used many different shampoos on my naturally wavy hair and this made it feel softer and cleaner than anything I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> so i am pleased with the result at such an early stage,</li>
            <li> Sometimes i felt the hair is soft but when i run my fingers through my hair it was kind of rough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the two sudsing method the directions say to, but with my short hair, one application gives me nice lather so next time</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this natural shampoo to my girl :)./</li>
            <li> I love the smell and make my hear very smooth without being heavy or flat.  </li>
            <li> I love that my scalp is clean but is not dried out or &#x27;tight&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long; after applying Silk 18 conditioner my hair became smooth and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> He said this really helped soothe his scalp and it left his hair soft and very clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> She says her hair has never felt so soft and she is right</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is not &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; which used to be the case with other shampoos; it is glossy and has a nice natural sheen to it;  the color also seems to be brighter.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a really good shampoo, cleans the hair well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp unlike other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have combination hair, oily on the top and super dry from middle to the end.  </li>
            <li> There was no strong smell of any kind to the product which makes no difference to me.  </li>
            <li> It has made my hair very soft after the first use.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> However, she has requested I buy her the Argan shampoo and Silk 18 because they have made her long, fine hair so much easier to comb out.</li>
            <li> The reason I decided to try this shampoo was two-fold: I have suffered from eczema and psoriasis for most of my life, and as I am getting older, I&#x27;m finding that not only is my skin becoming more sensitive, but my flare-ups are much worse when I come in contact with chemicals and fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I figured maybe my shedding was due to something else, so I used this 3 more times over the course of two weeks, but my hair did not stop falling out.</li>
            <li> This means there are more of those ingredients in the product than the other oils advertised.</li>
            <li> But third wash onwards, the lumps of hair during hair wash just reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> But it is still more affordable than the other hair fall control shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> Simply it is a great product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I have tried so many other shampoos including dove</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo because I enjoyed the other Maple Holistic shampoos.</li>
            <li> It does seem to need more than some other shampoos in order to lather.  </li>
            <li> I used the Argan Oil Shampoo for the first time today and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better when I use this than other shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair stays healthy looking and it helps balance the frizzy flyaways that I tend to get with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itchy like many other shampoos have done.</li>
            <li> After the first use my hair was as  soft and shiny as it is after leaving the salon!  </li>
            <li> Better than other brands Ive used.</li>
            <li> I’ve also noticed a significant decrease in the amount of frizz and a big improvement in shine.</li>
            <li> Especially using it in the winter I had major drying and static.  </li>
            <li> More moisturizing than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I looked up each and every ingredient, and Maple Holistics is true to its word: the most of chemicals used are from natural ingredients, none of it is harsh harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that in conjunction with spraying pure argan oil directly onto my scalp and the use of this shampoo I will be able to combat my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have previously used this brand&#x27;s sage shampoo and liked it for the subtle, pleasant, natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> Also, although it felt wonderful on my scalp, and left my scamp and hair clean, the first time I used it I did not follow up with a conditioner and my hair was very coarse and difficult to comb out after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I have bought several different natural shampoos in the past, and haven&#x27;t been overly impressed, but I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li> My hair actually feels clean...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a week now, and I have long, undyed fine hair.</li>
            <li> This just makes me feel clean, as simple as that.</li>
            <li> would either make it too dry that they can break easily or too silky to show any volume at all.</li>
            <li> I have fine long hair that has been colored.</li>
            <li> I have recently tried a co-wash shampoo/conditioner and don&#x27;t feel like my hair and scalp were really clean.  </li>
            <li> However, after several washings with this shampoo, my hair is now clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> this shampoo seems to have done as good a job as we could hope for, we&#x27;re assuming by not being so harsh on the hair (without all the sulfates and whatnot apparently).</li>
            <li> have been using sulfate free shampoo for years, part of a decision to live as organically as possible</li>
            <li> Both the Argan Oil shampoo and Silk 18 conditioner take very little to be effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely light feeling, but cleans my hair very well and doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all.</li>
            <li> for my dry, itchy skin, I believe it is too soon to see if natural products work, however it does seem to be getting a bit better.</li>
            <li> Including after the shower, my gel process, and air dry, my hair felt soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Paired with the silk conditioner, my hair felt much lighter, combed through easily in the shower and after applying my natural  products (I use pure argon oil and a bit of shea moisture curl milk then let air dry).</li>
            <li> Worked very well left my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a natural hair shampoo</li>
            <li> First, I like this shampoo for what it doesn&#x27;t contain, namely, a lot of harmful chemicals; second, I like it because it contains a lot of natural ingredients known to be good for hair, and third, I like the way it leaves my hair, shiny and soft, and fourth, I like the way it smells, a really pretty scent that&#x27;s not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It came out better the second time, but I think I would go back to using Aveeno shampoo unless Maple Holistics other shampoos works better.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the amount of lather, no it was not as much as my old shampoo, but more then enough!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> After just the first use my hair felt soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and really shiny!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t shed as much hair as normal after use</li>
            <li> like I normally would so don&#x27;t know how it would affect that, but I really like the way my hair felt.</li>
            <li> After two bottles my hair went flat and felt un clean.</li>
            <li> You only need a little for it to give a good lather</li>
            <li> This is my new shampoo!  </li>
            <li> but brand new, as I could never wear it!</li>
            <li> Helped my hair gain new life again!</li>
            <li> I will buy again and use as my new routine!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try the product at first, fearing another breakout, but had high hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have a reaction to the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my long, fine, thin hair soft, full and with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> My dry, long hair is looking much better!  </li>
            <li> Apparently I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> This is a HUGE feat, considering I&#x27;ve been having itchy &amp; dry scalp for over 15 years now.</li>
            <li> After a month and a half I continue seeing improvement and feel much better.  </li>
            <li> but then we always expect a lot more for a lot less and that NEVER happens.</li>
            <li> My hair gets frizzly and dry during the winter time and this shampoo made my hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> importantly, hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using it.</li>
            <li> After using it my dry hair looked silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair red and purchased this product when it said it was color safe.  </li>
            <li> If you have a scalp problem, you know how super embarrassing it is to have to constantly brush away a pile of while powder from your shoulders.</li>
            <li> I am now a loyal customer -- this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> That made it tempting enough for me to use a second time, but with another hunk of hair in the shower drain, I just could not use it again no matter how fabulous my hair looked!</li>
            <li> It clean my hair very well and won&#x27;t get it dry.  </li>
            <li> Also, all of my soaps, body and face lotion, and even hand sanitizers are now all chemical free and with either essential oils or natural products.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo ~ it only took one use of another product to send me back</li>
            <li> So, my older sister purchased this for me about a month ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been only using this shampoo and some argan oil, and my hair has definitely changed for the better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,  not the best but not the worst.</li>
            <li> my main focus is products that won&#x27;t leave my hair looking like twine, corn husks or overcooked spaghetti by noon.  </li>
            <li> Scent is mild, doesn&#x27;t lather the way regular shampoos do...</li>
            <li> The main problem is my hair that it is overly frizzy.</li>
            <li> the older I get).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Water is the main ingredient</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li> Overall love the product and don&#x27;t plan on going back to the drug store brand junk.</li>
            <li> Very soft and lathers really well.</li>
            <li> It went from dry, tangled, and oily to silky soft, tangle-free, and beautifully clean!</li>
            <li> it definitely leaves my hair feeling clean, soft, and silky for days!</li>
            <li> My hair felt different after the very first wash.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft after wash!</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t need hair conditioner - the hair is very soft!</li>
            <li> Regular shampoos also lather right away, so you don&#x27;t REALLY need to wash your hair twice</li>
            <li> No dry ends, no limp hair, no bad scents, no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest the argan shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you feel you need to know for yourself, like me, then buy this, otherwise I highly recommend Shea Moisture products.</li>
            <li> Will highly recommend it,</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I will be ordering again and highly recommend both the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> We searched on amazon.com for shampoos with high rating and came across this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying Maple Holistic products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- 1 star because of its high price per volume.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It also has a very lovely subtle smell.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money buying other Shampoos - get this one, trust me, you will love your hair again.</li>
            <li> Compared to other natural shampoos I&#x27;ve seen and the one I bought, the price is definitely better.</li>
            <li> It does give me more volume and thicken hair, somehow I feel it little frizzy and tangle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have a cute little Afro.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it, but a little to pricey</li>
            <li> but it could use a little more potency though,</li>
            <li> Usually a little while after straightening it, my hair starts tangling and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d be able to get my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels fresh, clean and FLUFFY.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot fine, long blond hair and my old shampoo was too drying.</li>
            <li> Often I&#x27;ve tried natural shampoos being careful to steer clear of all the chemicals in most shampoos, and been less than satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Our hair is soft and feels very light - not weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to help my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I went back to my previous shampoo (Burt&#x27;s Bees baby shampoo) and continued using Maple Holistic&#x27;s Silk 18 conditioner (love it!)</li>
            <li> Left my hair super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> But this shampoo somehow does the trick for keeping my hair clean and shiny without weighing down or making my fine curls frizzy or flat</li>
            <li> I have been reading about the negative effects of SLS and similar sulfates, i.e. how it is used in many shampoos because it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> so far nothing that is noticeable really</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick going in</li>
            <li> So far really like this.  </li>
            <li> So far, I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was shocked; instead it curled then even more!!!!</li>
            <li> Natural Holistics keeps their products at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It Is soft and it just looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Lauroamphoacetate is a gentle, amphoteric foaming and cleansing agent derived from natural and renewable resources.</li>
            <li> Made my hair really soft really shinny.</li>
            <li> It is really natural and you can&#x27;t really smell anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spare you the details of my long, arduous journey, of how many bottles I tried and discarded, how many dragons I slew, how often I was cast into despair.</li>
            <li> Hair feel clean but not stripped dry.  </li>
            <li> I really like the natural feel my hair has after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> But the one who really loves the combination is my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> but it made my hair very sticky and almost TOO soft.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone wanting to try a natural shampoo at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers really well (which you don&#x27;t expect from a natural product).  </li>
            <li> It has no smell, makes my hair feel soft and look straight.</li>
            <li> provide more update in a few days.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite - it lasts a long time, so I only have to order about every six months.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> You normally buy products that either contain jojoba or argan or almond or avocado.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, didn&#x27;t have all the knots I normally do after my shower.  </li>
            <li> I can normally go 1-2 days without washing my hair but not with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> If you have keratine done and have some of normal to oily</li>
            <li> That price will get you a 16oz bottle of this shampoo at Maple Holistics&#x27;s website (the bottle is $23.35) plus a few more dollars for shipping</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics DOES try to cover the ingredients in the bottle on an information card I received with the shampoo, it just doesn&#x27;t go over the first two thirds of the list where the most complicated looking ingredients are that people would probably be most likely to suspect were made in a lab or something.</li>
            <li> Even rinsing out the shampoo, I could tell this shampoo wouldn&#x27;t have the same success as the Sage shampoo for me.</li>
            <li> After several shampoo-ings, I have found that my hair looks full and soft and prettier than it has ever looked.</li>
            <li> I use as directed, it doesn&#x27;t lather up much on the first wash but does lather up on the second wash.  </li>
            <li> I have normal hair...</li>
            <li> Towards the end of my long search I started to try the all natural, free of everything style of shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wash and go kind of girl, no styling for lazy me, and with naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have almost normal hair, but in winter there&#x27;s no shampoo</li>
            <li> hair is long greasy curly/wavy and this shampoo tamed it better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.for those of you looking into the low poo trend</li>
            <li> I can go three days before I need to wash my hair again given normal day to day activities.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my long hair soft, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I just used this shampoo for a few days now and already my hair feels silkier and more moisturized.  </li>
            <li> First let me say that this is fantastic for african American natural hair.</li>
            <li> Normally I have oily hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather like a normal shampoo, but I don&#x27;t find that bothersome.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look and feel really healthy, soft and silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> However, I think having healthy hair and less exposure to harmful products in the long run is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It also does not dull it, which some products will do when they&#x27;re oil-heavy.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, dry, color-treated hair and my 8 year old daughter, who has very sensitive skin, has fine, oily hair and a scalp that is prone to flaking.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it out I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference at first compared to other shampoos, but the next morning my hair felt much softer.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure if it&#x27;s this or the batiste dry shampoo that&#x27;s giving me dandruff, which I NEVER get when using regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I will probably try Maple Holistics&#x27; shampoo for dry hair and scalp next and see if that works better for my hair.</li>
            <li> It literally left my hair so dry and made it look more damaged then</li>
            <li> leave you feeling and definitely not coated like many of my shampoos for dry, damaged hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair dry though definitely needs more moisturizing ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s sulfate-free and herbal with several nourishing oils for my dry and damaged curly hair.</li>
            <li> I will lightly blow dry my hair and use about a pea size conditioner plus argan oil together to smooth it out; I can even flip my hair upside down and rake my fingers through it and it will be the smoothest hair (for days)</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair, it frizzes when it dries, and I&#x27;ve tried many different products.  </li>
            <li> Though, I was skeptical about this since I have allergies and always have a reaction to natural products, so far so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other argan oil product but they usually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Up until recently I had been using sulfate shampoos, but I recently learned that it has the capacity to strip good cultures from your head and other damage.</li>
            <li> Just bought this product on a whim looking for a nice natural shampoo to use daily or every other day.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair very soft, clean, and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> However I didn&#x27;t see drastic change in my hair growth (new hair growth) that is normal, but</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this stuff and suggest giving it time if you don&#x27;t see results right away.</li>
            <li> I finally found it right here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Both of them tried it right away the same day they received it.</li>
            <li> It does feel very thick and luxurious though, which I always enjoy in a shampoo, and it cleans just fine.</li>
            <li> Compared to the only other natural shampoo I tried (and many others according to other people), it lathers much better</li>
            <li> So for me it is very hard to find good natural products from head to toe.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily hair and a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, especially because it comes at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It felt just fine and actually softer than when I&#x27;ve had to use a regular shampoo without conditioner in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fragile fine blonde hair and this makes it feel so silky!</li>
            <li> It generates lather and feels moisturizing when your shampooing, once you rinse your hair feels squeaky clean, not fragile nor stiff like some sulfate free shampoos do.</li>
            <li> Honestly, at first I was a bit skeptical, for I really did not think that this shampoo with all its seemingly wild ingredients would really be able to get my hair clean enough without normal soap!  </li>
            <li> compared to non-natural shampoos, this shampoo is more expensive and may not be for people on a tight budget, but it gets my hair as clean, leaves my hair looking shinier, leaves my scalp feeling much better, and is healthier for my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Creamy shampoo, sulfate free, long lasting, made in the USA, reasonably priced and did what I got it for - seems to moisturizer my scalp, not so itchy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I intend to use the free product offer by Maple Holistics to see if this is the case for other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But when you first open the bottle it has an overwhelming scent (not a huge fan of that).</li>
            <li> I got this Argan Oil Shampoo because I wanted to try something a little more natural with not a lot added in there as sulfate and fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of scent sensitivities am always nervous about trying something new with added fragrances.  </li>
            <li> They refunded my money for the shampoo and offered to send me the new Argan Shampoo that just come out.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the argan shampoo with hopes that it would leave my hair feeling clean and healthy without the heavy or greasy residue that some other shampoos leave.  </li>
            <li> and it actually makes my hair feel amazing unlike this waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love how these shampoos are all natural and none of those harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> However, I think it is doing a decent job at keeping my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, but made my hair dry</li>
            <li> but this prove me wrong bit now software and mangerial and most important</li>
            <li> I have short thin hair and this product works great for me.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason i took a star off is because i wish this product was available in a larger size...preferably with a pump!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really just taking people&#x27;s word for it that it&#x27;s 100% natural and am still researching the ingredients a bit</li>
            <li> My hair is still coming out more than usual, but my doctor says this is normal after surgery (and being under anesthesia).</li>
            <li> and I like that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped of its natural oils but feels clean after I towel dry.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair super dry.</li>
            <li> I have a recommendation to Maple Holistics: if  it is possible  let the shampoo to be available in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t afford the higher price, but my hair has become really damaged from other no scent shampoos that have no oils or moisturizing benefits</li>
            <li> This does not weigh down my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and it didn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this shampoo again, and highly recommend it,especially if your scalp is sensitive or tends to be itchy.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can not change products AT ALL.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling very soft and fuller.</li>
            <li> I also use the Argan Oil Conditioner from the same line, and like it very much as well.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re very conscious about what we use in our house and what we put in our body.</li>
            <li> have tried several different brands and my favorite brand that works great is very expensive to ship</li>
            <li> I am very surprised of the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li> I find this shampoo keeps it very soft and silky while also adding a bit of volume to it.  </li>
            <li> However after 3 washings with this product I like it a lot, it leaves my hair very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> After blow drying my hair is very soft,</li>
            <li> The argan oil makes my hair very soft and fluffy-like.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean not weighed down, its very shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find good value for all natural, especially among shampoos.</li>
            <li> I started Argan Oil Shampoo by MapleHolistics, the rough hair started becoming smooth and no more stiffening in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Being a guy I usually use a shampoo conditioner combo product which works ok for me.</li>
            <li> After ordering this shampoo as a gift for my sister in law who is very health -conscious and loves organic and natural products, my husband surprised me with a bottle as well.  </li>
            <li> NO ITCH so far!</li>
            <li> my hair has been incredibly soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, the bottle was small, but we just need a quarter size for first rinse and another quarter size for the second rinse.</li>
            <li> To me, for the most part, feels the same as any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo consistently for the last week and notice that my hair is a bit softer.</li>
            <li> Within the first week I noticed the massive change in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not buying all natural hair stuff to save the planet, I&#x27;m buying it to save my hair!</li>
            <li> My husband and I eat organic and are switching slowly to other organic and/or safe products that we use in our daily lives...after all, have to take care of yourself.  </li>
            <li> It was okay, not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> No big difference, and much higher in price</li>
            <li> Bottle small but love the feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> I do find that a small amount like a nickel to a quarter size amount at most is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by smell!</li>
            <li> Use it for the first time today 07 25 2015, I will definite write as I use,</li>
            <li> In an effort to lower my families exposure to xenoestrogens such as sodium lauryl sulfate and other chemicals found in many shampoos and cleaning products I chose Maple Holistics.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> This product helps ease my hair getting too greasy/oily in the first 48hrs, which is big change for me!!  </li>
            <li> One use of the Argan Oil Shampoo completely transformed my hair!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Was I ever surprised!  </li>
            <li> Without sulfates there is usually no &amp;#34;lather, but this shampoo lathers well.</li>
            <li> Recommended to anybody looking for a natural shampoo out there!</li>
            <li> So far this seems to be it!</li>
            <li> I noticed a considerable difference in my hair even after using this product ONE time!</li>
            <li> I have fine slightly wavy hair that is oily.</li>
            <li> My hair usually makes it through one day with most shampoos.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> And I used to wash it nearly every day!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I received the item on time, and so far I like it!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair so shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a pretty solid product.</li>
            <li> my dry flaky scalp even more dry, made my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and was skeptical that this would be able to clean my hair well.</li>
            <li> You only need a quarter sized amount to clean an entire head of shoulder length medium hair thickness.</li>
            <li> This formula makes my hair smooth and shiny without weighing it down, so I still have all of my volume.</li>
            <li> simply apply first thing in the shower to very wet hair, leave it in while I clean the rest of me, then rinse.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair and scalp clean longer then other shampoos do.</li>
            <li> i had just stripped my hair of every nutrient in order to clean it like other chemical enhanced shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have very fine but thick hair.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing, my hair looks shinier, feels softer, and didn’t take as long to dry.</li>
            <li> Basically any product that our bodies will be in contact with or that we&#x27;ll be breathing the air filled with that product, we&#x27;re very intentional about getting a product that will not harm our bodies and have other side effects later in life.</li>
            <li> I love this shampo since my first time use,every time just apply a little bit for my long hair,then make my hair clean and healthy,also it Darken my black color.</li>
            <li> Also , this shampoo, for the first time ever of any shampoo (including other “natural” shampoos), actually made my hair feel CLEAN, too -- no gunkiness or build</li>
            <li> I tried the sample several times over the course of a week, just to see if I might develop a rash after the first attempt, but in fact, my skin started to clear up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to wash my fro now without the hassle of breakage and dry outs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I only used the argon shampoo once it left my hair soft, clean.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up the project and believed that I would have to settle for expensive, overly scented, toxic shampoos once again if I ever wanted to have beautiful and manageable hair.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m not totally blown away or anything, but I do really like it!</li>
            <li> The last time I used this shampoo I decided to use my old conditioner on my hair below my shoulders first and leave it in while i shampooed.</li>
            <li> Giving this 4 stars because I am not sure yet if this is that much better than my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> This one smells nice and I can tell from the lather, or lack of, that it actually may be missing the sulfates!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know the long lasting benefits but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Only have to use a small amount and using with the conditioner makes make treated hair nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li> After the first use the hair felt thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first use my hair felt thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> The 100% Pure shampoo I used had a relatively small and simple ingredient list, but the Maple Holistics shampoo does work much better, so</li>
            <li> It was very soft and shiny, but not fluffy.</li>
            <li> It smells yummy and leaves my hair very soft and alive.</li>
            <li> one thing I liked more about the 100% Pure shampoo was that on the ingredient list it had a laymen&#x27;s description in parentheses next to any ingredient that sounded complicated or foreign.</li>
            <li> There is little to no smell which is fine for me.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought this shampoo for me yesterday , my hair is kind of weak</li>
            <li> they actually refunded my money, and in ADDITION sent me a full bottle of the silk 18 conditioner that I loved to satisfy my disappointment in the shampoo</li>
            <li> So I hopped on Amazon.com to look for a new all natural shampoo that won&#x27;t bother my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The product lathers really well for not having any lathering agents (unnatural anyways), but it leaves my hair very squeaky dry like.</li>
            <li> A subtle fragrance that leaves my hair fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of a pleasant smell but it isn&#x27;t terrible either.  </li>
            <li> It did a good job with the natural part of my hair but as for the remainder it was just hard and dry.</li>
            <li> - Affordable: I don&#x27;t have to use much shampoo to get a good lather (long, thick hair).&lt;br /&gt;- Sulfate free, Natural/free of those funky hard to read chemical ingredients, Jojoba and almond oils</li>
            <li> I was born with pin-straight manageable hair, but when I entered my teens I started to mess around with many different shampoo’s and hair products</li>
            <li> This shampoo relieved my dry itchy scalp and left my hair really smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I was born with pin-straight manageable hair, but when I entered my teens I started to mess around with many different shampoo’s and hair products</li>
            <li> In addition to using these products, I also have a different brand of 100% Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> instead of worse like when I used the 100% Pure shampoo, and it made my hair look and feel better.</li>
            <li> and it’s a little more than a third gone, so</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive, leave my hair clean and soft, and last a long time.</li>
            <li> To give a little background on my purchase, I am allergic to most standard shampoos.</li>
            <li> I no longer need to use additional frizz free products that end up weighing my hair down and leaving it &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling!</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel healthy not dry like other shampoo I did not have to use any conditioner later</li>
            <li> I never find it leaves my hair dry or brittle, which I can say has been the result with many other natural brands.</li>
            <li> Worth trying if you are tired of using $4 department store brands that do absolutely nothing but not expensive like the $20 high end stuff that may or may not work.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have tooooo much hair left on my head, so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell, but my hair seems to come out soft and healthy as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i personally don&#x27;t think it smells too bad, but i wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s especially pleasant compared to what we might be used to.</li>
            <li> After brushing my hair out, I thought it felt really dry and still tangled easily, but then I decided to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> They are way cheaper (not on Amazon though, they are cheaper at walmart) and have only natural ingredients and absolutely nothing else.</li>
            <li> You need less shampoo, and the clean hair lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I just started to focus on whole body wellness, so I wanted to go above and beyond just putting quality natural ingredients in my body.</li>
            <li> After rinsing shampoo off hair it felt clean, but slightly tangled.</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and arrived in a short amt. of time.</li>
            <li> my hair looks alive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, this shampoo is not color safe at least with Just for Men color.</li>
            <li> I like all the natural products they use in this product as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly without the frizz and feels so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo twice so far (along with the 18 silk conditioner) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> and it leaves your hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo not knowing what to expect since I&#x27;ve never used a homeopathic / all natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to products-like the canary in the coal mine.</li>
            <li> it made my hair feel so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> its too early)</li>
            <li> But, on the second application it really does lather up as well as a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-sulfate natural shampoo, when I found this one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order and wait until a later time to order the shampoo I really wanted.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much and only wash twice a week.</li>
            <li> And my hair has never felt this soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> Any product that claimed to be sulfate-free, all natural, blah blah, etc.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase a foam making machine from Amazon for my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> It feels soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> I wanted an all natural shampoo for my family.</li>
            <li> I also dye my hair to cover the grays and this shampoo is gentle enough for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and normal/dry hair.  </li>
            <li> any more!My hair is soft and have volume -it</li>
            <li> I developed a habit of grabbing and shaking my collar vigorously before entering a store or restaurant to remove the pile I knew was there without looking.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My bleached &amp; highlighted hair came out soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Argan Oil Shampoo combined with the Silk18 Natural Conditioner</li>
            <li> and I like them for natural products.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable and immediate difference when I started using the Argan Oil Shampoo and the Silk18 Natural Conditioner.</li>
            <li> , leave&#x27;s it soft too...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li> but my hair is pretty long.</li>
            <li> to even ‘try’ to be manageable…my hair was a complete disaster.</li>
            <li> still surprised to this day how on earth I even managed to HAVE hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was a complete disaster</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell natural too.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find an all natural shampoo that can meet my needs as I have oily skin and hair, both a blessing and a curse.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend using it with the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner.</li>
            <li> so far.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and I color my hair.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for shampoo that will make your hair soft and shiny than try this out.</li>
            <li> I am naturally gray and after using Argan Oil Shampoo for one week my hair is shiny and fuller.</li>
            <li> Oh, but for the record, if you don&#x27;t mind the stink or losing hair, it did work well as far as how my hair looked afterwards.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair fell soft and dries easier.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the natural smell.</li>
            <li> It leaves our hair, soft, shiny and manageable without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> The bonus is it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sulfate free, shampoo without all the harsh chemicals, which would not damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural product and thought I would give it a try, with all the reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; I am 62 years old and color my hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for those that are looking for non-comedogenic products and is natural.</li>
            <li> I used it this morning and my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a shampoo that is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are completely natural.</li>
            <li> Lots of natural oils in it.</li>
            <li> , this shampoo completely revived my color and did a hair &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> natural</li>
            <li> I also wanted to buy a product that was hypoallergenic and contained natural ingrediants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking to find all natural products.</li>
            <li> Got Silk conditioner and Argan oil Shampoo a week ago, and so far I&#x27;ve used both in combination 3 times.</li>
            <li> I am in transition from perm damaged hair to natural hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways I remember commenting about this product and my difficulties with it, so I decided to try it again with just natural hair.</li>
            <li> and I know I&#x27;m not stripping the natural oils from my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this Argan Oil shampoo made by Maple Holistics and was pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> The shampoo feels like it strips all the natural oils out of my hair, definitely not an everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li> and this shapoo makes my hair so soft as baby hair.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t possibly use as much product as they ship automatically.</li>
            <li> So far I like it - how it feels.  </li>
            <li> my husband and I have a business offering affordable natural skin care products)</li>
            <li> I wish they kept it all natural</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling very silky.  </li>
            <li> Using it with Silk 18 natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Any shampoo now a days strips your hair of its natural oils</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the same price as biolage and I&#x27;d much rather buy that way</li>
            <li> I been scratching my scalp to see if dandruff or flakes gather under my nails, so far it sees to be taking care of that issue as well.</li>
            <li> I am looking for a product which cleans scalp as well as gives moisture and volume to hair naturally.</li>
            <li> eventhough after applying shampoo i used silk 18 conditioner but conditoner makes my hair soft doesnt give volume.</li>
            <li> Thought , huh looks natural , I might as well try it.</li>
            <li> My hair are soft and manageable after each use.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s try another natural shampoo I used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural and understand what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t look like it would be a natural ingredient!&amp;#34;, so I looked it up and after some reading found the simplest explanation on truthinaging.com:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> It is also used as a natural replacement for the ingredient known as sodium laureth sulfate, or SLES.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> So far I lIke it,</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if a natural shampoo helps speed up the process.</li>
            <li> Got it two days ago, and so far this has been</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft and manageable after using it</li>
            <li> my wife is currently breastfeeding our newborn son and has found much of her hair to be falling out because of it.</li>
            <li> I used to use shampoo for relaxed and natural hair</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone who likes natural shampoo</li>
            <li> No build up, no limp look.</li>
            <li> Hair felt soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I do admit, I dye my hair frequently thus</li>
            <li> I followed with the conditioner and it made my hair incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> I paired it with the Silk 18 conditioner and my hair was so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This company is as professional as can be.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft when I use this</li>
            <li> I have been in search for a natural shampoo for months.  </li>
            <li> to even ‘try’ to be manageable…my hair was a complete disaster.</li>
            <li> still surprised to this day how on earth I even managed to HAVE hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was a complete disaster</li>
            <li> Cleans hair well and leaves it feeling soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I had to leave the conditioner in far longer than recommended.</li>
            <li> It has a soft smell, a creamy texture, leaves my hair malleable and nourished.</li>
            <li> This product is for whom looks for natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the all natural ingrediets.</li>
            <li> so no harsh dyes or colors added.</li>
            <li> I was so depressed about my hair quality and texture and started searching for some natural solutions.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly a month.  </li>
            <li> The product has lot of nutritional ingredients that are natural.  </li>
            <li> I isn&#x27;t soapy, but it leaves your hair soft even if you don&#x27;t use the conditioner</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really feeling softer and actually shines again.</li>
            <li> It cleans so well, leaves my hair soft and feeling well moisturized.</li>
            <li> As a test, when we returned home I went back to using Nexus shampoo and it made my hair much dryer</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that has a brazilian blow out.</li>
            <li> Makes it soft and no chemicals.</li>
            <li> Make my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My old shampoos are going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Both problems seem to be under control, so far.</li>
            <li> This shampoo in combination with Silk 18 conditioner keeps my hair hydrated, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I also bought the conditioner and together they make my hair, which is colored every 3-4 weeks soft.</li>
            <li> It was soft.  </li>
            <li> I am ready to get my next sets again!&lt;br /&gt;(PS.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair once my hair air drys</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I decided to try natural shampoos and after searching on Amazon I came across this one.</li>
            <li> You only use about a quarter size amount and it really softens your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used it three times so far and while it does leave your hair &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; it remove build up from styling products.</li>
            <li> I have naturally soft hair</li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural and came across Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> My hair felt notably soft all day and night.  </li>
            <li> I am 65 years old, my hair is color-treated, curly &amp; wavy.</li>
            <li> I did not like the loreal shampoo and decided to go with a natural product.  </li>
            <li> I only use a nickle size amount to my scalp and it cleans very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> My hair has been really soft and manageable even though the humidity has been through the roof.  </li>
            <li> I have spend a lot of time searching for a natural shampoo for my family and I.</li>
            <li> Very greasy and just gross.</li>
            <li> So ridiculously soft</li>
            <li> Makes my unruly, frizzy and straw like hair amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural...</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel so soft n manageable</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft &amp; shiny</li>
            <li> So far this argan shampoo (and</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable 2 out of 5 times.</li>
            <li> But the outer touch was soft.</li>
            <li> have used it for about a week now, and have no problems to report so far.</li>
            <li> all natural.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that this is a natural product</li>
            <li> I will definitely come back for more when my bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I have transitioning 3c hair and my hair is so soft and manageable after I use this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, to the shampoo…  The reason that I bought it was because I had just gotten my hair professionally colored</li>
            <li> chemicals stripped all of that natural oiliness away.  </li>
            <li> I just recently purchased the conditioner and it REALLY conditions</li>
            <li> I have frizzy naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt surprisingly soft after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Im going to try with their conditioner to get a complete feel about it.</li>
            <li> Also using the Natural Conditioner Silk 18.  </li>
            <li> It is alive in touch, with glitter.</li>
            <li> I have since been experimenting with organic shampoos with partial success.</li>
            <li> with this one I found that it did balance the oils in my hair, my scalp is not as oily as it was and my ends get better with the oils I use to them, and I actually do not need to wash my hair everyday like I used to</li>
            <li> I was not surprised that it would&#x27;ve damaged my natural hair tone, but this product really does work wonders!</li>
            <li> But overall its a good product but thought it to be bit expensive as it really hasnt worked wonders.</li>
            <li> The texture of this shampoo is magnificent, not to thin, but not too thick.</li>
            <li> Also cost wise it is not like otjer products which are avaialble in market and are so expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair has been a mess while trying to find a natural shampoo that will clean and nourish my hair.</li>
            <li> With very little shampoo, you get lots of good suds and the conditioner detangles with just slight finger-work.  </li>
            <li> It made my dry hair soft after first use.altho it has no smell</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it, as I have used many different shampoos (some quite expensive) and have not found one that worked as well as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey for the size, but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shampoo to my family and friends as a permanent switch from their normal shampoo!</li>
            <li> Managing my long, thick hair can be overwhelming at times especially when I would like for it to be soft and pretty!</li>
            <li> Many oil shampoos leave my hair feeling heavy or flat, but this one leaves my hair conditioned but with a natural amount of body.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair as well, so the ingredient list of this shampoo interested me with all of the oils.</li>
            <li> I have white female hair; fine and long.</li>
            <li> my hair is pretty dry because I always bleach my hair for coloring and highlights .</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and am always on the lookout for good quality shampoo (and other haircare products) that will condition my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really did not think that the product would lather very much, but when I squeezed out just a little onto my hand and started to wash my hair</li>
            <li> I have coarse greying hair, and in recent months with more grey areas coming in, my hair has become totally unmagageable with cowlicks sticking up everywhere when I get up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is how much I have to use on my hair, but that&#x27;s my own problem for having super thick horse hair.</li>
            <li> Seems like it foams a little too much for me as I use it as my &amp;#34;second&amp;#34; wash after using a &#x27;cowash&#x27; the first time.  </li>
            <li> I knew it wouldn&#x27;t suds up a whole lot as there are no fake, artificial ingredients in the formula to produce more suds.  </li>
            <li> It is more pricey for the amount you get, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair felt flat without much body to it.</li>
            <li> Oh boy, just after few washes my hair loss reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> tried a lot of natural dandruff shampoos; very few of them actually give me a satisfying lather.</li>
            <li> Only used once so far but left my very long hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely serious and more thankful than anyone can ever realize.</li>
            <li> The Argan Shampoo smell is more like Elmer&#x27;s glue or rancid oil; neither are subtle or soothing.</li>
            <li> Plus the scent is subtle and not overpowering like so many products on the market.</li>
            <li> I gave it a second try this past weekend, and the results were much better.</li>
            <li> Hair products,in particular, have different effects, depending on hair type.</li>
            <li> That is amazing considering the amount of long thick hair I have.</li>
            <li> My hair dye used to wash out within 2 weeks with regular shampoo, and I&#x27;m already going on week 3 with vibrant color.  </li>
            <li> It is harsh at first, does not lather up quite as well, and leaves hair VERY stipped/</li>
            <li> First shampoo that suited my hair from the time I moved in states, I am giving 4* because I am  using it from just last one month, will update my rating and review as it goes further, But till now I like mildness, smell and after effects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decently priced and last me about a couple of months on my medium/long hair.</li>
            <li> These products are WELL worth the money, &amp; I will continue to purchase Argoil, so long as the formula stays the same.</li>
            <li> Their products are easy and have made my super thick long blonde hair shinier, longer</li>
            <li> I used to have nice thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain this is why I can go for so long between washings.</li>
            <li> The first time my hair felt very dry...</li>
            <li> Other than that, I washed my hair right away</li>
            <li> This product was reviewed highly and in my personal opinion thinks the ratings were spot on.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone else with similar issues!</li>
            <li> Throughout my middle school days into my high school days, I straightened my hair every day, i’m</li>
            <li> I was just about to give this product only four stars, just because of the slightly high price, but</li>
            <li> I recently tried this shampoo for my dry,damaged hair along with the conditioner,my hair is soft,manageable, I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Throughout my middle school days into my high school days, I straightened my hair every day, i’m</li>
            <li> Recently got high lights.</li>
            <li> For one, I ran around emitting a high pitched wheeee at regular intervals.</li>
            <li> i love this , also bought Natural Conditioner By Maple Holistics - Sulfate Free Treatment for Dry and Damaged , i have dry ,thin fuzzy hair, always knotted, after this , no more knotted hair , only leave me smooth ,shinny!</li>
            <li> The only downside for me is that it&#x27;s not necessarily color-safe, so I have to get my roots done a little more often.</li>
            <li> Next time I use it I will cut back a little because I had more lather than needed for my length hair.</li>
            <li> This means I&#x27;ll be paying up to twice as much for less product and be using twice as much product each time I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does the trick and leaves my hair feeling super soft, once it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has a pleasant subtle scent, slightly nutty.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil shampoo has helped my dry scalp more than any of the other dandruff shampoos, such as T-GEL, head AND SHOULDERS AND PERT ANTI-DANDRUFF.</li>
            <li> She has long straight hair and swears by it.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling soft and rehydrated I don&#x27;t even need conditioner with this product it naturally tamed my wild curly hair</li>
            <li> In the past one year +, I&#x27;ve changed all of my house products to all chemical free products.</li>
            <li> My scalp also has skin problems sometimes, quite sensitive to shampoos in general.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fantastic and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> you really need a small quantity and leaves the hair soft thanks to the Argan oil, almond, jojoba,peach kernel, camelia seed ,avocado and botanical keratin !</li>
            <li> It is not completely a anti dandruff shampoo but it really reduced hair fall.</li>
            <li> My scalp is getting back to normal.</li>
            <li> after using this shampoo my hair did actually feel thicker than it normally does</li>
            <li> Also, I only like to get my hair cut every few months (4-5), so I try to keep it as healthy as possible in between cuts.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having products around the house that are full of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It also made my scalp dry and flaky which never happens and certainly did NOT happen with the argan oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying very hard to find a more natural shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li> As an active male with short hair, my scalp tends to get itchy with most shampoos on the market; especially if I skip a day.</li>
            <li> But unlike before, I only have few flakes appearing on my jet black hair, which can be easily removed with the flick of a wrist.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as a very-much-in-debt college student, I don&#x27;t have a large amount of funds appropriated for pricier beauty supplies such as this (compared to the large bottles of Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes and was confident I was buying an all natural, high quality product, but it turned out to be a bad experience.</li>
            <li> I love them and it was hard for me to change back to liquid shampoo.</li>
            <li> Left my blonde color treated hair clean, nourished, soft and extremely shiny without leaving it greasy feeling or a residue.</li>
            <li> I finally got into the college of my dreams and decided to create a new look</li>
            <li> I have been searching and trying new products constantly.</li>
            <li> I finally got into the college of my dreams and decided to create a new look</li>
            <li> There is no distinct smell but who cares right?</li>
            <li> My hair had been getting dry and this shampoo really helps.</li>
            <li> They both work very well on my dry hair which make my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> At age 50 with dry, highlighted hair I really needed to find a shampoo &amp; conditioner that would revive my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo also doesnt dry out my hair, and has restored it so much.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy,  fine, slightly oil hair.</li>
            <li> Really wish it softened my dry hair .</li>
            <li> I have very curly dry hair</li>
            <li> I do not have to use my dry shampoo as much or at all.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something for dry and tinted hair, something gentle and moisturizing and that I could use every day without worrying.</li>
            <li> I left it on about 5 minutes and for the first time in a long time I did not use conditioner because I wanted to see what the shampoo did for my hair without conditioner.</li>
            <li> I could not believe that my hair actually was manageable, straight, and not frizzy after only a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair in the front and coarse curly hair in the back.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos and was never happy with anything thus far.</li>
            <li> I am an African American and I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes natural shampoos just don&#x27;t do the job in cleaning the hair, but this definitely does all while keeping it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Approximately one year ago I made the switch to more natural shampoo in an attempt to limit my exposure to chemicals.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like how the label obscured the shampoo bottle so the only way I could tell how much was left was by the weight of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo expecting the same pleasant experience, but was immediately disappointed when I first used it and realized it smells like old food and herbs smashed up together.</li>
            <li> It left my hair very soft and shiny which my wife and daughter even commented about.</li>
            <li> No other shampoo has allowed me to do this.  </li>
            <li> After having major surgery on my ear that involved an incision in my scalp, my hair was falling out dramatically.</li>
            <li> I wish I discovered this product sooner, but better late than never!</li>
            <li> No other shampoo could do this.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos and usually get an over dry scalp &amp; end up using oils and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other argan-oil-based shampoos before and some of them had a strong smell due to the oil.</li>
            <li> It does leave your hair &amp;#34;Squeeky clean&amp;#34; with only a small amount but that Squeek means pretty much all of the natural oils were stripped from my hair.</li>
            <li> I have &#x27;fine&#x27;, delicate and color treated hair</li>
            <li> Usually I have to do 3-4 shampoos until it feels squeaky clean but with this Argan oil shampoo</li>
            <li> I wash twice with a small amount like it says and my hair always feels clean.  </li>
            <li> I would mind trying other products since the company really focuses on using all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other sulfate-free shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> I figure if some of it sits there all day, that’s fine with me, my hair is thick</li>
            <li> nicely fine with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long ( past waist ) thin Asian hair &amp; this shampoo was perfect!</li>
            <li> &amp; it gets greasy/oily pretty fast, especially using my previous shampoos, like the next day after a wash (Head &amp; Shoulders/Pantene)!  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m lucky, my hair will last a day and a half before looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> I received an email back within 24 hours saying they were so sorry for the situation and that they were going to refund the amount for the original bottle, let me keep the one that was sent in error and send me the actual product I ordered free of charge as well.</li>
            <li> so well it&#x27;s hard to believe it is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and my hair is thinning so I am trying supplements and new more natural shampoos that are less damaging to the scalp.</li>
            <li> (well, I only bought an 8oz bottle here on Amazon, but 100% Pure is still more expensive)</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of it to feel like my hair is even getting clean, but it also leaves my hair very dried out and tangly.</li>
            <li> In the end, I highly recommend you try the product because the ingredients are each necessary to properly enriching your hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I see it&#x27;s mostly woman who have left reviews on this product, so here&#x27;s a little something for the fellas curious about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not just my scalp, but my skin in general.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to some ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have been researching about the chemical effects of shampoo on our body and since only used natural products.</li>
            <li> I am a perpetual hair straightener (daily) and this product has completely changed my hair.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a handful of times but so far I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using sulfate-free shampoos because they help sustain the natural oils found in my hair.</li>
            <li> The product itself works like a shampoo, conditioner, leave in oil, and de-frizzer because of all the natural components.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is a milky white almost translucent color.</li>
            <li> so I ofter use baby shampoo, as natural as possible.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t contain sulfate and contains several natural oils.</li>
            <li> I do not have dandruff, but an extra sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I use only natural or organic products on my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the only natural shampoo I have purchased that my husband likes.  </li>
            <li> The entire family uses it and it leaves our hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember any such offers</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing the conditioner in the near future.</li>
            <li> During this time I have developed a severe skin sensitivity, especially on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an advocate of using all natural personal care products (</li>
            <li> This Shampoo made my hair amazingly soft and actually makes it shiner and healthier.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice so far.</li>
            <li> Even without a conditioner I could feel that my hair was stripped of its natural oils which us brown girls definitely don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> Not only can I stand the smell, my hair is so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Made my coarse, curly hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> does not feel soft after shampooing with this product (even after a second use of this shampoo).</li>
            <li> I would say that I never gave my hair or skin that same treatment with quality natural ingredient shampoos.</li>
            <li> I also like that I&#x27;m now using a shampoo with natural ingredients and so not doing further damage to my scalp and hair with chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is literally the only shampoo so far that hasn&#x27;t caused him to break out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This Shampoo made my hair amazingly soft and actually makes it shiner and healthier.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo and it left my hair feeling really soft and luscious.</li>
            <li> In recent months, I have changed my routine to use far fewer cleanser products on my hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft, manageable and it was soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> My sensitive facial skin was irritated by a product used and the skin started to burn.  </li>
            <li> I was also surprised to see how long my hair held up till next wash, it did not oil up like it normally does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find shampoos that are not harsh to the hair, and Maple Holistics not only met my expectations, but also exceeded it.</li>
            <li> and it has a nice faint smell to me.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and lathers well without harsh sulfites and parabens.</li>
            <li> My hair was beginning to thin out on top.  </li>
            <li> I need to keep a &#x27;poofy&#x27; style to disguise how thin my hair is, but most shampoos that offer help with body are also drying.  </li>
            <li> My family and friends have noticed that I keep my hair down more often now rather then in a messy bun.</li>
            <li> I have gotten into organic and chemical free products lately and was looking for a new shampoo and most were way too expensive.</li>
            <li> but as I am certainly no expert on holistics or organics, they may very well be something truly organic.</li>
            <li> And it left my hair soft after my normal blow dry routine.  </li>
            <li> I flew home fromHI (where I live)  to CA for winter break, and on my way back as I was unpacking, I realized I left my shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I flew home fromHI (where I live)  to CA for winter break, and on my way back as I was unpacking, I realized I left my shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> but my hair is no longer falling out, is so soft, and my curls are much softer and less brillo-pad like.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> I take a large amount of steroids for a medical condition and my hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> I have hair that gets dry and unmanageable and this shampoo has changed all that my hair is left soft and shiny without looking weighed down like so many other shampoos.</li>
            <li> After my first use I had less itching and irritations.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s normal to dry.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, but no better than other (better smelling) shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics does this with the last several ingredients, but mostly the ingredients list on this Maple Holistics shampoo is difficult to read and requires research if you want to really want to know</li>
            <li> It may work better with other colors, but I strongly do not recommend those with red hair to use this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly into the whole organic movement, but it did concern me a bit that I still don&#x27;t know what some of the listed ingredients actually are...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really messed up my hair with other products including the baking soda</li>
            <li> I find that this shampoo is much easier to distribute evenly throughout the hair than other brands.</li>
            <li> (you don&#x27;t need to use as much as some other shampoos).</li>
            <li> other than that didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> I was loosing quite a bit of hair due to stress and I have noticed that it is not happening as much since I have been using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about this product as I have not had much luck with natural products.</li>
            <li> a quarter size amount in your hand goes a long way, I used as much as I would with a normal shampoo and the suds were poring down my head.</li>
            <li> Even though it was a moisturizing hair care treatment, those other products left my hair super dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Makes my very long, thick and naturally curly hair super soft.</li>
            <li> It actually does foam, cleans amazingly, and my hair-fall has been reduced by at least half after using this and their Silk Conditioner for about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Has natural essential oils such as tea tree,lavender,and argan oil and vanilla and honey!!love</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and if left it feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really believed that different shampoos would make that much of a difference on hair.  </li>
            <li> reference, I have very low-maintenance undyed, thick straight hair that doesn&#x27;t need to be washed every day.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does not dry out our hair while cleansing and it does not leave it oily.  </li>
            <li> I am Asian with black, thick and strong straight hair.</li>
            <li> It tangles easily and usually feels very dry.</li>
            <li> First to tell you a little bit about my hair history.</li>
            <li> First to tell you a little bit about my hair history.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last longer than I originally thought because, you only use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I just bought a second bottle, even though I still have about half of the first bottle to go.  </li>
            <li> This bothered me at first, but now that I’m seeing such an improvement in my hair’s health, I could care less.</li>
            <li> I have spent many of wasted money on salon products only to find out that they make my hair greasy or dry.</li>
            <li> My scalp itches like crazy and I haven&#x27;t experienced this with any other product.</li>
            <li> So, I decided maybe I&#x27;d try a sulfate free shampoo as I&#x27;ve heard sulfates are not good for hair.</li>
            <li> , I used to wash my hair daily because I have very oily scalp, with other shampoos</li>
            <li> am an African American male, 48 years old, and I rock a mini “fro”.</li>
            <li> Leaves my corse grey colored hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> The same thing applied to the second time I used it (I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far).</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair that grows fast and thick, and I color my hair all the time, and this revitalized my hair to almost like baby soft.</li>
            <li> I know a product can do wonders on your hair in the first few days/ weeks</li>
            <li> not a good product which is a bummer since it has so many good oils :(</li>
            <li> First, I used the shampoo which made my head a bit itch, but the itching feeling are gone after few weeks continues using.</li>
            <li> I expected my hair to at minimum be a bit shinier or softer than normal.</li>
            <li> But I found it to be too harsh, it faded my hair color from the first wash</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it I thought it was working well</li>
            <li> Been trying to find a product that would help moisturize my hair in the very dry climate where I live.</li>
            <li> So it seems expensive but it lasts a while if you do not  wash your hair every day and with this shampoo I can easily go 3 days without needing to shampoo!</li>
            <li> As an older woman hair gets drier due to years of coloring and age.</li>
            <li> Honestly it was hard to get past the smell.</li>
            <li> Obviously this shampoo won&#x27;t do the whole shabang for your hair and you&#x27;ll use other products that&#x27;ll manage your hair further to what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only been using this a week, but I swear, my hair feels much softer than it did with any of the other standard brands of shampoo (probably because all of them have sulfates)!</li>
            <li> By using these shampoo, my hair is shiny and soft all day long!</li>
            <li> I usually take just the right amount of shampoo required for me.</li>
            <li> but i dont feel dry any more..and they have become soft as well...</li>
            <li> It relieved some of my dry, flaky scalp and made my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li> but my dry hair stuck out like a sore thumb, it was time to take action.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic with no harsh chemicals and does not make my hair dry to comb.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this for my 8 year old son whose hair is quite dry and stringy.</li>
            <li> but this shampoo just made my hair stringy and dry; however, it did wonders for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> but my dry hair stuck out like a sore thumb, it was time to take action.</li>
            <li> I have boob-length, straight, black hair.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for natural solutions for frizzy hair as well as dry hair problems.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone with dry hair and a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> my easy to manage hair became brittle, greasy, and seriously thin.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I blow dried my hair and was left with my hair looking as it always does, just a bit drier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian American and had thick, black, straightish-wavy-ish hair until after my pregnancy, when sections of my hair started curling more and other sections became stick straight.</li>
            <li> I was surprised such small amount generates so much lather.</li>
            <li> I only shampoo a couple of times a week so as not to dry out my naturally curly salt and pepper hair.  </li>
            <li> I recently started growing facial hair and used this on my beard and it did not dry out my face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair and rarely use hair products (maybe a few times a year).  </li>
            <li> I have had this problem for the last few years, and tried many other shampoos, ranging from expensive to cheap (as prices denote) and from all-natural to regular formulations.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than normal dandruff and over the years I&#x27;ve tried numerous herbal shampoos and was using a prescription shampoo with 2% Ketoconazole right up to the time I tried this Argan Oil Shampoo from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural shampoos in the last six months, I have been looking for one that doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to become dry.  </li>
            <li> Dry Hair!&lt;br /&gt;OK, so this is the only real issue I have,  This shampoo really dries out my hair and makes it hard.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> I have been using different kinds of shampoo, but most of them leave my hair dry and look unhealthy.</li>
            <li> I was forced to wear white and light shirts but have dug up a black polo shirt that must be 10 years old</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and used a quarter-sized amount which was actually a little too much as my hair is medium length.</li>
            <li> I have noticed, and so have other people, new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Left with dry, life-less, and coarse feeling hair, I returned back to my old commercial products.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, hair and this product has totally transformed it!!</li>
            <li> I have waist length baby soft but thick hair that has tangled ALL of my life!!!, have never been able to find a shampoo that would detangle it till now</li>
            <li> I think it is a good shampoo but a little expensive for the bottle size.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using argan oil shampoo, my hair has never been dry and looks much healthier compared to other shampoos I have used.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo wasn&#x27;t too bad it did smell good</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t find the scent of this shampoo to be bad, it just isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money and a small drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I believe this is because my hair is so thick its not wet enough until after that first rinse</li>
            <li> No other shampoo has ever let my hair feel so dry.  </li>
            <li> No other shampoo has ever let my hair feel so dry.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with the Argan shampoo, and let it air dry with no other products on my my hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing i think it is a bit pricey for such small bottle, but my hair felt very clean after using a small amount of it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has an odd smell of old fat and some ingredients appear to be less than pure.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly long black hair, and I shampoo it about two times a week.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that the sources of fragrance are completely natural so the chemicals that cause my asthma attacks aren&#x27;t present.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for several weeks, the one thing I&#x27;m thinking about is trying their dry hair shampoo as while I don&#x27;t mistreat my hair, recent years and weather have dried it out considerably</li>
            <li> A little bit of this shampoo goes a long way, and it lathers up very well.</li>
            <li> I know that in most shampoos, artificial products and chemical additives constitute the major ingredients.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the conditioner, which doesn&#x27;t take much either, as long as you add a little bit of water as you work your way through the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m actually surprised, but all of these reasons were complaints from other reviewers on here</li>
            <li> I figured I would try this and work my way through other products the company offers if it gave me some relief.</li>
            <li> The Conditioner on the other hand made my hair sooo soft</li>
            <li> The family member&#x27;s sensitivity is so extreme that even natural scents are a problem.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft and looking fuller than it did with other brands.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair, so I do use argon oil occasionally, but had not used it on this day.</li>
            <li> I only needed two shampoos and my hair felt a little bit more moisturized before I even applied conditioner, usually with my other shampoo</li>
            <li> Even though it is expensive, it only takes a small amount to do a really good job.</li>
            <li> I had extremely dull, brittle hair, I have tried many products in past to no avail, nothing compares to this product.</li>
            <li> I was very shocked to see my hair looking just as clean on day 2 and with a tad more volume.</li>
            <li> I typically try something new each time I buy shampoo but will probably keep using this one.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately they make my hair dry, SUPER FRIZZY and Tangled!!</li>
            <li> Both products are very concentrated so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> My hair is normal type, it is not straight, yet not really wavy.</li>
            <li> It first started out slow, exercising regularly, drinking water…holding off on that ranch with my fries etc.</li>
            <li> Normally, I have thick, naturally curly, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It first started out slow, exercising regularly, drinking water…holding off on that ranch with my fries etc.</li>
            <li> Like the other type, you need very minimal product to get a really rice lather.</li>
            <li> It is a very small bottle, but I&#x27;m not going to knock on that until I&#x27;ve used it long enough to tell whether it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Many products have left my hair feeling a little on the greasy side with a filmy feel that was tough to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Overall, the health of my hair has improved and I feel like it has been restored to how it naturally was (also I have noted less frizz and dryness).</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, my hair again felt dry and coarse, so I used a lot of conditioner afterwards, and had no problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles as a Christmas present for my two sons who constantly complain of oily and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Am on my 2nd bottle &amp; my hair is not as dry as it was with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fabulous shampoo for my thin dry damaged frizzy hair - looks softer and healthier after just one wash.</li>
            <li> I was expecting some natural shampoo, but after i received it and checked the formula, i found out many BAD ingredients such as SCL, SLS!</li>
            <li> it looks like maple holistics doesn&#x27;t use any fragrances (artificial at least) anyway, and i imagine the hair health benefits will outweigh this issue for most people, but it&#x27;s just something worth pointing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, with just a really small amount of shampoo, it takes care of my whole head.</li>
            <li> and my waves are looking much cleaner with a beachy look without the frizziness I usually have.</li>
            <li> Lathers very well and requires a fairly small amount to apply to hair.</li>
            <li> My hair aren&#x27;t long either, I have short 2.5 inch hair strands.</li>
            <li> (smell is the last thing I care about as long as the product works well).</li>
            <li> What it does not say is the list of chemicals long enough to choke an elephant.</li>
            <li> have grey hair , so i do color regularly to hide</li>
            <li> We will definitely be using this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Bottle seems like it will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> I also flat iron my hair and the Maple Holistics</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of shampoos for my long curly blonde (dyed) hair.</li>
            <li> Forget flat ironing too; it would just make my hair like straw and fry the ends.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is washed and styled daily.  </li>
            <li> It dried out my normally oily hair.</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp and thick hair that falls right below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and have had trouble with sulfate-free shampoos leaving my hair limp, in the past.  </li>
            <li> I was also surprised at how long it lasted as I only had to use a little to lather my entire head.</li>
            <li> this shampoo leaves my hair soft &amp; silky, but not weighed down.</li>
            <li> This made my hair soft and silky without weighing down.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry to begin with and this shampoo is much too harsh.  </li>
            <li> My biggest notice is the texture of my hair itself, usually the other shampoos left it dry &amp; flaky right after washing and even with try conditioning it to replace what the shampoo stripped.</li>
            <li> Too bad because I really wanted to use cruelty free products.</li>
            <li> A lot of people have said in their reviews that this product smells bad, but in my opinion it actually it smells quite nice.</li>
            <li> I have tried various products for my dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair extremely dry</li>
            <li> Having bleached blonde hair, this product is a savior in that it moisturizes the dry ends.</li>
            <li> i have dry color treated hair and after only 2 uses i can see the softness and shine.</li>
            <li> Those reviews weren&#x27;t joking when they said it left their hair dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to square one trying to find a fix for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I considered chopping off my hair because it had become dry, lifeless, fragile and brittle.</li>
            <li> But just to see if it was drying, I decided to not use a conditioner the second time I tried it, and although my hair didn&#x27;t have the silkiness it gets from my conditioner, it wasn&#x27;t dry or straw-like either.</li>
            <li> This seems to be helping so far, there are less hairs on my bathroom floor</li>
            <li> If left my hair really dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this bottle to a friend and I will try their dry scalp/dandruff shampoo next.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I decided to air dry.</li>
            <li> Again, left my hair dry</li>
            <li> , however it did not lather up in my hair at all and left it dry and matted,  </li>
            <li> Some shampoos dry out my skin and feel itchy, but this product has the opposite effect.</li>
            <li> the scalp is not left dry.  </li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to do made my hair soft much less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I tried the wash with baking soda, rinse with vinegar thing but as soon as my hair was dry it felt so gross at my head.</li>
            <li> Some of the natural shampoos I&#x27;ve tried previously didn&#x27;t lather well</li>
            <li> I was previously using another shampoo that was all natural</li>
            <li> I do not use any conditioner but a very tiny amount of coconut oil at the ends of my hair when hair gets too dry.</li>
            <li> Prior to this my scalp was scaly and flaking and my graying hair was dry and thinner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been surprised that my kids have less knots in their hair using the shampoo with the matching</li>
            <li> The shampoo is moisturizing as I have even skipped the conditioner a few times when I was not going anywhere (to save water as CA is in the middle of a drought) and my hair still felt soft.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times so far, but I have a feeling it is going to become a staple in my shower.</li>
            <li> But now after a few weeks of using it it has started to make my hair like hay and has brought back my scalp issues which had disappeared after I made the switch to completely natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> left my curly, thick hair super soft plus no frizz in the south Carolina&#x27;s humid late spring this year.</li>
            <li> It still burned somewhat but was better for a few months then got worse.</li>
            <li> Although the bottle is only 8 oz, it doesn&#x27;t take much (1/3 to 1/2 tablespoon) to lather all of my thick, waist-length hair.</li>
            <li> A little went a long way, and it left my hair feeling soft, looking shiny, and in control.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to nail down which ingredient in particular irritates me, but every shampoo must contain it because I will break out in full body hives when I use them.</li>
            <li> ; when it is being combed out but it&#x27;s very soft once it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
            <li> This also includes shampoos, which when rinsed off in the shower, were creating horrible rashes on my neck and chest, as well as my hands from having to use the shampoo in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company and upon request, received a free and very generous sample to try before making a purchase.  </li>
            <li> This bottle lasted for almost 6 month because you really need only small amound of shampoo for a wash.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will get this shampoo again!</li>
            <li> My hair is usually unruly and curly, just came back from vacation from India which made it much more worse.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling very dry (even with the silk18) and brittle and left my scalp dry as well.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy and dry hair and have been having severe hair loss for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> only negative (which may not be an issue for many people) is that my wife feels that the shampoo, while putting it on in the shower, has an unpleasant smell (she says something along the lines of &amp;#34;burnt plastic&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Acrylates Copolymer is a synthetic polymer used as a film former in cosmetics and personal care products that has opaque properties and is seen in a variety of formulas, including those for sunscreens and other lotions, according to CosmeticsCop.com.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t contain any of those nasty chemicals you&#x27;ll find in other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it along with Silk 18 for a couple of weeks now and very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried Rogaine and  numerous  other shampoos but have never seen such improvement.</li>
            <li> I am middle aged and my hair texture has changed to very coarse and dry.</li>
            <li> But I mixed it with another shampoo and then continued my cleansing regimen with a deep conditioner hydrating mask, and this product can mix with other hair cleansers.</li>
            <li> but when it dried, my hair felt like the cuticle was rough and the whole head looks so dry.</li>
            <li> the opposite made it very dry and straw like feeling..</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo may work for only very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry scalp and it keeps my hair and scalp sufficiently moist without an extra conditioner, even when I use it every day.  </li>
            <li> I have very very dry hair and this shampoo is the only product worked on my hair!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions for use, and while the shampoo lathers nicely, it left my hair very dry and course.</li>
            <li> I put the silk 18 conditioner in hoping it would help a little and to my udder shock and relief my hair felt silky soft as I smoothed it through.</li>
            <li> Acts like a clarifying shampoo with a little conditioning action.</li>
            <li> My usual brands are high end - R**k*n and S**s**do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve turned down similar offers from other companies  because I couldn&#x27;t endorse their products.</li>
            <li> Even with our hard well water, it really lathers up and rinses out with ease.</li>
            <li> The overall quality of my hair has improved - less breakage, fewer split ends, less scalp oil, less static, less tangles, an it requires less styling, etc.</li>
            <li> I am usually skeptical of buying shampoo that is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel healthy without all the crazy ingredients others put in there shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used to spend hours trying to smooth my hair using expensive products, but since I ordered Argan my hair start responding to the treatment.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled for very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this combo for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> My hair is long so I always have problem when I brush it.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was a bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and I am not young.</li>
            <li> or so that doesn&#x27;t go away with regular washing, and I think I may put it in an empty argan oil shampoo bottle when I finish this one.</li>
            <li> a long</li>
            <li> As long as the product works....</li>
            <li> I have long hair and the shampoo</li>
            <li> I have long color treated hair</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, about a nickel size for long hair.  </li>
            <li> This product falls within the category of nourishing, but leaves my long hair in dire need of a conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair and want a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner, then you shouldn&#x27;t go for it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as it doesn&#x27;t build up as some shampoos can do</li>
            <li> I have to mist or wet some areas to get them to lie back in place.  </li>
            <li> and it is noticeably not nearly as oily.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to massage on scalp and leave it for 2-3 minutes which is strange coz</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minor thing for the quality of the shampoo</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> Since this is a rather expensive shampoo, I&#x27;d like it to last as long as possible, but even if I still need both applications, I&#x27;ll rebuy as the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, somewhat curly hair, and really like this shampoo for it.</li>
            <li> Though I was slightly nervous about the size when I got it because I might go through it too fast but after trying, this shampoo soaps up nicely so a little will go a long ways.</li>
            <li> Leave my hair a little dry but extremely soft</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few natural shampoos and I haven&#x27;t find any that don&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> My hair feels smoother, softer, and less frizzy after the first few days!  </li>
            <li> , I want to start by saying it was LESS harsh than other shampoos I had been using, It left my hair feeling moisturized for much longer as well.</li>
            <li> Only small amount will lather well, so I hope it will go pretty long, even though the quantity seems small.</li>
            <li> I have a short hair but very dry and rough.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine curly hair that can get a bit oily as well as dry (if you have my hair type, you know exactly what I mean as crazy as it sounds)</li>
            <li> and I wash my hair maybe every other day and use only about a quarter-sized dollop.</li>
            <li> I prefer the sage one due to its extra benefits for the scalp.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to try other products from same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels different than any other product I’ve tried on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I use it in between another shampoo due to when I was using it daily, my hair felt greasy...</li>
            <li> I’m definitely going to be trying other products from this company, including the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo itself but it&#x27;s really expensive for how little you get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had active eczema since I was young, and am hypersensitive to so many artificial ingredients in products and the environment, that I am usually nursing several &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34; on my face and body.</li>
            <li> So, if you have extremely dry hair, I&#x27;d say this shampoo is not for you.</li>
            <li> If you have oily scalp and dry ends, you can make this work.</li>
            <li> Will continue searching for a shampoo that works for my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I used baby shampoo for a while but even that seemed to irritate my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and fuzzy.</li>
            <li> I never use conditioner, but maybe I should start, but again, the shampoo I was using didn&#x27;t dry out my hair like the Argan does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my hair dry:</li>
            <li> My hair is a bit dry after using it.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry hair and this product did dry my hair a bit.  </li>
            <li> feeling a bit dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat dry and my scalp is often dry, so I thought with all the oils in this shampoo, it would work wonders for me.</li>
            <li> no longer have damaged and dry hair.</li>
            <li> The reason why I bought this was because I started noticing that my skin, by my eyebrows was getting itchy and really dry, Also my head was itchy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a result, my hair is beaten up by all those chemicals which caused the hair to be incredibly dry and lifeless.</li>
            <li> and makes it dry</li>
            <li> My hair is dry at the end and oil at the root.</li>
            <li> but my hair still looked damaged and really dry.</li>
            <li> My hair still seems dry</li>
            <li> My hair feel softer, not as brittle and dry, and healthier.</li>
            <li> and my hair is keeping it&#x27;s color and isn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair dry.</li>
            <li> and i kept seeing everyone complaining about how it leaves your hair dry.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> I want to prevent my hair from thinning and it has always been dry</li>
            <li> this shampoo cleans scalp but makes hair dry.</li>
            <li> my ends were so dry</li>
            <li> Also Argan oil applied sparingly every day to dry ends</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that didn&#x27;t dry out my hair before applying conditioner.</li>
            <li> However, if you have dry brittle hair, this is FOR you!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, wavy, and frizzy, so I always need to use some type of gel or frizz control serum.</li>
            <li> They both help with winter dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle at all after using this.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind washing my &amp;#34;horse hair&amp;#34; because when it&#x27;s all dry it feels like silk.</li>
            <li> I also take an hour to blow dry after air drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nopt working so well for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the Argan oil shampoo for my dry skin</li>
            <li> Since I moved to Arizona my hair and scalp became extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I used it together with their conditioner and my hair was frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> My son has itchy dry scalp, after he use it, he doesn&#x27;t feel it anymore.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I do feel as though it makes my hair feel dry after I wash until I apply conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Also leaves hair really dry,</li>
            <li> Today my hair feels and looks dry like a broom.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it makes my hair feel really dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I seem to be allergic to this shampoo, it makes my scalp really dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> It suits my dry hair.</li>
            <li> My scalp was dry and irritated by all of the hair products I have been using.</li>
            <li> My scalp was no longer itchy or dry.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few days now and can say that even though I am a guy with short hair, I can tell that it has a different healthier appearance since I have been using this argan shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have severely damaged/over processed hair after consistent perming, dying, bleaching hair for the past few years.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft and looking silkier after just a few uses!!</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to try a dime size first (if you have short hair, maybe less); get small amount on your palm and add little water and lather</li>
            <li> and I read the labels on every single thing I buy.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I would have to go back to conventional shampoos but</li>
            <li> You need very little,  leave hair soft .  </li>
            <li> Very little of it is required and it creates soft lather.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair which was breaking and very frizzy due to coloring.  </li>
            <li> Finding a sulfate free shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat and lifeless is next to impossible.</li>
            <li> There are not many natural, sulfate-free shampoos out there, I just might stick with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be buying some dark blue shirts and darker colors now.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other natural shampoos but they made my hair knotty after washing and my hair started falling out (from the tugging of washing my hair).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 69 years old and the past year my hair has been thinning.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t tangle as it usually does, and her hair was really soft.</li>
            <li> So I tried dying lighter-from med brown to dark blonde.</li>
            <li> This is WORSE than avid or suave or anything!!&lt;br /&gt;Reason</li>
            <li> My hair is strange and I have never really had a conditioner that helped the problems that I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to switch to sulfate-free for a while, but the true sulfate-free shampoos are so expensive.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it leaves my hair a little dry, but considering the fact that this shampoo uses only natural ingredients, it&#x27;s a trade-off</li>
            <li> I also have dry (like very dry) hair</li>
            <li> , my ends are splitting much less frequently, and there is less hair in my hairbrush.</li>
            <li> We switched back to Argan and my hair is less dry</li>
            <li> The ingredients here are natural and not harmful to one&#x27;s hair -- reason enough to put serious thought into ordering this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, my hair and scalp are super dry.  </li>
            <li> The oils didn&#x27;t weigh down the hair or feeling greasy and instead left it feeling moisturized .</li>
            <li> Although it has chemicals - it&#x27;s not entirely organic - if you water it down - your hair will et shiny-clean.</li>
            <li> but they just weigh down your hair and the hair looks greasy the second day of wash.</li>
            <li> I still only use the shampoo on my scalp and let the shampoo work its way down when rinsing.</li>
            <li> I have only used Argan once and already the burning has quieted down a lot.</li>
            <li> I have no intentions on going back to any other shampoos I have tried before!</li>
            <li> Although the chlorine smell never left our hair, my hair did not further dry out like is usually does</li>
            <li> I still have dry hair but at least it looks alive!</li>
            <li> It started to fall out in clumps (a common occurrence, I was told, for new mothers.</li>
            <li> I’ve been curious for a very long time about trying organic hair products.</li>
            <li> The only REAL complaint I have with this conditioner is the fact that it is very drying.</li>
            <li> My hair felt horribly dry and doll like!</li>
            <li> My ends would get dry and break!</li>
            <li> I can already feel a difference in my dry, frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li> It left my hair moisturized and with less fly-aways.</li>
            <li> I have bleach blonde hair, and was previously using a salon quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> Even my hairdresser commented when I went in last that my hair was stronger and my scalp less irritated.  </li>
            <li> Less shipping and plastic &#x3D; smaller carbon footprint.</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong surfer with dry hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also curious about their Hydrate Shampoo because my bf tends to have dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I believe the jojoba oil makes the difference, since I used other shampoos with the same other ingredients in this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love the conditioner, so not sure what went wrong with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not only does it take me now about 3 minutes to comb through my hair, I don&#x27;t experience the hair loss in the comb I previously had.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every three days, and on the 3rd day I use a little bit of dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The smell was unpleasant, it smells like Vinegar and it seemed to really strip all of the oils out of my (thick, fine) hair, which I found to be too harsh and left it frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a lot of chemicals in my hair, but have had a hard time finding a natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> my hair has been very dry.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one for my very dry scalp.</li>
            <li> and she specifically told me to get one that has Argan oil because I had very dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have Very dry and damage  hair .</li>
            <li> it makes my hair very dry</li>
            <li> and my hair felt very dry.</li>
            <li> Even my husband after using it found that his scalp felt very dry.</li>
            <li> Her hair was very dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy prone to frizz, after washing and using the conditioner my hair is soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> This shampoo left my thick, untreated, wavy East Asian hair frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have spent thousands of dollars – trying everything new that comes out to control my hair and nothing – and I mean nothing – works.</li>
            <li> I mixed in about a teaspoon of fractionated coconut oil into the bottle, and it&#x27;s still a little drying for my hair.</li>
            <li> It lasts a while, you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> It seems a little thinner than the last bottle I owned, but still works just as well.</li>
            <li> Alone it leaves my hair feeling a little too coarse.</li>
            <li> You only need a little</li>
            <li> Also, it has a lot of bubble even you only use a little.</li>
            <li> It makes it oily despite using only a little and rinsing thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Only a little bit is needed to sud up.</li>
            <li> Only a little bit is needed to sud up.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewer&#x27;s have said, this product made my hair and scalp extremely dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry it out like a lot of other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Other non-organic shampoos that I&#x27;ve used seem to make my hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was dull and dry and no other product I&#x27;ve used worked</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled better - it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Brazilian Keratin Hair Treatment 300ml Professional Complex)</li>
            <li> the actual ingredients i order this for are the last on the list so that means the least amount.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is concentrated, so you only need a small amount; even with long hair.</li>
            <li> Despite all of the natural ingredients, the shampoo has an icky plastic/chemical aroma.  </li>
            <li> The only way is to shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times because I shampoo once a week or once every 2 weeks, but when I have used it</li>
            <li> earlier my hair used to feel dried out and lacked life....</li>
            <li> I’m not really concerned about this</li>
            <li> Not much to say</li>
            <li> I wanted to get quite a few washes in before I left a review</li>
            <li> so the color stays in, washing your hair twice with this product does not really help the color in your hair.  </li>
            <li> I used the shampoo as recommended, especially letting it soak into the scalp for a few minutes before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> so I have to be careful what I wash my hair with.</li>
            <li> I used to pull out way too much hair every time I washed it, but since I&#x27;ve started using this the amount has decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only used for a few days now</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m considering adding a few drops of essential oil.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not really anything to be concerned about.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t smell the jojoba at all, which I expected the scent to be.</li>
            <li> I have spent literally years looking for this product.  </li>
            <li> Since this product came up when I searched for organic shampoos, I expected it to be organic.  </li>
            <li> Have only used a few times, so can&#x27;t give an opnion on long-term results.  </li>
            <li> Not much of a smell to it</li>
            <li> product has absolutely no scent that I could discern whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> It took a few weeks for the improved condition to be obvious.  </li>
            <li> not much though.</li>
            <li> product wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> After it dried, the harsh chemical look from coloring (last summer), was no longer present.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Now my hair feels smoother (while wet).</li>
            <li> I leave this shampoo in for a few extra minutes.  </li>
            <li> not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Because I color my hair, I am careful about which shampoo to use.</li>
            <li> Cleans my straight, thick hair without making it over dried or frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have long waving hair down to my waist.</li>
            <li> reviewers wrote that this shampoo is too drying, but I think it&#x27;s because this shampoo is little concentrated and lots of people use the same amount as other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have long black hair.</li>
            <li> After trying six or seven shampoos offering oils of different plants and being disappointed because they either left my hair unchanged or left it too oily, I tried Argan Oil shampoo, not expecting much.</li>
            <li> Less red scratchy skin, less dandruff and stronger hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of shampoos make my head itchy and hair dry, and I narrowed it down to sulfates.</li>
            <li> and then I noticed it was starting to flake a little bit and had a few patches of visibly dry skin.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and weak and gets oily easily.</li>
            <li> Granted, those other shampoos were not natural, so perhaps it’s just that my hair is truly oily and previous shampoos’</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be happier, as I am changing my diet to mostly raw foods I wanted to change the products on the outside as well.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very thick, coarse hair and have trouble getting product completely gone!</li>
            <li> I am still having a slight problem with dry scalp, so I am still working on this, but I will buy this shampoo again and keep using it.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels less itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> and my scalp feels less dry.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels less dry too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I have long, thick, wavy and frizzy East Asian hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> So a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, and even though my hair is softer, I am not sure if it is due to the shampoo or the conditioning oil i use everyday.</li>
            <li> My hair feels less dry after using this compared to my other shampoo.</li>
            <li> This Argan shampoo left my hair dry, dull and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It has made her long hair tangle-free, easy to manage and less painful while brushing.</li>
            <li> My hair is now a dry frizzy mess even after I used the silk 18 conditioner too.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is it could be a little bigger for the price, maybe around 10-12oz.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say about it is that the bottle was a little smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> so I decided to find a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo hoping it would be less likely to  cause me skin trouble.</li>
            <li> I have thin, curly, color-treated, dry hair, and I&#x27;ve been trying to find something natural, healthier for my hair</li>
            <li> For reference, I have extremely thick, coarse hair that is often dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have always splurged on haircare products because bottom shelf shampoo and conditioners dry out my hair, making my natural hair issues even worse.</li>
            <li> Other basics:</li>
            <li> My hair feels a lot cleaner and lighter than it did using other shampoo products.</li>
            <li> I plan on trying some of the other products.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> My hair feels a lot cleaner and lighter than it did using other shampoo products.</li>
            <li> I find it basically unscented other then just a castille soap smell.  </li>
            <li> No need for any other hair products.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for people who do not want to put excessive chemicals in their hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will start off by saying that I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week, usually 2.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo due to raves from others and because it supposedly has no chemicals.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I notice the difference of no residue, which was not evident with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo does the trick - it does not strip my color and allows me to go every other day without washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this Maple Holistics Argan Oil shampoo every other day, alternating it with the Canadian brand Calia&#x27;s Hydrating shampoo.</li>
            <li> I usually suffer from dandruff and will have to rotate between dandruff control and regular shampoo - with this</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky when it comes to my shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s been no &amp;#34;buildup&amp;#34; like other shampoos.</li>
            <li> After getting keratin treatment and dye on my hair, I needed a shampoo without sulfate and other ingredients that would strip the keratin away or otherwise be harmful for the body.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try due to the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I had other bottles of shampoo on hand that I needed to use up as well.  </li>
            <li> I want to try other products sold by Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that I do not need to wash my hair as often as I did with the other products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it has the highest ratings among all other sulfate-free shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair has suffered due to some health issues.  </li>
            <li> i did like the smell but other than that</li>
            <li> I am not sure only about that vanilla smell on my head</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I know how a lot of times when you buy something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; a lot of times its</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo due to raves from others and because it supposedly has no parabens and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> It cleans my scalp and hair well with only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t finished looking up all the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> The other option would be to do what naturopathica did and just put a list of product ingredients with their descriptions on the website instead of wasting paper on an info card or info sheet to send with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I use this and the conditioner and am extremely please with this product.</li>
            <li> It could just be due to the sensitivity of my skin, head, etc.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to put any other product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> feeling which I didn&#x27;t get from other shampoo products.</li>
            <li> My hair, I believe,  had been falling due to stress, but now it feels fuller and shinier.  </li>
            <li> Usually, products that give your hair an immediate shine are loaded with silicone and other chemicals that are only temporary.</li>
            <li> I have to mix it with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for what you get unless you wash your hair once a week...</li>
            <li> but this outweighs any other product I used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to an every other day schedule.</li>
            <li> I mention this because even though this bottle of shampoo is small, I feel like it will last me awhile based on my washing regimen.</li>
            <li> My color faded with any other sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to begin trying other products by Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> Did not experience dandruff issues from other organic shampoo products.</li>
            <li> If I go for a shampoo with body I have other problems.  </li>
            <li> I can wash my hair with this every day or every other day and have no problem.</li>
            <li> There could be other variables contributing to that though also.</li>
            <li> After a long and thorough study of the market for shampoo without toxic products in it, firmly stopped on Maple Holistics Argan Oil  Shampoo.</li>
            <li> another reason (and probably why most people are even looking at this product) is because you are sick of detergents and other odd chemicals being put into hair products.  </li>
            <li> It does dry my hair out a little</li>
            <li> I did not blow dry as usual either and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> However the shampoo does have the same consistency of other natural brands I have tried which is normally very thick!</li>
            <li> It is little expensive but worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very careful with my colored ends, and the shampoo can be a bit drying.</li>
            <li> It smells like nothing and leaves my hair very rough.</li>
            <li> I struggled for 4 years with hairfall, rough, dull and lifeless hair, after japanese rebonding my hair twice!!</li>
            <li> the reason why I am giving 4 stars instead of five is because the cap of the shampoo has a slight leakage when tilted even though it is closed and sealed otherwise</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have blonde thin fragile hair.</li>
            <li> Then again, I have thick straight hair (thick strands and a lot of it).</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is, I feel like it makes my hair lose a little volume when I blow dry it out.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t have that weighted down feeling that I would get with other products.  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy and isn&#x27;t weighed down by buildup like other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the 8 oz bottle being perhaps a bit too small with the amount I normally use, but you really DO get a lot from just a small amount!</li>
            <li> Dried my hair a LOT and made my color run more than other shampoos. :(</li>
            <li> As far as misses, i have very thick hair with curly roots</li>
            <li> then I realized how little you have to use each time, only a spot in your hand the size of a quarter, and this small amount will cut through all the oil and dirt on anyone&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> really only have two issues with this shampoo: the price for the quantity and the hard to read and understand ingredients</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lathering for this shampoo is average compare to conventional shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> It actually smells just like my sally hansen wax I used to use, which I never liked either.</li>
            <li> For like $14 it is not worth it, it made no difference in my hair from my Pantene I use.</li>
            <li> so if you want me opinion- not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money we r paying.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the bottle size.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about it is that after I rinse it out, it leaves my hair feeling “squeaky” in the shower –</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottle was when I bought it and with long hair</li>
            <li> I decided to try to do something about my thinning, thin hair, and this shampoo (in addition to the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner by Maple Holistics)sounded</li>
            <li> #1 is that when I used it, it stripped my hair far worse than any shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly, and coarse.</li>
            <li> Only concern is that my hair is thick and uses up a lot of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have medium length thick Asian hair, and dime size is all</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural shampoo without unnecessary harmful chemicals and now I have truly found it.</li>
            <li> Mine is thin and oily, his is thick and dry (he&#x27;s mixed race, black and white) and yet this shampoo works well for both of us.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that has recently became thin, dry and stringy.</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight his hair down or make it frizz.</li>
            <li> This product does not weigh my hair down but tames the friziness.</li>
            <li> I may as well have flushed $13 down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Will have to see down the line whether it helps with the hair growth or hair fall.</li>
            <li> It cuts down on the frizz I get in warmer temperatures - can&#x27;t explain why - it</li>
            <li> I thought these products would go down the drain just like everything else I’ve purchased for my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all</li>
            <li> : It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong bottle of shampoo instead of this one on accident by Amazon (they fulfilled the order not maple holistics) and was going to have to send the wrong one back and wait for my refund and then reorder myself the correct bottle that I ordered originally.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I feel like my dandruff has reduced a little.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has met my expectations, and I hope that I can try Maple Holistics other products soon!</li>
            <li> Let me just say I will not be buying any other shampoo again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clogging pores in other places!  </li>
            <li> have since gotten rid of all of my family&#x27;s other hair care products--I am a customer for life!  </li>
            <li> I plan on using the Silk 18 as other reviewers have suggested!</li>
            <li> Also appreciate this product does not have all the other ingredients that I don&#x27;t know what they are, let alone can pronounce!</li>
            <li> Plus it is expensive and you&#x27;re forced to be on auto ship, which I do not like because my hair is fine, thin, and short.</li>
            <li> Usually when I use just a shampoo product by itself, my hair feels really dry and isn&#x27;t shiny at all.</li>
            <li> Usually after I dye my hair it gets really dry</li>
            <li> NO MORE DANDRUFF OR DRY SCALP.</li>
            <li> After trying various shampoos and being left disappointed, I wanted to try something natural.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a very small amount it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, just so you know, lately I use the Argan shampoo a little differently than the instructions say.  </li>
            <li> The bottle size is small but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> hair: thin, little damage at ends from  chemical processing, naturally frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not find that it dried my hair out, as other reviewers have suggested.  </li>
            <li> Also, a very small amount of product is needed to fully cover my hair, so it should last awhile.</li>
            <li> Only con is that the bottle is very small.</li>
            <li> I have switched to organic products because I do not like the harsh ingredients in the other store brand products.</li>
            <li> , it just feels less irritated after using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Feels a bit glue like and smells odd</li>
            <li> it kinda has an odd smell to it</li>
            <li> Less frizz smoother hair</li>
            <li> I have also noticed less hair loss both while washing and brushing with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I estimate I will get just a tick less than 50 applications of it.  </li>
            <li> Ive had some serious health issues recently and between sickness and medications</li>
            <li> Hair feels cleaner and lighter than using my previous shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less shedding in the shower as well.</li>
            <li> I was switching to a shampoo with less chemicals and this had the highest rating</li>
            <li> I ran out of my previous brand of shampoo and stumbled upon maple holistics on amazon and thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely serious when I say that if I rubbed or scratched my chin, you could actually see powdery flaking.</li>
            <li> I notice the oilyness is not as much as previous also.  </li>
            <li> I have applied previous night.  </li>
            <li> Being a black woman</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair softer and less frizzy</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with a 4a/b hair texture.</li>
            <li> It gave some life to my previously wiry hair.</li>
            <li> I like that because my previous shampoos were overpowering at times.</li>
            <li> Even our medication for cold or flu, allergies or sinuses, are all natural and from plants and essential oils.</li>
            <li> my hair is thicker and falls less</li>
            <li> I would give it four and half stars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say maybe a slight glue-like smell kinda even looked like it</li>
            <li> Feels a bit glue like and smells odd</li>
            <li> Less hair come out in my combs when trying to detangle after washing as well.</li>
            <li> and I can use much less.</li>
            <li> Really, my previous shampoo did that to me.</li>
            <li> The hair loss seems to be less.</li>
            <li> I also noticed after switching over to using this product that I started shedding significantly less hair.</li>
            <li> I tend to have frizzy hair and it seems less frizzy also.</li>
            <li> I have mid-length black hair which sometimes gets tangled.</li>
            <li> Now, I feel it dries my hair less than when</li>
            <li> i also see less hair on the my comb now</li>
            <li> so I thought it was going to be another fail, but I followed the directions and applied the same amount a 2nd time</li>
            <li> I previously used Aveda brand shampoos</li>
            <li> I am losing less hair which is an added bonus for me.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair softer and less volume.</li>
            <li> It did not cause my scalp to itch like my previous shampoo and</li>
            <li> The bottle may be small but it&#x27;s thick and you&#x27;ll use much less at a time than other regular brands.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to every other day and will not need to replace this for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, it takes a lot of product for me to get a lather distributed throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally thick, frizzy and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I stopped using conditioner completely to narrow down</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is very long, curly and hard to comb after showers.  </li>
            <li> maybe it may not dry my hair since my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> My hair became really dry and was hard to run my finger thru...</li>
            <li> My hair ended up frizzy and dry, and dull in appearance, even with the Silk conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is returning to being silky-soft after just one week of use (I should note I have very long, thick hair).</li>
            <li> but lately I have been on some meds that dry me out.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s really not more expensive because it lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair feel greasy and did not clean well.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, course, dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s frizzy, extremely thick, curly, and dry.</li>
            <li> Everyday in the morning, combing is a big nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the roughness and sleeping through the night, it becomes stiff and standing and it becomes next to impossible to make them flat</li>
            <li> I usually use it with few drops of Argan oil applied to the roots when the hair is still a little wet and this has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty thick and a little difficult to wash out, which probably contributes to the drying effect.</li>
            <li> If you must have damp hair to style properly just rinse it every other time and you&#x27;ll see dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy for its size (8 oz) but its quality makes up for that.</li>
            <li> Before going into details on the product I wanted to give a little history.  </li>
            <li> This was a little bit of a hassle for me since it wasn&#x27;t my fault at all</li>
            <li> I have scratchy, itchy scalp and a little oilyness.  </li>
            <li> and I decided, why not spoil myself a little.</li>
            <li> For some reason this one dries my hair out a little, even though it has Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Well, you can find them all in this little bottle.  </li>
            <li> Made a limp mess of my hair.</li>
            <li> Seems like my hair feels little softer.</li>
            <li> My hair feels a little softer.  </li>
            <li> except I thought the price was a little steep for an 8 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend at least trying this shampoo!</li>
            <li> just a little goes</li>
            <li> there was no overwhelming scent to compete with any other fragrance I choose to wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to this Argan Oil Shampoo or Maple Holistics</li>
            <li> and I decided, why not spoil myself a little.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I bought silk 18 and that helped a little.</li>
            <li> will update my review after I have given my hair a little bit of time to adjust.</li>
            <li> Let me start by telling you a little bit about me, as context for this review.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair either every other day, or every two days.</li>
            <li> That helped a little.</li>
            <li> I started the Argan Oil Shampoo in January of this year, so I&#x27;ve used it a little over 5 months.</li>
            <li> Although I like the conditioner from this brand, the shampoo did little for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a little over two months now.</li>
            <li> this shampoo has a little lather</li>
            <li> Despite trying the other brands, I usually had some scratching and itchiness after a few days.  </li>
            <li> I use a little conditioner, because I color my roots every few weeks, but otherwise, I do not need conditioner for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Hands down to this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but creamy, with a very subtle fragrance, yet a tiny bit lathers like crazy!</li>
            <li> I carefully searched for shampoo and conditioner to help my dull hair and the reviews made me think this was just the ticket.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t until the 5th day that my hair starts to go limp and get oily</li>
            <li> My wife ravs about her hair now everyday since beginning to use this product.</li>
            <li> My product is apparently missing it.</li>
            <li> I do not like to over wash my hair or use products that have harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your valuable time and money buying this product.</li>
            <li> a few weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think oil help lift sebum from follicles without using harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> My hair became a burden, and with the addition that the I had to straighten my hair everyday to manipulate it</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying over the counter shampoos, and found out that there are countless harmless chemicals that make up the shampoos that I used to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it because I don&#x27;t want to waste it,  and also pricey</li>
            <li> The labels on this argon oil stuff has all kinds of things that sound like alcohol and crap</li>
            <li> I even got a few compliments on it.</li>
            <li> My hair also tends to thin when I use regular sulfate shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of annoyed to say it does, because I am such a cheapskate.</li>
            <li> I have been using argan shampoo for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I read a couple reviews from people that said this shampoo dried out their hair.</li>
            <li> Eventually all shampoos leave my hair limp or oily looking.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday which can make my hair a bit like straw.</li>
            <li> I got the shampoo and conditioner in Argan oil and used it a few times now.</li>
            <li> She says that it&#x27;s not that brittle and dried anymore.</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to see if this product made a difference for my hair, and it does.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> My hair became a burden, and with the addition that the I had to straighten my hair everyday to manipulate it</li>
            <li> I have been in wheelchair for a few years and didn&#x27;t take care of my hair.</li>
            <li> Heavy fragrance tends to irritate me.</li>
            <li> I now wash it everyday, but know this product isn&#x27;t stripping or overly drying my hair.</li>
            <li> but my hair always felt limp and heavy.  </li>
            <li> It does not strip my hair, nor does it make it feel greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> and I had heard that the harsh sulfates in some shampoos are what led to some of my hair loss and damage.</li>
            <li> Every morning I awake to see the condition of my hair and with a few pulls here and</li>
            <li> I was looking into purchasing Argan shampoo because my hair is color treated so much it is dried out.</li>
            <li> Tangled my hair and dried it out.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be old, it smelled weird.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks, and</li>
            <li> but I am tired of buying all of these various name brand shampoos and conditioners that stink and have a ton of product in them that I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> I typically found my skin and hair either dry or feeling weak, so I decided to give shampoo&#x27;s like this one a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s curlier than usual and doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> Usually if I use a moisturizing shampoo for the color, it weighs my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone wanting smoother, less frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I followed with my usual Keihl&#x27;s brand sunflower conditioner for color-treated hair and other usual styling products.  </li>
            <li> Other shampoos would leave my hair in awful conditions given the many chemicals they tend to contain.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very thick and a little goes a LONG way</li>
            <li> and I am extremely sensitive to the usual bad chemicals found in regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> and i have had problems as late with loosing hair due to stress</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s not a strong smell either.</li>
            <li> I have never used a shampoo before that made such a dramatic difference after one use.</li>
            <li> and I started experiencing strange scalp issues, I assumed it was from all the crazy chemicals in regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> That doesnt mean that other people wont like it..</li>
            <li> I have long very thick hair</li>
            <li> This makes it very difficult to find hair products that work for my whole head.</li>
            <li> I have colored curly thin hair which was damaged and frizzy for a long time.</li>
            <li> I blow dried and styled as usual.  </li>
            <li> I had a few tangles, but nothing close to usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also expensive, so I try to use as little as possible to prolong the life of my bottles</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I soon noticed that the shampoo made my scalp itch painfully and the conditioning oils seemed to build up until after a while, my hair wasn&#x27;t soft and shiny anymore but instead weighed down and slightly greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I walked to Walmart and purchased Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative shampoo/conditioner with sea kelp and Argan Oil</li>
            <li> I walked to Walmart and purchased Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative shampoo/conditioner with sea kelp and Argan Oil</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with it, but it makes my hair look thin, straight and damaged.</li>
            <li> This made my hair dry, frizzy and unhealthy.</li>
            <li> and I’m estimating there is AT LEAST 80% less of</li>
            <li> I have dry and thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was super annoying that day.</li>
            <li> As it&#x27;s been a very cold winter (we live on the east coast) and my hair has been dry and with using this shampoo just once I did not need to use any conditioner at all.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair &amp; scalp out plus the chemicals dilute the oils to the point where there is no smell so obviously this product is NOT a safe organic alternative, just another product with fake reviews.</li>
            <li> How hard is it to add a little vanilla scent?</li>
            <li> My scalp became red dry and scratchy and I developed terrible dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product with very little expectation, once i use the product its absolutely&lt;br</li>
            <li> have very little dandruff</li>
            <li> It lathers with very little shampoo needed, cleanses well and leaves my hair feeling silky.</li>
            <li> I have dark thick hair and my hair was looking dull and lifeless</li>
            <li> This shampoo really makes my hair thicker, I was recommended it by a friend who told me that sulfates cause some people bad reactions that make your hair fall out.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use various oils to moisturize my scalp once a week for an entire day, even though this has some of those oils, this shampoo messed up my scalp. :-(</li>
            <li> My hair looked ok, but I was miserable all day at work.</li>
            <li> I usually use Tresemme but never felt like it did anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is already healthy, but I have terrible allergies and skin sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> and you need a small amount of product to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month (along with the silk 18 conditioner) and in this time it has cleared the seborrheic dermatitis that I&#x27;ve had on my scalp for the past 20 years without any creams or awful-smelling medicated shampoos.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t usually pay attention to what I buy when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure why it started happening</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair had been falling off in dramatically for the past year as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of this shampoo yet.</li>
            <li> up until this past year.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam up like ordinary shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t have sulfate.</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> It has nearly driven me crazy with the burning.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve tried Jason and Nature Gate products</li>
            <li> Having the slick</li>
            <li> I would probably want to use the conditioner also, as I usually use both on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is pointless to buy.</li>
            <li> just a small amount</li>
            <li> After trying several different brands of shampoo and being disappointed, I did a Google search for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo and found MapleHolistics Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> This shampoo takes all the past gunk out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have the same results.  </li>
            <li> After I air dried my hair felt a bit icky.</li>
            <li> I have been having hair problems for a while now from shedding excessively to having my hair become a dull/brittle color.</li>
            <li> Usually after just one or 2 days I see flakes.</li>
            <li> If you wash your hair every day, this may be a bit pricey for how small it</li>
            <li> but it does the job for the small amount</li>
            <li> All shampoos that I had used in the past, even using shampoo for colored hair has faded my hair each time I washed my hair .  </li>
            <li> After using Argan Oil Shampoo just one time, my hair has been softer to the touch, and no more waking up with wild and crazy hair in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> really dried out my hair!</li>
            <li> No more frizz either.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a highly-rated &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; product, but no more.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is it made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> The last products I used were the store brand of a certain health food grocery store chain that were awful.</li>
            <li> I need very little, and don&#x27;t have to shampoo as often (hair that is thick, and past my shoulders).</li>
            <li> I am constantly playing with it now, which is a big deal since I hate my hair.</li>
            <li> Since I have to take this medication the rest of my life, I have gone from product to product, drugstore brand to expensive brands to prescription brands, at least 15 different products.</li>
            <li> My hair is hard to manage (think Einstein hair), so I usually have knots in my hair which I have to untangle before blow drying.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong artificial fragrance on this product, which is what I want, so that it won&#x27;t conflict with the perfume or essential oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that this Argan shampoo left my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> After using a few times, I realized it&#x27;s a little drying for my hair, nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t really like it and was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I eventually did something wrong because my hair changed from pin-straight manageable hair to dry, brittle, UNmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> but I am sad to say that it made my hair dry and after shampooing</li>
            <li> and I eventually did something wrong because my hair changed from pin-straight manageable hair to dry, brittle, UNmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair and after week 6, my hair starts to look orangie and dull</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave the color looking dull.</li>
            <li> After using their JUNK conditioner, I still had a hard time combing it out.  </li>
            <li> Also my hair didnt feel hard or stringy after.</li>
            <li> It felt hard and drying as I attempted to distribute it through my hair.</li>
            <li> It is hard to run my fingers through my hair when rinsing without feeling like my fingers catch and pull on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder length hair and had a hard time rinsing out the shampoo, my hair was so matted.  </li>
            <li> I saw that other reviews stated that the results from using this shampoo were horrible and left their hair dry.</li>
            <li> I recently was in a predicament as I was using Fundamental&#x27;s shampoo and the last bottle I got wreaked of eucalyptus that dried out my hair and scalp terribly.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product sucks.</li>
            <li> it just makes my head/scalp feel icky to use all those chemicals.</li>
            <li> Every product has caused burning of my scalp at least until it dries, then itches thereafter.</li>
            <li> im a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; fanatic.</li>
            <li> Personally, I would prefer a bit stronger of a scent just because I like the aroma therapy effect I can get in the shower with a stronger scented shampoo, but all of those have a lot of chemicals, dyes, and artificial perfumes in them.</li>
            <li> At least not for mine</li>
            <li> and my roots don&#x27;t get that icky oil feel.</li>
            <li> Wavy with some curls when air dried and not too thick or thin.</li>
            <li> It would always take me at least 15 minutes to comb through my hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, curly, and somewhat frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy hair and psoriasis on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wavy hair and follow the shampoo with the Silk 18 conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Before, I combed thru my hair slowly, petrified after seeing with each pass strands of frayed hair in the comb.</li>
            <li> It works to my thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this product does wonders.</li>
            <li> I have always had thick poofy wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy and color processed hair.  </li>
            <li> Thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> People tell me how thick my hair looks, and even my hairdresser told me that my hair got thicker.</li>
            <li> no more itchy or flaky scalp!</li>
            <li> This small bottle lasted me four months!</li>
            <li> No more wasteful spending!</li>
            <li> In the mean time, I wanted to get some shampoo to help with my color treated hair, and I found this one on the Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This has never happened before – and I mean never.</li>
            <li> No more frizz!  </li>
            <li> I bought it to try for myself in spite of the polar opposite reviews it&#x27;s gotten and the fact that the one star reviews were so bad!</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t know, pig hair is very coarse and unpleasant).</li>
            <li> my hair is soft but it looks like almost all my strands are separated like a broom :(.</li>
            <li> Once the digital perm faded, my hair was frizzier than ever and impossible to style.</li>
            <li> Bought it for the girlfriend who suffers from dry and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> The price is ridiculous for such a bad product.</li>
            <li> I think the only downside is the smell--which isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Not a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Not a good smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe not good for colored hair.</li>
            <li> I do not have thick hair nor thin hair</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very thin and after a few surgeries - any anesthesia&#x27;s, it got even thinner.</li>
            <li> I use it now only as a body wash :(</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty awful.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, course and wavy as well as color-treated.</li>
            <li> Very thick lather.  </li>
            <li> bit about my hair -- it is shoulder-length and very, very thick and wavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this shampoo is bad, because I like the way my hair feels, but it is not necessarily good for colored hair due to the process to wash.  </li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell bad at all but is a bit rough during application.  </li>
            <li> My dandruff got worse and my scalp itched.</li>
            <li> but overtime you hair can start rejecting it and poor outcomes can result.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with thin hair all my life (63 years).  </li>
            <li> but I also have thin hair so that must help.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with hair products irritating my scalp by causing bumps and itchiness and/or drying it out.</li>
            <li> Ive broken plenty combs &amp; when my hair is braided its take 2 people.</li>
            <li> I have thin and silky hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a couple weeks and my falling hair decreased, so I recommended it to all my family, my sister in law and my cousins.</li>
            <li> Really the worst shampoo I have ever tried</li>
            <li> So tired of all the chemicals, etc.</li>
            <li> The smell is also not great.  </li>
            <li> I think this makes my hair feel worse than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used other than the Tru Moroccan Argan oil Shampoo which is just as bad.</li>
            <li> No better than anything I already bought at WalMart which is really disappointing</li>
            <li> I usually wake up with unhappy hair that is begging for hair wash.</li>
            <li> I like wearing black shirts, but I have always had really bad dandruff that shows up on the collar and can see flakes in my hair.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep trying a little while longer hoping my hair just needed to adjust, I didnt get bad overnight</li>
            <li> In fact, I also bought the Maple Holistics Degrease shampoo because I&#x27;ll get bad build up every few months</li>
            <li> hair is usually soft and shine but using this product for couple of times made it look horrible and lifeless..</li>
            <li> But for me a white girl it didn&#x27;t work and my hair still felt dirty after :(</li>
            <li> Sadly, all promises have been broken, until I met Maple Holistics&#x27; Argan Oil Shampoo.</li>
            <li> A family member has chemical sensitivity and it is almost impossible to find a shampoo that has no kind of smell.  </li>
            <li> My hair did weird things.  </li>
            <li> Im obsessed with the scent.</li>
            <li> and then I just mentioned that I received the wrong bottle accidentally and what Amazon had said I&#x27;d have to do correct the issue myself.</li>
            <li> expensive salon shampoos</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, about a month ago, my itchy hives returned with a vengeance.</li>
            <li> Some organic stuff can be outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> I even tried some on my 4-year-old granddaughter&#x27;s thin, fly-away baby hair, and even she noticed!  </li>
            <li> BUT ... You can never go wrong with originals.</li>
            <li> sad.</li>
            <li> But sadly this didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> Just a bit expensive</li>
            <li> it just made my hair feel weird once I got it on.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Ill keep shoppin for something that i would use instead of just looin at it sittin in my shower..</li>
            <li> if my hair was supposed to feel like a weird texture or not.</li>
            <li> After switching to an expensive salon color, I thought I would research this again and found this product.  </li>
            <li> It also has a weird smell, kinda like plastic.</li>
            <li> Then, for the last year, I&#x27;ve had a horribly itchy and flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> My husband thinks I am weird because I spend a lot of time just petting my hair now</li>
            <li> I know this is weird but may be its just because i used the shampoo wrong?</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Worse than aveda shedding!!!&lt;br /&gt;Reason #4 is that this stuff stinks, literally!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the bottle especially, hard to get shampoo out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my scalp reacted badly to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have crazy amount of hair loss while shampooing</li>
            <li> It does not have any artificial scent which is one of the strengths of this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t have any artificial flavor.</li>
            <li> ~ I do use cold water.  </li>
            <li> And a few months after her birth my hair became my worst nightmare.</li>
            <li> Had to condition it like crazy afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I’m now afraid to use anything still in  my bathroom</li>
            <li> I have never been steered so wrong on Amazon!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this brand!</li>
            <li> This product was horrible and dried my hair out really bad.</li>
            <li> Unpleasant smell, did not like this product at all.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because she has very difficult hair.</li>
            <li> It has a very faint smell which I prefer as I don&#x27;t like my hair smelling like fruits or anything like that.</li>
            <li> but nothing that would be bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> and I thought I would forever be that girl with the really bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s bad for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Reason</li>
            <li> and I thought I would forever be that girl with the really bad</li>
            <li> It might not have been a bad idea if it had contained some conditioning material.</li>
            <li> My hair has been drier, fluffier in a bad way...</li>
            <li> Frustrated and worried, I threw away the remaining 30%.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my scalp so itchy :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly disappointed, I do not recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> But this shampoo and you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, because the Honey and Vanilla aroma is nonexistent.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> Bought this product after reading reviews on how it helped some people with their psoriasis but was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t help mine.</li>
            <li> Disappointed after reading all the reviews.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m really disappointed in the scent (or lack thereof).</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting a peach/almond scent but felt disappointed that this was anything</li>
            <li> very unhappy shampoo does not lather well</li>
            <li> I used to HATE washing my hair.</li>
            <li> That was a terrible disappointment.</li>
            <li> I honestly hated it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated my hair...</li>
            <li> Really really disappointed with it, gonna through it to the garbage !  </li>
            <li> As a mother and house wife it helps me manage my hair even on its worst days!</li>
            <li> I want to preface my review by saying that I&#x27;ve had a terrible dandruff problem for decades.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> I actually do hate this stuff!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reason #3 is that I shed hair for days after one shampoo with this crap!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible to me!</li>
            <li> Terrible</li>
            <li> The WORST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!!!  </li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was horrible.</li>
            <li> And even after the awful more-hair-in-the-drain-than-on-your-head phase was done my hair still felt like straw in a barn.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Just terrible hair!!</li>
            <li> SO this is just awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It cleanses well n keeps the hair well moisturized . I m loving my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a short hair but very dry and rough. Everyday in the morning, combing is a big nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the roughness and sleeping through the night, it becomes stiff and standing and it becomes next to impossible to make them flat&lt;br /&gt;and nicely combed condition. The only way is to shampoo everyday. To Make it more understandable, I don&#x27;t have the habit of rinsing my hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;After I started Argan Oil Shampoo by MapleHolistics, the rough hair started becoming smooth and no more stiffening in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mapleholistics for making such a wonderful Product.</li>
            <li> This is my new shampoo!  I will be ordering again.  I have always been a Pantene/Herbal Essence kind of girl, but using this shampoo has shown me the benefits of using a higher quality product.  My hair looked so much better after just one wash with this product.  I love that I am avoiding sulfates with this product as well.</li>
            <li> I use this with Argan Oil conditioner, love the combo, smooth, silky hair, no sulfates</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny after using this shampoo.  It is very affordable and arrived in a short amt. of time.</li>
            <li> I tried the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; route for my hair but everything seems to make my hair really oily and eventually devolves into dandruff which I&#x27;ve never had before. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo with the associated conditioner for a couple of weeks now and so far I am delighted. I wear my hair up and under a cap for work so I don&#x27;t bother to wash it throughout the week. It isn&#x27;t until the 5th day that my hair starts to go limp and get oily and when I wash it it feels fantastic. I have baby fine hair but lot&#x27;s of it and this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, probably just a quarter sized blob of the both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> At first I think it&#x27;s very sticky in my hair but if you leave it long enough and pair it with the silk 8 conditioner it works best with the conditioner. My hair is very smooth Afterwards I love it!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it makes it feel so much thicker.</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo works wonderful. I usually only my hair once or twice a week, and I only wash it after I&#x27;ve done a oil treatment on my hair, so I have had none of the over drying issues some others seem to have. It actually lathers really well, which is something i haven&#x27;t found to be true with many shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian American and had thick, black, straightish-wavy-ish hair until after my pregnancy, when sections of my hair started curling more and other sections became stick straight. It became frizzy and unmanageable, and so I tried a digital perm which left my hair beautiful and wavy... for about 2 months. Once the digital perm faded, my hair was frizzier than ever and impossible to style. My dandruff got worse and my scalp itched.The only shampoo that kept my dandruff at bay was Head and Shoulders. My hair did weird things.  This shampoo stopped all of that. It immediately stopped the dandruff and my hair feels so much softer and manageable. Not only am I looking forward to growing out my hair again, but I feel like my scalp is healthier and not as stripped.  Other basics: The smell is pretty neutral: no perfumey scents so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, probably best to stick with the Herbal Essences. I have about shoulder-length hair and I wash my hair maybe every other day and use only about a quarter-sized dollop. My shampoo arrived March 6th, and by 4/17, I had gone through maybe 40% of the bottle; so it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but so worth it. I&#x27;d absolutely buy in bulk :)</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, first time using a sulfate free product and I can already tell the difference, it seems like my hair is softer and just feels better overall.  Same with my scalp, it just feels less irritated after using this shampoo.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after looking at several shampoos that were sulfate-free and this one just sounded right after reading the ingredients. Apparently I made the right choice. My wife ravs about her hair now everyday since beginning to use this product. She says her hair has never felt so soft and she is right it just feels so light and soft. Great great shampoo!! Will definitely be purchasing again. The praises of best husband ever are nice to hear as well!</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Gentle and effective. No chemicals to worry about. Pleasant mild aroma.</li>
            <li> LOVE! I recently was in a predicament as I was using Fundamental&#x27;s shampoo and the last bottle I got wreaked of eucalyptus that dried out my hair and scalp terribly. I contacted the company and they said they would send me samples next month. I was like okay, then you&#x27;re losing my business. So I hopped on Amazon.com to look for a new all natural shampoo that won&#x27;t bother my extremely sensitive skin. I found this Argan oil shampoo and so far I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it. My scalp is getting back to normal. I love the smell and my hair is very manageable. I&#x27;m now purchasing the conditioner, too!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a homeopathic shampoo with no sulfates and BPA free.  Because of a recent illness, I&#x27;m doing my best to use homeopathic &amp; all-natural products.  Because of the many good reviews, I decided to try this shampoo along with Maple Holistics&#x27; Silk 18 conditioner (also homeopathic &amp; BPA free).  These products are both great!!!  With very little shampoo, you get lots of good suds and the conditioner detangles with just slight finger-work.  Both have pleasant aromas.  I like them both so much that I already ordered another pair.</li>
            <li> After trying various shampoos and being left disappointed, I wanted to try something natural. I searched amazon for a a natural and organic shampoo that had good reviews and found Maple Holistics! I ordered the argan shampoo with hopes that it would leave my hair feeling clean and healthy without the heavy or greasy residue that some other shampoos leave.  I have been searching for hair products that are also gentle to my skin; I seem to always break out when I use unnatural shampoos and conditioners.  I am so happy with this product.  My hair feels truly clean after using the argan shampoo and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since! I highly suggest the argan shampoo.  I stopped using conditioner completely to narrow down what was causing my breakouts. Since I have had such good luck with Maple Holistics shampoo, I hope to now pair it with the Silk Conditioner!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m in love with this shampoo! my hair looks alive. wish i found it earlier!!!!</li>
            <li> Finding a sulfate free shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat and lifeless is next to impossible. I ordered this shampoo hoping it would different. My hair has volume, feels clean, and my scalp isn&#x27;t irritated BC of no sulfate. This shampoo smells great and really nourishes your hair root to tip!</li>
            <li> Smells really nice and gentle. Feels good on the finger and on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this shampoo is not color safe at least with Just for Men color.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, soft shiny hair and no itchy scalp/</li>
            <li> I used this product twice since receiving it in the mail. My hair feels a lot cleaner and lighter than it did using other shampoo products. Feels a bit glue like and smells odd but it works good.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo along with the Sage shampoo from the same company. Like the other type, you need very minimal product to get a really rice lather. I love how these shampoos are all natural and none of those harsh chemicals. It left my hair moisturized and with less fly-aways. It also kept my curls after I let it go from a bun. If you prefer a more sleek and rich shampoo, you would like the argan oil shampoo. I prefer the sage one due to its extra benefits for the scalp. Overall, amazing brand!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is definately worth buying...smells great and cleans well!</li>
            <li> Leave my hair a little dry but extremely soft</li>
            <li> this shampoo leaves my hair soft &amp; silky, but not weighed down. smells nice too. I plan on trying some of the other products.</li>
            <li> Amazing and its soapy!</li>
            <li> Not quite sure if it&#x27;s this or the batiste dry shampoo that&#x27;s giving me dandruff, which I NEVER get when using regular shampoo. Has no scent either, wish it smelled delicious like the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and I love it. It smells very good and doesn&#x27;t take much to wash your hair. My hair was really shiny and smooth after using it. After reading other reviews I am glad I purchased this product! I will definately be buying from this company again. I like all the natural products they use in this product as well.</li>
            <li> Nice natural product. Looking forward to try other products from same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> Sweet smell, makes my hair appear smoother and shiner. I hope it can help aid my fight with thinning hair!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It leaves your hair clean but doesn&#x27;t strip your hair. My hair is so soft and silky feeling. This is my go to shampoo. I will never be without it!!!  I only wish that it would come with a pump.In order to get the product out easier. Great product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I started using back in November 2014, and my hair is growing in thicker now. I have very fine hair, and it dries out easily with styling. This, along with a collagen hydrolysate supplement, is making a difference.</li>
            <li> I have never been nice to my hair and thought it was time for a change. I read about sulfate-free shampoos and then searched on amazon. This product was reviewed highly and in my personal opinion thinks the ratings were spot on. This shampoo lathers up so nicely! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and I think it&#x27;s doing wonders for my hair. My hair is softer, it doesn&#x27;t feel like straw anymore, no greasiness after a couple of days. My family and friends have noticed that I keep my hair down more often now rather then in a messy bun. I&#x27;m sold. I will be ordering more of this product. Do something nice for your hair!</li>
            <li> I have been only using this shampoo for a week and I already feel and see the improvement on the texture and the look of my hair. I absolutely love this!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely outstanding. my hair feels great! I have normal hair and leaves my hair feeling and looking soft and smooth. Most importantly it feels healthy!</li>
            <li> The Shampoo is light, smells great, and doent feel overwelming on my hair. I love this Shampoo. Natural is the best way to go, and this natural shampoo beats them all!</li>
            <li> The product lathers really well for not having any lathering agents (unnatural anyways), but it leaves my hair very squeaky dry like. I have to use the conditioner after. Not sure I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels very nice and soft.  I really love this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Started with the Hydrate but switched to this one. Impressed with how soft hair felt after the first wash and not stripped at all! First sulphate-free shampoo that has worked well and I use it with Silk18 Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will provide more update in a few days.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It is simply the best I have ever used for my curly, somewhat frizzy hair. You only need to use a very small amount it and it feels so silky on your hair. I left it on about 5 minutes and for the first time in a long time I did not use conditioner because I wanted to see what the shampoo did for my hair without conditioner. I did not blow dry as usual either and let it air dry. My hair is curly without the frizz and feels so soft to the touch. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo twice so far (along with the 18 silk conditioner) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I wash my hair every other day, and by the morning of the second day, my scalp would be incredibly oily and itchy. That does not happen anymore! My hair is now super shiny and because I have an ombre, the sulfate-free aspect of the shampoo is also helpful. I&#x27;m also very careful with my colored ends, and the shampoo can be a bit drying. So, if you have extremely dry hair, I&#x27;d say this shampoo is not for you. If you have oily scalp and dry ends, you can make this work. The conditioner is wonderful, and it works well with the shampoo (and I also apply a leave in conditioner and some finishing serum after I blow dry). I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Well, yes, a woman did recommend this shampoo when she noticed me surreptiously scratching my itchy scalp ( very nonchalantly I thought ) but, hey, I listened didn&#x27;t I...and realty glad that I did!  This is, without doubt, the best product that I have ever used and no more itchy scalp...even my miniature dachshund likes it!  This shampoo is just a miracle in a bottle for me...no more itchy or flaky scalp!</li>
            <li> - Affordable: I don&#x27;t have to use much shampoo to get a good lather (long, thick hair).&lt;br /&gt;- Sulfate free, Natural/free of those funky hard to read chemical ingredients, Jojoba and almond oils&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans my straight, thick hair without making it over dried or frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;- Also works well for my husband&#x27;s curly, fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t weight his hair down or make it frizz.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times because I shampoo once a week or once every 2 weeks, but when I have used it I love it. It is sulphate free and full of moisturizing oils which is a huge plus! I am a very natural, chemical free, and holistic person and this fits the bill for me.</li>
            <li> I tried this productout and i loved it, dont use conditoner anymore. my hair feels better and even looks heailther. it kinda has an odd smell to it but nothing that would be bad. i definitly love using this stuff im glad i started using this stuff, also my hair isnt as oily as it would be the next day if i didnt wash it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I love it! The natural ingredients make me feel great about using it and it does wonders for my hair! I highly recommend this product. As a mother and house wife it helps me manage my hair even on its worst days! Less frizz smoother hair and I feel good about using it too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It does clean well. The scent is kind of a soapy scent, not like honey/vanilla at all, but the smell does not stay in my hair. After using a few times, I realized it&#x27;s a little drying for my hair, nothing dramatic. I mixed in about a teaspoon of fractionated coconut oil into the bottle, and it&#x27;s still a little drying for my hair. I will probably try Maple Holistics&#x27; shampoo for dry hair and scalp next and see if that works better for my hair.</li>
            <li> First things first, this shampoo does its job by getting my hair clean. I recently received the Silk 18 conditioner and fell in love with it so I decided to get the Argan Oil Shampoo. It&#x27;s a little pricy for its size (8 oz) but its quality makes up for that. The only REAL complaint I have with this conditioner is the fact that it is very drying. Other than that, I would recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Pleasant smell and it leaves your hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I have bleach blonde hair, and was previously using a salon quality shampoo. This shampoo destroyed my hair. It takes a lot of it to feel like my hair is even getting clean, but it also leaves my hair very dried out and tangly. Even my boyfriend who has unprocessed hair experienced the same issues with this. I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo not knowing what to expect since I&#x27;ve never used a homeopathic / all natural shampoo. Being a guy I usually use a shampoo conditioner combo product which works ok for me. The first time I tried the shampoo and left it in my hair like it said I felt a tingling sensation which felt kind of nice. It left my hair very soft and shiny which my wife and daughter even commented about. My wife tried it and now she loves it and has decided to switch to this shampoo. Just so the women know - my wife is very particular about her shampoo / hair care products so for her to switch products is a very big deal.</li>
            <li> I have to say this shampoo is amazing! Im obsessed with the scent. It is amazing!! Has natural essential oils such as tea tree,lavender,and argan oil and vanilla and honey!!love it!</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo, and also the Maple Holistics Conditioner with vanilla!! I am a med student and I read the labels on every single thing I buy. I totally endorse this product as one of the best, if not, the best, natural shampoo and conditioner manufacturer. Their products are easy and have made my super thick long blonde hair shinier, longer and I have a reduced number of split ends. I have reordered several times and I&#x27;m going to buy again today!</li>
            <li> Wow this a no BS product it is great my long curly hair loves it</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to products-like the canary in the coal mine. I love this product and the way it makes the hair shine and is easy to style.</li>
            <li> Not only was the shampoo excellent on my hair, the smell was nice and the shampoo rich.  The customer service is excellent and on top of things.  The bottle was packaged well so nothing leaked.  I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> After researching and reading reviews for a dozen different natural shampoos, this was top 5 on my list, so I purchased it. Astonishingly, my hair started falling after first use. I figured maybe my shedding was due to something else, so I used this 3 more times over the course of two weeks, but my hair did not stop falling out. Frustrated and worried, I threw away the remaining 30%. I really had high hopes and was confident I was buying an all natural, high quality product, but it turned out to be a bad experience. My hair aren&#x27;t long either, I have short 2.5 inch hair strands. I use various oils to moisturize my scalp once a week for an entire day, even though this has some of those oils, this shampoo messed up my scalp. :-(</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I ever used! it made my hair feel so soft and shiny. I would recommend any shampoo from this company! Thank you</li>
            <li> I was surprised of how clean my scalp feels after using this product. I love it</li>
            <li> No better than a regular shampoo, and smells funny to boot.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the Silk conditioner and Maple Holistics. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This makes my scalp itch and I found it leave residue on my scalp even though I carefully washed to make sure all of shampoo are off.  Not a good shampoo.  but I did like the conditioner though.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to help my sensitive/dry scalp like I was hoping it would. I do like the conditioner that I purchased with it though. Will continue searching for a shampoo that works for my dry scalp. I used baby shampoo for a while but even that seemed to irritate my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed.  I have extremely dry and frizzy hair and have tried so many products to no avail.  This makes my hair so soft, silky, full, and no frizz!  Thank you Maple Holistics.  I just started using it now if it starts making my hair thicker I&#x27;d be on cloud nine!</li>
            <li> I find it bizarre that this product claims to be natural and good for your hair (free of the &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; etc.), yet the ingredients list shows that it contains &amp;#34;Acrylates Copolymer&amp;#34; which is definitely NOT natural and I highly doubt it is good for you or your hair. As quoted from an external website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer is a synthetic polymer used as a film former in cosmetics and personal care products that has opaque properties and is seen in a variety of formulas, including those for sunscreens and other lotions, according to CosmeticsCop.com. Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer has large molecules that do not penetrate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer is CIR approved with concentration limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safety Measures/Side Effects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer is listed as a moderate hazard ingredient by the Cosmetics Database. The EWG notes contamination concerns including methacrylic acid, a potential toxin and carcinogen; acrylic acid, a human respiratory toxicant, known toxin and potential carcinogen; and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, a known immune syste, human lung and skin toxicant. It is, however, &amp;#34;Considered safe based on assumption of low absorption.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Together with the conditioner, which I also love, my hair is super soft and shiny. The scent is very subtle. My hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. My hair is naturally very thin and after a few surgeries - any anesthesia&#x27;s, it got even thinner. I am trying to avoid &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; chemicals in a cleaning and personal hygiene products as much as possible. Using this product  makes a big different on my hair. I will recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> For 2 years, I experimented with making my own shampoos and conditioners in an attempt to limit my exposure to chemicals in my home.  I had some success, but I just never found a recipe that I was sold on.  I finally gave up the project and believed that I would have to settle for expensive, overly scented, toxic shampoos once again if I ever wanted to have beautiful and manageable hair.  I was so excited and relieved when I found this!  I was comfortable with the ingredient list, and then once I used it, I was happy with the lack of a fake fragrance.  It has the lather that I missed for those 2 years of my own concoctions, and it cleaned my hair nicely.  I used the Silk 18 conditioner immediately after, so I do not know how the shampoo performs on its own, but I love the combination of the two.  I wash my hair every three days, and on the 3rd day I use a little bit of dry shampoo.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to was my hair every day!  I&#x27;ll be using this combo for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and fuzzy. this product is very moisturizing, that is what I am looking for. And it smells good too. just the bottle is smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> Its been a week since I am using this shampoo and my hair feels good...earlier my hair used to feel dried out and lacked life....it did not become shining(though its too early) but i dont feel dry any more..and they have become soft as well...i like touching them now :) i would definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I have tried various products for my dry and damaged hair. I have curly hair and I have treated it with various straightening chemicals/processes. This made my hair dry, frizzy and unhealthy. I read about benefits of argon oil and after extensive research, I ordered this product. I am very happy with this product as this has reduced frizz on my hair and my hair softer and easy to manage. I am delighted that this works well on my 6 year-old-daughter&#x27;s hair too. It has made her long hair tangle-free, easy to manage and less painful while brushing. I have also noticed less hair loss both while washing and brushing with this shampoo. I use this product with the Silk18 conditioner. This combination has worked perfect for me!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my scalp itch just hours after using it. Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to some ingredient. My hair looked ok, but I was miserable all day at work. It&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> It cleans well, leaves my hair without buildup and smells very pleasant. It does work well in my blond highlighted hair and I want to try the conditioner as well for even better results.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for over a month and I absolutely love it! My hair looks and feels healthier, shinier and stronger. I have seen a significant decrease in scalp buildup and my hair stays cleaner for a longer amount of time. Overall, the health of my hair has improved and I feel like it has been restored to how it naturally was (also I have noted less frizz and dryness). Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love the scent, very light.  And it makes my hair full and bouncy... love it!!</li>
            <li> Great for any type hair, very good for dry scalp, and is not anything as in the way of fragrance as I could tell. Would definitely try.</li>
            <li> 1.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I was very satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;3.  I will be purchasing it again within the next 90 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Dandruff control!&lt;br /&gt;I am an African American male, 48 years old, and I rock a mini “fro”. I like wearing black shirts, but I have always had really bad dandruff that shows up on the collar and can see flakes in my hair.  Today, I asked a relative to check my collar and hair today and she verified what I already knew, the dandruff is so much better, she says she’s never seen it this dandruff free before. I have to really scratch to get any dandruff to fall and the dandruff that did fall today is very fine and I’m estimating there is AT LEAST 80% less of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Lather!&lt;br /&gt;I’ve tried a lot of natural dandruff shampoos; very few of them actually give me a satisfying lather. The instructions say to use a quarter sized amount, now I don’t get great lather on the first application.  But, on the second application it really does lather up as well as a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo. I believe this is because my hair is so thick its not wet enough until after that first rinse and I use a lot more with my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smell (or lack thereof).&lt;br /&gt;I would expect a shampoo made from all these natural ingredients to have a nice healthy smell, but Argan doesn’t seem to have any smell at all. I’m not really concerned about this though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Dry Hair!&lt;br /&gt;OK, so this is the only real issue I have,  This shampoo really dries out my hair and makes it hard.  Since it does such a great job on the dandruff, I can live with that, but I might try their conditioner on my next order. I never use conditioner, but maybe I should start, but again, the shampoo I was using didn&#x27;t dry out my hair like the Argan does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price.&lt;br /&gt;When I first received the product, I thought it was an awfully small bottle for $13.  However, I have now used the product for 10 days (that’s 20 quarter sized applications) and it’s a little more than a third gone, so I estimate I will get just a tick less than 50 applications of it.  Considering the results, I can’t really complain about the price, not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, just so you know, lately I use the Argan shampoo a little differently than the instructions say.  On my second application, I lather up real good, let it sit for three minutes, but I don’t rinse with water.  I just squeeze off the excess with my hand and let the residue kind drip dry. I figure if some of it sits there all day, that’s fine with me, my hair is thick you wouldn&#x27;t notice it anyway.  I wonder if the Sage shampoo for heavy dandruff has a good Spikenard smell to it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Shampoo!  I was looking for something that would be good on my color treated hair, clean, add moisture, and would feel like it was actually cleaning my hair without stripping it..  This product sure did the trick!  Thank you Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> I have been researching about the chemical effects of shampoo on our body and since only used natural products. This is my second order of Argan shampoo and it leaves me feeling satisfied and safe. the reason why I am giving 4 stars instead of five is because the cap of the shampoo has a slight leakage when tilted even though it is closed and sealed otherwise the contents itself deserves five stars. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the argan oil shampoo and silk 18 conditioner about a  month and a half ago and wanted to make sure to use it for a while before reviewing to make sure I had a good idea.  Before going into details on the product I wanted to give a little history.  Ive had some serious health issues recently and between sickness and medications my easy to manage hair became brittle, greasy, and seriously thin.  My scalp became red dry and scratchy and I developed terrible dandruff.  For the last 9 months ive been trying to find a solution and finally came across this stuff.  At first it didnt seem to be working well my hair seemed more brittle and became greasy faster.  I decided to keep trying a little while longer hoping my hair just needed to adjust, I didnt get bad overnight so it likely wouldnt get better overnight.  After about 3 weeks I started seeing an improvement.  Less red scratchy skin, less dandruff and stronger hair.  Even my hairdresser commented when I went in last that my hair was stronger and my scalp less irritated.  After a month and a half I continue seeing improvement and feel much better.  I definitely recommend this stuff and suggest giving it time if you don&#x27;t see results right away.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice since receiving it in the mail. My hair feels a lot cleaner and lighter than it did using other shampoo products. I usually use Tresemme but never felt like it did anything for my hair. Though, I was skeptical about this since I have allergies and always have a reaction to natural products, so far so good! But I guess time will tell if there is a difference in my hair that is why I am not giving this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this all natural product. I have coarse wavy hair and I noticed when I use this shampoo paired with silk 18 conditioner and its a 10 with keratin leave in conditioner that my hair dries quicker and smoother. Overall great product! Will be ordering again :)</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling very soft and it has great lather for a sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-sulfate natural shampoo, when I found this one. Not much to say - it&#x27;s just perfect. Hair feels cleaner and lighter than using my previous shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels amazing! What I needed for living in the desert.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a while and I love it. It leaves my hair squeaky clean, smooth, and shiny. I also use their sage shampoo.So, I ordered the second one + conditioner. Great product. Great customer service. You never lose your money</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! I could notice a difference after just one use. I am a perpetual hair straightener (daily) and this product has completely changed my hair. It is more manageable, less straw-like, and has more life to it. I use in combination with Silk 18 from the same company. The bottle size is small but a little goes a long way. I use about a quarter size in my hair of each and that is plenty. I have shoulder length hair. I have noticed less shedding in the shower as well. I cannot say enough about this product but certainly recommend it!!! A+++</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brands. Love this stuff. And it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t come with a big price tag either!</li>
            <li> I gave 5 stars for this product strictly for maple holistics customer service.  I received the wrong bottle of shampoo instead of this one on accident by Amazon (they fulfilled the order not maple holistics) and was going to have to send the wrong one back and wait for my refund and then reorder myself the correct bottle that I ordered originally. This was a little bit of a hassle for me since it wasn&#x27;t my fault at all so I just said whatever I&#x27;ll keep the shampoo I didn&#x27;t order and wait until a later time to order the shampoo I really wanted. Well in the meantime a rep from maple holistic had sent me an email asking how I liked&lt;br /&gt;My new shampoo and making sure my ordering process went smoothly. So I emailed him back saying I loved my two bottles that I got correctly and then I just mentioned that I received the wrong bottle accidentally and what Amazon had said I&#x27;d have to do correct the issue myself. I received an email back within 24 hours saying they were so sorry for the situation and that they were going to refund the amount for the original bottle, let me keep the one that was sent in error and send me the actual product I ordered free of charge as well. That&#x27;s amazing customer service to me and I will definitely be ordering there products again. The shampoo and conditioner I already received are amazing the silk 18 conditioner smells delicious and feels divine on my hair!! Super happy with maple holistics products and customer service!!</li>
            <li> Makes my very long, thick and naturally curly hair super soft. Almost don&#x27;t have to use conditioner. But I do use the Silk 18 from the same company and LOVE it. I don&#x27;t have to use much and only wash twice a week. I rinse with hot water on the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; days. My hair feels awesome using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but will look for something else.</li>
            <li> cleans well but does not lather a bunch!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely worth every penny!  My hair is already healthy, but I have terrible allergies and skin sensitivities.  After my first use I had less itching and irritations.  And my hair has never felt this soft.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this shampoo. The lather feels silky and rich, and my hair is soft and very clean after using it. It cleans your hair and scalp thoroughly, so be prepared to use a good conditioner afterward (such as their Silk 18). But I really love how my hair looks and feels with this product!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shampoo! It&#x27;s extremely light feeling, but cleans my hair very well and doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all. My favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li> best shapoo ever my hair is so silky now</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the conditioner and was delighted by the yummy vanilla smell and natural qualities. I bought the shampoo expecting the same pleasant experience, but was immediately disappointed when I first used it and realized it smells like old food and herbs smashed up together. Not a good smell. It&#x27;s such a turn off that I can&#x27;t use the shampoo at all. Maybe I&#x27;m just picky, but in the description/ingredients it says it contains vanilla scents to give it a nice smell. My product is apparently missing it.</li>
            <li> After ordering this shampoo as a gift for my sister in law who is very health -conscious and loves organic and natural products, my husband surprised me with a bottle as well.  I was excited to try it, as I have used many different shampoos (some quite expensive) and have not found one that worked as well as I had hoped.  This shampoo leaves my hair much easier to comb and leaves it feeling soft and fresh smelling.  I use an amount the size of a quarter and this seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! My hair is so soft and smells great. I use it with the silk conditioner and couldn&#x27;t be happier with them both!</li>
            <li> Good product, cleans hair well and is natural.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and smells wonderful! People hug me and then comment on how much they love the smell of my hair all the time!  I especially want to give huge kudos to the company, Maple Holistics, for incredible customer service. I had an issue and they resolved it immediately and with the kind of c/s stores used to have 40 years ago.  I will repurchase this item from Maple Holistics no matter if somewhere else is cheaper. I may be a small purchaser, but I still want to support them by purchasing their products in gratitude for the great way their c/s worked with me!</li>
            <li> I have only used it a handful of times but so far I like it a lot. This is my first time using a natural hair shampoo and I do have to say that I like the fact that it does lather. It does dry my hair out a little but it helps if you pair it with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo, which makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very soft. I will definitely be buying ths again.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Item as described.</li>
            <li> Fabulous Shampoo!  Goodbye expensive salon shampoos hello natural good for me shampoo.  I love this shampoo and so do my teen daughters.  Our hair is soft and feels very light - not weighted down.  I find it basically unscented other then just a castille soap smell.  But, it&#x27;s nice.  I highly recommend this shampoo!  I want much larger bottles with a bulk price.  Less shipping and plastic &#x3D; smaller carbon footprint.</li>
            <li> This product was ok... I was switching to a shampoo with less chemicals and this had the highest rating so I tried it... My hair became really dry and was hard to run my finger thru... I switched to something different when I finished the bottle.</li>
            <li> It made my hair dry:( I loved that it was organic and sulfate free but just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I have very curly long black hair, and I shampoo it about two times a week. I&#x27;ve recently started using sulfate-free shampoos because they help sustain the natural oils found in my hair. I ran out of my previous brand of shampoo and stumbled upon maple holistics on amazon and thought I&#x27;d try it. I ordered the argan oil shampoo and tried it for the first time yesterday then I straightened my hair. MY HAIR WAS SO SHINY AND I DIDN&#x27;T USE ANY PRODUCT ON IT BESIDES THE SHAMPOO. I didn&#x27;t even use conditioner because I wanted to truly see how the shampoo works. The smell of the shampoo isn&#x27;t that great, but that&#x27;s probably because there are no unnecessary chemicals- you can easily notice the &#x27;natural&#x27; feeling you get from the shampoo. The product itself works like a shampoo, conditioner, leave in oil, and de-frizzer because of all the natural components.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is a milky white almost translucent color. It is worth the money and a small drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for quality shampoo and conditioner for fine, dry hair when I found this shampoo that is Sulfate free. This and the conditioner &amp;#34;Silk 18&amp;#34;  leave my hair with a salon finish. I find that I do not have to use the conditioner daily.  I have had many compliments on the fragrance which is light.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 3 weeks. I noticed my hair is softer. I was using shampoos that were too drying and my hair was really suffering. I decided to start using better, more hydrating shampoos. I thought maybe I would have to go back to conventional shampoos but the thought of all the chemicals and harmful ingredients steered me away. I found this shampoo after an amazon search. The price is reasonable. It lasts a while, you only need a little bit. The ingredients are quite benign and the results are pretty good. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair is a bit dry after using it.</li>
            <li> i love this , also bought Natural Conditioner By Maple Holistics - Sulfate Free Treatment for Dry and Damaged , i have dry ,thin fuzzy hair, always knotted, after this , no more knotted hair , only leave me smooth ,shinny! also use it on my 5 year daught &#x27;s hair, she loves  it , love the smell.1 great buy , and must buy, just love it</li>
            <li> Second order of the shampoo. Especially it is organic devoid of strong chemical in generic shampoos that one gets at superstores.&lt;br /&gt;Really happy with the finding and this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so great my hair felt so clean and soft, Thank you so much Maple Holistic,  please tray it you wont regret, ID # 114-0173554-2268229 my Address is 22 Clenning Street, Nepean Ontario, K2J 5B2, Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mayra Acosta</li>
            <li> It really does make your hair very smooth and it eliminates frizz!  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I don&#x27;t like the smell at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product! This Product and my Silk 18 shampoo make my hair feel silky and bouncy.</li>
            <li> The directions on the back of this shampoo didn&#x27;t say anything about following with a conditioner so I decided to give it a try just by itself. Usually when I use just a shampoo product by itself, my hair feels really dry and isn&#x27;t shiny at all. This product proved to be way different. I was worried because when I got out of the shower, my hair was super tangly but that is just how my hair is naturally. After brushing my hair out, I thought it felt really dry and still tangled easily, but then I decided to blow dry my hair. Afterwards, my hair was super soft and super shiny. I could not believe that my hair actually was manageable, straight, and not frizzy after only a conditioner. Next time, I will probably use some sort of detangling product, but this shampoo is great by itself and I have never been as pleased by using a shampoo alone. This is definitely worth giving a shot if you want soft, shiny, manageable hair.</li>
            <li> Make the hair very greasy</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  I purchased it because it was sulfate free.  I take a large amount of steroids for a medical condition and my hair is very dry. Using this product my hair has been very manageable.  I don&#x27;t have the frizz and I can control it</li>
            <li> Great product! My hair is soft, silky and shiny. No need for any other hair products.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair - never hold a curl either - I have to wash everyday because it looks like a grease pit if I don&#x27;t.  Well, using this Shampoo I can go three (3) days without washing!!!  I love it - my  hair has never felt and looked so good.  I would recommend this Shampoo to anyone.  Do not waste your money buying other Shampoos - get this one, trust me, you will love your hair again.</li>
            <li> its perfect for my hair! My hair were so damaged! I can see the difference after one week already! I wont buy anything else anymore!</li>
            <li> Effective in controlling my dandruff, smells great, and softens my hair. So glad I purchased this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Love the Argan oil treatment any way.  Going to order the conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I had great expectations for this product after reading the reviews. Although I liked the product I do not think it is right for me. It left my hair extremely dry and tangled.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I liked about it is that it lathers very nicely and you need a small amount of product to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly would not buy it again but it might work for another person.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft and looking silkier after just a few uses!!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo b/c of the great reviews and b/c I&#x27;m trying very hard to find a more natural shampoo for my hair. I have bought several different natural shampoos in the past, and haven&#x27;t been overly impressed, but I really like this shampoo! I have a dry scalp and thick hair that falls right below my shoulders. It does a great job cleaning my hair and doesn&#x27;t require a ton of shampoo to do it. Despite all the great oils in it, my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel oily. In fact, I can almost go longer without washing my hair since using this shampoo. I&#x27;ve also been using the Silk 18 conditioner and like it as well. Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed and happy with my purchase of this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, curly, and somewhat frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve tried literally every product out there! Any product that claimed to be sulfate-free, all natural, blah blah, etc. I&#x27;ve tried many products specialized for curly hair and EVEN the baking soda apple cider vinegar technique! But I can honestly say that I&#x27;m probably gonna stick with these products. They are inexpensive, leave my hair clean and soft, and last a long time. I think the only downside is the smell--which isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just neutral. I like having strong-scented shampoos that leave my hair smelling nice but that&#x27;s why I bought their conditioner, which smells like vanilla! :)</li>
            <li> Dried my hair &amp; scalp out plus the chemicals dilute the oils to the point where there is no smell so obviously this product is NOT a safe organic alternative, just another product with fake reviews. I used this product for over a month &amp; if anything changed about my hair it&#x27;s become more brittle now than before!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product. It makes my hair feel great and my scalp feels clean and comfortable after use. I tend to have dry hair and this product did dry my hair a bit.  I would definitely recommend this for people who do not want to put excessive chemicals in their hair.</li>
            <li> I have crazy amount of hair loss while shampooing so I ofter use baby shampoo, as natural as possible. When I saw this best seller form Amazon, I decided to give it a try. I really love the foam texture, very soft very fine. I used to purchase a foam making machine from Amazon for my old shampoo. It does give me more volume and thicken hair, somehow I feel it little frizzy and tangle.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it is caused by not applying conditioner. So I guess I may need to purchase Maple&#x27;s conditioner.</li>
            <li> To give a little background on my purchase, I am allergic to most standard shampoos. I have been unable to nail down which ingredient in particular irritates me, but every shampoo must contain it because I will break out in full body hives when I use them. I have since been experimenting with organic shampoos with partial success. I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees, which made my itching disappear entirely...but left my hair feeling oilier than before I washed it. I tried a couple products that were semi-organic (as in, they used mostly organic ingredients but were not entirely organic). For about a year that seemed to do the trick. My hair felt clean and I didn&#x27;t get itchy. Unfortunately, about a month ago, my itchy hives returned with a vengeance. In a rush I began looking into organic shampoos again, and this is my first purchase. I thought the price was relatively reasonable compared to a lot of other organic shampoos and it had great reviews. I&#x27;m not particularly into the whole organic movement, but it did concern me a bit that I still don&#x27;t know what some of the listed ingredients actually are...but as I am certainly no expert on holistics or organics, they may very well be something truly organic. I don&#x27;t know.    Pros:  1. NO ITCH so far! I have been itch-free since I began using this shampoo.  2. My hair actually feels clean...it does what shampoo is supposed to actually do!  3. It lathers pretty good. I realize without sulfates, there won&#x27;t be much lather (I have experienced this with Burt&#x27;s Bees), but I have had no trouble getting this shampoo to lather.  4. Still within the affordable range. Some organic stuff can be outrageously expensive. This is still more than I would like to spend on a shampoo, but trust me, it&#x27;s worth it to stop that itch.    Cons:  1. Smells somewhat like cardboard to me. Not a bad smell...just...boring and kind of ugh.  2. Dries my hair a bit. But I used the silk conditioner by the same company and that seems to solve this problem. The conditioner also smells something like warm vanilla sugar, so once I use that I forget all about the cardboard shampoo smell.    If any of this changes, I will update the review to reflect it, but for now, all is well and I really am overall quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> TL:DR: this is a great quality shampoo but it did not work for my hair, it might work for yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start off by saying that I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week, usually 2. I do not like to over wash my hair or use products that have harsh chemicals. I wanted to get quite a few washes in before I left a review so I can give an honest opinion of the product. I used the Argan oil shampoo in combination with their Silk18 conditioner to see how well they worked together. The Silk18 (review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R14MAU4N28P99H/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00L1KFQKC )  is amazing for my hair, the argan oil shampoo is not for my hair type. My hair is normal type, it is not straight, yet not really wavy. I do not have thick hair nor thin hair, it&#x27;s kind of in the middle. It is also mid length, just below the shoulders. It left my hair feeling very dry (even with the silk18) and brittle and left my scalp dry as well. I have used it for over a month now but each time I have the same results. The smell didn&#x27;t bother me, it smelled like standard dish soap with no hint of fruit, flower, or vanilla (smell is the last thing I care about as long as the product works well). Although this did not work for my hair, it may work for yours. I would not purchase it again and I do not plan on using what is left.</li>
            <li> It has a mild smell, and a gentle lather. When my hair is thoroughly rinses, it feel nice. It feels soft. I don&#x27;t need to use a lot either, because my hair is shiny and clean just after one shampoo. I&#x27;m glad I bought this. My hair is pretty brittle, as a rule, because of all the cheap, supermarket shampoos. This seems to thicken my hair starting at the roots. I definitely need a trim, but I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Since I started using this my hair has been incredibly soft and manageable! Love that the smell is so light. Sometimes the perfumes in products can be overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great</li>
            <li> While I like how clean this leaves my hair feeling, and it looks very healthy and soft in combination with the Silk conditioner, I do want to say one thing: I would not claim that this shampoo is color friendly.  I recently dyed my hair red and purchased this product when it said it was color safe.  I didn&#x27;t realize that when you use this, you have to use the shampoo TWICE.  Once to let it osmose in your hair, and the second time it actually lathers.  So if you&#x27;re trying not to wash your hair often so the color stays in, washing your hair twice with this product does not really help the color in your hair.  It may work better with other colors, but I strongly do not recommend those with red hair to use this.  I&#x27;m not saying this shampoo is bad, because I like the way my hair feels, but it is not necessarily good for colored hair due to the process to wash.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great, though I would love if it had a slight scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week, and I really do like it. I was using a shea butter shampoo before, and I felt my hair looks greasy by the end of the day. With the Maple Holistics shampoo, I can skip a day of washing my hair and not my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy. A little bit of this shampoo goes a long way, and it lathers up very well. I checked on their website, and it states they do not test their products on animals which is another key feature I look for.</li>
            <li> Hair seems alot healthier</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly because of the sulfate free shampoo. I am a lifelong surfer with dry hair and scalp. Even after the first time using this product I felt the difference. I looked on Amazon for Wen shampoo and gagged at the price upon further investigation I stumbled on Argan. Same product basically but a fraction of the cost. Reasonable and just a good product. I will buy this again. Mahalo</li>
            <li> This product is indeed one of the best that I&#x27;ve used. My hair often gets oily and this shampoo seems to be doing its job in cleansing it all out. I would recommend this brand to all who have oily hair. It gives a refreshed and light feeling after using it. I think I&#x27;ll be constantly using this for a while.</li>
            <li> very smooth for the first use, and you can feel how natural it is after finishing washing your hair: no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this.  Good shampoo.  Makes my hair soft.  I am pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have naturally oily hair and this removes oil and keeps hair smooth, shiny and healthy looking. There are not many natural, sulfate-free shampoos out there, I just might stick with this one. The only downside to this is that it doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant scent that you expect from hair care products.</li>
            <li> I wanted an all natural shampoo for my family. This does the job and leaves my hair bouncy and fresh. I also dye my hair to cover the grays and this shampoo is gentle enough for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have sensitive skin and normal/dry hair.  It lathers up great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking that it will make my hair sliky and good.. it just did it the opposite made it very dry and straw like feeling..&lt;br /&gt;My hair is usually soft and shine but using this product for couple of times made it look horrible and lifeless..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and yes its true that u get a free bottle if u leave a good review... so don&#x27;t be fooled by those reviews. PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your valuable time and money buying this product.</li>
            <li> Great product with great ingredients. After one wash my hair already feels clean and not caked with product.</li>
            <li> A great product without all the chemicals. Left my hair super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I do love this shampoo. It seems a little thinner than the last bottle I owned, but still works just as well. It lathers nicely and makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month (along with the silk 18 conditioner) and in this time it has cleared the seborrheic dermatitis that I&#x27;ve had on my scalp for the past 20 years without any creams or awful-smelling medicated shampoos. My hair is very fine and used to look oily about 15 hours after shampooing, but now it looks clean for over 24 hours after washing.  Highly recommended for anyone else with similar issues!</li>
            <li> First time  I used this it made my hair look great I was so happy. Now I don&#x27;t see a big difference.</li>
            <li> Just ok... it does suds up but still I&#x27;ve had better shampoos...</li>
            <li> very happy with this entire line! Thanks Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> It cleans your hair well and it also makes it feel very supple and moisturized. I definately will continue using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I never used it before,but when i got it,I liked it!I also got conditioner and they work together.My hair is long so I always have problem when I brush it.I don&#x27;t have that problem any more!My hair is soft and have volume -it is my dream!I would buy this shampoo again!</li>
            <li> I carefully searched for shampoo and conditioner to help my dull hair and the reviews made me think this was just the ticket. Not! No better than anything I already bought at WalMart which is really disappointing</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  My daughters hair is very long, curly and hard to comb after showers.  After using this paired with a great condition it is so much easier to comb after.  I love the way my hair feels after and it has ingredients I love.  Just bought my second bottle.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> DO YOU HAVE SCALP PROBLEMS? THEN READ THIS! I want to preface my review by saying that I&#x27;ve had a terrible dandruff problem for decades. It&#x27;s worse than normal dandruff and over the years I&#x27;ve tried numerous herbal shampoos and was using a prescription shampoo with 2% Ketoconazole right up to the time I tried this Argan Oil Shampoo from Maple Holistics. If you have a scalp problem, you know how super embarrassing it is to have to constantly brush away a pile of while powder from your shoulders. I developed a habit of grabbing and shaking my collar vigorously before entering a store or restaurant to remove the pile I knew was there without looking. I was always very self-conscious about my scalp problem - and the flaking even extended into my beard! I&#x27;m completely serious when I say that if I rubbed or scratched my chin, you could actually see powdery flaking. It was horrible. I could never find anything that helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sick of paying for a prescription shampoo that wasn&#x27;t working, I found this shampoo and ordered a bottle. From the very first time I used this shampoo - my problem went away - I&#x27;m NOT exaggerating. I&#x27;m completely serious and more thankful than anyone can ever realize. I keep waiting in dread for the flaking and scaling to return but it hasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks now and am incredibly thankful. I ordered 2 more bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what ingredient, or synergy of ingredients, is responsible for curing my problem - but please never stop making this shampoo. I&#x27;m singing it&#x27;s praises to everyone. It blows my mind that this took care of my problem with the very first use. I was forced to wear white and light shirts but have dug up a black polo shirt that must be 10 years old but brand new, as I could never wear it! Haha. I&#x27;m going to be buying some dark blue shirts and darker colors now. I&#x27;m so freaking happy about this. Thank you, Maple Holistics. You&#x27;ve made a customer for life. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: It works! Natural ingredients. Holistic. Hypoallergenic. BPA free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: None that I know of, as yet.</li>
            <li> I received the shampoo one day ahead of schedule which is great. I have very oily hair. No other shampoo has ever let my hair feel so dry.  I bought this shampoo due to raves from others and because it supposedly has no chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! I used this shampoo along with Silk 18 Conditioner also by Maple Holistics &amp; the results are amazing! My bleached &amp; highlighted hair came out soft &amp; shiny. I&#x27;ve tried many different and expensive products &amp; never received the kind of shine &amp; softness that these products have given my hair!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I think I have ever had!!! Thank you !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what I&#x27;ll get from this. I&#x27;ll update with pica in a few weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i used it today for the first time along with the silk conditioner, and my hair feels AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair: thin, little damage at ends from  chemical processing, naturally frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now remember what the product is for. If the product holds true to what it says, then you got what you paid for. Obviously this shampoo won&#x27;t do the whole shabang for your hair and you&#x27;ll use other products that&#x27;ll manage your hair further to what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- hope it works for everyone else!</li>
            <li> I use this product with the Silk 18 conditioner.  I love it! All natural, sulfate free (great for hair that has been straightened) and my hair feels so soft :)</li>
            <li> I had keratin treatment on my hair and my hair expert ask me to use sulfate free organic shampoo. So I searched on Amazon and found this product with some good reviews. Before buying it looks bit expensive to me but after using it I can say this is one of the best shampoo for hair after keratin treatment and for hair fall problem too.&lt;br /&gt;Before this shampoo I tried a lot different products on my hair but not gain such benefit as this shampoo worked for me. However I didn&#x27;t see drastic change in my hair growth (new hair growth) that is normal, but yes for hair fall problem it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Though it doesn&#x27;t create much lather but still I like it, this is perfect natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have really dry hair and wanted more moisture and shine.  It works great - my hair feels better after washing &amp; conditioning with their Silk18 Natural Conditioner, and it&#x27;s prettier.  At first I was thinking this was a bit pricey - but I use almost 1/2 the amount that I was using of Panteine.  So it&#x27;s really not more expensive because it lasts much longer.  Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Great product!! My hair looks healthier. Money is worth it</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo works amazing</li>
            <li> I was looking for organic Shampoo so HERE it is! Smells so fresh! I Love how my hair looks and feels! I don&#x27;t think that this shampoo have so many good and 5 star reviews because of the Free product card like i read in one comment! It is truly best shampoo i have ever ordered!</li>
            <li> I have been reading about the negative effects of SLS and similar sulfates, i.e. how it is used in many shampoos because it&#x27;s cheap but it overstrips the moisture from the scalp. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t contain sulfate and contains several natural oils. I think oil help lift sebum from follicles without using harsh chemicals. I liked how it lath err ted. The oils didn&#x27;t weigh down the hair or feeling greasy and instead left it feeling moisturized . I love the smell of honey so the scent was another plus. I&#x27;m also curious about their Hydrate Shampoo because my bf tends to have dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. It leaves my hair manageable and soft. My wife who requires a mild shampoo because of a scalp condition also liked  this product. I am definitely buying it again.</li>
            <li> Argan was recommended by a friend...it was worth a try. My hair felt different after the very first wash. I highly recommend this shampoo to everyone. My next buy Will be the conditioner. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Love the clean fragrance of this shampoo but for my hair, it clarified a bit too much - left it feeling a bit dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! I have hair past my shoulders and first time I put a dime size of the product in my hand and couldnt believe the coverage. I have downgraded to a pea size and that is perfect! The shampoo is moisturizing as I have even skipped the conditioner a few times when I was not going anywhere (to save water as CA is in the middle of a drought) and my hair still felt soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo - Argan Oil Shampoo - in January and have used it 4 times since.  I have scratchy, itchy scalp and a little oilyness.  I used the shampoo as recommended, especially letting it soak into the scalp for a few minutes before rinsing.  Since I used the shampoo, over 6 weeks ago, I have not had any itchiness or scratching on my scalp.  I have had this problem for the last few years, and tried many other shampoos, ranging from expensive to cheap (as prices denote) and from all-natural to regular formulations.  Despite trying the other brands, I usually had some scratching and itchiness after a few days.  I do not have dandruff, but an extra sensitive scalp.  My scalp feels good, and I haven&#x27;t itched or felt the need to scratch it.  It doesn&#x27;t feel irritated, and my hair is soft and clean.  I use a little conditioner, because I color my roots every few weeks, but otherwise, I do not need conditioner for my hair.  After shampooing, my hair feels clean, without any residue.  I notice the difference of no residue, which was not evident with other shampoos.  I notice the oilyness is not as much as previous also.  I believe the jojoba oil makes the difference, since I used other shampoos with the same other ingredients in this shampoo.  I will be buying this shampoo again, and highly recommend it,especially if your scalp is sensitive or tends to be itchy.  Also, my hair is not &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; which used to be the case with other shampoos; it is glossy and has a nice natural sheen to it;  the color also seems to be brighter.  For the cost, it is a good product; in comparison I used to pay more than $30 for shampoo, with lesser results.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewer&#x27;s have said, this product made my hair and scalp extremely dry. My scalp itches like crazy and I haven&#x27;t experienced this with any other product. I&#x27;ve only used 1/3 of the bottle and I&#x27;m throwing it out!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and after giving birth she needed something to save her hair like before post partum. We usually never spend this much on a hair product since she gets them cheap since she coupons but she wanted to try something more natural and effective but after about 3 months now of using she told me it doesn&#x27;t work and I can tell because she is still losing a lot of hair and her hair is always frizzy. For the price we were hoping more results but so far nothing that is noticeable really and the bottle is almost done. Bought this with silk 18.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best, natural, organic, sulfate-free, and hypoallergenic hair product I have used. I have severe eczema and I am extremely sensitive to the usual bad chemicals found in regular shampoos. Using this did not make me itch or get irritated. It relieved some of my dry, flaky scalp and made my hair extremely soft. Make sure not to use too much, just the recommended use (a quarter-size), works just like a regular shampoo that&#x27;s foamy and bubbly. This may not work for everyone, but I was very satisfied with my results.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is incredible. It lathers perfectly, and leaves hair silky smooth. I am now a loyal customer -- this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ll use. I pair it with the Silk18 conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. My daughter and I have blonde thin fragile hair. We have been using this for one month now. It has made such a difference in moisture and strength. I will never use any other kind of shampoo again</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo may work for only very dry hair. My hair is somewhat dry and my scalp is often dry, so I thought with all the oils in this shampoo, it would work wonders for me. And at first it did - my hair was super shiny and soft after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I soon noticed that the shampoo made my scalp itch painfully and the conditioning oils seemed to build up until after a while, my hair wasn&#x27;t soft and shiny anymore but instead weighed down and slightly greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo! I like that the ingredients are natural, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong and lingering smell, and I like the way it makes my hair sooo soft.  I have color treated hair, and this does not strip the color at all!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have very sensitive skin and can not change products AT ALL. Recently the shampoo I have been using for years started to break me out around the hairline. I felt sure the company had changed something in the shampoo so I decided to find a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo hoping it would be less likely to  cause me skin trouble. I found this shampoo and I love it! The break outs went away within a week of switching. It also has a very lovely subtle smell. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent Shampoo.. I&#x27;ll buy it again..</li>
            <li> the first thing I did when I received this in the mail was open it and smell it, and it smells great, nothing too strong like perfume, but a shampoo that smells nice and clean. it left my hair nice and soft, shiny, and clean!</li>
            <li> I decided to try to do something about my thinning, thin hair, and this shampoo (in addition to the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner by Maple Holistics)sounded hopeful so I purchased both just two weeks ago. Already, my hair has more body, shine and texture to it - and is looking like real hair - not frizzy-foam.  I even tried some on my 4-year-old granddaughter&#x27;s thin, fly-away baby hair, and even she noticed!  She said her hair made her feel  like Rapunzel!  From the mouths of babes...you&#x27;ll really like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Argan Oil Shampoo combined with the Silk18 Natural Conditioner and I like them for natural products. The last products I used were the store brand of a certain health food grocery store chain that were awful. Even though it was a moisturizing hair care treatment, those other products left my hair super dry and frizzy. There was a noticeable and immediate difference when I started using the Argan Oil Shampoo and the Silk18 Natural Conditioner. My hair returned to it&#x27;s normal healthy state. I can&#x27;t say that this shampoo has made my hair better than normal as it had been a while since my hair had felt healthy. However, I think it is doing a decent job at keeping my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this all natural product.  I works beautifully without drying out my hair.  Makes it clean and clarifies along with nourishment.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t contain any of those nasty chemicals you&#x27;ll find in other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it along with Silk 18 for a couple of weeks now and very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have damaged and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel dry and brittle, gave it 2 stars because it made it on time, in good shape</li>
            <li> If I could give this product 0 star, I would. It was the most drying shampoo I have ever used and even after using a salon-quality conditioner, I could still feel the roughness of my hair. Too bad I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> I love Herbal Essence and all of the new scents, and products... BUT ... You can never go wrong with originals.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite - it lasts a long time, so I only have to order about every six months. She has long straight hair and swears by it.</li>
            <li> Love it Love it! MAke my hair so much easier to take care of, leave&#x27;s it soft too...</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, the bottle was small, but we just need a quarter size for first rinse and another quarter size for the second rinse. Can feel a healhty and silky hairs after couple washes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few days now and can say that even though I am a guy with short hair, I can tell that it has a different healthier appearance since I have been using this argan shampoo. I will definitely be buying more products from this company!!</li>
            <li> one thing.. it dried my hair too much</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with very little expectation, once i use the product its absolutely&lt;br /&gt;  Increable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can one praduct change the health my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I recommand this praduct for anyone who needs to improve their hair.</li>
            <li> I’ve been curious for a very long time about trying organic hair products. I began to read about many different products and decided to take a chance with this shampoo. I’ve been using the Argan Oil shampoo for a few weeks, I am very happy with this shampoo! My hair looks healthier, it has more shine and it doesn&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself works just fine. It cleans the scalp, but does not strip it from all it&#x27;s natural oils. My only issue with this shampoo is the strong scent it has. It does not leave a strong smell after use (which is ok). But when you first open the bottle it has an overwhelming scent (not a huge fan of that).</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this shampoo. I only has to use a very small amount to clean my hair, and the shampoo smells very nice.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. I do find I have to use about double than what the bottle suggests but my hair is pretty long. I&#x27;m pleased enough that I can see ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I am a male and I don&#x27;t usually pay attention to what I buy when it comes to beauty products.I don&#x27;t really understand what many people are writing here regarding the lather feeling and what not. To me, for the most part, feels the same as any other shampoo. The reason why I bought this was because I started noticing that my skin, by my eyebrows was getting itchy and really dry, Also my head was itchy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure why it started happening but I decided to change what I put on my head to something more natural and ended up with this product. The bottle seems to be a lot smaller than what I am used to getting, I was expecting somewhat more. However, with just a really small amount of shampoo, it takes care of my whole head. I am sure it will last a long time. Also another thing I noticed was that my hair felt lighter.It is easier to comb my hair since it doesn&#x27;t take much to set it the way I want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my dry, itchy skin, I believe it is too soon to see if natural products work, however it does seem to be getting a bit better. I will probably end up buying this product again.</li>
            <li> It is okay, I guess. But I am switching back to my old product, which worked better.</li>
            <li> First to tell you a little bit about my hair history. I was born with pin-straight manageable hair, but when I entered my teens I started to mess around with many different shampoo’s and hair products and I eventually did something wrong because my hair changed from pin-straight manageable hair to dry, brittle, UNmanageable hair. My hair became a burden, and with the addition that the I had to straighten my hair everyday to manipulate it to even ‘try’ to be manageable…my hair was a complete disaster. Throughout my middle school days into my high school days, I straightened my hair every day, i’m still surprised to this day how on earth I even managed to HAVE hair. I finally got into the college of my dreams and decided to create a new look, I decided to bleach my hair. Mistake. My hair was a complete disaster and I thought I would forever be that girl with the really bad hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2015 came around and of course I had the same resolutions as every one else “to be healthy, inside and out” and “taking care of myself”, the only difference about my resolution is I decided to HONOR it. It first started out slow, exercising regularly, drinking water…holding off on that ranch with my fries etc. As I was creating a healthier regime for myself, I started to notice how well my complexion was becoming but my dry hair stuck out like a sore thumb, it was time to take action. I started off with home recipes for hair, such as egg masks, coconut oil masks etc. One day in the shower as I was using my Herbal Essence, I read the ingredients out of curiosity and had an idea: “I should invest in some actual good shampoo’s”. I was looking around Whole Foods one day and noticed many shampoos that were “sulfate free” and started to try out this new “hype”, I chose their 2Chic Avocado &amp; Olive Oil for dry, damaged hair shampoo/conditioner/mask. I saw instant improvement, my frizz was tamed, my hair was more manageable, I was ecstatic. I flew home fromHI (where I live)  to CA for winter break, and on my way back as I was unpacking, I realized I left my shampoo/conditioner. I walked to Walmart and purchased Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative shampoo/conditioner with sea kelp and Argan Oil free of: sulfates, paragons, phthalates, paraffin, gluten propylene glycol, mineral oil, synthetic fragrance/color, DEA. This is where the magic happened. My hair was instantaneously TRANSFORMED. My frizz was gone, the only product I would put in my hair was Argan Serum after my shower just to give it shine, and i’d walk out the door with no problem. One day I was on Amazon and ended up on your product and I decided, why not spoil myself a little. I’ve used your product many times now, my hair can’t get enough of it. My hair has never been this luscious, frizz free, so manageable! My hair has been restored and I can’t be any happier. I’m a sulfate-free believer now, I even convinced 2 of my close friends to consider the switch and they have, and they are now sulfate-free believers! I will continue to purchase your product because my hair can’t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> three words  LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> great shampoo, really works.  I hope it will continue to work, I know that at times your body will get used to something and no longer work the same...</li>
            <li> I have very super fine hair and damaged from blow dry. This shampoo makes my hair very soft, clean, and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair. It also reduce frizz. I love all the fact that it&#x27;s all natural, sulfate free. It&#x27;s smell natural too. My hair seems to be easier to manage. I always use it with their conditioner. I tried many natural hair products but this brand is my favorite now.  I will definitely buy it again and try different product from the same brand. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Argan Oil Shampoo knowing the benefits of Argan Oil. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t have a lot of smell as such which is good as I sometimes apply oil to my hear whose smell I love and I would rather not want any mixed fragrance. Other than that, I feel like my dandruff has reduced a little. I believe I was expecting a lot more but then we always expect a lot more for a lot less and that NEVER happens. So I am satisfied with the product is all I can say!  Update on the product 6/11/2015  I have been using this shampoo for a while now. 4 weeks to be precise. I apply it twice or thrice a week and I apply a hair oil intermittently. So the reason I purchased this shampoo was that the earlier shampoo I was using from a mainstream off the shelf product manufacturer was leading to a lot of itching in my hair, probably because of the dandruff caused by the scalp dehydration. This in turn resulted in a lot of hair fall. This shampoo has helped a lot in that regard. It has resulted in substantial reduction in itching. I will however warn off people on using a large quantity of shampoo as it will still result in drying of hair and will take away all the moisture. Moisture is absolutely necessary for hair to stay healthy. I usually take just the right amount of shampoo required for me. This right amount will depend on everybody&#x27;s hair types, hair volume and hair condition. So modify accordingly. However, I apply more than the regular quantity when I want to take off the oil from my hair I have applied previous night.  All in all, one of the better shampoos out there. Go for it!</li>
            <li> Loved the product! Great wih my hair, didn&#x27;t dry it out and I can feel the difference compared to my last shampoo</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. It leaves my hair and scalp clean longer then other shampoos do. I love that my scalp is clean but is not dried out or &#x27;tight&#x27;. I have &#x27;fine&#x27;, delicate and color treated hair so I have to be careful what I wash my hair with. I recommend this product as well as Maple Holistics Silk 18 conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading how it would help with thinning hair. I have used it once so it is to soon to tell. I do like the way it makes my hair feel and love that it barely has a smell to it as some shampoos have such a strong smell that can be over powering when you smell them. This feels nice on your hair and hope it will thicken it up. Will update as I keep using it. I am in my late 50&#x27;s and my hair is thinning so I am trying supplements and new more natural shampoos that are less damaging to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this Shampoo for my Son and my Wife. Have tried using this for about 2 rinse. so far so good. My sons hair is silky and shining when compared to earlier product. I need to wait for a months time, to see the results. I will again provide my review comment in 30 days time.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner! I am a true beleiver and will be stock piling this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have been trying to find an all natural shampoo that can meet my needs as I have oily skin and hair, both a blessing and a curse.  This shampoo does the trick - it does not strip my color and allows me to go every other day without washing my hair.  No other shampoo has allowed me to do this.  Plus there is no build up on your scalp.  It has a nice clean smell and it does not take much about a nickel size for my hair and I have long hair.  I would recommend using it with the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is still oily and this gives me dandruff.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only been using this a week, but I swear, my hair feels much softer than it did with any of the other standard brands of shampoo (probably because all of them have sulfates)! I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair this week. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> After trying the ACV and BS technique and going no-poo, i was not as thrilled with the transition as I had hoped. So instead, I wanted to try a more natural shampoo. I have been using this product for almost 2 months and LOVE it!  A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m also able to only wash my hair every 2-3 days. I&#x27;ve also just recently purchased the conditioner product too and am looking forward to trying it.</li>
            <li> i love this product as it left my hair feeling lovely and soft and is really shiny</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using argan oil shampoo, my hair has never been dry and looks much healthier compared to other shampoos I have used. The only thing I wish would be improved a bit would be the scent.</li>
            <li> the first bottle I really liked. The second one smelled like a baby shampoo and didn&#x27;t foam rich like the first one.</li>
            <li> The company makes it seem like the product contains replenishing ingredients. When in fact, very drying synthetic components are listed first. This means there are more of those ingredients in the product than the other oils advertised.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying over the counter shampoos, and found out that there are countless harmless chemicals that make up the shampoos that I used to buy. I wanted to buy a shampoo that I could settle for instead of having to jump from one brand to another. This is the first organic shampoo that I&#x27;ve bought and it will most likely be what I use from now on. People have been telling me how noticeable softer my hair is since I&#x27;ve been using it! I let my sister try it out and she told me to purchase two more bottles(along with the silk eighteen conditioner). Much recommended. :]</li>
            <li> Right from the start it&#x27;s great....so far.  It&#x27;s not thick going in and so it works through very easy even on my long hair.  I don&#x27;t have to use a lot for a great lather.  It smells great, to boot!</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy hair and psoriasis on my scalp. This shampoo works great to clean my hair and leaves it less frizzy. I bought this shampoo along with the hydrate shampoo and I love the smell of the hydrate shampoo but the Argan shampoo worked better for my hair. I also use the Silk 18 conditioner and that works great with the Argan shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 2 months ago.  Me being a hair and makeup artist did not want to review this product until I had a substantial amount of time using it.  From experience I know a product can do wonders on your hair in the first few days/ weeks but overtime you hair can start rejecting it and poor outcomes can result.  I must say this is definitely not the case with this product.  I do keratin treatments on my hair and this product has done nothing but prolong the treatment!  It keeps my hair soft and silky.  It also has a pleasant smell.  The ingredients speak for themselves.  So many added benefits from the natural ingredients.  It is wonderful.  I am most definitely buying again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo consistently for the last week and notice that my hair is a bit softer. I was using L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate Free shampoo for the last few years, which smelled nice but wasn&#x27;t too hydrating. The consistency of the shampoo is like a thinner lotion, so it&#x27;s fairly easy to apply all over the head. Overall, I appreciate that the argan oil shampoo has more natural ingredients and will see if I notice more significant results.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle with my hair! It left my hair feeling soft and manageable. I would definitely recommend  this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!  It is a great base for adding my essential oils to.  I think it lasted quite awhile also.  Just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Lathers great, hair feels clean, nice smell</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I have combination hair. I have straight hair in the front and coarse curly hair in the back. This makes it very difficult to find hair products that work for my whole head. I also have dry (like very dry) hair but I can&#x27;t go even one night without washing my hair because if I do my face breaks out! I decided to buy this product based on reviews. When it came I was excited and scared to try it. I&#x27;ve really messed up my hair with other products including the baking soda no poo method and had to do oil treatments that make me breakout in order to get my hair back to not feeling like pig hair(in case you don&#x27;t know, pig hair is very coarse and unpleasant). I read the instructions and did as they said.... I immediately panicked! My hair felt horribly dry and doll like! I put the silk 18 conditioner in hoping it would help a little and to my udder shock and relief my hair felt silky soft as I smoothed it through. I left the conditioner in as I showered and rinsed it before I got out. OMG!!!! My hair is softer than it&#x27;s ever been!!! I can even go a night without washing(instead I just rinse) my hair! No breakouts in the morning!! I&#x27;ve been using these two products together for a month now and am still so so soooo happy I tried them!</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo and conditioner together.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product, which makes my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my scalp so itchy :(  I&#x27;m still using it because I don&#x27;t want to waste it,  and also pricey, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. I need to keep looking for different brand.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST shampoo that I have ever used! I have severely damaged/over processed hair after consistent perming, dying, bleaching hair for the past few years. As a result, my hair is beaten up by all those chemicals which caused the hair to be incredibly dry and lifeless. I noticed that my hair had been falling off in dramatically for the past year as well. After reading all these great comments on amazon for this product, I decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Just after the first wash I can feel a difference from the usual Pantene that I used. Hair felt more hydrated and smooth after blow drying. As of now I have been using this shampoo five times since receiving it, and my hair is no longer dying of thirst nor feeling brittle. Will continue to use this product, highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF ! I wanted to wait before I wrote a review on this product to see what my hair would look like after a week. My hair looks like it did when I was 13 . The shine !! My hair is so soft and I color my hair. If you are looking for shampoo that will make your hair soft and shiny than try this out. I will be buying again soon !</li>
            <li> A great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  My hairdresser noticed that my hair was in better condition without my even mentioning anything.</li>
            <li> Wanted to like this but I just couldn&#x27;t. Dried my hair a LOT and made my color run more than other shampoos. :( sad.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo, it makes my hair feel very soft and is easy to lather. For some reason this one dries my hair out a little, even though it has Argan Oil. It might have something to do with the fact that my hair is not color treated. I will probably try another shampoo from Maple Holistics after this is done.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. After trying six or seven shampoos offering oils of different plants and being disappointed because they either left my hair unchanged or left it too oily, I tried Argan Oil shampoo, not expecting much. This product was just what I needed. As an older woman hair gets drier due to years of coloring and age. This shampoo is just right. I was offered a free gift in return for this posting. I&#x27;ve turned down similar offers from other companies  because I couldn&#x27;t endorse their products. I genuinely endorse this one!</li>
            <li> It is exactly how it&#x27;s described. Recommend. You will not regret it !!!</li>
            <li> I can really feel that my hair is clean after using this shampoo.  I have thick curly/wavy hair and follow the shampoo with the Silk 18 conditioner.  Together they are a great combination!</li>
            <li> The smell was unpleasant, it smells like Vinegar and it seemed to really strip all of the oils out of my (thick, fine) hair, which I found to be too harsh and left it frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! My hair looks so good when I use it! Super shine and full of body! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance, now what I expect from Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased just after my first shampoo. I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo. I am naturally gray and after using Argan Oil Shampoo for one week my hair is shiny and fuller. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was expecting some natural shampoo, but after i received it and checked the formula, i found out many BAD ingredients such as SCL, SLS! SCG, Coco-Glucoside.... Really really disappointed with it, gonna through it to the garbage !  It&#x27;s better i still use my own formula which is the dr bronners + argan oil and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo available! Sulfate free and natural. My wife and i are using this shampoo. we are very happy with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommende!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a shampoo product emphasizing on sulfate free. When washing my hair, the product is very smooth to use. It didn&#x27;t create a lot of foams but I can feel that my hair is gently cleansed. There&#x27;s no strong artificial fragrance on this product, which is what I want, so that it won&#x27;t conflict with the perfume or essential oil I use after shampooing.</li>
            <li> Love this sulfate free shampoo.  It&#x27;s organic with no harsh chemicals and does not make my hair dry to comb.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love that they&#x27;ve included all of the ingredients and natural oils that have been proven to promote hair growth and maintain healthy hair in this shampoo. It leaves my hair feeling very soft and fuller.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo and I received this as a sample. This product works great there are no heavy perfume smells and it makes my hair look so healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this product but whenever I use it, my hair stays clean for several days and seems extra healthy. It&#x27;s curlier than usual and doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have had very good results using this shampoo. It works better than any other sulfate-free shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. It actually does foam, cleans amazingly, and my hair-fall has been reduced by at least half after using this and their Silk Conditioner for about 6 weeks. My hair is shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using Wen cleansing conditioners for years- and just switched to this product. It makes my hair soft and healthy feeling. I use it with the Silk 18 conditioner. I wish that the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> Good product. Being a black woman I use only natural or organic products on my hair.  Products that are actually good for my hair and I believe I found a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves my hair soft and easy to manage. However, I do wish there was more of a natural moisturizer agent in it.</li>
            <li> Only used once so far but left my very long hair clean and soft. Very happy!</li>
            <li> great shampoo&lt;br /&gt;great seller&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;many thanks</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo as a gift this holiday season.  It is amazing.  My hair gets frizzly and dry during the winter time and this shampoo made my hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> makes my hair stick together! and makes it dry</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It works miracles on my overly processed hair! It took me by surprise how fast it work I absolutely love it. Within the first week I noticed the massive change in my hair. My hair is manageable,smooth,silky and shiny. I have no intentions on going back to any other shampoos I have tried before!</li>
            <li> After using 1 bottle of the Argan Oil Shampoo and Silk 18 Conditioner my hair is in fantastic condition.  My hair stylist/colourist commented on how healthy my hair is and co-workers have offered nice compliments on my hair.  I have very fine and oily hair which always looked a bit frizzy.  Not anymore!  My hair is smooth, soft, shiny and healthy looking.  These products are keepers for me!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It smells great and leave hair feeling fantastic. I liked this in combination with their conditioner. Great purchase and really worth a try!</li>
            <li> I love how it feels in my hair.</li>
            <li> First, I like this shampoo for what it doesn&#x27;t contain, namely, a lot of harmful chemicals; second, I like it because it contains a lot of natural ingredients known to be good for hair, and third, I like the way it leaves my hair, shiny and soft, and fourth, I like the way it smells, a really pretty scent that&#x27;s not overpowering.  All in all, it&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li> I was offered this product as a discount in an exchange of a review.  It is hypoallergenic and BPA free.  You normally buy products that either contain jojoba or argan or almond or avocado.  Well, you can find them all in this little bottle.  I love the smell and make my hear very smooth without being heavy or flat.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer of this shampoo.  I would recommend it, in combination with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural shampoos in the last six months, I have been looking for one that doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to become dry.  I am in the 60+ age range and my hair is starting to need extra care...I have used this for about three weeks and am very pleased with it so far.  My hair is noticeably softer and feels lighter to the touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with...a shampoo?! Yes indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course there&#x27;s a backstory. I&#x27;m itchy. I&#x27;ve always been itchy, and irritated for that matter! Not just my scalp, but my skin in general. I&#x27;ve had active eczema since I was young, and am hypersensitive to so many artificial ingredients in products and the environment, that I am usually nursing several &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34; on my face and body. I also have wavy hair, and tried the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;, and The Curly Girl Method for awhile. Maple Holistics has been a magic potion for me, not just giving good cleansing, yet at the same time...wait for it...relieving my itchy scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using it on May 7th, 2015, I&#x27;ve had a happier head! I also use the Argan Oil Conditioner from the same line, and like it very much as well. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SG3BJ7G?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00</li>
            <li> This is the only natural shampoo I have purchased that my husband likes.  Lathers better than the others I have used.</li>
            <li> I actually do hate this stuff! I bought it to try for myself in spite of the polar opposite reviews it&#x27;s gotten and the fact that the one star reviews were so bad! But for me, I&#x27;ve found that people were not lying or exaggerating. In my opinion this product sucks. It&#x27;s bad and I think it&#x27;s bad for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Reason #1 is that when I used it, it stripped my hair far worse than any shampoo I have ever used. It was so &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; I felt like I had straw for hair afterwards! I&#x27;m not buying all natural hair stuff to save the planet, I&#x27;m buying it to save my hair! I used to use aveda which works excellent, but I gave it up because it seriously dried out my scalp and I was noticing more and more hair loss in the shower. FREAKY. This is WORSE than avid or suave or anything!!&lt;br /&gt;Reason #2 is that I lost a ton of hair in the shower after ONE use, just like when I was using aveda. After Aveda I switched to no poo (that sucked) and then to Shea Moisture shampoo. When I used Shea Moisture I noticed zero hair loss in the shower and all my &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; problems disappeared. I tried this just for the heck of it, and it was a mistake. I&#x27;m going back to Shea moisture where I feel safe!&lt;br /&gt;Reason #3 is that I shed hair for days after one shampoo with this crap! Worse than aveda shedding!!!&lt;br /&gt;Reason #4 is that this stuff stinks, literally! The smell is horrible to me! It&#x27;s sweet smelling but not the scent I like I guess. Maybe you would like it but not me. My main reason for trying something new was to get away from the Shea buttery smell of Shea moisture, but I now realize how mild that shampoo is. This smell must be argon oil smell, or something. It actually smells just like my sally hansen wax I used to use, which I never liked either. And don&#x27;t believe the people who say the smell goes away right away. It smelled for days afterward and even in my bathroom the smell lingered for days. NAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m actually surprised, but all of these reasons were complaints from other reviewers on here and I should have listened to them. I&#x27;m returning it, with no shipping charge and no hassle so that&#x27;s a huge plus! If you feel you need to know for yourself, like me, then buy this, otherwise I highly recommend Shea Moisture products. They are way cheaper (not on Amazon though, they are cheaper at walmart) and have only natural ingredients and absolutely nothing else. The labels on this argon oil stuff has all kinds of things that sound like alcohol and crap I don&#x27;t understand. I don&#x27;t really care though since it really damaged my hair. Oh, but for the record, if you don&#x27;t mind the stink or losing hair, it did work well as far as how my hair looked afterwards. That made it tempting enough for me to use a second time, but with another hunk of hair in the shower drain, I just could not use it again no matter how fabulous my hair looked!</li>
            <li> I have naturally very curly hair (3B). I have to use sulfate free products and this one works well. I also don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it, so that is appreciated. This seems to absorb well and cleans my scalp. My scalp is allergic to sulfates, so I am happy to have found a sulfate-free shampoo that works. Many sulfate-free shampoos are still laden with chemicals, but this one isn&#x27;t. I recommend this shampoo and will be using it again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so drying to hair..</li>
            <li> It makes my hair fell soft and dries easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a week now, and I have long, undyed fine hair. I use this Maple Holistics Argan Oil shampoo every other day, alternating it with the Canadian brand Calia&#x27;s Hydrating shampoo. By using these shampoo, my hair is shiny and soft all day long! It lathers better than most natural shampoos do, which is refreshing after using non-lathering shampoos for so long. I find that this shampoo is much easier to distribute evenly throughout the hair than other brands. This shampoo has met my expectations, and I hope that I can try Maple Holistics other products soon!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the natural smell. Money value back!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves my corse grey colored hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. It does it&#x27;s job, but no better than other (better smelling) shampoos I have tried. I love the conditioner, so not sure what went wrong with the shampoo. How hard is it to add a little vanilla scent? It does feel very thick and luxurious though, which I always enjoy in a shampoo, and it cleans just fine.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with thin hair all my life (63 years).  My hair also has damaged ends and doesn&#x27;t hold a style.  I purchased this shampoo along with the Silk 18 conditioner about a month ago, and I can really see and feel a difference in my hair.  It has more shine and body, and it feels thicker.  After shampooing, I use the Silk 18 Conditioner; and my hair feels so clean afterward.  My hair doesn&#x27;t have that weighted down feeling that I would get with other products.  I also like the fresh fragrance!  I absolutely love these products and will continue to buy them in the future.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this make my hair feel and look. Voluptuous, volume, shiny, are all the perks you get from this shampoo. It&#x27;s great to know it&#x27;s all natural too. I usually suffer from dandruff and will have to rotate between dandruff control and regular shampoo - with this, I don&#x27;t have to rotate. Recommend to anybody! Great overall!</li>
            <li> Only con is size especially for daily use.</li>
            <li> Just switched to organic shampoo, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy, it has volume and feels clean.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Received for free for review. This shampoo is incredible, smells great, makes my hair soft, shiny and manageable and not frizzy, jojoba and almonds are just 2 things that are in it that i love, made me want to try, great product.</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky when it comes to my shampoo and conditioner.  I started using the Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo and Silk 18 Conditioner about 5 months ago.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier, LOVE IT!!  The entire family uses it and it leaves our hair soft and silky.  It lathers well and smells great.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, but made my hair dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of this shampoo yet. My hair seems cleaner, but I&#x27;m not in love. It smells fake to me, and there are still too many chemicals in this product.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this shampoo. Having bleached blonde hair, this product is a savior in that it moisturizes the dry ends. I also like that it&#x27;s sulfate free and dense (you don&#x27;t need to use as much as some other shampoos). I will definitely be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing. Helped my hair gain new life again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with this shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  I use it with the Silk 18 conditioner. You do have to rinse and repeat like the instructions say to get the shampoo to lather and work through your hair.</li>
            <li> Super clean hair!!! First time trying Argan oil and so Far so good.</li>
            <li> We bought this because of the great ingredients.  We have used it for 3 months and just bought our second bottle.  It leaves our hair, soft, shiny and manageable without all the chemicals. There&#x27;s been no &amp;#34;buildup&amp;#34; like other shampoos. You only need a little for it to give a good lather so it&#x27;s really a good value.  It smells really good too.  This is now our favorite shampoo and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> excellent shampoo!  I do like it!  My hair is dry at the end and oil at the root. It clean my hair very well and won&#x27;t get it dry.  My hair is very soft after wash!</li>
            <li> I;&#x27;ve been using this  since the end of March.  Yesterday, my hairdresser asked me what shampoo I&#x27;ve been using, as my hair seemed to have improved in texture and volume.  This is definitely the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  I also love that it&#x27;s toxin-free and not tested on animals.      (I see that someone mentioned people getting offers for free products in return for reviews..... I don&#x27;t remember any such offers, I&#x27;m just giving it five stars because I think it&#x27;s terrific.  But everyone&#x27;s hair is different.   This one happens to work well for mine.)</li>
            <li> Like the  product, worked  very nice on my hair. nicely fine with my thick hair. Would order again. Package great.</li>
            <li> I use this with the conditioner. It is great! My hair is so smooth. I am constantly playing with it now, which is a big deal since I hate my hair. I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> Good product , will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I need very little, and don&#x27;t have to shampoo as often (hair that is thick, and past my shoulders). Also use the silk 18 conditioner, but don&#x27;t even have to use that every time! REALLY happy with this product - will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> perfect with silk18. today is my second day to use this product and i can see the difference. i have dry color treated hair and after only 2 uses i can see the softness and shine. the size if perfect too to bring to out of town travel.</li>
            <li> So far really like this.  My hair is glossy and healthy looking.  Will continue using.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of shampoos but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer or shinier. The bonus is it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I literally looked up every ingredient in this shampoo and found that everything was safe. (I purchased it together with the silk18).  I have been looking for a sulfate free, shampoo without all the harsh chemicals, which would not damage my hair.  My husband and I eat organic and are switching slowly to other organic and/or safe products that we use in our daily lives...after all, have to take care of yourself.  After so much research, I decide on this item.  My hair is hard to manage (think Einstein hair), so I usually have knots in my hair which I have to untangle before blow drying.  To my surprise, didn&#x27;t have all the knots I normally do after my shower.  And it left my hair soft after my normal blow dry routine.  I would say, I like it.  (Oh, it also comes in a pretty bottle...this may not matter for most, but it appealed to my tastes).</li>
            <li> Good quality shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;As claimed, my scalp and hair feels more alive and not feeling dry or freezy after only the first wash.&lt;br /&gt;hair feels fuller with better texture  after my 1st wash.&lt;br /&gt;will consider ordering the cnditione too. Good pricing.&lt;br /&gt;my scalp felt clean without and residue and dryness.</li>
            <li> I kept debating on whether I should buy this shampoo. I saw that other reviews stated that the results from using this shampoo were horrible and left their hair dry. I was hesitant but decided to take the risk and purchase it. I was excited when it arrived to try it out. Those reviews weren&#x27;t joking when they said it left their hair dry. It literally left my hair so dry and made it look more damaged then what it already was. My hair was fried. I also purchased the conditioner and it made it better but my hair still looked damaged and really dry. Maybe it isn&#x27;t for color treated hair. I&#x27;m highly disappointed, I do not recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> the product was really good. I got it on time and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am usually skeptical of buying shampoo that is sulfate free.  I have had some not so good experiences.  This shampoo in combination with the conditioner  is amazing.  My hair feels clean not weighed down, its very shiny and soft.  I am happy I took the chance on a new product and am excited to try more!!</li>
            <li> My hair had been getting dry and this shampoo really helps.</li>
            <li> It was okay, not sure if I would buy it again. My hair still seems dry and I do not have over processed hair. I was looking for a natural product and thought I would give it a try, with all the reviews. Unfortunately, it is not for me. I am still looking for more and more moisture.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for three weeks  .... This shampoo rates as the best I have ever found, ending a years long search for a natural shampoo that likes my hair. Even with our hard well water, it really lathers up and rinses out with ease. It leaves my long, fine, thin hair soft, full and with a nice shine. My hair and I are very happy and looking forward to a long relationship with Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> After getting keratin treatment and dye on my hair, I needed a shampoo without sulfate and other ingredients that would strip the keratin away or otherwise be harmful for the body. This shampoo was the only one after hours of searching that fit all my requirements. It does not bubble as much as the regular brand of shampoo, but it bubbles plenty enough and smells very pleasant. I am also prone to getting dandruff, but ever since this shampoo, I have not had a problem. My only wish is that the bottle was bigger--I have bought it only 2 weeks ago, and I think I am about a third of the way if not halfway through. This means I would be spending $10 per month on shampoo alone, which is more expensive than buying a whole tub from Costco that lasts a few months. However, I think having healthy hair and less exposure to harmful products in the long run is worth the money. It is an investment, but one that is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Okay. FIRST OFF, I want to start by saying it was LESS harsh than other shampoos I had been using, It left my hair feeling moisturized for much longer as well. The scent WASN&#x27;T overpowering. Personally I enjoyed the scent. I even got a few compliments on it. Something told me to buy this shampoo, I don&#x27;t regret it. The only negative thing I have to say is it could be a little bigger for the price, maybe around 10-12oz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey for the amount but it&#x27;s natural and works perfectly! My hair is soft and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t really foam well because of the non toxic ingredients so I do two shampoos each time and use a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Let me just say I will not be buying any other shampoo again! This stuff is amazing! After one use my hair feels extremely clean, it&#x27;s soft, and it&#x27;s super shiny. Even my ends looke like I just got a hair cut in which I haven&#x27;t in months. I love this and I only used it one time! But this shampoo and you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try due to the ingredients. This is phenomenal. The smell is kind of meh, but I really don&#x27;t mind. My hair feels incredible after using it only twice. I do pair this up with the conditioner of the same ingredients and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair texture and quality feel great. I was looking for something natural and good quality to help fix the quality of my hair and this is it. My hair feel softer, not as brittle and dry, and healthier. I&#x27;ll be ordering this shampoo from now on.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, and even though my hair is softer, I am not sure if it is due to the shampoo or the conditioning oil i use everyday.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo love it</li>
            <li> This shampoo relieved my dry itchy scalp and left my hair really smooth and soft.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair feel greasy and did not clean well.  This shampoo might be good for someone with super dry scalp.  I can normally go 1-2 days without washing my hair but not with this shampoo.  I used it up but had to resort to using this shampoo for 1st lather, then rinsing &amp; using a DIFFERENT shampoo for 2nd lather.  Won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo in September of 2014 and just finished the bottle.  I had other bottles of shampoo on hand that I needed to use up as well.  The girl that always cuts my hair noticed the shine on my hair and asked me if I had put something on it for shine. I said no, I just washed it with this shampoo and the conditioner from this company. She said, &amp;#34;Keep doing what you are doing; your hair looks great. &amp;#34; I am 62 years old and color my hair. I flat iron my hair, so I do use argon oil occasionally, but had not used it on this day. This shampoo makes my hair softer and less frizzy so I am going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product not only feels healthy, but it also does a great job at keeping my hair soft and moist. I recommend this product for those that are looking for non-comedogenic products and is natural. I was also surprised at how long it lasted as I only had to use a little to lather my entire head.</li>
            <li> Good lather, however not much in the way of fragrance.</li>
            <li> Unpleasant smell, did not like this product at all.</li>
            <li> I used it this morning and my hair feels soft. It is also very shiny. I received compliments on my hair.  I have been looking for a shampoo that is 100% natural. I want to try other products sold by Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my hair become and look healthier. It is sulfate free which does not damage hair of all types and helps retain the natural nutrients that are found in hair. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for healthy beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> It smells great and cleans my hair well, but since I&#x27;ve been going no &#x27;poo for a year or two it just makes my head/scalp feel icky to use all those chemicals. I will probably not use it all up...</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.  A subtle fragrance that leaves my hair fresh and clean.  Very soft and lathers really well.</li>
            <li> Its it nice shampoo, but i felt my hairs started to turn more grey</li>
            <li> VERY DECEPTIVE. The advertising says contain argan, jojoba, almond, peach kernel, camellia seed, avocado and botanical keratin. What it does not say is the list of chemicals long enough to choke an elephant.</li>
            <li> Made a limp mess of my hair. Terrible</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I have very fine hair that I have to wash daily, sometimes more. My hair also tends to thin when I use regular sulfate shampoo. I used to pull out way too much hair every time I washed it, but since I&#x27;ve started using this the amount has decreased dramatically. It makes my hair feel cleaner, fuller, and the clean feeling lasts all day and night. The only downside for me is that it&#x27;s not necessarily color-safe, so I have to get my roots done a little more often. But that&#x27;s worth it to me for the results I get!</li>
            <li> love it will buy again</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo a lot, makes my hair and scalp feel great.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this shampoo. I have only used it a few times so far, but I have a feeling it is going to become a staple in my shower. The ingredients are completely natural. Lots of natural oils in it. It is sulfate free so it does no harm my hair dye. It has no distinguishable scent, which is okay by me. It is a very small bottle, but I&#x27;m not going to knock on that until I&#x27;ve used it long enough to tell whether it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for over a week and I&#x27;m 100% impressed. I dye my hair and after week 6, my hair starts to look orangie and dull, this shampoo completely revived my color and did a hair &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34;. My hair feels cleaner and healthier! I&#x27;ve tried the moroccon oil shampoo and conditioner at the salon and it doesn&#x27;t compare to this. Will be purchasing the conditioner in the near future. Hope this review help! :)</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling soft and rehydrated I don&#x27;t even need conditioner with this product it naturally tamed my wild curly hair</li>
            <li> I am a hair care product skeptic. I have used the same cheap shampoo for years and years, with good results...up until this past year. I was experiencing hair loss, and it was increasing by the week. Anxiety erupted before I would wash my hair, knowing I would see a handful of hair in the bottom of the shower. So I read and researched. Argan looked like a good fit, claiming it would reduce hair loss in a natural product sort of way, I decided to try it.  I am happy to say, that with the shampoo, and conditioner, I have noticed a reduction in hair loss.  I have also noticed that I do not need to wash my hair as often as I did with the other products. A co-worker said to me last week..&amp;#34;Your hair looks fuller&amp;#34; and I told her &amp;#34;I changed shampoos&amp;#34;. She laughed. I had to tell her about &amp;#34;Argan&amp;#34;.  So, this skeptic is ordering more shampoo and conditioner. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle. I will never go back to any other shampoo. It lathers very nicely. I&#x27;m pleased with the ingredients used. I also follow with their silk conditioner. Also a must have. Only thing, I wish they had bigger bottles, BUT, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this to get a good lather. I am very happy and I hope they continue making this forever!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Buying more!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it has the highest ratings among all other sulfate-free shampoos. The product itself does work its magic, after the first use my hair became very smooth and shine the next day. The only flaw would be the smell, kinda like melted plastic smell (?). I&#x27;ve tried other argan oil product but they usually smells pretty good. :/</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo i ever use, after pregancy i lost hope in my hair but this prove me wrong bit now software and mangerial and most important natural so i can breastfeed workout working a but clerical good product</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t suit my hair type maybe because I have curly hair it didn&#x27;t go very well with it</li>
            <li> I like this Sulfate Free shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t foam up like ordinary shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t have sulfate. But it smells wonderful and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly, and coarse. I read so many good reviews about this product that i gave it a try. It does leave your hair &amp;#34;Squeeky clean&amp;#34; with only a small amount but that Squeek means pretty much all of the natural oils were stripped from my hair. My hair is now a dry frizzy mess even after I used the silk 18 conditioner too. I&#x27;m back to square one trying to find a fix for my dry hair. :-/</li>
            <li> I just bought this for my 8 year old son whose hair is quite dry and stringy. We&#x27;ve only used for a few days now but I can already see and feel the difference in his hair. I also wanted to buy a product that was hypoallergenic and contained natural ingrediants. Your shampoo is phenomenal. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. By the way, my son loves it as well. He told it smelled awesome and he no longer has knots in his hair when combing. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> No big difference, and much higher in price then similar products</li>
            <li> A good shampoo at a good price. The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is that I wish I liked the scent more. I don&#x27;t like overly perfume-y products but I expected a more pleasant smell given the ingredients. Though it&#x27;s not a strong smell either.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing!!! really good for tangly hair...</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo for my over processed hair.</li>
            <li> I use this for shampoo and body wash. Leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean.  Smell is mild and pleasant. Suds up appropriately.  I try to support natural products like these because they&#x27;re good for both my health and the environment.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have come across for my eczema.</li>
            <li> I just received this product &amp; Absolutely LOVE  it! My hair is color treated &amp; this product leaves it soft &amp; silky &amp; the shine is incredible! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants soft, beautiful, healthy shiny hair ♡</li>
            <li> Fell in love with Argan Oil Shampoo from the first time. It really did repair my damaged hair. After wash with this shampoo my hair  look shiny and  healthy. I have medium length hair.This bottle lasted for almost 6 month because you really need only small amound of shampoo for a wash.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will get this shampoo again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking to find all natural products. While there&#x27;s a lot of unsettled science on many of the chemicals in our products, I&#x27;d rather not take a chance. It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find good value for all natural, especially among shampoos. I love how the Argan Oil shampoo makes my hair feel. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out like a lot of other shampoos. It&#x27;s also such a good price. This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought it and I love it!</li>
            <li> So far so good! Only used this once but it has made my hair much softer and easier to handle while brushing. I didn&#x27;t need to use that much product in order to get a good coverage but I also have thin hair so that must help. I will try their other products since this one was quite nice. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and recently I have highlights to mix with my silver strands. Even though I eat clean, use organic hair products my hair has been very dry. Got Silk conditioner and Argan oil Shampoo a week ago, and so far I&#x27;ve used both in combination 3 times. Seems like my hair feels little softer. Will update in 1 month.</li>
            <li> As much as I want to give this product a great review, I can&#x27;t. I love maple holistics and it&#x27;s natural glowing products but this shampoo just made my hair stringy and dry; however, it did wonders for my natural hair. I am a black woman with a 4a/b hair texture. I am in transition from perm damaged hair to natural hair. It&#x27;s a process But sadly this didn&#x27;t do the trick. It did a good job with the natural part of my hair but as for the remainder it was just hard and dry. I will finish the bottle but I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll buy another one. The silk 18 conditioner though is something I am willing to try and hopefully I will enjoy it. At the moment I am using another conditioner and that saved my hair from this shampoo lol. I would love to give you guys a great review just because I think it didn&#x27;t work for me since I am transitioning. As much as this kills me I have to give 3 stars. I will look forward to using this product again once my hair becomes fully natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I decided to chop off my perm damaged hair and just go natural!!!! No matter how short... Luckily I had more natural hair than I thought and I have a cute little Afro.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I remember commenting about this product and my difficulties with it, so I decided to try it again with just natural hair. I have to say I love thus product; it cleaned my hair and it DID NOT dry out my curls. I was shocked; instead it curled then even more!!!! I love this shampoo so I am back to remake this from a 3/5 to a 5/5&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this shampoo from now on. It&#x27;s worth it and it has a nice faint smell to me. It&#x27;s fun to wash my fro now without the hassle of breakage and dry outs.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and I recommend you guys with natural coily 4a/b/c hair textures to give it a try. It&#x27;s totally worth it. I am so happy I didn&#x27;t through it out the first time I used it. I am very happy with the results and I am now a regular customer!!! Well will be lol</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a lot of chemicals in my hair, but have had a hard time finding a natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and frizzy.  I also find many shampoos of all types are too smelly.  This shampoo leaves my hair moisturized and does not smell too much.  This very light fragrance is fine for men and women.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product for the first time and have been using it for about a week and I absolutely love it! It leaves my hair feeling so silky and shiny. I also have colored hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave the color looking dull. I feel great using this product because it&#x27;s sulfate free and I know I&#x27;m not stripping the natural oils from my hair. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The first wash did nothing special to my hair. Second wash, still no difference. But third wash onwards, the lumps of hair during hair wash just reduced significantly. I have very frizzy and dry hair and have been having severe hair loss for the past 3 years. I use the Silk 18 conditioner after shampooing and my hair feels softer now. So far, so good. Only concern is that my hair is thick and uses up a lot of shampoo and conditioner. I will not be able to use this for more than 10 washes. But it is still more affordable than the other hair fall control shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of shampoos make my head itchy and hair dry, and I narrowed it down to sulfates. Once I started using shampoos without them, my hair started looking a lot healthier and I could curl it easier for some reason, too. I got a chance to purchase this with a discount, so I decided to take the plunge to see if more expensive shampoos make a difference. I&#x27;m sort of annoyed to say it does, because I am such a cheapskate. Ugh! Dang it. It feels like I&#x27;ve been ruined off grocery store shampoos forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the ingredients in this one and saw things like argan oil and camellia seed oil. The latter is a super traditional oil known for making hair nice and shiny in my culture, so I knew this shampoo would be good. And unlike a lot of sulfate-free shampoos, this cleans and foams really well! I love it. I also like that the smell (although very pleasant) isn&#x27;t so strong or too lingering. It lingers enough to make my hair smell softly clean when I sniff it, but it doesn&#x27;t punch me in the nose with strong perfumes every time I brush it or take it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have very low-maintenance undyed, thick straight hair that doesn&#x27;t need to be washed every day.</li>
            <li> I grew used to purchasing the cheapest shampoo from the store and my hair reflected that. Finally, I decided to upgrade and see how my hair would respond. I bought this Argan Oil shampoo made by Maple Holistics and was pleasantly surprised with the results. It gave some life to my previously wiry hair. I recently started growing facial hair and used this on my beard and it did not dry out my face.  This shampoo has a neutral smell; it doesn&#x27;t give off much of an aroma. I like that because my previous shampoos were overpowering at times. It also builds a nice lather, which I was concerned about since I hadn&#x27;t used a natural shampoo before.</li>
            <li> Worked very well left my hair feeling soft and smooth. It felt very clean as well as moisturized.</li>
            <li> Great product! Usually after I dye my hair it gets really dry but I&#x27;ve been using this plus the Silk 18 and my hair is keeping it&#x27;s color and isn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> It lathers surprisingly well, just as well as those shampoos filled with sulfates and whatnot.  My hair feels clean and light, and I haven&#x27;t experienced an oily scalp or dry ends.  It really feels exactly the way a shampoo should... clean.  It&#x27;s pretty much scentless so I&#x27;m considering adding a few drops of essential oil.  Overall, I recommend.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Shipment is fast! Smells great and leave my hair smelling fresh and smooth!!</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying using this shampoo. The bottle was a bit smaller than I expected. Other non-organic shampoos that I&#x27;ve used seem to make my hair extremely dry. After using this shampoo for a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is shinier and more hydrated. I&#x27;m definitely using this product in the future.</li>

            <li> Bottle small but love the feel of my hair. This is great stuff.  It leaves my hair soft and full looking... Will continue to purchase...</li>
            <li> I have long black hair. My hair is thin and weak and gets oily easily. I always washed my hair twice because of my oily hair. But after I used this Argan Oil Shampoo, I only wash my hair once. It does not have any artificial scent which is one of the strengths of this product. Also my hair got softener and stronger then before. My friend gave this shampoo as a present before and I was really satisfied with this product. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m pruchasing it again. Overall, I like this Argan Oil Shampoo!!</li>
            <li> In the past one year +, I&#x27;ve changed all of my house products to all chemical free products. Cleaning products like laundry detergent, dish washing detergent, wipes, products to clean the shower and the floors. Also, all of my soaps, body and face lotion, and even hand sanitizers are now all chemical free and with either essential oils or natural products. We only buy groceries that are organic and pesticide-free. We&#x27;re very conscious about what we use in our house and what we put in our body. Basically any product that our bodies will be in contact with or that we&#x27;ll be breathing the air filled with that product, we&#x27;re very intentional about getting a product that will not harm our bodies and have other side effects later in life. Even our medication for cold or flu, allergies or sinuses, are all natural and from plants and essential oils. We use essential oils for our headaches, immune system, allergies, stress, and for our digestion. We love all that is natural and that comes from nature! That being said, we&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo product for a while that fits all of our &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;holistic&amp;#34; lifestyle and we fell in love with the Argan Oil Shampoo! This is already my fourth shampoo and we always keep on coming back for this shampoo! We recommend this shampoo to all of our fiends and we&#x27;re so happy that we found it!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! I use this with Silk12, and my hair feels a lot better than when I used normal commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li> I purchased the argan oil shampoo and conditioner. They both work very well on my dry hair which make my hair shiny. Most importantly, their products contain no harmful ingredients such as sulfates. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the smell, since I really like the aroma of the Winter Blend Shampoo. I was disappointed, because the Honey and Vanilla aroma is nonexistent. The Argan Shampoo smell is more like Elmer&#x27;s glue or rancid oil; neither are subtle or soothing. Honestly it was hard to get past the smell. The shampoo feels like it strips all the natural oils out of my hair, definitely not an everyday shampoo. If it wasn&#x27;t for the Silk18 Conditioner (which is fabulous) I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a stand-alone product.  Update: I have normal to oily hair and a very sensitive scalp. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation: No flakiness, itchiness, redness, or tightness. Happy to say, The Maple Holistics Team responded to my review and issued me a coupon to try a different product. Excellent Customer Service!</li>
            <li> Love it, but a little to pricey</li>
            <li> Not for me. My hairs are thinning. I hoped that this would add some volume to it but it didn&#x27;t. My scalp also has skin problems sometimes, quite sensitive to shampoos in general. I was hoping this product would suit with my scalp but it didn&#x27;t. I would mind trying other products since the company really focuses on using all natural ingredients. It sounds better than other products which use whatever chemicals available.</li>
            <li> Lots of lather.... You need very little,  leave hair soft .  Very nice.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have been doing Keratin treatments for a while now, if you do thise kind of treatment you need a shampoo that is sulfate free. Not only Argan oil shampoo is sulfate free, it smells nice and the convination of the keratin treatment (now available in amazon too: Brazilian Keratin Hair Treatment 300ml Professional Complex) and this shapoo makes my hair so soft as baby hair. It shines, it has weight it&#x27;s just easy to handle and last clean for a while (yes, I do not wash it every day, who has time for that?).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway great results!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and have had trouble with sulfate-free shampoos leaving my hair limp, in the past.  Not so with this shampoo, it has a nice bit of lather and cleans really well.  I did not find that it dried my hair out, as other reviewers have suggested.  I bought this with the Silk 18 Conditioner and actually prefer the shampoo as I have to use a TON of the conditioner to get good results.</li>
            <li> I have colored treated hair and this shampoo does wonders for it.  I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase and will definitely re-order the product.</li>
            <li> we really love this shampoo and my husband said it really helped his scalp.  He has very oily hair and his scalp often feels itchy.  He said this really helped soothe his scalp and it left his hair soft and very clean feeling.  I love this shampoo as it can be used for color treated hair and leaves it very soft and manageable.  We loved this so much we ordered the shampoo again and this time got the conditioner to go with it.  I color my hair and needed something gentle that would leave my hair shiny and not greasy.  These products are awesome and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> best shampoo i have ever used, will not stop using this product as long as it is work for me. my hair is thicker and falls less</li>
            <li> I have been taking daily chemo pills for eight years. During this time I have developed a severe skin sensitivity, especially on my scalp.  Since I have to take this medication the rest of my life, I have gone from product to product, drugstore brand to expensive brands to prescription brands, at least 15 different products. Every product has caused burning of my scalp at least until it dries, then itches thereafter. It has nearly driven me crazy with the burning. The closest thing to helping was Wen brand. It still burned somewhat but was better for a few months then got worse. Plus it is expensive and you&#x27;re forced to be on auto ship, which I do not like because my hair is fine, thin, and short. You can&#x27;t possibly use as much product as they ship automatically. Then I tried this product.  OMG - my scalp does not burn or itch! I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and still no problem. I cannot tell you how happy I am to have discovered this product. I will be ordering the conditioner soon. I did not buy it up front because, frankly, I didn&#x27;t have much hope it would be any better than all the others. Someone suggested the good reviews are because you can get a free product.  Why would you want a free product if you didn&#x27;t like it in the first place?  I want nothing in return for this review. It may not work for everyone, but for me it is a blessing.</li>
            <li> So far I like it - how it feels.  My hair feels a little softer.  I am only giving 4 stars because it&#x27;s going to taken more to see if there are real changes in my hair.  My hair has suffered due to some health issues.  In short, I am hoping with love and care, restoration will happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost forgot - product delivery was seamlessly  arrived on time and perfectly packaged.</li>
            <li> This is a great Natural Shampoo.  I have allergies especially with smells that are too strong (perfume like).  This shampoo smells so good and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It also makes my hair look great and makes me at peace to know that there are no additive chemicals. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Up until recently I had been using sulfate shampoos, but I recently learned that it has the capacity to strip good cultures from your head and other damage. Though I&#x27;ve only started using it, I can already tell it&#x27;s much more healthy than your conventional shampoo. The smell is not the best, something like a honey-almond smell. But that&#x27;s not really anything to be concerned about.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair very nice and was used with Silk 18 conditioner.  I was pleased with the results.  Have only used it once but I think it is going to help.  My hair felt like straw and would not do anything.  After the wash it was smooth  and soft.  I am encouraged.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  It smells good, lathers up just enough, and rinses out leaving my hair feeling clean and smooth. I use the silk18 conditioner with it for best results overall.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 4 weeks and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an advocate of using all natural personal care products (my husband and I have a business offering affordable natural skin care products) So quality and affordability are a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several different brands and my favorite brand that works great is very expensive to ship so I have been on the hunt for a great shampoo that will take away my hairline dandruff/dry scalp and itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product HAS taken away the itchiness, but HAS NOT taken the dandruff/dry scalp from my hairline away. I figured I would try this and work my way through other products the company offers if it gave me some relief. Which is has. I really like the product and will continue to use it...I will need to try one of the specific dandruff shampoos to see what that does. I do find that a small amount like a nickel to a quarter size amount at most is all that is needed. I use it everyday to every other day and will not need to replace this for a few months. Well worth the price for what you get. I do find that when you rinse it out I get a straw like feeling in my hair, but with the Silk 18 conditioner that goes away quickly and leaves my hair silky soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today, lathered well and my hair felt full and clean. This Shampoo made my hair amazingly soft and actually makes it shiner and healthier.</li>
            <li> I was searching a sulfate-free shampoo and bought this one. In the past, I&#x27;ve tried Jason and Nature Gate products but I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied. I have now tried the Argan Oil shampoo and I am very pleased. You need less shampoo, and the clean hair lasts longer. I also didn&#x27;t need hair conditioner - the hair is very soft! I will probably buy this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and it does a nice job making your hair feel clean without drying out.  I will most certainly purchase again and make it my daily shampoo.  It has a nice lather too.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really let my hair so shine.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing this shampoo and didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Well I was pleasantly surprised how great my hair and scalp felt. Plus it smells good too, will definitely will buy it again</li>
            <li> I have been using this for last two months.&lt;br /&gt;I have grey hair , so i do color regularly to hide grey and product is very good for colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thought i have not seen drastic change after using this product but its good for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this, till i am getting any better than this.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> the actual ingredients i order this for are the last on the list so that means the least amount. other than that didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. wont order again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo, believe it or not his hair is starting to grow. Will highly recommend it,</li>
            <li> Is an overall good Shampoo! Very pleased! Would recommend. Smells good, leaves hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually unruly and curly, just came back from vacation from India which made it much more worse. I was using Wella products before and was planning to switch to sulfate free products. I am a fan of Amazon, so started searching around and stumbled upon maple holistics products and noticed plenty of positive reviews. I decided to give it a try and used it first time today. My hair is now back to where it was before the vacation, and I hope few more washes will make my hair much more manageable. I didnt like the smell though as it smelled more like a medicine(tonic), but the good thing is after the wash it didnt linger around. I used silk 18 conditioner after shampooing my hair. Love the part that its sulfate free and 100% all natural ingredients :)</li>
            <li> Argan oil sampoo is perfect for my hair. Recently I had an keratin treatment on my hair and wanted to use a sulfate free sampoo. Then luckly I bought Argon oil and it works so well with my hair. I loved it. It does not make my hair dry. Personally, I don&#x27;t like to use a sampoo with strong odor. This is the another reason why I liked as it does not have any strong odor. I strongly recommend this sampoo!!</li>
            <li> Amazing for those who need moisturizing properties for their everyday shampoo. I love that this shampoo is all natural!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that finally I found a perfect hair products.I use to have an allergic reaction for regular shampoo and my head was inching all the time.But after Argan shampoo and conditioner my scalp is not irritating and hair is silky and shiny.Its totally organic and free of harmful ingredients products.I just ordered different kind this time because I want to try all of them:)I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> While I enjoy the fact that it has argan in it and is sulfate free... The scent is not as pleasant as I expected it to be. You can&#x27;t smell the jojoba at all, which I expected the scent to be. Its not even vanilla like another reviewer said it would be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; beauty product quest. I tried a few other natural shampoos but they made my hair knotty after washing and my hair started falling out (from the tugging of washing my hair). I got this shampoo and I LOVE IT. I&#x27;m totally sold on this shampoo and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I did not find much difference, in fact, my hair started falling after using this shampoo. It did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I think that this is a very high quality product. Nothing miraculous but a solid healthy alternative for good shampoos.</li>
            <li> I just tried this shampoo and really like it.  It doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance and my hair feels really clean after washing with it.  I will continue to try products from this line in the future.</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics with it&#x27;s Argan oil shampoo has helped my dry scalp more than any of the other dandruff shampoos, such as T-GEL, head AND SHOULDERS AND PERT ANTI-DANDRUFF. ALONG WITH SILK18 CONDITIONER HAS LEFT MY SCALP BETTER THAN EVER. NO MORE DANDRUFF OR DRY SCALP. It was delivered on time and package well. I use it every 2 days. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have gotten into organic and chemical free products lately and was looking for a new shampoo and most were way too expensive. Natural Holistics keeps their products at a reasonable price. As a male I love that this shampoo is also fragrance free. Having the slick back look I always look for hair product with shine and that is one of the reasons I chose this specific product. After using this product I&#x27;m more than satisfied with it seeing the extra shine I didn&#x27;t have before.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a really good shampoo, cleans the hair well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp unlike other shampoos. I expected my hair to be more silkier after using it, but maybe you&#x27;re supposed to use it with the same conditioner for best results.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo.....there is another I like as well - but wanted to try this.  Seems like it foams a little too much for me as I use it as my &amp;#34;second&amp;#34; wash after using a &#x27;cowash&#x27; the first time.  Leaves hair very moist though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the bottle especially, hard to get shampoo out. Wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed by the shampoo either. Didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like I wanted it. Too bad because I really wanted to use cruelty free products. This one just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
            <li> Although it has chemicals - it&#x27;s not entirely organic - if you water it down - your hair will et shiny-clean. I wish they kept it all natural that&#x27;s my only issue.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice so far. I have very curly hair. The first time my hair felt very dry... The second time I pre-poo my hair with oil, and did a protein treatment. It came out better the second time, but I think I would go back to using Aveeno shampoo unless Maple Holistics other shampoos works better.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of my hair when it was wet, but it do much for the dryness.</li>
            <li> I have been using argan shampoo for a few months now. I love all the natural ingredients in the shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair feel healthy without all the crazy ingredients others put in there shampoo. I would recommend this shampoo for anyone that would like to try a &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by smell! It so... Amazingly incredibly nice! I&#x27;ve already using this product for a few weeks, and it seems to me that my hear looks much better, much brilliant. I&#x27;d like to buy one more, for my sister!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo ~ it only took one use of another product to send me back and I ordered two bottles! Customer service from Maple Holistics is genuine. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I bought it twice and the makers even followed up with an email to see what I thought.  The bottle may be small but it&#x27;s thick and you&#x27;ll use much less at a time than other regular brands. I think it&#x27;s good to have this for about three time a week (if you was every day) or every other wash if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I considered chopping off my hair because it had become dry, lifeless, fragile and brittle. Today, I received the argon oil shampoo and silk 18 conditioner. additionally, I used the HSI heat protectant. Can you say &#x27;thoroughly impressed&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;Immediately, my hair felt silky and was tangle-free. Before, I combed thru my hair slowly, petrified after seeing with each pass strands of frayed hair in the comb. The combination of these products have been a hair-savior. I can&#x27;t wait to show-off my hair!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice shampoo, it has a very pleasant mild scent, nice thick lather, worked very nicely on my curly, sometimes frizzy hair.  Left my hair feeling very silky.  I would probably want to use the conditioner also, as I usually use both on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am 26. I used to have nice thick long hair. But that was before diabetes took a lot of it. I have been searching and trying new products constantly. Not to grow my hair back, but to find something that made the hair I have left healthier. So I wont lose anymore. Well, I found this. My hair is no longer coming out in clumps in the shower. It is shiny. It Is soft and it just looks so much healthier. Whatever is in this product works for me. I am happy!</li>
            <li> before i got this i did read the reviews and i kept seeing everyone complaining about how it leaves your hair dry. since i had a gift card i decided why not give it a try especially since everyone has different hair types maybe it may not dry my hair since my hair is very thick. well unfortunatly that was not the case my hair is soft but it looks like almost all my strands are separated like a broom :(. i am not buying this again i did like the smell but other than that not a good product which is a bummer since it has so many good oils :(</li>
            <li> Good product and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Use it for the first time today 07 25 2015, I will definite write as I use, so far it fine. Left my hair feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this company pays people on FiverR to get fake 5 stars.  I am still going through break outs 5 months or so since the time I tried this.....    Makes skin feel oily all over.  It&#x27;s clogging pores in other places!  BEWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF BREAKING OUT!</li>
            <li> I am very surprised of the quality of this product. This is the best shampoo I ever used and I am not young. I am going to reorder soon because my wife love it too after only one wash. Simply it is a great product and a little goes a long way. I am not sure only about that vanilla smell on my head I wish it could me something else (more masculine).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. I have dry and thin hair. I  have been using this product for three weeks now. I have noticed a big difference in softness, more shiny, more body. Using it with Silk 18 natural conditioner. love it:)&lt;br /&gt;cost is slightly high for me, but I will invest the money if the product does what it says!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Maple Holistic&#x27;s silk vanilla conditioner for quite a while now and noticed a big difference in the texture and manageability  of my hair with just that and another brand of shampoo. I decided to go full Maple Holistic force and use their Argan oil shampoo along with the silk vanilla conditioner. Just after one time of using, I immediately noticed my scalp and hair feeling cleaner as I rinsed it out. Not stripped and tangled like some shampoos leave you feeling and definitely not coated like many of my shampoos for dry, damaged hair leave me feeling. This just makes me feel clean, as simple as that. Paired with the silk conditioner, my hair felt much lighter, combed through easily in the shower and after applying my natural  products (I use pure argon oil and a bit of shea moisture curl milk then let air dry). My hair is very thick, course and wavy as well as color-treated. It tangles easily and usually feels very dry. I&#x27;m just on the 2nd application of the shampoo and conditioner together and I am loving how they work together to make my hair so light and my waves are looking much cleaner with a beachy look without the frizziness I usually have.</li>
            <li> I see it&#x27;s mostly woman who have left reviews on this product, so here&#x27;s a little something for the fellas curious about this shampoo. I am about a week in to using this product and I couldn&#x27;t be happier, as I am changing my diet to mostly raw foods I wanted to change the products on the outside as well. I have short thin hair and this product works great for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my hair is soft shiny and smells great, plus I feel good about using it as there is no animal testing and no harmful or unknown ingredients!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Decent product, but it didn&#x27;t work for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, Full list of ingredients (which i really appreciate), but did slightly dry my hair out (In all fairness everything drys my hair out)&lt;br /&gt;  Worth trying!  if you don&#x27;t have extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks. Clean, soft and shine. I used to use a product after washing my hair to make it look good, and I don&#x27;t use anymore. And shines even more just with the shampoo and conditioner from Maple Holistics. Thank you for this great product.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff ;made a difference after one use read and follow the direction .I&#x27;m very happy &#x27;stoked I tell ya&amp;#34; smells like tart cherry</li>
            <li> This is a lovely shampoo if you are looking for something natural that you can use every day.  I have a very dry scalp and it keeps my hair and scalp sufficiently moist without an extra conditioner, even when I use it every day.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I am very pleased with the results.  I just bought a second bottle, even though I still have about half of the first bottle to go.  I would have given it a 5 star review, except I thought the price was a little steep for an 8 oz bottle.  Still, you get what you pay for, and I think this is worth it.</li>
            <li> In an effort to lower my families exposure to xenoestrogens such as sodium lauryl sulfate and other chemicals found in many shampoos and cleaning products I chose Maple Holistics.  I researched a lot of different brands and felt that buying from this company I would get the best quality with a resonable price point.  My wife and I have been very happy with the results.  My wife&#x27;s hair looks the best it&#x27;s looked since we were dating and my hair feels and looks so much better and my sister in law who stayed with us used it and wants to buy some as well.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I purchased this but I am sad to say that it made my hair dry and after shampooing, I came out with a bird nest at the back of my head. My hair did not feel any softer or shiner. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Shampooing at its best. Wonderful smell. Makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really good leaves the hair moisturized nice thick consistency and has a tropical fruity smell wonder if there is an matching conditioner because it would be a perfect combo and most likely give you the full benefit of the shampoo that&#x27;s the only downside in my opinion. It also lathers wonderfully a little goes a long way so be light handed this is a great shampoo for natural hair also</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever. Just a bit expensive but I have tried so many other shampoos including dove but they just weigh down your hair and the hair looks greasy the second day of wash. This shampoo  one the other hand visibly soothes your hair no matter what kind of hair you have; straight, curly, wavy. It gets rid of flyaways and brings out your hair without the greasy look. Another cool thing is that you can see all this after your first use.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the smell of the shampoo, and like that it&#x27;s sulfate free! Any shampoo now a days strips your hair of its natural oils and I like that this doesn&#x27;t. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> If you have keratine done and have some of normal to oily this shampoo is the remedy.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair look good. Hands down to this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and my hair just keeps on getting better and better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!! I felt a difference in my hair after the first wash but the overall look and appearance of my hair seems to continue getting better after each wash. I have a problem with hair products irritating my scalp by causing bumps and itchiness and/or drying it out. This product does neither of those things. I&#x27;ve found that massaging it into your scalp and even letting it sit for awhile before rinsing is nice. This product does not weigh my hair down but tames the friziness. Also, a little goes a long way!  The ONLY reason i took a star off is because i wish this product was available in a larger size...preferably with a pump! I cannot wait to try more maple holistics products!</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo because I enjoyed the other Maple Holistic shampoos. I just received it last week and have been using it for 3 days. The smell is pleasant and it left my hair soft. I only use sulfate-free products now and will continue to use Maple Holistics (made in the USA!)  This is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product and the fact that my hair was shining after the first use!</li>
            <li> This is honestly an awesome shampoo. I needed a sulfate free shampoo because of my hair type. 3C/4A. Now this is something I can stick with! Has a very clean smell and gives plenty of slip. Even without a conditioner I could feel that my hair was stripped of its natural oils which us brown girls definitely don&#x27;t need. I will be trying out everything in the line and see which one I like best!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo with nutrients and enriching properties, especially since I have been coloring my hair for about six months now. I want to prevent my hair from thinning and it has always been dry so conditioners have always been important.  This shampoo leaves my hair shining and it is much easier to style and control after washing it.  I find it has qualities of a conditioner as well as keeping the hair clean.  It does seem to need more than some other shampoos in order to lather.  That is the only drawback I could find but I certainly recommend it for others to use.  I would give it four and half stars.  I received a discount to buy this product in return for writing a review.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo! Make sire you get the conditioner along with it. It leaves your hair feeling amazing after a long day of swimming and exposing your hair to chlorine. Very happy with the product and shipping is always very quick!!</li>
            <li> The WORST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!!!  Bargain dish soap would have been better.  I have thick shoulder length hair and had a hard time rinsing out the shampoo, my hair was so matted.  After using their JUNK conditioner, I still had a hard time combing it out.  My hair now looks like a well used Brillo Pad.  Now I know why they get such good reviews, the offer the possibility of free products if you give the great reviews.  I wouldn&#x27;t use there products for FREE!!!!</li>
            <li> This is pointless to buy. For like $14 it is not worth it, it made no difference in my hair from my Pantene I use. Also you&#x27;d think it smells good but it doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell I&#x27;d say maybe a slight glue-like smell kinda even looked like it so if you want me opinion- not worth buying. It&#x27;s like the same price as biolage and I&#x27;d much rather buy that way more worth it and it actually makes my hair feel amazing unlike this waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for my hair. I used this shampoo twice, and it doesn&#x27;t give good results.</li>
            <li> Very different from anything else. A surprising dense foam that leaves your hair feeling remarkably clean and fresh. The Silk 18 conditioner really makes your hair shine. A noticeable difference from the very first time. I want to try the Tea Tree formula as well.</li>
            <li> love. awesome smell too</li>
            <li> Feels a bit glue like and smells odd but it works good.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo in combination with the Silk 18 conditioner and let me tell you, it works wonders! I had tried everything from the baking soda and apple cider vinegar to shampoo bars but nothing was helping with my scalp problems ): UNTIL I did some extensive research and finally decided on trying this amazing stuff! I was skeptical at first because I know how a lot of times when you buy something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; a lot of times its NOT but after reviewing the ingredients, I have no qualms and I think that for the quality, the price is definitely justifiable. I think this will be my go to shampoo for a loooong time! Oh and also, the silk 18 conditioner is a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> Its a hit with me. Im African American and I have length, coarseness, curliness and thickness. Ive broken plenty combs &amp; when my hair is braided its take 2 people. So for me it is very hard to find good natural products from head to toe. My hair texture after felt much softer and not like i had just stripped my hair of every nutrient in order to clean it like other chemical enhanced shampoos. It smells great &amp; the smell isnt overwhelming but it could use a little more potency though, im a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; fanatic. My biggest notice is the texture of my hair itself, usually the other shampoos left it dry &amp; flaky right after washing and even with try conditioning it to replace what the shampoo stripped. I been scratching my scalp to see if dandruff or flakes gather under my nails, so far it sees to be taking care of that issue as well. Less hair come out in my combs when trying to detangle after washing as well. Also my hair didnt feel hard or stringy after. I will continue buying this.  As far as misses, i have very thick hair with curly roots so it takes a good amount to wash and clean thoroughly so a bigger size would be nice. Or discounts for purchasing multiple bottles. Also a more potent smell.   After the try/first use I mixed it w/ACURE Shampoo Moroccan Argan Oil + Argan Stem Cell 8 oz because I couldnt choose which one, so i originally bought both. I bought both because each had different ingredients. My hair is still improving after mixing.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo, I don&#x27;t use every day is again be hard on my hair, when I do use it is awesome that makes my hair very manageable pictures</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair softer than ever. I love this shampoo. I color my hair with henna and indigo, and was looking for SLS-free shampoo that&#x27;s color-safe, and this is great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers wrote that this shampoo is too drying, but I think it&#x27;s because this shampoo is little concentrated and lots of people use the same amount as other shampoos. My suggestion is to try a dime size first (if you have short hair, maybe less); get small amount on your palm and add little water and lather well first, then shampoo your hair. I was surprised such small amount generates so much lather. I have medium length thick Asian hair, and dime size is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Silk18 conditioner, and it works great to condition my hair too.</li>
            <li> this shampoo cleans scalp but makes hair dry. I am looking for a product which cleans scalp as well as gives moisture and volume to hair naturally. eventhough after applying shampoo i used silk 18 conditioner but conditoner makes my hair soft doesnt give volume.</li>
            <li> Honestly, at first I was a bit skeptical, for I really did not think that this shampoo with all its seemingly wild ingredients would really be able to get my hair clean enough without normal soap!  You know &amp;#34;good old soap&amp;#34; full of &amp;#34;good old&amp;#34; sulfates which I understand strip your hair of its own natural oils.  My problem however is that my hair is very oily, so much so that I must shampoo quite often, and when I miss my hair looks and feels so oily that I can&#x27;t wait to wash it.  I really did not think that the product would lather very much, but when I squeezed out just a little onto my hand and started to wash my hair I was surprised at the amount of lather, no it was not as much as my old shampoo, but more then enough!  I was so happy after my first use,  for I could tell right away that my hair was squeaky clean; however, the real test came later on when I missed washing my hair one day!  The product cut right through the oil and dirt in my hair and agin made my hair squeaky clean!  I was so pleased indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was just about to give this product only four stars, just because of the slightly high price, but then I realized how little you have to use each time, only a spot in your hand the size of a quarter, and this small amount will cut through all the oil and dirt on anyone&#x27;s head.  This I am sure!  So, rethinking it all again, I will have to honestly give this product  a perfect score, for just a small amount of product to do the job it did for me is worth the money, not to mention that it is simply more healthy for my hair all around!</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I ordered for myself. I have tried n number of shampoos and hair conditioner but still suffered from constant hair loss. It was a never ending quest for the perfect shampoo - conditioner I wanted. Then I came across this product on Amazon, while searching for that perfect shampoo/ conditioner. Thought , huh looks natural , I might as well try it. I did see rave reviews but wasn&#x27;t sure and then I ordered it. Oh boy, just after few washes my hair loss reduced significantly. Very little of it is required and it creates soft lather. Coupled with similar conditioner, my hair literally felt like spa. My hair are soft and manageable after each use. I am a fan now and just ordered a silk conditioner too. Super excited.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was okay.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a reduced price and love it!! I have only been using it for about a week now and have already noticed a difference in how my hair looks and feels. I would definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li> I have very very dry hair and this shampoo is the only product worked on my hair! I used to spend hours trying to smooth my hair using expensive products, but since I ordered Argan my hair start responding to the treatment. I still have dry hair but at least it looks alive!</li>
            <li> I have thin and silky hair. Most of the shampoo&#x27;s ranging from pantene/dove to bolage volumizing range would either make it too dry that they can break easily or too silky to show any volume at all. I tried this shampoo and its amazing. I do not see as much hairfall or dryness. I usually use it with few drops of Argan oil applied to the roots when the hair is still a little wet and this has worked wonders for me. It provides just the right amount of conditioning and my hair feels healthier with decent volume.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel amazing</li>
            <li> Scent is wonderful and not over powering. Lathers really well, hair is clean.</li>
            <li> It dries out my scalp. Don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo wasn&#x27;t too bad it did smell good it just made my hair feel weird once I got it on. The Conditioner on the other hand made my hair sooo soft and I have very curl hair it made it easier to manage and the conditioner also even smelt very good. I Love putting the conditioner on and then leaving some on and towel drying leaves a great shine and smell.</li>
            <li> Incredible shampoo, I used to wash my hair daily because I have very oily scalp, with other shampoos my ends were so dry no matter how much I put oil on them, but with this one I found that it did balance the oils in my hair, my scalp is not as oily as it was and my ends get better with the oils I use to them, and I actually do not need to wash my hair everyday like I used to</li>
            <li> I received the shampoo one day ahead of schedule which is great. Other than that, I washed my hair right away but when it dried, my hair felt like the cuticle was rough and the whole head looks so dry. No other shampoo has ever let my hair feel so dry. No softness as others have said and the shampoo has no smell which might be a good thing but with all the botanicals in the ingredients, it should have some kind of good smell. I bought this shampoo due to raves from others and because it supposedly has no parabens and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> This product was horrible and dried my hair out really bad. Disappointed</li>
            <li> This Shampoo is excellent!  It cleans my scalp and hair well with only a small amount.  It makes my hair feel silky and manageable. It works very well with the silk 18 conditioner.  I plan to try more products by Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> I was happy with it for a while since it was natural but it lathered. But now after a few weeks of using it it has started to make my hair like hay and has brought back my scalp issues which had disappeared after I made the switch to completely natural shampoos. As much as I wanted to buy it again I don&#x27;t think I will be.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels great in my hair!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel nice. Not too strong of a scent, so it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a good shampoo and tried lots before I decided to try a natural shampoo instead, so I started searching for a good natural shampoo and was really anxious to finally get to try this one. So far, I&#x27;m not totally blown away or anything, but I do really like it! It smells nice but the scent is very mild, so it&#x27;s great if you do not want a strong smelling shampoo. Personally, I would prefer a bit stronger of a scent just because I like the aroma therapy effect I can get in the shower with a stronger scented shampoo, but all of those have a lot of chemicals, dyes, and artificial perfumes in them. It also made my scalp feel great and made my hair feel really clean afterward. I read a couple reviews from people that said this shampoo dried out their hair. I always use conditioner after I wash my hair, which is about twice a week, so I&#x27;ve never had that problem and didn&#x27;t when I used this shampoo and followed with a regular conditioner again. But just to see if it was drying, I decided to not use a conditioner the second time I tried it, and although my hair didn&#x27;t have the silkiness it gets from my conditioner, it wasn&#x27;t dry or straw-like either. It felt just fine and actually softer than when I&#x27;ve had to use a regular shampoo without conditioner in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really only have two issues with this shampoo: the price for the quantity and the hard to read and understand ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most I&#x27;ve ever spent on shampoo is $25 for a 25.35oz bottle of TIGI Diamond Dreams shampoo at my salon (much cheaper here on Amazon). That price will get you a 16oz bottle of this shampoo at Maple Holistics&#x27;s website (the bottle is $23.35) plus a few more dollars for shipping and you&#x27;ll spend more if you buy two 8oz bottles here on Amazon, although the Amazon price is a bit cheaper than the website price and shipping&#x27;s free if you have prime or do the $35+ purchase thing. Regular shampoos also lather right away, so you don&#x27;t REALLY need to wash your hair twice (ya know, the wash, rinse, repeat thing). With this shampoo, I did not get much lather the first time I washed my hair, so I felt like I needed to repeat. During the repeat wash, I got a really good lather and was really pleased! The same thing applied to the second time I used it (I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far). This means I&#x27;ll be paying up to twice as much for less product and be using twice as much product each time I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my above comparison was to non-natural shampoos. Let&#x27;s try another natural shampoo I used. I think it&#x27;s just called 100% Pure because that&#x27;s all it really says on the bottle lol. It was the cheapest one I could find before I found this one. It&#x27;s all natural and organic. There was barely any lather at all even on the repeat wash, and I felt like I had to use much more than the Maple Holistics shampoo just to cover my whole head. It also made my scalp dry and flaky which never happens and certainly did NOT happen with the argan oil shampoo. The 100% Pure shampoo was $25 for a 13oz bottle, and like I said, I had to use much more than the Maple Holistics shampoo, so it was more money for less product (well, I only bought an 8oz bottle here on Amazon, but 100% Pure is still more expensive) and I had to use about twice as much shampoo per shot than the argan oil stuff. Actually I think it was more. I had to use about two quarter sizes of the argan oil shampoo (one for the first wash and slightly more for the repeat) and for the 100% Pure stuff I used an amount a bit bigger than a silver dollar on the first wash and again on the repeat wash before I was satisfied. So that&#x27;s 50 cents versus two dollars :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I liked more about the 100% Pure shampoo was that on the ingredient list it had a laymen&#x27;s description in parentheses next to any ingredient that sounded complicated or foreign. So for example, next to &amp;#34;Fucus Vesiculosus&amp;#34; it had &amp;#34;(Kelp)&amp;#34; and next to &amp;#34;Tocopherol&amp;#34; it had &amp;#34;(Vitamin E)&amp;#34;. Maple Holistics does this with the last several ingredients, but mostly the ingredients list on this Maple Holistics shampoo is difficult to read and requires research if you want to really want to know it&#x27;s natural and understand what&#x27;s in it. I would love a bit more info on the ingredients in Maple Holistics products. So far I&#x27;m really just taking people&#x27;s word for it that it&#x27;s 100% natural and am still researching the ingredients a bit myself.&lt;br /&gt;For example, when I saw an ingredient like Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, I thought to myself &amp;#34;Heeeyyy....that doesn&#x27;t look like it would be a natural ingredient!&amp;#34;, so I looked it up and after some reading found the simplest explanation on truthinaging.com:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;...according to TriNature.com, it is a foaming agent that is derived from glucoside from coconut and corn. It is also used as a natural replacement for the ingredient known as sodium laureth sulfate, or SLES.&amp;#34;  So it comes from coconut and corn.&lt;br /&gt;I also looked up Sodium Lauroamphoacetate and according to naturopathica.com: &amp;#34;Sodium Lauroamphoacetate is a gentle, amphoteric foaming and cleansing agent derived from natural and renewable resources. Based on coconut oil, this mild ingredient creates excellent foam structure and feel.  It is bio-degradable and well tolerated by all skin types.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t finished looking up all the other ingredients. It would just be nice for there to be a simpler ingredients listed instead of the first two-thirds of the list looking like gibberish lol or for the bottle to come with a small info sheet on ALL the ingredients that you see in the list. Maple Holistics DOES try to cover the ingredients in the bottle on an information card I received with the shampoo, it just doesn&#x27;t go over the first two thirds of the list where the most complicated looking ingredients are that people would probably be most likely to suspect were made in a lab or something. ***The other option would be to do what naturopathica did and just put a list of product ingredients with their descriptions on the website instead of wasting paper on an info card or info sheet to send with the shampoo. Naturopathica put all of the ingredients in all of their products in an &amp;#34;ingredient glossary&amp;#34;.*** The 100% Pure shampoo I used had a relatively small and simple ingredient list, but the Maple Holistics shampoo does work much better, so my opinion is that the quality outweighs this con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So compared to non-natural shampoos, this shampoo is more expensive and may not be for people on a tight budget, but it gets my hair as clean, leaves my hair looking shinier, leaves my scalp feeling much better, and is healthier for my hair and scalp. Compared to other natural shampoos I&#x27;ve seen and the one I bought, the price is definitely better. Compared to the only other natural shampoo I tried (and many others according to other people), it lathers much better and I can use much less. It also, like I said, made my scalp feel much better than when I was using non-natural shampoos instead of worse like when I used the 100% Pure shampoo, and it made my hair look and feel better. The bottle&#x27;s also much prettier :P I really love it! In fact, I also bought the Maple Holistics Degrease shampoo because I&#x27;ll get bad build up every few months or so that doesn&#x27;t go away with regular washing, and I think I may put it in an empty argan oil shampoo bottle when I finish this one. &amp;#34;Degrease&amp;#34; is frankly something I would expect a product found in my garage to say, not my feminine, earthy, zen-y bath area :P.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was really happy with this shampoo, and I&#x27;m really looking forward to trying it with the Silk 18 conditioner which people say is the BEST combo ever. Despite being on a budget, I feel like the quality of this shampoo really is worth the price, so I do intend to buy this shampoo again when I run out - actually the bigger 16 oz bottle, and maybe 3 of them since there&#x27;s a discount on the website when you buy 2 or more - and I would definitely recommend at least trying this shampoo!</li>
            <li> So far I lIke it, love that is natural. It&#x27;s light but still soapy enough to get a good wash. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair dry though definitely needs more moisturizing ingredients. But would not change the brand did</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair really soft really shinny. Love it.</li>
            <li> it is a good product. I tried it for a couple weeks and my falling hair decreased, so I recommended it to all my family, my sister in law and my cousins.</li>
            <li> Horrid. Really the worst shampoo I have ever tried; I would actually rather Herbal Essences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made my dry flaky scalp even more dry, made my hair feel like straw. Also, the smell almost made my boyfriend throw up. I may as well have flushed $13 down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this because of the reviews, but it was a huge mistake. I have never been steered so wrong on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Smells really awesome, I hope it feels good to use.</li>
            <li> I have previously used this brand&#x27;s sage shampoo and liked it for the subtle, pleasant, natural fragrance. And as I have heard of the many benefits of argan oil I decided to try this one for my very dry scalp. I am hoping that in conjunction with spraying pure argan oil directly onto my scalp and the use of this shampoo I will be able to combat my dry scalp.  Will post an update as I find out!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money we r paying. please don&#x27;t go for it.</li>
            <li> Really made my hair feel like straw.  Not sure why so many people had such a good experience with it. I didn&#x27;t. Won&#x27;t be buying again. I do have hair color in my hair.  Maybe not good for colored hair. At least not for mine</li>
            <li> I will never use a different shampoo again!!!  I have long very thick hair and I use this and the conditioner and am extremely please with this product.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and this is a fairly drying shampoo, even for my oily scalp. Also, it smells nothing like vanilla. It has a strong soapy smell that isn&#x27;t appealing to me. This company makes a nice conditioner that has a lovely vanilla scent, and I was hoping this shampoo would be on par with that, but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s also pretty thick and a little difficult to wash out, which probably contributes to the drying effect. I&#x27;d buy the conditioner again, but they can keep their smelly shampoo.</li>
            <li> Totally sold on these products... I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li> like but it makes my hair oily the next day</li>
            <li> Creamy shampoo, sulfate free, long lasting, made in the USA, reasonably priced and did what I got it for - seems to moisturizer my scalp, not so itchy at the end of the day. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s hair products that make the top of my head itch, not dandruff or the like, but this shampoo would probably help a lot of scalp or dry hair problems. Cleans my hair without drying it out. I&#x27;m buying it again.</li>
            <li> Now that I tried this I can&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo this stuff is amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for anyone it&#x27;s the best there is!!&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair healthy and happy!! A little pricey for the size, but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is absolutely amazing. I have natural curly hair that grows fast and thick, and I color my hair all the time, and this revitalized my hair to almost like baby soft. It&#x27;s almost indescribable. You must use it for yourself to understand and appreciate it. I will never be able to use another shampoo!</li>
            <li> Now here is a shampoo i will use forever. (so please dont stop manufacturing it) I struggled for 4 years with hairfall, rough, dull and lifeless hair, after japanese rebonding my hair twice!! I finally read about Argan Oil Shampoo and I ordered it a month ago. My hair has improved so much, to begin with reduced hairfall and hair with some life. I logged on Amazon to order my next bottle and thought why not let customers know that you will not regrett using this shampoo. Its indeed different and works on my hair. Just happy with the way my hair looks now. Thank You Maple Holistics for creating such an awesome shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just got this and used it in a combo with the Silk 18. WOW. My hair feels amazingly soft! I have thin, curly, color-treated, dry hair, and I&#x27;ve been trying to find something natural, healthier for my hair, that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feel like hay. Really, my previous shampoo did that to me. This one works good for me, my hair didn&#x27;t feel as dry before I applied the condition, so I&#x27;ll keep using!</li>
            <li> This was not my favorite.  It could just be due to the sensitivity of my skin, head, etc.  But I did not like it, my hair was still oily and it made my head itchy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels different than any other product I’ve tried on my hair and scalp. As an active male with short hair, my scalp tends to get itchy with most shampoos on the market; especially if I skip a day. My scalp seems to really like something about this product. If I decide to skip a day or two of shampooing, I really don’t get that itchiness anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big plus about this product is the scent. Most shampoos on the market have extremely strong aromas. This stuff is quite mild. I would almost consider it scent-free. Also, a very small amount of product is needed to fully cover my hair, so it should last awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice for my daughter and I, It&#x27;s great and gives off a lot of suds. Our hair feels great, will definitely order/use this again.</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li> After having major surgery on my ear that involved an incision in my scalp, my hair was falling out dramatically. Normally, I have thick, naturally curly, color treated hair. It was important to me not to put any chemicals on already traumatized hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using sulfate free shampoo for years, part of a decision to live as organically as possible I used this shampoo twice now, and I&#x27;m very pleased. My hair feels clean, but more importantly it seems fuller. My hair is still coming out more than usual, but my doctor says this is normal after surgery (and being under anesthesia). Time will tell if a natural shampoo helps speed up the process. I plan on adding Silk 18 conditioner to my hair care based on the reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I like the way the shampoo smells, lathers, and thickens my hair. The customer follow up is outstanding, Maple Holistics seems actually concerned about selling a quality product.</li>
            <li> So far, so good after using it along with the natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love how nice it makes my hair, especially in used in tandem with the SILK conditioner!</li>
            <li> Was about to purchase the WEN product but found this item &amp; based on the reviews, wanted to give this a try!  I wash my hair  two times a week &amp; it gets greasy/oily pretty fast, especially using my previous shampoos, like the next day after a wash (Head &amp; Shoulders/Pantene)!  This product helps ease my hair getting too greasy/oily in the first 48hrs, which is big change for me!!  Gentle on my hair/scalp &amp; I don&#x27;t blow my hair (have shoulder length hair).  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Firstly I would like to say their after sales team/customer service team needs a huge applause because they really try to do everything in their power to make the purchase a great one. The product is really amazing and natural. It has a calming affect and the lather while usage is perfect to give you the satisfaction of a good clean wash.</li>
            <li> I love it. It works to my thick and curly hair. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had moderate dandruff and this has helped eliminate it. It lathers well on first application and even better if you follow the instructions for the second application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can see is that there is virtually no scent to this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t really bother me, but it is a shampoo after all and everyone expects a shampoo to make you hair smell nice.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and was skeptical that this would be able to clean my hair well. But this product worked better than I thought. After using the products for several days, my hair was smoother and silkier. Initially, I couldn&#x27;t comb my hair with a comb because it was so dead and tangled, but after shampooing with this product my hair was much smoother. Since I have oily hair, I think I should try the DeGrease shampoo first before giving this a 5 stars. But overall, this product worked fairly well and is perfect for those who want softer hair.</li>
            <li> I have colored curly thin hair which was damaged and frizzy for a long time. I started using this product along with a silk conditioner and it really makes a difference. Very much recommended.</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to be good quality but I actually gave it away.  I prefer 100% chemical free, and while this is close, its not.  I ordered by mistake and and tried to cancel nearly right after the order, but I couldnt.  I am giving it three stars because my friend who I gave it too said she like it and appreciated the non-harsh ingredients (I didnt feel like going through the hassle of a return on an inexpensive item).</li>
            <li> Not only can I stand the smell, my hair is so soft and manageable. I like this product a lot and it better for your hair because its sulfur free...</li>
            <li> I used the Argan Oil Shampoo for the first time today and all I can say is WOW! My hair has been a mess while trying to find a natural shampoo that will clean and nourish my hair. One use of the Argan Oil Shampoo completely transformed my hair! It went from dry, tangled, and oily to silky soft, tangle-free, and beautifully clean! I have never been able to get my hair to look and feel this good unless I&#x27;ve just come back from the hair salon. Try this product--it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Got it two days ago, and so far this has been FABULOUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just a small amount it&#x27;s enough to wash my hair and it feels so nice and silky, I love it! Although I do wish that there&#x27;s more shampoo in each bottle, but as they say, quality over quantity!</li>
            <li> I tried this Argan shampoo since I&#x27;ve used and loved the Sage shampoo by this company. The Sage shampoo is geared towards people with dandruff, and since I don&#x27;t have dandruff, I figured I&#x27;d try the Argan shampoo. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have long, thick, wavy and frizzy East Asian hair.  It&#x27;s normal to dry. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair and rarely use hair products (maybe a few times a year).  My usual brands are high end - R**k*n and S**s**do. Since shampoo/conditioner is basically the only product in my hair, it&#x27;s easy for me to compare one shampoo brand with another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that this Argan shampoo left my hair dry and frizzy. Argan oil is touted to help with frizziness, moisture and shine, but this shampoo did none of those things.  Even rinsing out the shampoo, I could tell this shampoo wouldn&#x27;t have the same success as the Sage shampoo for me. My hair ended up frizzy and dry, and dull in appearance, even with the Silk conditioner. Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan shampoo has the same consistency as the Sage shampoo, but no smell. The Sage shampoo scent is like aromatherapy to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: I think this Argan shampoo is better for oily hair. This shampoo left my thick, untreated, wavy East Asian hair frizzy and dry.  I&#x27;m going to stick with the Sage shampoo even though I don&#x27;t have dandruff, because the Sage shampoo leaves my hair amazingly soft, smooth and shiny, without me adding any styling products.  This Argan shampoo left my hair dry, dull and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  I was looking for a sulfate-free, more natural alternative to nourish my hair.  After using this product-- just a little goes a long way-- my hair was shiny, smooth and manageable.  I use this with Maple Holistic&#x27;s Silk 18 conditioner and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the richest most luxurious product I&#x27;ve ever used to wash my hair. The shampoo feels conditioning in itself but I also bought the conditioner which was magical. My hair was so soft and manageable after using it I didn&#x27;t have to put any other product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this combination and will repurchase again and again! Thank you for creating such wonderful products!</li>
            <li> Satisfied first time customer.  I was on the search for a shampoo that does not have sulfates and I ordered this from Amazon.  I like the way the shampoo lathers and feel great that I am not using a product that will damage my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice and soft!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I have coarse hair and if left it feeling baby soft. love the smell, too. My hair was shiny and bouncy after drying and styling.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of argan oil for several years now, and when I found this shampoo, it was a match made in heaven!  The reason I decided to try this shampoo was two-fold: I have suffered from eczema and psoriasis for most of my life, and as I am getting older, I&#x27;m finding that not only is my skin becoming more sensitive, but my flare-ups are much worse when I come in contact with chemicals and fragrances.  This also includes shampoos, which when rinsed off in the shower, were creating horrible rashes on my neck and chest, as well as my hands from having to use the shampoo in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company and upon request, received a free and very generous sample to try before making a purchase.  I was hesitant to try the product at first, fearing another breakout, but had high hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have a reaction to the natural ingredients.  WOW!  Was I ever surprised!  I tried the sample several times over the course of a week, just to see if I might develop a rash after the first attempt, but in fact, my skin started to clear up and my hair has never felt this soft and healthy!  Because the shampoo was such a success, I purchased the Silk 18 conditioner, and let me tell you--this stuff is amazing!  My ends were smoothed, and hair literally felt like silk after one use!  Not only that, but no break-outs and my hair smelled like sugar cookies :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since gotten rid of all of my family&#x27;s other hair care products--I am a customer for life!  If you have sensitive skin or just want to use more natural products, I would HIGHLY recommend both the Argan Oil shampoo and the Silk 18 conditioner--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s with straight, fine, flyaway hair--I don&#x27;t even need to brush my hair anymore :)</li>
            <li> Using very small amounts and it works great!  My hair was damaged from coloring and the sun. This product repaired my hair and helped it to grow. I highly recommend it, especially because it comes at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> my wife is currently breastfeeding our newborn son and has found much of her hair to be falling out because of it. while some hair loss is likely inevitable, we started looking for a healthier shampoo option than the standard shampoo we buy locally to hopefully lessen the damage. this shampoo seems to have done as good a job as we could hope for, we&#x27;re assuming by not being so harsh on the hair (without all the sulfates and whatnot apparently). my wife has also commented that her hair feels more bouncy and looks healthier, so that&#x27;s a plus. i don&#x27;t have tooooo much hair left on my head, so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell, but my hair seems to come out soft and healthy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only negative (which may not be an issue for many people) is that my wife feels that the shampoo, while putting it on in the shower, has an unpleasant smell (she says something along the lines of &amp;#34;burnt plastic&amp;#34;). i personally don&#x27;t think it smells too bad, but i wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s especially pleasant compared to what we might be used to. luckily, the smell isn&#x27;t present after the shower is over, but i guess you don&#x27;t get as much of the &amp;#34;ahhhh&amp;#34; clean feeling in the shower as with something that smells fresh and fragrant. it looks like maple holistics doesn&#x27;t use any fragrances (artificial at least) anyway, and i imagine the hair health benefits will outweigh this issue for most people, but it&#x27;s just something worth pointing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, seems to be a nice buy. i can&#x27;t say that you&#x27;ll have earth-shattering, clean and healthy hair after using this, but it might very well be overall better than what you&#x27;re currently using and is worth a try if you&#x27;re in the market for a healthier shampoo.</li>
            <li> It felt so smooth while applying on hair and I got a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling which I didn&#x27;t get from other shampoo products. All my family members likes this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfumed fragrance and feels like made from all natural ingredients. I bought this as my wife demanded to buy and now we all are happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using it. Honestly I have no idea about Argan oil or its advantages, but I like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and the Silk 18 conditioner too! The first time I used this product I was pleasantly surprised. I have used many different shampoos on my naturally wavy hair and this made it feel softer and cleaner than anything I&#x27;ve used before. My hair is super soft and shiny and smells wonderful. I will definitely order it again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have spent literally years looking for this product.  A family member has chemical sensitivity and it is almost impossible to find a shampoo that has no kind of smell.  The family member&#x27;s sensitivity is so extreme that even natural scents are a problem.  I beg Maple Holistics to NEVER change this benefit!  I really can&#x27;t afford the higher price, but my hair has become really damaged from other no scent shampoos that have no oils or moisturizing benefits so I am splurging.  I wish there was a conditioner to match this, the only ones I see refer to a scent in the reviews.  Thank you Maple Holistics for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I REALLY love this shampoo! It&#x27;s gentle yet very effective. I love that it&#x27;s sulfate-free and herbal with several nourishing oils for my dry and damaged curly hair. The shampoo is very thick and a little goes a LONG way so the price is excellent also! It has a lovely scent and it&#x27;s very rich. They did not skip out on quality! I will order this product again!!!! So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for the girlfriend who suffers from dry and itchy scalp. It has improved and her hair smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this shampoo for my dry,damaged hair along with the conditioner,my hair is soft,manageable, I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look an feel heathy</li>
            <li> My hair are like they were ten years ago  after using this. I just love how amazon time and again directs me to products that were not even remotely on my radar and then are so much of a contribution to a happier life. Hair happy and light and natural. life is good!</li>
            <li> Absolute perfection.  Fragrant and kind to my hair.  What more can be asked?  Hint of the day ladies/men:  don&#x27;t overshampoo hair.  No matter what conditioners and hair products you apply after, too many washings leave your hair stripped of essential oils and your hair will suffer.  If you must have damp hair to style properly just rinse it every other time and you&#x27;ll see dramatic results.  Also Argan oil applied sparingly every day to dry ends will make your hair thank you.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing! I&#x27;m currently on a healthy hair journey and is perfect. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that didn&#x27;t dry out my hair before applying conditioner. This product did what it claims and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results! I will be trying their conditioner next.</li>
            <li> 4c ethnic hair.  This doea the job but follow up a second wash for better clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome for all curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> One of the great products I ever had. Second time buyer and like its feeling of not oily. It would be great if the volume is more. Too slim and fast used up. That&#x27;s why I take out 1 star.</li>
            <li> Made my coarse, curly hair feel soft. Plus, I like that there was no overwhelming scent to compete with any other fragrance I choose to wear.</li>
            <li> I bought both the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  My hair is very soft &amp; silky.  I am very happy with both products.  I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really makes my hair thicker, I was recommended it by a friend who told me that sulfates cause some people bad reactions that make your hair fall out. This seems to be helping so far, there are less hairs on my bathroom floor and it has only been a week!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and makes my hair so soft, healthy, and shiny! Definitely got compliments on my hair after I started using this product!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this shampoo and felt it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to post a review without actually trying this AMAZING Shampoo! I am so incredibly pleased.  My hair feels cleaner than it ever has before.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to this Argan Oil Shampoo or Maple Holistics Silk 18 Conditioner but my hair is no longer falling out, is so soft, and my curls are much softer and less brillo-pad like.  I AM A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!!</li>
            <li> Since this product came up when I searched for organic shampoos, I expected it to be organic.  Nope.  Not at all</li>
            <li> Used it to try out the curly girl method...the method didn&#x27;t work well for me but I don&#x27;t think it had anything to do with the shampoo, my hair always felt clean after I used it instead of cowashing.</li>
            <li> I just finished a bottle of this. I have to say my hair has never felt better! My hair was dull and dry and no other product I&#x27;ve used worked but this did!</li>
            <li> So, my older sister purchased this for me about a month ago and I just have to say that I am IN LOVE with this shampoo! Not only does it SMELL great but it works absolute WONDERS on my relaxed hair. I used to use shampoo for relaxed and natural hair but I have made the permanent change to Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo. I would definitely recommend this shampoo to my family and friends as a permanent switch from their normal shampoo!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the third time tonight and still love it! My hair has felt and looked so much healthier. I have thick curly hair and this product does wonders. I paired it with the silk 18 conditioner. This shampoo has no smell in my opinion, but the silk 18 has a lovely vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about two weeks and I have noticed that my hair is not falling as much.  My hair, I believe,  had been falling due to stress, but now it feels fuller and shinier.  It smells great and lathers up nicely. Love it so far. Thank you!</li>
            <li> At age 50 with dry, highlighted hair I really needed to find a shampoo &amp; conditioner that would revive my hair. After just the first use my hair felt soft &amp; silky. What a difference! My hair smells nice too. Just wanted to clarify that the Silk18 conditioner I used, from the same seller, is the nice smelling product.  The shampoo smell is just ok.</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo mainly because it is a sulfate free shampoo and has good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo is almost scentless.&lt;br /&gt;Lathering for this shampoo is average compare to conventional shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Hair does not feel soft after shampooing with this product (even after a second use of this shampoo). May need conditioner along with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion, beside the fact that this is a sulfate free shampoo, I am not impress with the performance of this shampoo as of yet (used this shampoo for several weeks now).</li>
            <li> Like this product.  Have only used a few times, so can&#x27;t give an opnion on long-term results.  However, my hair is fine and it does give it more texture and body.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo very much it makes my hair feel healthy not dry like other shampoo I did not have to use any conditioner later, i tried this for the first time and I am very satisfied with this purchase. recommend this to anyone who likes natural shampoo</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics describes this product as one that can be used by everyone, no matter your hair type. My hair is strange and I have never really had a conditioner that helped the problems that I have. As I stated earlier, it is frizzy and damaged, but it also gets greasy easily. This formula makes my hair smooth and shiny without weighing it down, so I still have all of my volume.There is no distinct smell but who cares right? As long as the product works....I do really like these products; they work and smell wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really good! It cleans your hair so good and is made up with alot of things that are good for your hair! Definately 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I just started to focus on whole body wellness, so I wanted to go above and beyond just putting quality natural ingredients in my body. I found that that inner body health is critical for overall body wellness. I would say that I never gave my hair or skin that same treatment with quality natural ingredient shampoos. I typically found my skin and hair either dry or feeling weak, so I decided to give shampoo&#x27;s like this one a try. I honestly believe it makes all the difference and you will notice a change in how your body interacts with these ingredients. I found that by using a cheap shampoo you deprive your skin of important nutrients. Similarly, you would deprive your body of important ingredients by choosing cheap food options. In the end, I highly recommend you try the product because the ingredients are each necessary to properly enriching your hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Just received the shampoo and conditioner, tried right away and so pleased with results.  Many years of searching for the right product for me, thank you Maple Holistics, I believe I have found it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan! I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using shampoo altogether (I like the way my hair feels when I use baking soda and apple cider vinegar) but my teen son thinks not using shampoo is &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34;. Go figure! Anyway, I ordered a bottle of Argan Oil Shampoo and we both loved it. I&#x27;m still doing the baking soda thing mostly, but my son and I do love the way our hair feels when we use this shampoo. And I should mention that we both have completely different hair! Mine is thin and oily, his is thick and dry (he&#x27;s mixed race, black and white) and yet this shampoo works well for both of us.</li>
            <li> Nice clean product! Great smell, gives you incredible soft clean hair, no residue and no chemicals. This is what Aphrodite would use in her hair! Feel free to use that quote on your website! :)</li>
            <li> If left my hair really dry</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d found this shampoo years ago. I&#x27;m 69 years old and the past year my hair has been thinning. After trying several different brands of shampoo and being disappointed, I did a Google search for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo and found MapleHolistics Argan Oil. This shampoo leaves my hair soft and looking fuller than it did with other brands. I also like that I&#x27;m now using a shampoo with natural ingredients and so not doing further damage to my scalp and hair with chemicals. I highly recommend this product. [[ASIN:B00L4FQVB2 Argan Oil Shampoo, Sulfate Free - With Argan, Jojoba, Avocado, Almond, Peach Kernel, Camellia Seed, and Keratin - 100% Safe for Color Treated Hair - For Men, Women, and Teens - All Hair Types - Most Beneficial Haircare Product Available]]</li>
            <li> I have very fine but thick hair. Eventually all shampoos leave my hair limp or oily looking.  I wash my hair everyday which can make my hair a bit like straw. This shampoo takes all the past gunk out of my hair. Alone it leaves my hair feeling a little too coarse. Using this combined with Silk 18 however my hair feeling soft and clean. No build up, no limp look.</li>
            <li> My mom was the first person to use it. She has thick,long, and curly hair. She loved the smell, and the way the product left her hair. It didn&#x27;t tangle as it usually does, and her hair was really soft. I was really excited to try the shampoo after my mom had great results. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have the same results.  My hair is different from my mom&#x27;s. I have thin,short, and wavy hair. After I air dried my hair felt a bit icky. And it was a bit out of control. I gave it a second try this past weekend, and the results were much better. Hair felt soft and silky. Don&#x27;t know what happened the first time.</li>
            <li> I got the shampoo and conditioner in Argan oil and used it a few times now. The hair loss seems to be less. But unfortunately they make my hair dry, SUPER FRIZZY and Tangled!! I have tried a lot of shampoos and conditioner but nothing has made my hair this frizzy and tangled.  Oh did I mention the color wash off?? Yeah, it claims to be color safe but washes off color every single time.   I&#x27;d give only one star or none but as it has reduced hair loss.</li>
            <li> It is light, gently washes heir and leaves it shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and lathers well without harsh sulfites and parabens.</li>
            <li> It is acceptable. I sought a shampoo that does not use damaging chemicals or leave residue; I cannot attest to the truth of these claims, but thus far I have not noticed significant residue. However, as some reviews have stated, the hair is left rougher and possibly drier than before. I intend to use the free product offer by Maple Holistics to see if this is the case for other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also observed that it does not foam significantly unless you lather more than once.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing in terms of its moisturizing properties. The argan oil makes it suitable for more dry brittle hair. I would say if you have oily hair like me, then it is not the best. However, if you have dry brittle hair, this is FOR you!&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy this brand maple hollistics. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this brand!</li>
            <li> I was loosing quite a bit of hair due to stress and I have noticed that it is not happening as much since I have been using the shampoo. My stylist has also noticed an improvement. She says that it&#x27;s not that brittle and dried anymore. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to all my colleagues.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and corresponding conditioner, combo. This review addresses both products: Argan shampoo and Silk conditioner. I wanted sulfate free, they are, and are of good quality. Hair products,in particular, have different effects, depending on hair type. My hair is dry, wavy, and frizzy, so I always need to use some type of gel or frizz control serum. The shampoo, for me, didn&#x27;t translate very well. It felt hard and drying as I attempted to distribute it through my hair. My hair got more tangled trying to wash it. But I could tell it was of quality. Just not working for me. Then I used the conditioner- it was a good experience. Very moisturizerizing, untangled my hair (nice slip), and overall, conditioned very well. Including after the shower, my gel process, and air dry, my hair felt soft and healthy. I don&#x27;t want to deter anyone from the Argan shampoo, because it might work well for you. I can vouch for the conditioner. Overall, quality products.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry to begin with and this shampoo is much too harsh.  However, it does a great job of getting my hair squeaky clean..literally, squeaky clean.  I like it well enough as a &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; shampoo and will use it once or twice a month as moisturizing shampoos leave a buildup.</li>
            <li> I used this product along with Silk 18 Conditioner. I have been having hair problems for a while now from shedding excessively to having my hair become a dull/brittle color. Honestly, I thought there was nothing that could really solve the issue or return some of the natural texture of my hair back to what it once was till I tried this shampoo!! I do admit, I dye my hair frequently thus I was not surprised that it would&#x27;ve damaged my natural hair tone, but this product really does work wonders! It leaves your hair feeling smooth with a natural shine. My scalp is naturally oily, but this shampoo introduces just the right amount of oil to your hair and scalp that it leaves you with a clean finish. There has been no change to the color dye I used in my hair so it is color safe. I was skeptical about the 8 oz bottle being perhaps a bit too small with the amount I normally use, but you really DO get a lot from just a small amount! I also noticed after switching over to using this product that I started shedding significantly less hair. I honestly would highly recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s on the fence about it because it will go beyond your expectations!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this a week ago and so far have used it many times. I like it so far and the felling of using something that has no chemicals make me feel good. Will have to see down the line whether it helps with the hair growth or hair fall.</li>
            <li> Love it! It lathers really really well. It doesn&#x27;t have that much of a smell, but I use the Silk 18 conditioner afterwards which gives my hair a fresh vanilla scent. I waited a few weeks to see if this product made a difference for my hair, and it does. Usually, products that give your hair an immediate shine are loaded with silicone and other chemicals that are only temporary. I can honestly say my hair is softer and shinier after using both the shampoo and conditioner. Only con is that the bottle is very small. I have long thick hair, it takes a lot of product for me to get a lather distributed throughout my hair. It&#x27;s also expensive, so I try to use as little as possible to prolong the life of my bottles</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better when I use this than other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo! Although I don&#x27;t quite like the smell of it, but I can deal with that.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed with this shampoo. Loved what it did for my hair. It is something I would endorse and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Not much of a smell to it but it lathers and cleans my hair great. I followed with the conditioner and it made my hair incredibly soft.  I was pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> Lathers very well and requires a fairly small amount to apply to hair. This small bottle lasted me four months! That is amazing considering the amount of long thick hair I have. Now that my trial run is over I purchased two more bottles and now trying the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really believed that different shampoos would make that much of a difference on hair.  Well, this one did!  I started using this shampoo and quickly realized how well balanced it was for my hair.  This in conjunction with the Silk 18 conditioner are wonderful!  My hair stays healthy looking and it helps balance the frizzy flyaways that I tend to get with other shampoos.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> fast delivery. wonderful product. will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with how my hair changed after my pregnancy and this definitely did it.  I also love that the ingredients are safe bc now with my kids I don&#x27;t like having products around the house that are full of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite shampoo. Smells wonderful and lathers perfectly!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using this shampoo, my hair is more healthy. Without sulfates there is usually no &amp;#34;lather, but this shampoo lathers well. Also it smells great.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few natural shampoos and I haven&#x27;t find any that don&#x27;t dry my hair out. This shampoo is fantastic. I tried it with out any other hair products and when I woke up the next day my hair is so unbelievably soft! I can&#x27;t wait to try the conditioner.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this shampoo!  For being sulfate free, you still get a nice lather and my hair feels very clean.  I paired it with the Silk 18 conditioner and my hair was so soft and shiny.  This is great for a natural shampoo!</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with it, but it makes my hair look thin, straight and damaged. I have healthy, wavy hair and have never had a problem with shampoo. Maybe it isn&#x27;t for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> after using this shampoo my hair did actually feel thicker than it normally does and i have had problems as late with loosing hair due to stress so i am pleased with the result at such an early stage,</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I have fragile fine blonde hair and this makes it feel so silky! This shampoo also doesnt dry out my hair, and has restored it so much. It feels so strong and shiny now.</li>
            <li> This company is as professional as can be.  Their bottles are filled to the brim, the shampoo is unscented with no harmful additives what so ever and leaves my scalp feeling super clean after a wash.  Your hair and scalp will feel much better using this product than something unnatural bought at the store.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes my hair feel so soft and really shiny! I also love that it actually smells good! It&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m washing my hair with a product that is good for it. Recommended to anybody looking for a natural shampoo out there!</li>
            <li> Based on 800+ customer reviews and 68% 5star reviews I bought Argan Oil Shampoo and Cnditioner and I am extremely satisfied with the product.  I recently had keratin treatment and this shampoo goes well with my hair. If you first ever trying sulfate free shampoo, I would recommend try this product from Maple Holistics</li>
            <li> My husband and I have both been looking for a good natural shampoo that meets our diverse needs. So far this seems to be it! I approve of the ingredient list, both of our scalps feel clean and not itchy and there is no leftover residue. The husband is in love! My only complaint is how much I have to use on my hair, but that&#x27;s my own problem for having super thick horse hair.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty happy with this shampoo, rinses clean and does not leave a residue behind. Con- wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> So this shampoo wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was thinking it was going to be.... I thought it would be more of a liquid oil but it honestly ended up being a fabulous gel/shampoo like wash that I fell in love with! I have baby fine curly hair that can get a bit oily as well as dry (if you have my hair type, you know exactly what I mean as crazy as it sounds) But this shampoo somehow does the trick for keeping my hair clean and shiny without weighing down or making my fine curls frizzy or flat and my roots don&#x27;t get that icky oil feel. This shampoo is for sure my absolute favorite!&lt;br /&gt;. Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. I have long, wavy,  fine, slightly oil hair. I&#x27;m on a mission to go longer between washings and this product helping me get there. The overall quality of my hair has improved - less breakage, fewer split ends, less scalp oil, less static, less tangles, an it requires less styling, etc. This shampoo compliments Moroccan oil treatments. I LOVE that it has almost no scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a week now and I love it.  It leaves my hair squeaky clean, smooth, and shiny.  I also use their sage shampoo. They both help with winter dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Very good.&lt;br /&gt;I want to buy  one more</li>
            <li> I noticed a considerable difference in my hair even after using this product ONE time! For reference, I have extremely thick, coarse hair that is often dry and frizzy. I have never used a shampoo before that made such a dramatic difference after one use. My hair is noticeably smoother and I can tell it has more moisture. I try to wash my hair with colder water in addition to using this shampoo; I get the best results that way. I love that this shampoo is sulfate free and completely natural. This is definitely the best shampoo you can get for the price, in my opinion. I will continue purchasing this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> Good Shampoo.. I use it in between another shampoo due to when I was using it daily, my hair felt greasy... even after rinsing several times. I think it would be excellent used in dry hair...  Very Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft when I use this, my ends are splitting much less frequently, and there is less hair in my hairbrush. My hair is already pretty long, but I haven&#x27;t had any success getting more growth. My ends would get dry and break! So far I am loving the results, I will purchase again. Belly button length hair here I come.</li>
            <li> I have been in search for a natural shampoo for months.  This product is exactly what I have been looking for.  Has the right amount of lather and gentleness in my hair.  It leaves my hair soft and clean; I like conditioner for smoothness.  Overall great product!  Will be ordering again :)</li>
            <li> Great product, while some of the reviews I read found it to be a negative that the product is virtually unscented, it&#x27;s a huge boon for me.  I have a lot of scent sensitivities am always nervous about trying something new with added fragrances.  I also appreciate that the sources of fragrance are completely natural so the chemicals that cause my asthma attacks aren&#x27;t present.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for several weeks, the one thing I&#x27;m thinking about is trying their dry hair shampoo as while I don&#x27;t mistreat my hair, recent years and weather have dried it out considerably and I might need to do some repairing before going back to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It smells like nothing and leaves my hair very rough. I have to mix it with other shampoos. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used this a couple of times and here&#x27;s what I have to say. I like that there isn&#x27;t a strong smell. I&#x27;ve tried other argan-oil-based shampoos before and some of them had a strong smell due to the oil. It lathers nicely but not overly-so. And it feels GREAT! The only complaint I have is that it leaves my hair a little dry, but considering the fact that this shampoo uses only natural ingredients, it&#x27;s a trade-off I&#x27;d make again and again. You only need a little so the price is justified for me as well. I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> This shampoo plus silk 18 conditioner is the best combination of hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. It may be a smaller bottle but a quarter size amount in your hand goes a long way, I used as much as I would with a normal shampoo and the suds were poring down my head.</li>
            <li> First to tell you a little bit about my hair history. I was born with pin-straight manageable hair, but when I entered my teens I started to mess around with many different shampoo’s and hair products and I eventually did something wrong because my hair changed from pin-straight manageable hair to dry, brittle, UNmanageable hair. My hair became a burden, and with the addition that the I had to straighten my hair everyday to manipulate it to even ‘try’ to be manageable…my hair was a complete disaster. Throughout my middle school days into my high school days, I straightened my hair every day, i’m still surprised to this day how on earth I even managed to HAVE hair. I finally got into the college of my dreams and decided to create a new look, I decided to bleach my hair. Mistake. My hair was a complete disaster and I thought I would forever be that girl with the really bad hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2015 came around and of course I had the same resolutions as every one else “to be healthy, inside and out” and “taking care of myself”, the only difference about my resolution is I decided to HONOR it. It first started out slow, exercising regularly, drinking water…holding off on that ranch with my fries etc. As I was creating a healthier regime for myself, I started to notice how well my complexion was becoming but my dry hair stuck out like a sore thumb, it was time to take action. I started off with home recipes for hair, such as egg masks, coconut oil masks etc. One day in the shower as I was using my Herbal Essence, I read the ingredients out of curiosity and had an idea: “I should invest in some actual good shampoo’s”. I was looking around Whole Foods one day and noticed many shampoos that were “sulfate free” and started to try out this new “hype”, I chose their 2Chic Avocado &amp; Olive Oil for dry, damaged hair shampoo/conditioner/mask. I saw instant improvement, my frizz was tamed, my hair was more manageable, I was ecstatic. I flew home fromHI (where I live)  to CA for winter break, and on my way back as I was unpacking, I realized I left my shampoo/conditioner. I walked to Walmart and purchased Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative shampoo/conditioner with sea kelp and Argan Oil free of: sulfates, paragons, phthalates, paraffin, gluten propylene glycol, mineral oil, synthetic fragrance/color, DEA. This is where the magic happened. My hair was instantaneously TRANSFORMED. My frizz was gone, the only product I would put in my hair was Argan Serum after my shower just to give it shine, and i’d walk out the door with no problem. One day I was on Amazon and ended up on your product and I decided, why not spoil myself a little. I’ve used your product many times now, my hair can’t get enough of it. My hair has never been this luscious, frizz free, so manageable! My hair has been restored and I can’t be any happier. I’m a sulfate-free believer now, I even convinced 2 of my close friends to consider the switch and they have, and they are now sulfate-free believers! I will continue to purchase your product because my hair can’t get enough of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;Leslie</li>
            <li> This gave me dandruff after 3 uses. I&#x27;ve never had dandruff in my life before now.</li>
            <li> Have used just a couple of times and can already tell a difference.  Scalp feels soothed and no itchiness by my temples is gone.  Will keep using for sure!</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo.  Cleans hair well and leaves it feeling soft and manageable.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle at all after using this.  Would highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I love how soft and full of body it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine long hair that has been colored. This shampoo cleans really well. I usually wash my hair every other day. The first two times I used this my hair felt like straw after rinsing until I used conditioner. After reading reviews I bought silk 18 and that helped a little. The last time I used this shampoo I decided to use my old conditioner on my hair below my shoulders first and leave it in while i shampooed. I still only use the shampoo on my scalp and let the shampoo work its way down when rinsing. By having conditioner already on ny hair it helped it not feel like straw after shanpooing. Then I used the silk 18 which smells really good. That seemed to work better. Giving this 4 stars because I am not sure yet if this is that much better than my old shampoo. I guess if you have oily hair it is probably a great match.  Update- returned with no issues.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome! I would highly recommend. It smells good and it feels good too! We will definitely be using this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great for my short, fine hair.  Not too much fragrance for those who are bothered by that.  The Silk 18 conditioner is wonderful with it and my hair feels silky and light.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have fine slightly wavy hair that is oily. My hair usually makes it through one day with most shampoos. If I&#x27;m lucky, my hair will last a day and a half before looking greasy.  I washed my hair with the Argan shampoo, and let it air dry with no other products on my my hair. It was very soft and shiny, but not fluffy. I didn&#x27;t have a lot of expectations for this shampoo. I was very shocked to see my hair looking just as clean on day 2 and with a tad more volume. The next time I used it, I used my normal styling products after shampooing, and was excited to see beautiful, full, shiny hair under control.  This shampoo has more than surpassed my expectations! I would recommend this line of products to anyone. I&#x27;ve enjoyed all that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Excellent non toxic shampoo. We have members of our household with chemical sensitivities, but most fragrance free or natural shampoos are lacking in quality.  This is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause problems for our family , decent lather, and seems to work well for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I got the Argan shampoo and it arrived very fast. It has made my hair very soft after the first use. I have been in wheelchair for a few years and didn&#x27;t take care of my hair. Now I use this shampoo to make my hair healthy again.</li>
            <li> My. Hair. Is. Gorgeous. I used this product because I am allergic to synthetic fragrance and needed better conditioning for my hair. I have a lot fine, long blond hair and my old shampoo was too drying. This made my hair soft and silky without weighing down. I used the Silk 18 conditioner as well. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Argan oil shampoo. First, I used the shampoo which made my head a bit itch, but the itching feeling are gone after few weeks continues using. I love this shampoo the most is that I don&#x27;t lose hair. I wait until now to write this review because I want to make sure that my non-hair loss is credit for this shampoo and not only credit for my pregnancy&#x27;s hormones. My son was born one month ago, and I have still not experience of hair loss yet. Also, I recommend Argan oil shampoo to my friend who gave birth 4 months ago. She was losing hair until she started to use this shampoo. This shampoo seems work for a hair loss problem, but this was just me and my friend&#x27;s personal experience. Hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase! My hair is thick and wavy prone to frizz, after washing and using the conditioner my hair is soft and shiny!  They also have great customer service. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Like the conditioner, I cannot say enough good about this product.  I love it.  I used to HATE washing my hair. I had to leave the conditioner in far longer than recommended. This shampoo it great and it FEELS good! I never said that about a shampoo.  I will now. I don&#x27;t mind washing my &amp;#34;horse hair&amp;#34; because when it&#x27;s all dry it feels like silk. WOW! I&#x27;ve never said that one either. I will use this and buy this as gifts for the holidays, for &amp;#34;just cuz&#x27;s&amp;#34;, and anything else I can think of.  I love this and gladly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> hair is fried after using it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing shampoo. My hair was beginning to thin out on top.  My brother recommended this product and I have been using it for about a month.  I have noticed, and so have other people, new hair growth.  My receding hair line is getting remarkably better.  My hair is softer and looks so much healthier.  I have tried Rogaine and  numerous  other shampoos but have never seen such improvement. Also  you don&#x27;t need to use alot . A dime size portion is more than enough.  Love this product  This is a 5 star product in my opinion</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shampoo. It has a soft smell, a creamy texture, leaves my hair malleable and nourished. I can feel it.&lt;br /&gt;No chemicals, nothing to fear. This product is for whom looks for natural ingredients. I will order more!.</li>
            <li> I thought the shampoo based on the reviews on Amazon. It shipped out right away and was on time. Kudos to Amazon! I had to try it out right away and was amazed. It says to use a quarter sized amount and they surely did not overstate that all you need is a quarter sized amount. I have long hair and the shampoo lathered up greatly and left my hair clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review after I have given my hair a little bit of time to adjust.</li>
            <li> I recently purchase Shampoo for Oily, Itchy &amp; Greasy Hair with Organic Rosemary, Peach Kernel and Jojoba  and it was amazing. It does what it says, my scalp stop itching and I want to try this one. I can not wait to feel the results from this one. Also I am ordering more. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great.  Leaves hair feeling very clean and has a good lather to it.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the all natural ingrediets. I love the way it smells, and the positive health attributes it has for my hair. I will recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this brand! I have thick, course, dry and frizzy hair. In just one use this shampoo softened and smoothed my hair, making it super manageable--as if it were conditioner. I&#x27;d rate this shampoo above Pureology and Moroccan Oil brands. One caution: The bottle says its for all scalp types, but I have mild-moderate dandruff and was still left with flakes on my scalp. I&#x27;m giving this bottle to a friend and I will try their dry scalp/dandruff shampoo next.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works better for me than the Soap Nuts shampoo does. There is no odor to it at all, so if you&#x27;re looked for a great natural product, I&#x27;d recommend this one. Cleans my hair but seems to condition it at the same time. Just need a tiny bit if washing your hair daily.</li>
            <li> My hubbin has such severe sensitivities with his scalp and we&#x27;ve been trying every brand and scent for each brand of hypoallergenic shampoo that we can find, for over 4 years now. We even tried other types of sulfate free shampoos with no luck - he breaks out with many large sores on his scalp...except with this shampoo.  This is literally the only shampoo so far that hasn&#x27;t caused him to break out.&lt;br /&gt;This product has absolutely no scent that I could discern whatsoever.  So in addition to being sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be fragranced and is white so no harsh dyes or colors added.</li>
            <li> I like that it uses more natural ingredients than most other shampoos. I have very short hair so I mainly use this to keep my scalp feeling refreshed and smelling good. My only beef is that i wish there more of a fruity/peachy or avocado or almond scent to it as that was one of the ingredients. Come to think of it, it didn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> Even though this is shampoo is more expensive than most the ones I have used before, but I think it is totally worthy! This shampoo doesn&#x27;t have any artificial flavor. It is really natural and you can&#x27;t really smell anything. Also, it has a lot of bubble even you only use a little. And it helps your hair!! It makes your hair super super smooth and free/ :)</li>
            <li> The smell of this is not great, but that is OK because the conditioner smells wonderful.  Cleans my hair well and makes it very shiny.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and did not need much for a nice lather. The scent is nice without being overwhelming. It leaves my hair soft &amp; combs out easily. So tired of all the chemicals, etc. in self care products so it is important to me that this is all natural. Try it!</li>
            <li> I have naturally very thick, coarse hair and have trouble getting product completely gone! I also take an hour to blow dry after air drying. Managing my long, thick hair can be overwhelming at times especially when I would like for it to be soft and pretty! I have only used Maple Holistics Argan Shampoo and Silk 18 Conditioner and already feel transformed! Not only does it smell amazing, my hair looks shinier, feels softer, and didn’t take as long to dry. It feels overall healthier which is great!</li>
            <li> Smells different but I like it. Nice refreshing tingle too. Didn&#x27;t shed as much hair as normal after use</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great. I&#x27;ve been only using this shampoo and some argan oil, and my hair has definitely changed for the better. A lot of people have said in their reviews that this product smells bad, but in my opinion it actually it smells quite nice. The scent is light and it&#x27;s not overpowering at all. This shampoo lathers very well and leaves my hair soft, shiny, frizz-less and beautiful overall. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is truly amazing! I use it along with Maple Holistics Silk 18 Conditioner and my hair feels soft and looks shiny and healthy. I wash my hair every 4-6 days and never get an itchy scalp which I have gotten from some shampoos and conditioners. It really does moisturize my hair, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any residue in it. I&#x27;m certain this is why I can go for so long between washings. I sometimes use just this shampoo on my daughters fine hair and forgo the conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, but does keep her fine hair tangle free. We live a pretty simple life and don&#x27;t use many personal care products, but this is one that I am glad exists! Keep making these excellent natural products!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like at all. I think this makes my hair feel worse than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used other than the Tru Moroccan Argan oil Shampoo which is just as bad. As soon as you rinse it out, your hair feels like you have been in a pool with too much chlorine. The price is ridiculous for such a bad product. Suave makes my hair feel better than this!!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo i have ever ordered so fat . I was so depressed about my hair quality and texture and started searching for some natural solutions. This is what was an ultimate respite for me. MY hair had no frizz, became smoother and with lots of shine. Best best product so far.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great! I love how clean my hair feels and paired with Silk 18 it definitely leaves my hair feeling clean, soft, and silky for days! I will buys this over and over again!</li>
            <li> Really didnt care for this product.. It just wasnt for me.. That doesnt mean that other people wont like it.. Ill keep shoppin for something that i would use instead of just looin at it sittin in my shower.. TY</li>
            <li> A good shampoo for my over processed hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo following a strong keratin treatment of my hair. My hair stylist told me to get a sulfate free shampoo and she specifically told me to get one that has Argan oil because I had very dry and damaged hair. I have used this shampoo twice since my treatment and it has been great. It smells yummy and leaves my hair very soft and alive.</li>
            <li> Good simple shampoo that cleanses as it moisturizes. Usually I have to do 3-4 shampoos until it feels squeaky clean but with this Argan oil shampoo I only needed two shampoos and my hair felt a little bit more moisturized before I even applied conditioner, usually with my other shampoo it feels like straw. And it smells good! Worth trying if you are tired of using $4 department store brands that do absolutely nothing but not expensive like the $20 high end stuff that may or may not work. ..this is a good happy medium</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and great communication. Love the shampoo! It&#x27;s really improved the quality and softness of my hair. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The item was shipped in a timely manner (thank you prime) and my wife loves this stuff. I got this for my wife because she has very difficult hair. Before She found maple holistic products she had gone through so many shampoo and conditioning products and had not been able to find one that made her hair as soft and manageable as these do.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly a month.  I can see a visible difference in the condition of my hair - it is so much healthier.  It took a few weeks for the improved condition to be obvious.  I use this with the Silk 18 conditioner, and I am very happy with these two products.  I will be ordering again and highly recommend both the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> My wife recently came to the U.S. and she was looking for a good shampoo. We searched on amazon.com for shampoos with high rating and came across this. We liked the product because it is cruelty-free and fragrance-free. My wife says that her hair is softer after using this shampoo. As for me, I like it because it does not have any fragrance. Heavy fragrance tends to irritate me. The price is a tad higher than the run-of-the-mill shampoos - but it is worth it to avoid a bunch of chemicals wreaking havoc on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair.  I find this shampoo keeps it very soft and silky while also adding a bit of volume to it.  I also really enjoy the smell.  Bottle seems like it will last me a long time.  I will definitely buy more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thinner hair (which makes me super self-conscious since I&#x27;m only in my early 30s), but this shampoo has done a great done of providing moisture to my scalp without weighing my hair down. I bought this at the same time as the Maple Holistics Silk18 Conditionera little over a month ago and will definitely order this product again but may try to pair it with another conditioner for the best results. The only improvement that would make this product perfect (for me, anyway) would be the scent - it smells &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but kind of like old vanilla or something. Even then, that doesn&#x27;t take away from this overall great product!</li>
            <li> Although the product does not smell the greatest it does lather well and my hair feels amazing after just one use! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to repair their hair or just want soft lovely hair!!</li>
            <li> I have been using shampoo bars for a year now. I love them and it was hard for me to change back to liquid shampoo. I was looking for something natural and good for my hair. I have to say, I really like this shampoo. The packaging is excellent. Presentation sells. Absolutely beautiful product. The texture of this shampoo is magnificent, not to thin, but not too thick. There is a beautiful pearl effect to the color of the soap. After using this product for almost a week, my hair looks better than ever. I have my shine and softness back. This shampoo lathers beautifully and a little does the job. I love all the ingredients in this product. The fragrance is vanilla and honey. The scent is very light. I prefer a louder scent. I think it needs just a bit more vanilla and honey, not much though. All in all, this is a wonderful natural product for every one.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the scalp.  The product has lot of nutritional ingredients that are natural.  The best part is that it&#x27;s free of sulfates, paraben and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love this product, will buy again. My hair stylist recommended this, she has seen amazing results.</li>
            <li> What can I say... Great Shampoo!! I isn&#x27;t soapy, but it leaves your hair soft even if you don&#x27;t use the conditioner and I like that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped of its natural oils but feels clean after I towel dry. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old.  My hair has seemed to change over the years,  Drier and not as easy to manage.  I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners over the years and more recently searching for something that would really help and not just mask what was really going on with my hair.  I finally found it right here on Amazon.  Both the Argan Oil shampoo and Silk 18 conditioner take very little to be effective.  The fragranes are mild which I like.  My hair is really feeling softer and actually shines again. I don&#x27;t believe either product will build up on my hair. I rely on reviews before I purchase from Amazon.  I know that I can count on honest information from people about their experiences.  I will keep ordering these two products for sure.  I have also notices that Maple Holistics carries facial products that I am also going to try.</li>
            <li> Great product,  it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent but it does make my hair feel and look great. Was really impressed with it since I didn&#x27;t even need a conditioner with it</li>
            <li> Iam happy with this shampoo</li>
            <li> Bought this product after reading reviews on how it helped some people with their psoriasis but was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t help mine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels after I shampoo it. It&#x27;s all tangled up.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is excellent. I am middle aged and my hair texture has changed to very coarse and dry. I decided to try some sulfate free shampoo to see if it would help to restore my hair back to smooth and soft.  The Maple Holistics brand has.  Used in conjunction with the Maple Holistcs conditioner my hair is returning to its former youthful texture and appearance. I also flat iron my hair and the Maple Holistics help keep it from drying out or becoming damaged.</li>
            <li> five stars for the customer service! I originally bought the silk 18 conditioner, which I loved. so I purchased the argan oil shampoo to give a try.... this shampoo didn&#x27;t work well on my hair, maple holistics had incidentally sent me an email asking how I like their products, I responded honestly that their conditioner was terrific, and explained what I didn&#x27;t like about their shampoo.  they actually refunded my money, and in ADDITION sent me a full bottle of the silk 18 conditioner that I loved to satisfy my disappointment in the shampoo, I didn&#x27;t even have to return the bottle.... I could not believe it, OUTSTANDING customer service.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo made my hair amazingly soft and actually makes it shiner and healthier. I have been using this since mid- Sept and now it&#x27;s Oct 8th and I have received several compliments on my hair. I just ordered two more bottles so my girls can start using it as well. LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this shampoo. Tried the much recommended Wen but got chemical burns on my ear tops. Maybe I was allergic to what it was scented with and not the shampoo. But I was looking for something, preferably without laurel sulfate, and something that will help my hair color stay. The reviews for this one said it lathered without laurel sulfate, which I thought wasn&#x27;t possible. But it DOES lather, smells great, doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch or give me chemical burns, and leaves my hair feeling great and feeling really healthy! I&#x27;m a big fan and will buy again. Hoping to save money with larger sizes.</li>
            <li> Quality shampoo, quality customer service...very happy with product.  Lathers well for being sulfate free.  Using conditioner afterwards helped with the softness factor.  I plan on using the Silk 18 as other reviewers have suggested!</li>
            <li> Very thick lather.  This is a great product that doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies.  (some sulfates &amp; lavender)</li>
            <li> After several shampoo-ings, I have found that my hair looks full and soft and prettier than it has ever looked. I now wash it everyday, but know this product isn&#x27;t stripping or overly drying my hair. No dry ends, no limp hair, no bad scents, no chemicals. Great product.</li>
            <li> My hair never looked or felt more beautiful.  I would most certainly re-order it again.</li>
            <li> very unhappy shampoo does not lather well wash hair 3 times before  clean. Will not purchase this product again</li>
            <li> I had extremely dull, brittle hair, I have tried many products in past to no avail, nothing compares to this product. I only used the argon shampoo once it left my hair soft, clean. My hair has shine, shine and more shine. Directions recommend shaking bottle before use, and leave in for  two mins it has done the trick. The fragrance is fantastic and not overwhelming. After three washes my color is still intact. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this shampoo . I&#x27;ll never use another one . I have Very dry and damage  hair . Now , my hair looks so soft and beautiful  . It changed my hair. I love this shampoo! Thank you so much .</li>
            <li> Finally something that works for my SD (Seborrheic dermatitis).I have been using this shampoo weekly and after the first 2 weeks I have not seen one flake. Usually after just one or 2 days I see flakes.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it makes my hair feel so soft and like that it is all natural.  I am still having a slight problem with dry scalp, so I am still working on this, but I will buy this shampoo again and keep using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. I wish it smelled better - it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It kind of just smells like what I imagine sodium cocoyl isethionate or sodium laurel glucoside carboxylate (ingredients) would smell like. But I use it with the Silk 18 conditioner which smells like heaven, so I don&#x27;t mind. I wash twice with a small amount like it says and my hair always feels clean.  I&#x27;d recommend they add some type of scent - lavender, honey, vanilla, something - to make it perfect.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo about 5 times now and I really love the way it has made my hair feel and look thicker and more healthy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful! The scent is nice, it&#x27;s not too strong. My hair is softer, fuller, and more healthy looking. A couple weeks ago I ran out of their winter blend and had to use a bottle of bed head I had in the cabinet. My hair went back to feeling coarse and I had some dandruff. I immediately ordered more product from Maple Holistics. This is definitely a product I recommend to my friends. My hair feels more moisturized and healthy. My only complaint is the bottle size. It did last a lot longer than expected and is the perfect for taking on a trip, but for my at home bathroom I would definitely love a bigger bottle and even better if it had a pump. Either way it&#x27;s a great product and I recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I have long color treated hair and I have have tried several sulfate free shampoos but my hair always felt limp and heavy.  I found this shampoo accidentally when I was shopping around for Argan oil and thought I would give it a try.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo.  My hair feels fresh, clean and FLUFFY.  I use as directed, it doesn&#x27;t lather up much on the first wash but does lather up on the second wash.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, about a nickel size for long hair.  I&#x27;v already ordered my second bottle.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, hair and this product has totally transformed it!! My hair has NEVER looked better! It is full, shiny, and healthy! I have spent many of wasted money on salon products only to find out that they make my hair greasy or dry. No more wasteful spending! This stuff is amazing and I wish I would have known about it YEARS ago!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product! You only need a quarter sized amount to clean an entire head of shoulder length medium hair thickness. So it seems expensive but it lasts a while if you do not  wash your hair every day and with this shampoo I can easily go 3 days without needing to shampoo! And I used to wash it nearly every day! It cleans so well, leaves my hair soft and feeling well moisturized. And it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itchy like many other shampoos have done. It is definitely worth trying! I tend to have frizzy hair and it seems less frizzy also.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this, daily, for a two week trip in Mexico where our hair would be exposed to a lot of pool and salt water. I have wavy, dry, color-treated hair and my 8 year old daughter, who has very sensitive skin, has fine, oily hair and a scalp that is prone to flaking. Although the chlorine smell never left our hair, my hair did not further dry out like is usually does and my daughters head remained oil and flake free. We did always use the Silk conditioner too which left us tangle free. As a test, when we returned home I went back to using Nexus shampoo and it made my hair much dryer and my daughters scalp went back to being flakey. We switched back to Argan and my hair is less dry and my daughters head isn&#x27;t flakey, although she is still gets oily. As a side note, we cant really tell any difference between using the Nexus conditioner or the Silk conditioner after using the Argan shampoo.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for what you get unless you wash your hair once a week...</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible. I have naturally curly hair that has a brazilian blow out. Recently got high lights. This shampoo was horrible. Loreal sulfate free is way better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,  not the best but not the worst. Really wish it softened my dry hair .</li>
            <li> This shampoo along with their Silk 18 conditioner is absolutely incredible!  It does everything it promises to do.  After the first use my hair was as  soft and shiny as it is after leaving the salon!  I was worried about it fading my color treated hair but I&#x27;m happy to say it hasn&#x27;t ~ I do use cold water.  If my hair could do a happy dance.....it would!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite! I have been through thousands of shampoos and I&#x27;ve finally found the one! I have dark thick hair and my hair was looking dull and lifeless and I started experiencing strange scalp issues, I assumed it was from all the crazy chemicals in regular shampoos. So I decided to try this instead of making my own or going &amp;#34;no &#x27;poo&amp;#34; (which didnt work well for me at all). It lathered surprisingly well. Cleaned better than some organic shampoos I&#x27;ve tried before and maybe it&#x27;s my imagination but my hair color looked brighter and definitely shinier. It gave life back to my hair. I will continue to buy this product for sure. I also purchased the conditioner, which is just as great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo based on the reviews, and I have to say after a couple of uses, I don&#x27;t really like it and was a bit disappointed. I expected my hair to at minimum be a bit shinier or softer than normal. I followed the instructions for use, and while the shampoo lathers nicely, it left my hair very dry and course. The conditioner is nice, but the end result does not leave your hair either soft, shiny, or frizz free. The first time I used this, I blow dried my hair and was left with my hair looking as it always does, just a bit drier. The second time I used it, I decided to air dry. Again, left my hair dry/course feeling and frizzy. I have normal hair... Wavy with some curls when air dried and not too thick or thin. I probably won&#x27;t purchase again, any natural shampoo at whole foods would be better. I do like that it is unscented/mildly scented.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels less itchy and dry. I think it is a good shampoo but a little expensive for the bottle size.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo. Such a good find!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff! It lathers up really nice without having to use a ton of it. After rinsing, it leaves my hair and beard nice and clean, but, it doesn&#x27;t have that squeaky, over-dry feeling. I use their Silk 18 conditioner to go along with it. It&#x27;s a great combination.</li>
            <li> I like that it is sulfate free, it has a nice light scent, makes my hair soft. I would recommend, especially if you have over processed hair like mine.  Need to stay away from drying sulfates. 😉</li>
            <li> I do Keratin treatments on my hair, so I am very picky about sulfate- and sodium- free shampoos. I have dry hair as well, so the ingredient list of this shampoo interested me with all of the oils. I researched it aside from Amazon reviews and found favorable reviews on numerous sites. I purchased it and was not disappointed. It does not strip my hair, nor does it make it feel greasy or heavy. It also does not dull it, which some products will do when they&#x27;re oil-heavy. After I dried my hair, it was very soft and had good volume. I have thick, somewhat curly hair, and really like this shampoo for it. Will continue using and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; ok to use once a month. It&#x27;s nopt working so well for dry hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works well , smells good and leave my hair soft, but when I ordered this I thought it was sulfate free. It is not so I won&#x27;t order anymore. If you don&#x27;t mind sulfates this is a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a pleasant subtle scent, slightly nutty.  It seems to clean my hair well.  I use it along with the Silk 18 conditioner.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this shampoo for a week and my hair started looking healthier and stronger. I used to use the Whole Foods shampoo and conditioner which was good but this outweighs any other product I used.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  Even though it is expensive, it only takes a small amount to do a really good job.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo. Argan oil works really well in my hair and this is a good brand. Makes it soft and no chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It generates lather and feels moisturizing when your shampooing, once you rinse your hair feels squeaky clean, not fragile nor stiff like some sulfate free shampoos do.</li>
            <li> Let me start by telling you a little bit about me, as context for this review. I have boob-length, straight, black hair. I have always been blessed with good hair and I have sailed through life never caring a fig about what product I slathered on my mane in the shower. Then I had a baby. And a few months after her birth my hair became my worst nightmare. It started to fall out in clumps (a common occurrence, I was told, for new mothers. That didn&#x27;t make me feel any better). And even after the awful more-hair-in-the-drain-than-on-your-head phase was done my hair still felt like straw in a barn. Straw in a barn that had been stepped on by a horse. Straw in a barn that had been stepped on by a horse and slept on by a pig. And so began my quest for the magic wand that would convert said straw back into silk. I&#x27;ll spare you the details of my long, arduous journey, of how many bottles I tried and discarded, how many dragons I slew, how often I was cast into despair. Suffice it to say that this shampoo was it (well this shampoo plus the Silk 18 conditioner). Towards the end of my long search I started to try the all natural, free of everything style of shampoos. The first one I tried was one from Acure Organics. That was a terrible disappointment. This one was a revelation. The very first time I used it my hair stopped impersonating a bale of straw. I was super annoying that day. For one, I ran around emitting a high pitched wheeee at regular intervals. Also, I kept shoving my head in my husband&#x27;s face and insisting that he stroke my hair. I have been using this shampoo for about 3 weeks now, and my enthusiasm is unabated.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful! Been trying to find a product that would help moisturize my hair in the very dry climate where I live. Plus the scent is subtle and not overpowering like so many products on the market.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works just as well as all the chemical laden products that I&#x27;m used to. I&#x27;ve been wanting to switch to sulfate-free for a while, but the true sulfate-free shampoos are so expensive. This one smells nice and I can tell from the lather, or lack of, that it actually may be missing the sulfates!</li>
            <li> originally bought this shampoo , along with the silk 18 conditioner for one of my guest bathrooms. But, since we don&#x27;t have any guests at the moment, I decided to give it a try. Really liked it- lather feels amazing and between the shampoo and the conditioner  left my curly, thick hair super soft plus no frizz in the south Carolina&#x27;s humid late spring this year. I noticed the shampoo and conditioner leaves no residue as my hair looks good even the next morning,. I usually wake up with unhappy hair that is begging for hair wash.</li>
            <li> Great product! I had bought only one so had to buy another. It leaves my hair smelling good</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the amazing reviews but this shampoo dries the hair out a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because it&#x27;s organic and very gentle on my hair. I use the silk 18 conditioner with it and together they make my hair very shiny, it feels healthier, and I don&#x27;t even have to use a leave in conditioner after because it does a great job of detangling. I will buy again and use as my new routine!</li>
            <li> it makes my hair very dry i cant even brush it well&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t recommend buying it again&lt;br /&gt;but i liked the silk 18 conditioner</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos and was never happy with anything thus far. I recently ordered this product as it was sulphate free and am amazed how much I liked it! In just 3 uses I see a big difference in my hair. My hair is on the dryer side buy after using this product it actually took the dryness away! I simply look fwd to washing my hair now!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is AMAZING! As of this writing I have used it twice. I usually wash my hair either every other day, or every two days. Depends on what I am doing/how my hair is looking/feeling. If I can go two days without washing I will, but if I go out and get my hair sweaty/dirty I&#x27;ll stick to an every other day schedule. I mention this because even though this bottle of shampoo is small, I feel like it will last me awhile based on my washing regimen. If you wash your hair every day, this may be a bit pricey for how small it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the suggestion on the bottle and lather twice, also let it stick in your hair for a couple minutes as well. This will make a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I felt my hair after drying it, I was so happy. It felt like the type of hair I have after going to a salon. I never though I could reproduce that effect, but I have and I will continue to with this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I had dyed my hair and the hair color made my scalp itch.  I was using Selsun Blue shampoo and hoping it would help with the itchness.  It didn&#x27;t help.  In the mean time, I wanted to get some shampoo to help with my color treated hair, and I found this one on the Amazon.  The reviews are good, so I decided to give it a try.  I am glad I bought it.  It helped with my itchy scalp, and helped the color stays longer.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this shampoo for me yesterday , my hair is kind of weak so he bought this shampoo because it has keratin that help nourish the hair , I have used it once so far and its good I even if doesn&#x27;t have the very good smell but I liked it&#x27;s organic smell</li>
            <li> My hair stays cleaner longer and is super shiny.  I typically try something new each time I buy shampoo but will probably keep using this one.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo. Make my hair soft and shiny. The only con is that I wish it smelled better but I use a leave in treatment and that makes my hair smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I am an African American and I have very curly hair. Sometimes shampoo can be harsh for natural hair, but this leaves my hair feeling amazing and clean. Sometimes natural shampoos just don&#x27;t do the job in cleaning the hair, but this definitely does all while keeping it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a couple times already, and I bought it in conjunction with &amp;#34;silk18&amp;#34; conditioner. I originally made this purchase because it&#x27;s sulfate free and I had heard that the harsh sulfates in some shampoos are what led to some of my hair loss and damage. After using this product, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my results. My hair feels smooth and silky and I have seen a decrease in hair loss! I look forward to continuing my use of this product and purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Disappointed after reading all the reviews.  This had no smell (which isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me), however it did not lather up in my hair at all and left it dry and matted,  Had to condition it like crazy afterwards.  Will not purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Just bought this product on a whim looking for a nice natural shampoo to use daily or every other day. Argan&#x27;s shampoo couldn&#x27;t have filled my needs better. The natural extracts made my hair feel silky smooth. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know the long lasting benefits but so far so good. The shampoo works into a very nice lather even when using the recommended amount or less. It has a very faint smell which I prefer as I don&#x27;t like my hair smelling like fruits or anything like that. All in all I give this product 5 stars and will continue buying it in the future. Thanks Maple Holistics!!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for natural solutions for frizzy hair as well as dry hair problems. One of my hairdressers recommended products with argan oil in them. I have mid-length black hair which sometimes gets tangled. I tried this shampoo and it left my hair feeling really soft and luscious. It also takes care of dandruff issues. It has been a couple of days and my hair still feels and smells great! I would buy it again soon.</li>
            <li> I can only give this shampoo 3 stars to reflect my own experience. It is definitely a quality product and clearly it works very well for many people. I have long, fine, straight hair. I have been coloring my hair for 10+ years as I have about 90% gray. In recent months, I have changed my routine to use far fewer cleanser products on my hair. I often use a moisturizing shampoo on its own, and follow up with a leaving in conditioning spray or styling cream. I was attracted to this product because it seemed like it was a standalone moisturizing shampoo with a lot of rich ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;The product wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected. There are a lot of non-natural ingredients in it. Also, although it felt wonderful on my scalp, and left my scamp and hair clean, the first time I used it I did not follow up with a conditioner and my hair was very coarse and difficult to comb out after shampooing. I had to use a lot of detangling spray. The second time I used it, my hair again felt dry and coarse, so I used a lot of conditioner afterwards, and had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Since this product didn&#x27;t meet my expectations (a standalone conditioning shampoo) I think it&#x27;s just okay. However it&#x27;s a very nice shampoo when used with a conditioner</li>
            <li> Does a good job as far as in cleaning but left my hair very very tangled and not moisturized. I have very curly dry hair so maybe that was the reason. However the shampoo does have the same consistency of other natural brands I have tried which is normally very thick! So a little does go a long way. May be great on fine hair types. I also purchased the &amp;#34;silk 18&amp;#34;. You can see my review for both on YouTube @ http://youtu.be/wQGHko9EDRU</li>
            <li> This shampoo is excellent. It left my hair soft, manageable and it was soothing to my skin. My sensitive facial skin was irritated by a product used and the skin started to burn.  I used this shampoo on my face and it instantly soothed it. I am sure it was do to the oils in it; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the Argan oil shampoo for my dry skin and I am very satisfied with it. It surprising foams up better than other brands and doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume. I will definetely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> No..it left my hair tangled and I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesitant to write &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; until the 6th or 7th date, being a modern woman and all.  However after 3 washings with this product I like it a lot, it leaves my hair very soft and shiny.  No heaviness, no frizz, nice subtle scent, and best of all you don&#x27;t need half a cup full to get your hair clean.  I&#x27;m a wash and go kind of girl, no styling for lazy me, and with naturally curly/wavy hair my main focus is products that won&#x27;t leave my hair looking like twine, corn husks or overcooked spaghetti by noon.  I&#x27;m incredibly sensitve to chemicals and whatever else gets tossed into the cooker with standard shampoos, and everything from the ends of my hair to my scalp has responded very well to this.  It gets my vote.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair straight and it gives shine!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shampoo for my scalp but works wonders on my hair too.</li>
            <li> Nearly instant relief from a burning scalp! I have been coloring my hair for over 30 years and the last 2 years it has been burning my scalp a lot! So I tried dying lighter-from med brown to dark blonde. That helped a little. I finally decided it might be the Sodium Laurel in my shampoos bothering me too. I have only used Argan once and already the burning has quieted down a lot. I wash my hair in the kitchen sink and set the timer for 3 minutes, masaging the whole time. I always have to use a conditioner so I bought the Silk 18. Wow! That is truly silk in a bottle! I plan on trying their other shampoos and alternating to see what works best. I am SOLD on this brand. My old shampoos are going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I know the value of healthy hair. This product falls within the category of nourishing, but leaves my long hair in dire need of a conditioner. It might not have been a bad idea if it had contained some conditioning material. If you decided to use it, you should pair it with a conditioner. If you have long hair and want a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner, then you shouldn&#x27;t go for it. But my experience shows that shampoos that contain no conditioner are healthier, because it is better if the conditioner does not reach the scalp. I bought my third bottle. Now, I feel it dries my hair less than when I started-- maybe I just got used to it, but still you have to use conditioner. All in all, leaves my hair clean, is mild so can be used daily and I haven&#x27;t changed it for something else. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles as a Christmas present for my two sons who constantly complain of oily and dry scalp. Both of them tried it right away the same day they received it. Both of them told me, &amp;#34;Mom this shampoo is wonderful, my scalp feels relieved and calm, thank you.&amp;#34; The next use was a confirmation the oils in the shampoo work to restore moisture in the scalp by eliminating in one the oily hair and the dryness on the other. Both problems seem to be under control, so far. I have almost normal hair, but in winter there&#x27;s no shampoo can alleviate the itchiness of the scalp. I&#x27;ll keep my eye on both users and see whether I invest in one for myself.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on organic shampoos and I decided on this one.  I love the variety of organic ingredients and that in combination with the sulfate free component have made it great for maintaining red hair.  My hair dye used to wash out within 2 weeks with regular shampoo, and I&#x27;m already going on week 3 with vibrant color.  Scent is mild, doesn&#x27;t lather the way regular shampoos do...but my hair still comes out just as clean.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this shampoo! he thing I love most about this shampoo are the ingredients. Plus, it really cleans my hair and scalp, and my hair isn&#x27;t quite as frizzy. (FL humidity!) I will keep buying this!</li>
            <li> I have long waving hair down to my waist. Since I moved to Arizona my hair and scalp became extremely dry. I tried many hair products, but they didn&#x27;t work. This shampoo in combination with Silk 18 conditioner keeps my hair hydrated, soft and shiny. The shampoo lathers well and the smell reminds me of unscented bar soap. After rinsing shampoo off hair it felt clean, but slightly tangled. It didn&#x27;t last long; after applying Silk 18 conditioner my hair became smooth and easy to comb. The conditioner smells as sweet vanilla. As a hair line with non toxic ingredients I think the shampoo and condition works great together. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love with this product it is probably the best shampoo I have ever used and I will and have recommended this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve been losing a lot of hair, I am so glad I found a product with the best ingredients for my hair!!  I am so excited to know of this great product!!!  It will be the only shampoo I use from now on!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It&#x27;s light, but creamy, with a very subtle fragrance, yet a tiny bit lathers like crazy! It leaves my hair soft and wavy, and my hair and scalp feel clean. I notice a big difference, too, in my skin. Some shampoos dry out my skin and feel itchy, but this product has the opposite effect. My hair and skin feel nourished and calm. So happy to have found this, but wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> love this very good for my curly frizzy coarse hair</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo,  I knew it wouldn&#x27;t suds up a whole lot as there are no fake, artificial ingredients in the formula to produce more suds.  Love that it is completely natural and healthy for my natural wavy hair.  It cuts down on the frizz I get in warmer temperatures - can&#x27;t explain why - it just does!&lt;br /&gt;I simply apply first thing in the shower to very wet hair, leave it in while I clean the rest of me, then rinse.  Shiny, clean hair!</li>
            <li> Dandruff be gone! Great stuff to remedy your scalp. I will stick with this product from now on!</li>
            <li> This is a great homeopathic shampoo , I have been using it for almost a week and I am very happy ! It is creamy and gentle, I massage my scalp for 2-3 min and it gives me a very nice sensation of clean. It is easy to rinse ... you really need a small quantity and leaves the hair soft thanks to the Argan oil, almond, jojoba,peach kernel, camelia seed ,avocado and botanical keratin ! It is sulfate free and hypoallergenic !&lt;br /&gt;Best choice ever , I will buy it again !</li>
            <li> I bought this product a while ago and really love it. I also bought the conditioner and together they make my hair, which is colored every 3-4 weeks soft. I have switched to organic products because I do not like the harsh ingredients in the other store brand products. I definitely will continue buying this shampoo and also the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been no shampoo for 2 months and my hair was just a greasy mess, after ton of research this product was the best non chemical shampoo I&#x27;ve came across,  I do have friends over so I purchased the all scalps version. It took out all the greasy in one use but kept my hair from getting frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t bubble too much but it does the job for the small amount I&#x27;ve used it with&lt;br /&gt;my hair is long greasy curly/wavy and this shampoo tamed it better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.for those of you looking into the low poo trend I will suggest this product for similar hair like mine will be continuing purchase.&lt;br /&gt;for those of you who like that clean chemical shampoo feeling but want to ditch the chemicals I would also recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;smells amazing feels amazing. Thankyou!</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t have an over powering scent. It lathered nicely, rinsed out easily and left my hair feeling squeaky clean. I followed up with their &amp;#34;Silk 18&amp;#34; conditioner which complemented the shampoo very nicely.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I have ever used. I spent this much money in a natural product that would make my hair healthy and it made my hair break more. I used it together with their conditioner and my hair was frizzy and dry. My normal 3 dollar suave professionals shampoo is so much better.</li>
            <li> It smells great. I really didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference</li>
            <li> Great shampoo although I enjoy shampoo that is sudsier.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of shampoos for my long curly blonde (dyed) hair. It would always take me at least 15 minutes to comb through my hair after shampooing. I started the Argan Oil Shampoo in January of this year, so I&#x27;ve used it a little over 5 months. This shampoo is amazing! Not only does it take me now about 3 minutes to comb through my hair, I don&#x27;t experience the hair loss in the comb I previously had. Also, my hair is improving with every shampoo -- it looks and feels so healthy, I love touching it. The fly away look is gone, and I get a lot of compliments on my &amp;#34;healthy looking&amp;#34; hair. I&#x27;ve been telling others about the product, I&#x27;m so happy with it. Thank you Maple Holistics</li>
            <li> Great smell. I really didn&#x27;t see a huge difference</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo recently after doing a lot of research on the internet for Sulfate Free and Natural (good for colored hair) shampoos. After purchasing this product and using it now for the 4th time, I am in love with this product.  It leaves my hair clean, shiny, soft, very manageable, and smelling clean.  I can go three days before I need to wash my hair again given normal day to day activities.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who colors their hair, uses a flat iron, and likes soft and silky hair with a nice shine and no residue.  Great product.  I do intend to continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell, but it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review for both the Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner by Maple Holistics.  In addition to using these products, I also have a different brand of 100% Pure Argan Oil. I thought these products would go down the drain just like everything else I’ve purchased for my hair. I have spent thousands of dollars – trying everything new that comes out to control my hair and nothing – and I mean nothing – works. I’ve been reading up on argan oil and figured I’d give these products a try. The main problem is my hair that it is overly frizzy. I wake in the morning to bam, a pile of puff. No matter how short I’ve kept my hair it is always the same thing. When it was long, it had to be in a ponytail and even then the tail had a mind of its own. Forget flat ironing too; it would just make my hair like straw and fry the ends. Just terrible hair!! I wash my hair about twice a week, if that, and always with cool water. Since using the shampoo/conditioner, I have noticed that my puff is gone! Every morning I awake to see the condition of my hair and with a few pulls here and there, I’m actually good to go!! This has never happened before – and I mean never. I will lightly blow dry my hair and use about a pea size conditioner plus argan oil together to smooth it out; I can even flip my hair upside down and rake my fingers through it and it will be the smoothest hair (for days) I’ve ever had.  I’m now afraid to use anything still in  my bathroom; heck, why should I, as I know this is a keeper for sure!</li>
            <li> I had read all the positive reviews, and with the price, I thought...it cannot hurt....&lt;br /&gt;I was truly amazed..it did lather unlike a lot of sulfate-free shampoos.  But it felt light in my hair.  I love the way it makes my hair look even more.  After it dried, the harsh chemical look from coloring (last summer), was no longer present.  The ends of my hair HAD been dry, making me want to cut off a good 4&amp;#34;, and after using this shampoo - it was smooth as a baby&#x27;s... you know...It was soft.  My husband even noticed the difference...and ladies, we know that means the shampoo is majorly quick *#!&lt;br /&gt;Love the product.  Very good customer service.  Emailed me to ensure I was happy with the product.  That impressed me as well.&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence of whether to buy or not, get off the fence.  I assure you that you will be happy you made the jump.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Not a paid spokesperson or relative of Maple Holistics&amp;#34; - just a new customer.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Only have to use a small amount and using with the conditioner makes make treated hair nice and shiny.  I will buy again.  Used to use Organic Excellence, but like this better.</li>
            <li> Works great ....it&#x27;s made my hair so much more manageable!</li>
            <li> My wife asked me reorder this and get a conditioner from the same company.  She requires sulphate-free shampoo and says this works great for her hair.</li>
            <li> It dried out my normally oily hair. I can&#x27;t even imagine shampooing two times with this, like the instructions say. I honestly hated it.</li>
            <li> this is a very nice shampoo I use sulfate free shampoo for the past 5 years and my hair has increased in volume. This shampoo enriched with argan oil leaves the scalp feeling invigorated. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my dandruff. Every time I wash my hairs my scalp gets really clean  but my dandruff comes back the next day.It is not completely a anti dandruff shampoo but it really reduced hair fall. I have noticed huge  reduction in hair fall also. It smells good. I would definately buy it again.It is little expensive but worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product mostly because it is vegan friendly and contains my favorite oils such as argan, jojoba, avocado, almond. It smells pretty good as well, not too strong as some other natural shampoos. I also like that it is sulfate free! The only thing i think it is a bit pricey for such small bottle, but my hair felt very clean after using a small amount of it. Overall, I am excited to see how my hair feels and looks after using it a few more times!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the pros: good size shampoo bottle, nice packaging and label. The product itself works really well- I like the texture of the shampoo and how my hair feels afterwords.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;m really disappointed in the scent (or lack thereof). I honestly ordered this shampoo because the ingredients sounded like they&#x27;d make my hair smell fabulous: almond, peach kernel, jojoba... I guess I was expecting a peach/almond scent but felt disappointed that this was anything but. The Silk conditioner has a wonderful vanilla scent and I wish the shampoo could incorporate the same type of pleasant scent!&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> What makes this shampoo amazing besides being sulfate-free is that it does not rob my hair of moisture, but actually hydrates it!</li>
            <li> Great gentle shampoo to use often. Left my blonde color treated hair clean, nourished, soft and extremely shiny without leaving it greasy feeling or a residue. Company provided excellent customer service and fasting shipping. I believe the &amp;#34;Silk&amp;#34; Conditioner would compliment this product well and would love to try that next!! :))</li>
            <li> Really like this Argan oil shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t strip your color away, yet you feel like your hair is clean and healthy after use. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It made my dry hair soft after first use.altho it has no smell it is a great shampoo I love how it lathers u don&#x27;t need a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Love it, happy again with maple holistic!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  I have combination hair, oily on the top and super dry from middle to the end.  I have been looking for shampoo that will make my hair feel smoother and not oily up.  I always stay away from Argan oil type of product as I feel it will make my hair too oily look like &amp;#34;noodles&amp;#34;.  After reading all the review, I decided to get the combo of Argan oil shampoo and the silk 18 conditioner.  The price is reasonable as natural and sulfate free.  The product smells good, very light fresh secents and the shampoo didn&#x27;t leave my hair oily.  Hair feel clean but not stripped dry.  The conditioner was not too rich, it feels like its just enough to keep the good stuff in the hair without the greasy feeling.  I bought the combo back in Nov, 2014 and used it for 2 months now (app arching 3 moths).  I am ready to get my next sets again!&lt;br /&gt;(PS. my hair has been colored several times, and I have those corse Asian hair!)</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo! This made my hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever!! The sulfate free aspect keeps my color vibrant and the oils keep my hair nice and healthy!! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> SO this is just awful. I couldn&#x27;t even give it away. Perhaps someone with different hair might like it. But for me a white girl it didn&#x27;t work and my hair still felt dirty after :(</li>
            <li> When I initially used this product on my hair I wasn&#x27;t sure if my hair was supposed to feel like a weird texture or not. But I mixed it with another shampoo and then continued my cleansing regimen with a deep conditioner hydrating mask, and this product can mix with other hair cleansers. I have only used it once but I will try again to see more results.</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: I received a product discount for this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having very curly hair, I needed a shampoo that would keep my hair from frizzing, while not weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo did a great job. It has the body of creme rinse, and is low foaming. I was worried that the fragrance would be overwhelming, as I am sensitive to perfumes, I was happy to discover that the scent, while not light, is not too strong either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that this is a great product, and highly recommend it. My husband even likes it. :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo which is nature for my children and myself. After using this shampoo, my hair feel more smoothly and less fizzy. . My son has itchy dry scalp, after he use it, he doesn&#x27;t feel it anymore.</li>
            <li> Better than other brands Ive used.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers nicely using only a very small amount of product, which makes it a good value.  It leaves my hair soft and shiney; plus, I really like that it is safe for color treated hair.  Great product that I would recommend to others and will definitely reorder myself.</li>
            <li> **Update** This is our third bottle and the result is AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I really like the shampoo because of all the oils included. The shampoo does not dry out our hair while cleansing and it does not leave it oily.  I like that it includes Argan, Jojoba, Avocado, Almond, Peach Kernel, Camellia Seed, and Keratin because they are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;It honestly feels like a deep cleansing treatment and the scalp is not left dry.  After the first use the hair felt thick and smooth. We love the neutral scent, It just feels completely clean..&lt;br /&gt;We are completely satisfied with the product and will continue to use it. Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> I used this with the Silk conditioner by Maple Holistics and my hair loves it. I have natural hair once my hair air drys it doesn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Argan Oil Shampoo and the 18 Silk Conditioner and have been using it for several weeks.  I really love it.  I have very fine color treated hair. It gave me more body than any shampoo has before and it feels very healthy.  Usually if I use a moisturizing shampoo for the color, it weighs my hair down.  But using a shampoo for volume dries it out too much.  The combination of the Maple Holistics shampoo and conditioner works very well. The only negative thing I can say about it is that the bottle was a little smaller than I thought it would be. I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on all the reviews and because my hair is color treated.  But I found it to be too harsh, it faded my hair color from the first wash and my hair felt very dry. Even my husband after using it found that his scalp felt very dry. I use it now only as a body wash :(</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a nice shampoo since I moved to USA and I have finally found this one. This shampoo is really nice, it cleans the hair well but does not strip off natural hair oil (cause it contains argan oil). Only small amount will lather well, so I hope it will go pretty long, even though the quantity seems small. I have been using this for couple of days and can already tell the difference. Now I am interested in trying the Silk 18 conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;I think the shampoo is worth trying. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around the hair line that is easily irritated by harsh chemicals found in many shampoos. This shampoo is great!  No harsh chemicals. Leaves hair clean and shiny. Love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing Stuff! I&#x27;m undergoing chemo again and don&#x27;t want to lose my hair!! Before I got this shampoo my scalp ached and was supper itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Very very soothing; makes my scalp pain go away and my head is not so itchy anymore. I still have my hair...  I love this shampoo. I would defiantly recommend to others, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Will never use anything else !!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Am on my 2nd bottle &amp; my hair is not as dry as it was with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t leave a lot of buildup in my hair, cause damage, and that would help with frizz. I decided to try natural shampoos and after searching on Amazon I came across this one. I am so amazed with it. You only use about a quarter size amount and it really softens your hair. My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy and isn&#x27;t weighed down by buildup like other shampoos. I am impressed and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this shampoo for about a week now, and I am loving it. Approximately one year ago I made the switch to more natural shampoo in an attempt to limit my exposure to chemicals. I started out by making my own recipes I had found on the internet from various health blogs, but never found one that worked for me. I then turned to the no-poo method with baking soda and apple cider vinegar. Contrary to the many positive experiences I read about this method, it actually ended up damaging my hair. From there, I turned to Shea Moisture. Although I like the conditioner from this brand, the shampoo did little for my hair. Left with dry, life-less, and coarse feeling hair, I returned back to my old commercial products. However, even with the return my hair wasn’t improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this shampoo a try, and I am so happy I did. My hair is returning to being silky-soft after just one week of use (I should note I have very long, thick hair). I’ve also noticed a significant decrease in the amount of frizz and a big improvement in shine. The smell is awesome – think tropical breeze- and it lathers up so well. My only complaint about it is that after I rinse it out, it leaves my hair feeling “squeaky” in the shower – don’t know how else to describe it. This bothered me at first, but now that I’m seeing such an improvement in my hair’s health, I could care less. I’m definitely going to be trying other products from this company, including the conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is first time i am using Argon oil Shampoo and i liked it in very first time. My hairs looks more shinny, more dense. After seeing my hair result, my husband started using this product too. I am in love with shampoo now. It is Sulphate free, paraben free, what else a person needs. Also cost wise it is not like otjer products which are avaialble in market and are so expensive. I have started this product and wont stop now.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and just used it once, but my hair feels real soft in the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I have very little dandruff and I hope over the period it solves that problem as well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo along with the silk18 makes my hair super soft and shiny.  Love both products!</li>
            <li> I was looking into purchasing Argan shampoo because my hair is color treated so much it is dried out. I have used it three times so far and while it does leave your hair &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; it remove build up from styling products. If you DONT condition afterward, like most natural shampoos, it WILL leave it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; like. Most moisturizer shampoos ACTUALLY leave residues in the hair and DONT clean your hair, so if your shampoo leaves your hair with a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feeling then its ACTUALLY cleaning your hair. I followed up with the Maple Holistic Argan Conditioner and my hair is silky. I was also surprised to see how long my hair held up till next wash, it did not oil up like it normally does.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt happier or more full of body.  This does not weigh down my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I had practically given up on my hair ever looking and feeling healthy. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the natural feel my hair has after using this shampoo. Many oil shampoos leave my hair feeling heavy or flat, but this one leaves my hair conditioned but with a natural amount of body. I&#x27;m very excited to find a natural shampoo that has good performance and is much lower cost than Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> After all the reveiws i decided to Buy the product but i got disappoionted after using it, made my hair so oily and greasy.</li>
            <li> First , there is way to much lather for a sulfate free shampoo. Tangled my hair and dried it out. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Can see an improvement in shine and silkiness of my hair. And you truly only need a quarter size amount to get good lather. This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great products, speedy delivery, and packaged great. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and naturally conditions the hair without making it oily or leaving build up. It leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple weeks. I have naturally soft hair but this just improves it. I was looking for something natural and came across Maple Holistics. I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone to try!</li>
            <li> Argan Oil Shampoo is great, it does not fade my hair color !  All shampoos that I had used in the past, even using shampoo for colored hair has faded my hair each time I washed my hair .  Also Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner leaves my hair shiny &amp; soft, easy to manage .</li>
            <li> It does its cleaning &amp; nourishing the hair! I have been using different kinds of shampoo, but most of them leave my hair dry and look unhealthy. After trying this shampoo, it works well to keep my hair look and feel healthy. It seems to make more volume to my hair, since the hair must have some nutrition from it. I like it! :)</li>
            <li> OK girl&#x27;s this is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this shampoo, it makes my hair so smooth silky and smelling great. I can&#x27;t stop smelling my hair through out the day lol.&lt;br /&gt;shipping was good too. i really like this.</li>
            <li> My mom actually recommended this to me.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my hair now.&lt;br /&gt;with in two days it made a huge difference and my hair is much more soft now. i also see less hair on the my comb now, i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s from the shampoo .&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this ,its great .</li>
            <li> I am converting my entire house to chemical free and started in the bathroom. This product works well with my hair. It looks and feels good longer. I now only wash my hair every 3rd day. No feeling oily or looking yucky! And I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Have this product a try and will recommend it to anyone. I have hair that gets dry and unmanageable and this shampoo has changed all that my hair is left soft and shiny without looking weighed down like so many other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have fine, shoulder-length color-treated hair.  I&#x27;ve tried several sulfite-free shampoos before and they either made my hair greasy or felt like they completed disappears and stripped my hair.  After switching to an expensive salon color, I thought I would research this again and found this product.  I&#x27;ve never heard of this line but there were so many positive reviews I made a purchase.  I used a 1st application, the size of a quarter.  It didn&#x27;t lather up at all so I thought it was going to be another fail, but I followed the directions and applied the same amount a 2nd time and it lathered up great and rinsed without feeling stripped.  I followed with my usual Keihl&#x27;s brand sunflower conditioner for color-treated hair and other usual styling products.  I blow dried and styled as usual.  My hair felt notably soft all day and night.  There was no strong smell of any kind to the product which makes no difference to me.  I will continue to use this product as long as it doesn&#x27;t build up as some shampoos can do but I don&#x27;t think that will happen.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for several weeks and it gets better each time. Initially, it left my hair feeling &amp;#34;ropy&amp;#34; but I decided to stick with it. Giving it more time made a difference. Now my hair feels smoother (while wet). I also use the Silk 18 conditioner. I am 65 years old, my hair is color-treated, curly &amp; wavy. shoulder length.I think I will buy it again. Don&#x27;t expect this to feel like commercial hair shampoos. I have noticed my color is not fading and my scalp feels less dry.My color faded with any other sulfate-free shampoo. Glad I found a winner.</li>
            <li> I used it once and I didn&#x27;t like it. I have white female hair; fine and long. It makes it oily despite using only a little and rinsing thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair super dry. My hair literally squeaks after rinsing the shampoo off. It also has a weird smell, kinda like plastic. However their customer service is AMAZING. They really do have 100% satisfaction guaranteed!</li>
            <li> very good shampoo!! does nt a have strong overbearing smell. nice light scent. leave hair feeling clean revitalized</li>
            <li> I got this for free from Maple Holistics when I reviewed their silk conditioner. I loved the conditioner, but this was less popular. However, I love this shampoo! It lathers with very little shampoo needed, cleanses well and leaves my hair feeling silky. It doesn&#x27;t get frizzy like it used to. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the shampoo and this review is based on only one week of usage; I can tell there are not a lot of chemicals in it. hair looks great!</li>
            <li> good. after using this product, my hair smell is totally removed.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Great product especially for my long, color treated hair.  Sulfate free hair products have made my hair so soft and healthy,  but this one is THEORY best.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, I like that no toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have always had thick poofy wavy hair. My hair is horribly big and fried looking. Now my hair is no longer fried looking and I have nice curls. I use the shampoo and conditioner it has made drastic improvements with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have coarse greying hair, and in recent months with more grey areas coming in, my hair has become totally unmagageable with cowlicks sticking up everywhere when I get up in the morning.  I have to mist or wet some areas to get them to lie back in place.  After using Argan Oil Shampoo just one time, my hair has been softer to the touch, and no more waking up with wild and crazy hair in the mornings.  It&#x27;s amazing, really.  I used this shampoo conbined with the Silk18 conditioner, and I am sold on these products.</li>
            <li> Used this for 3 weeks, it feels great on the hair but leave the hair thin.&lt;br /&gt;OK as shampoo, but don&#x27;t expect anything more (i.e. not effective for hair-loss)</li>
            <li> Overall this is a very good product. I have been using it a little over two months now. I have fine straight hair that gets oily after a day. I originally bought this product to help my dry scalp. I have noticed my hair feels healthier, my scalp is better (but its winter so not totally flake free) and it is noticeably not nearly as oily. I do not have to use my dry shampoo as much or at all. Drawbacks- It is harsh at first, does not lather up quite as well, and leaves hair VERY stipped/ squeaky clean feeling (Compaired to salon brands), beacause of this i gave 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Good natural shampoo...doesn&#x27;t really have a strong smell and lathers great!  I prefer the Sage better if you like earthy smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo. Its the best shampoo I ever used it made my hair feel so soft and manageable. I would recommend any product from this company.</li>
            <li> I splurged on a Brazilian keratin treatment and had to go sulfate free.  I did not like the loreal shampoo and decided to go with a natural product.  This shampoo is wonderful.  It does produce suds, much more on the second wash  It leaves my hair clean, soft, and easy to comb. I wonder if I will even need another keratin treatment after switching to this and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to do made my hair soft much less frizzy.  Must buy both this shampoo Argan Oil Shampoo, Sulfate free&lt;br /&gt;Maple Holistics and the silky conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very long ( past waist ) thin Asian hair &amp; this shampoo was perfect! I previously used Aveda brand shampoos but now I&#x27;m in love with this brand &amp; will definitely be purchasing more from Maple Holistics. I only use a nickle size amount to my scalp and it cleans very thoroughly. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all and it actually adds a bit of volume! Will definitely be trying all their products.</li>
            <li> The combination of this shampoo and the Silk 18 purchase has really conditioned my hair.  I leave this shampoo in for a few extra minutes.  Not too much lather, and rinses well.  My color treated hair shines.  this removes any greasy, sticky product build up, also.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a shampoo without all the additives that make my scalp itch.  This shampoo made my hair look great and my scalp doesnt itch!  Would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Did as the instructions informed and used a quarter-sized amount of product. Next time I use it I will cut back a little because I had more lather than needed for my length hair. Left it in while I took my shower and actually didn&#x27;t use any conditioner. To my surprise I was pleased with the results for not following with a conditioner, I think that says a lot right there! I have been using a sulfate-free shampoo for months &amp; I can tell you that my hair color lasts so much longer than it ever has. I can&#x27;t wait to begin trying other products by Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> I received the item on time, and so far I like it! I&#x27;ve only used the shampoo a couple times but I think I like it. :)</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great.  I only shampoo a couple of times a week so as not to dry out my naturally curly salt and pepper hair.  The shampoo has a nice, subtle aroma (strong odors are more of a turn off the older I get).  Even though it is sulfate free, I get a nice lather.  I also ordered the Silk 18 conditioner.  My hair has been really soft and manageable even though the humidity has been through the roof.  Definitely a winner for me.</li>
            <li> My hair feels less dry after using this compared to my other shampoo. It is more pricey for the amount you get, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just AMAZING!!! I have spend a lot of time searching for a natural shampoo for my family and I. This all natural shampoo does the job and leaves my hair silky, bouncy and fresh. Also love the fresh scent of vanilla it has.</li>
            <li> This product is just Great, as I have very straight, baby fine, color treated hair, and this shampoo makes my hair look great. As it&#x27;s been a very cold winter (we live on the east coast) and my hair has been dry and with using this shampoo just once I did not need to use any conditioner at all. My hair looks fuller and is very shiny. Best thing, it&#x27;s all natural, no chemicals or sulfates, I would highly recommend everyone should try this shampoo, and the price is great too. Thank you, Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a hair saver! I&#x27;ve always hated my hair...it&#x27;s frizzy, extremely thick, curly, and dry. I very rarely do more with it than wash it and put it in a bun because it just never looks or feels good. It always feels like theres product or unrinsed conditioner still in it. Then, for the last year, I&#x27;ve had a horribly itchy and flaky scalp. Yay. I tried the wash with baking soda, rinse with vinegar thing but as soon as my hair was dry it felt so gross at my head. Very greasy and just gross. So, I decided maybe I&#x27;d try a sulfate free shampoo as I&#x27;ve heard sulfates are not good for hair. I searched amazon and started clicking on things and reading reviews. I decided on the Argan Oil Sulfate Free shampoo by Maple Holistics. Best decision ever! After just one use my hair felt amazing! So ridiculously soft and I could comb my fingers through it when I straightened it. Usually a little while after straightening it, my hair starts tangling and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d be able to get my fingers through it. This was not the case after using this shampoo. I had a few tangles, but nothing close to usual. My husband thinks I am weird because I spend a lot of time just petting my hair now :) I would highly recommend this amazing shampoo to anyone with hair!!</li>
            <li> So far this has been a good shampoo. I got this Argan Oil Shampoo because I wanted to try something a little more natural with not a lot added in there as sulfate and fragrance. I also like a lot of their ingredients. Though I was slightly nervous about the size when I got it because I might go through it too fast but after trying, this shampoo soaps up nicely so a little will go a long ways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, nice smell</li>
            <li> I have only had this shampoo for a week so I am not ready to say I love it.  I have fine wavy/curly hair.  This shampoo makes my scalp feel clean and cleanses the hair well.  I do feel as though it makes my hair feel dry after I wash until I apply conditioner.  I will continue to use this product.  I do like how it seems to help with my itchy scalp.  I follow up with Silk 18 Amino Conditioner from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good sulfate free shampoo and this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried. Thus far I&#x27;ve been very pleased. I have semi-thick, wavy, oily hair and each wash leaves me hair feeling smooth and much dryer. I can&#x27;t tell if my hair is any shinier but it feels much better over my old shampoo. For the amount you need you get a pretty decent lather, and I haven&#x27;t found that I&#x27;ve needed more than the recommended amount. Overall this shampoo gets my recommendation!</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo itself but it&#x27;s really expensive for how little you get. I didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottle was when I bought it and with long hair it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is my first go at using a sulfate free shampoo. I have curly hair that has recently became thin, dry and stringy. After searching online about my problem I have read that sulfate free shampoo will help with my problems :) I purchased this argan shampoo and honestly could tell a difference right away with my first wash. I use the amount it states on the bottle and it foams up nicely which was a surprise. This shampoo to me really has no scent at all. I have used it for probably a week or so and I am noticing thicker, squeaky clean hair. I am excited about this product and how it is helping my hair. I am losing less hair which is an added bonus for me. It&#x27;s great...I am totally going to buy more!</li>
            <li> It still has sulfate in it.. Really!!!</li>
            <li> Also leaves hair really dry, not what I expected at all. Overpriced for what you get. They should put &amp;#34;homeopathic&amp;#34; in the description since it&#x27;s written on the bottle.  Am suspicious of the 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li> Makes my unruly, frizzy and straw like hair amazingly soft.  this shampoo has a little lather so you feel like you are really cleaning your hair but it doesn&#x27;t feel stripped when you rinse it out.  I have been using the Silk 18 conditioner with it, and the 2 together have done amazing things to my hair!!  Super soft and manageable!  No more frizz!  truly awesome products.</li>
            <li> Was excited to receive this in the mail yesterday and rushed to wash my hair with this and Silk 18 conditioner. Today my hair feels and looks dry like a broom.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural... Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair though</li>
            <li> Was looking for something for dry and tinted hair, something gentle and moisturizing and that I could use every day without worrying. It&#x27;s too soon to tell the long term effects, but I can say that it sure lathers up well for a sulfate free product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo because I have been experiencing what I believe to be age-related hair changes. My hair has been drier, fluffier in a bad way...I wanted a gentle shampoo. This has been great. It lathers nicely without having to use very much and does a nice job gently cleansing my hair. I also ordered the Silk 18, and together, these products have made my hair a bit more manageable. But the one who really loves the combination is my 9 year old daughter. I have tried many shampoos for her, and ordered her the Degreaser because her scalp is always very itchy. However, she has requested I buy her the Argan shampoo and Silk 18 because they have made her long, fine hair so much easier to comb out. She has Never requested a particular product before and always just shrugs when I ask her if she liked something (we have tried so many!). She also says her head has felt more comfortable, and that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> BEST SHAMPOO I&#x27;ve ever used !!!!!!!!!! I have waist length baby soft but thick hair that has tangled ALL of my life!!!, have never been able to find a shampoo that would detangle it till now I will differently be ordering the cond. too and its shiny from root to the end of my tips, I am amazed Totally!!!! P.S. If you write a positive review and email it to the company they will send a free gift, mine was another full size of the same Argon oil shampoo I am a very happy camper!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having severe hair fall and i used many products before and spent lots of money, but it did nothing than making things worse...&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product and i really like it....finally somthing is working on my hair...&lt;br /&gt;Being a doctor, i advice my patients, friends and family to use it and i&#x27;m having good feed back....so i strongly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally thick, frizzy and wavy hair. I have always splurged on haircare products because bottom shelf shampoo and conditioners dry out my hair, making my natural hair issues even worse. Let me tell you this Argan oil shampoo from Maple Hollistics has changed my life. I&#x27;m sitting here with my morning coffee, running my fingers through my luscious locks, appreciating the fact that my hair is super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo for two weeks and have noticed a huge difference documented in pictures. I can skip the conditioner step with this shampoo. My hair is soft, manageable, not frizzy and healthy looking. My complimentary sample from Maple Holistics will run out soon but I&#x27;ll be a regular customer - this is a must have hair product for me.</li>
            <li> No description was given of the smell of this shampoo. I&#x27;m sure it is good shampoo, but I like shampoos and conditioners that smell clean and bright. Nothing that smells like suntan oil, coconut, or food (unless it&#x27;s lemon or grapefruit). This has an odd smell ... not quite as much vanilla as the conditioner, but it does not smell good to me. It smells like some kind of rubber or adhesive that&#x27;s pretty awful.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil Shampoo is amazing! It leaves my hair feeling CLEAN!! No buildup and it smells good too. Only a little bit is needed to sud up. I use this in addition to the Silk 18 Conditioner which is also amazing.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and shiny, and people always compliment me on how great my hair smells and looks.</li>
            <li> This is my second product from mapleholistics. Totally, I bought two shampoos. First, I used sage shampoo. That is good. Now ArganOil Shampoo.This  is really amazing! It leaves my hair feeling CLEAN!! No buildup and it smells good too like natural skikakai(Indian hair cleaning product). Only a little bit is needed to sud up. I use this in addition to the aveenoo conditioner which is also amazing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is GREAT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a month now and my hair has never looked better. It makes my hair look and feel really healthy, soft and silky without weighing it down. I wish I discovered this product sooner, but better late than never!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I am going to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo i have used and no chemical feeling</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I wish I had known of it sooner.  My hair feels great - cleaner and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> my hair feels healthier and smooth , would recommend these products</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel so soft n manageable</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time and am impressed. With most shampoos, you have to use a lot of product to get a nice lather going. I followed the directions and used a quarter-sized amount which was actually a little too much as my hair is medium length. It works up into a nice thick lather and rinses out easily. After rinsing it out I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference at first compared to other shampoos, but the next morning my hair felt much softer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It smells great and it lathers nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this is that it is fully natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, it is good for your hair follicles for stimulation and cessation of hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;It helped me. I am happy :)</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.Wanna order it again.</li>
            <li> I had tried this product before, it&#x27;s okay.. very natural, good smell!</li>
            <li> I am Asian with black, thick and strong straight hair. I love this shampoo. It makes my hair softer and less volume.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! It lathers up very well - unlike some sulfate-free shampoos I have tried. My scalp feels clean afterwards and my hair holds conditioner better. This is the best my hair has felt in years.</li>
            <li> The product worked wonderful my hair feels softer and less fizzy. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again. I am going to have my mom use it too.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just great for my hair. I&#x27;m going to be completely honest and just say that I&#x27;ve decided to keep using this shampoo for the following reasons: It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Other shampoos would leave my hair in awful conditions given the many chemicals they tend to contain. I didn&#x27;t notice the change until I started using this product. After washing my hair for the first time, I noticed how my hair had more body. With the conditioner it&#x27;s even better. My curls, which aren&#x27;t the same after heat and hair dyes, look like they are finally starting to revive. I recommend this product for those who have oily hair. I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t as oily as it was after two days, so that&#x27;s another pro. Overall great product!</li>
            <li> It seemed to be old, it smelled weird. Ingredients were not as good as I thought. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!!! My hair look great after using it, very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This product is great. My hair is manageable and the dryness is gone. I recommend this product for anyone with dry hair and a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> It took all the moisture out of my hair...really dried out my hair!</li>
            <li> I requested a free sample via their website, this stuff is awesome! it leaves my hair soft &amp; shiny&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy and color processed hair.  Also, have had a number of keratin treatments so I try to use shampoo with no sulfates.  I have recently tried a co-wash shampoo/conditioner and don&#x27;t feel like my hair and scalp were really clean.  So far this argan shampoo (and I used the argan conditioner with it) has exceeded my expectations.  It lathered nicely, rinsed well and most importantly my scalp and hair felt clean.  After blow drying my hair is very soft, no frizz and has bounce to it.  There is little to no smell which is fine for me.  I ordered a couple of products, which were delivered very quickly. One of them leaked in the process of shipping.  I notified Amazon and received a prompt refund for that particular product, great customer service.  I definitely will order again.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable 2 out of 5 times. Sometimes i felt the hair is soft but when i run my fingers through my hair it was kind of rough. But the outer touch was soft. I know this is weird but may be its just because i used the shampoo wrong? The instructions say to massage on scalp and leave it for 2-3 minutes which is strange coz i never had used a shampoo which asks to leave it on. But overall its a good product but thought it to be bit expensive as it really hasnt worked wonders.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for 4 - 6 wks.  I found that using this shampoo alone creates a very drying affect on my hair.  Especially using it in the winter I had major drying and static.  The smell is also not great.  The smell doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell bad at all but is a bit rough during application.  I used my conditioner (Avalon Organics brand) and it didn&#x27;t help at all with the drying/static issue.  I then purchased the Silk Conditioner from Maple Holistics and used it with this shampoo and saw a world of difference.  No more static and no more drying and the Silk Conditioner smells AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maple Holistics contacted me after my purchase to see how I liked the shampoo.  I recently responded and let them know my opinion, as stated above.  They refunded my money for the shampoo and offered to send me the new Argan Shampoo that just come out.  I also received a 20% off coupon for a future purchase within 30 days.  I am very very pleased with their customer service and look forward to trying the latest version of the Argan Shampoo as well as other products.  I highly recommend trying Maple Holistic products.  It is really at no risk since if you&#x27;re not satisfied they are true to their word and will refund your money.  I&#x27;ve dealt with a lot of holistic shampoo companies and this is not always the case.  Their customer service receives a 5 star for sure.</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil Shampoo is OK, but not that great.  I am not fond of the smell and it does not suds that well.  I do not think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Did not experience dandruff issues from other organic shampoo products.</li>
            <li> so far so good, this shampoo is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised! There is no smell to this shampoo, and though it does not foam, it still gets my hair nice and clean every time!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for about a week now, and have no problems to report so far.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair really nice and soft, but it still has body.  As I&#x27;ve aged, my hair has thinned considerably so I need something that will help in several ways.  I need to keep a &#x27;poofy&#x27; style to disguise how thin my hair is, but most shampoos that offer help with body are also drying.  Sadly, my hair and scalp are super dry.  This makes my scalp itch and my hair break easily.  If I go for a shampoo with body I have other problems.  I&#x27;m really pleased that this shampoo makes my hair cooperative and easy to style as I want, while also making it feel healthier.  My scalp feels less dry too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the two sudsing method the directions say to, but with my short hair, one application gives me nice lather so next time I&#x27;ll try that to see if I still get the great effect.  Since this is a rather expensive shampoo, I&#x27;d like it to last as long as possible, but even if I still need both applications, I&#x27;ll rebuy as the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is the answer to my problems.  I can go longer between washes without my hair looking oil.  The biggest plus is the use of natural ingredients and sulfate free.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this because I&#x27;m allergic to sulfate so I wanted a Sulfate-Free shampoo. I was pleased with this product, has good lather and doesn&#x27;t take much. My hair is fine and it didn&#x27;t weigh it down. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t have any scent to it, even a light scent. I don&#x27;t like a strong perfume smell but I thought a light scent would be nice. I would probably buy this product again and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this product.  Her hair was very dry and frizzy.  Her first application she was so excited immediately gave me the shampoo for me to try.  I had the same experience with the shampoo and my hair. I use a lot of product in my hair.  Root Booster and hair spray on top of shampoo and conditioners.  This Argan shampoo stripped out all the product buildup out of my hair,with out drying it out, and it&#x27;s never been this shiny!!  No more frizz either.  No other shampoo could do this.  I have gone through many, many.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my own the same day, and then ordered more for my daughters Easter Basket!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, and I appreciate the company emailing me to see if I like their product.&lt;br /&gt;Very good customer service.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is gentle and creamy.  I have only used it a handful of times so it&#x27;s yet to be seen how it removes styling-product residue.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it&#x27;s ingredients, and this company. My hair is so soft and clean without completely stripping it of its natural oils--this means I can go up to 4 days before another wash :)</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing!! Chemical free- all natural. Leaves my long hair soft, shiny and frizz free. This bottle will last longer than I originally thought because, you only use a small amount. Paired with the Maple Holistics Silk 18 Conditioner, my hair is healthier, soft and smells wonderful. I no longer need to use additional frizz free products that end up weighing my hair down and leaving it &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling! Love, Love Maple Holistics!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo does wash very well. It even gets a nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it makes my hair feel really dry afterwards. It is hard to run my fingers through my hair when rinsing without feeling like my fingers catch and pull on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the feel that this gives my hair. For that reason only, I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li> I received a sample and used it after washing my hair. A little went a long way, and it left my hair feeling soft, looking shiny, and in control. I didn&#x27;t style afterwards like I normally would so don&#x27;t know how it would affect that, but I really like the way my hair felt.</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo seems to start off wonderfully. But before I had finished the bottle, I had already made up my mind to switch to another brand. My hair felt flat without much body to it. Then again, I have thick straight hair (thick strands and a lot of it). I also didn&#x27;t like how the label obscured the shampoo bottle so the only way I could tell how much was left was by the weight of the bottle. If you try this shampoo, good luck!</li>
            <li> I just used this shampoo for a few days now and already my hair feels silkier and more moisturized.  My dry, long hair is looking much better!  I think it really helps to leave the shampoo in your hair for a couple of minutes before rinsing.  I would purchase again.  I also like the fact that this is a natural product but it lathers really well.  Some of the natural shampoos I&#x27;ve tried previously didn&#x27;t lather well and I ended up using lots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got the conditioner.  Both products are very concentrated so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Smelled great, and love that is all natural. More moisturizing than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I seriously LOVE this shampoo. Its makes my hair so soft and smooth. After washing with it I don&#x27;t even feel the need to use conditioner. I will definitely come back for more when my bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! Thick and creamy. It&#x27;s a great price and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the lather and scent of this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s made my hair really soft and flexible. my hair is pretty dry because I always bleach my hair for coloring and highlights . Now I don&#x27;t have to worry for dying my hair because I have this *_*! thanks.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. I was previously using another shampoo that was all natural but it made my hair very sticky and almost TOO soft. This shampoo makes my hair feel fuller and thicker. I am looking forward to trying out the Silk18 Conditioner with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I loved that it is sulfate free, I like the smell of it, but I had a little problem with the bottle, when I traveled the shampoo leaked, although I wrapped it well.</li>
            <li> very good feeling so far.. I will definitely recommend this natural shampoo to my girl :)./</li>
            <li> Acts like a clarifying shampoo with a little conditioning action. The argan oil makes my hair very soft and fluffy-like. Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair so soft and manageable, smells super nice too! I have very fine hair and this shampoo adds great volume and shine!! This is a LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft and healthy! Works surprisingly great for a shampoo made from natural ingredients. The only downside is the lack of smell.</li>
            <li> After two bottles my hair went flat and felt un clean. Had to use a lot to get it to clean right. Made my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li> I seem to be allergic to this shampoo, it makes my scalp really dry and itchy. To be fair, I am allergic to a lot of things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find shampoos that are not harsh to the hair, and Maple Holistics not only met my expectations, but also exceeded it. I looked up each and every ingredient, and Maple Holistics is true to its word: the most of chemicals used are from natural ingredients, none of it is harsh harmful chemicals. I even use it to wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 1 star because of its high price per volume.</li>
            <li> First shampoo that suited my hair from the time I moved in states, I am giving 4* because I am  using it from just last one month, will update my rating and review as it goes further, But till now I like mildness, smell and after effects.</li>
            <li> This was the first all natural shampoo that I tried and I absolutely love it. It worked just as well as the store bought shampoos I have been using.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo! Leaves your hair silky smooth. It also has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> Terrific shampoo! Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased this product and have to say that I am impressed.  I have color treated hair; I use a small amount of Argan Oil Shampoo and follow up with the Silk 18 conditioner (scent is awesome!).  I am pleasantly pleased with the results of both!</li>
            <li> It is natural and my hair feels and looks great!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It took me a while to get rid of the silicone shine in my hair using commercial shampoos. However, after several washings with this shampoo, my hair is now clean and shiny. People tell me how thick my hair looks, and even my hairdresser told me that my hair got thicker. I do not use any conditioner but a very tiny amount of coconut oil at the ends of my hair when hair gets too dry. Once in a while I use another natural shampoo that conditions more. But this is my go to shampoo. Bought it already several times.</li>
            <li> First let me say that this is fantastic for african American natural hair. No tangles and no sulfates.  A great natural product. I have transitioning 3c hair and my hair is so soft and manageable after I use this. Can&#x27;t wait to try their conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water is the main ingredient so it&#x27;s very moisturizing and healthy. I recommend this for anyone wanting to try a natural shampoo at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I selected this shampoo as it was sulfate free.I experienced that  works well to keep my hair look and feel healthy. So far my experience is good.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil Shampoo about a week.  Prior to this my scalp was scaly and flaking and my graying hair was dry and thinner.  Now in only a week the scales are gone and the wave is back in my hair.  I had been using a highly-rated &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; product, but no more.  From now  on, it&#x27;s Argan for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so awesome! It smells great and leaves my hair manageable. My hair feels softer and not as brittle. Will continue to use until I die! So great!!</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today,  lathered well and my hair felt full and clean. Then I used blonde glam conditioner (which I love) even though I&#x27;m a brunette.  My daughter has brown hair with about 4 inches of blonde at the bottom (ombre), We will see how it does for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> First let me say that this is literally the best company that I have ever dealt with.  They truly care about their customers and what we think of their product.  I wish that more companies would pay attention to their business model!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to the shampoo…  The reason that I bought it was because I had just gotten my hair professionally colored and I wanted  a way to make the color last.  Also, I only like to get my hair cut every few months (4-5), so I try to keep it as healthy as possible in between cuts.  Also. another reason (and probably why most people are even looking at this product) is because you are sick of detergents and other odd chemicals being put into hair products.  The ingredients here are natural and not harmful to one&#x27;s hair -- reason enough to put serious thought into ordering this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit about my hair -- it is shoulder-length and very, very thick and wavy.  I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks, and while it’s good, I find that my hair is greasier looking than it is from using other shampoos.  Granted, those other shampoos were not natural, so perhaps it’s just that my hair is truly oily and previous shampoos’ chemicals stripped all of that natural oiliness away.  I don’t find the smell over-powering , as other reviewers mentioned – it’s a nice, pleasant smell that doesn’t linger on your hair post-wash.  I am usually very sensitive to strong smells, perfumes, etc and this doesn’t bother me at all.  Also , this shampoo, for the first time ever of any shampoo (including other “natural” shampoos), actually made my hair feel CLEAN, too -- no gunkiness or build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As  a side note, I ordered the Silk 18 conditioner and can’t say enough good things about it.  Heading over to that product page for review #2!</li>
            <li> I had almost given up hope on liking any organic shampoo or conditioner product. This is amazing. It lathers so well it&#x27;s hard to believe it is sulfate free.  It smells great and it cleanses my scalp and hair really well. It also seems to make my hair shinier.  Normally I have oily hair but lately I have been on some meds that dry me out. I can wash my hair with this every day or every other day and have no problem. I just recently purchased the conditioner and it REALLY conditions so I would probably recommend only using the conditioner at most every two days. The company is very considerate of its patrons. I received a discount coupon upon my first order and a thank you note for trying their product.  I don&#x27;t do things 100% organic but I am tired of buying all of these various name brand shampoos and conditioners that stink and have a ton of product in them that I can&#x27;t pronounce. This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this shampo since my first time use,every time just apply a little bit for my long hair,then make my hair clean and healthy,also it Darken my black color.I will continue use this brand.</li>
            <li> I rely like this shampoo . I think it&#x27;s very good product and it smells good too. And I am very happy to receive my order quickly. thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking quite awhile for a mild but effective shampoo.... this product fits the bill perfectly!  It&#x27;s light nutty fragrance and rich lather produce a very nice calming effect that anyone can appreciate and enjoy. After just a couple weeks use I can see a huge improvement in the health of my hair and scalp. This is the PERFECT shampoo if you have very sensitive skin like myself, but still want a clean fresh feeling in your hair without any harshness or strong fragrance. Service and shipping was excellent as always.... I very highly recommend trying this shampoo for yourself !</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great! It leaves your hair so shiny and soft! So glad I switched to it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo.  Even though it is sulfate free it lathers nicely.  Cleans my hair really well and leaves a nice shine and fluffiness. I have been searching for a natural shampoo without unnecessary harmful chemicals and now I have truly found it. Will definitely be purchasing more in the future.  Would love if it came in a larger bottle. Enjoy this product so much better than Wen shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this all natural product. I have coarse wavy hair and I noticed when I use this shampoo paired with silk 18 conditioner and its a 10 with keratin leave in conditioner that my hair dries quicker and smoother. It&#x27;s decently priced and last me about a couple of months on my medium/long hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and am always on the lookout for good quality shampoo (and other haircare products) that will condition my hair.  This shampoo is rich and conditioning, and cleans without stripping the hair of its natural oils.  I highly recommend it to anyone with curly hair.  The scent is very pleasant, too!</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo a lot. I got it for the keratin to maintain my keratin treatment and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It foams up surprisingly well (very well) for a sulfate- free shampoo. My hair feels clean and it&#x27;s nice and smooth after a wash followed with the Silk conditioner. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is the smell...it doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasant. The first time I used it I really didn&#x27;t like the smell and thought I wouldn&#x27;t be happy with it but I&#x27;ve been using it now for over a month and it gets a lot better with time, the second time was already ok! It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all now. It&#x27;s a minor thing for the quality of the shampoo and I&#x27;m willing to ignore it for the good effects. I would recommend it for anyone wanting smoother, less frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> On my mom’s advice I ordered this shampoo. I used it with silk 18 conditioner and it gave excellent results. After using it my dry hair looked silky and smooth. It suits my dry hair. Their customer dealing is great. I appreciate their concern for customer needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product quality is amazing but there is always a room for improvement. Good luck Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based off of the reviews and I think it&#x27;s fair to say, it&#x27;s a pretty solid product. It doesn&#x27;t lather like a normal shampoo, but I don&#x27;t find that bothersome. It smells great and I&#x27;ve definitely notice a change in my hair for the better. The only complaint I have is, I feel like it makes my hair lose a little volume when I blow dry it out. There could be other variables contributing to that though also. Overall love the product and don&#x27;t plan on going back to the drug store brand junk.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this shampoo overall. It tends to dry out my hair,so I use a good conditioner. Because I color my hair, I am careful about which shampoo to use. Argan shampoo has  been great, no color fading.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has an odd smell of old fat and some ingredients appear to be less than pure.  However, my hair feels and looks amazing and my scalp is not irritated like with 90% of other shampoos.  The seller put extra effort into delivering this item before Christmas. Overall, a good product. I plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> I just received this shampoo yesterday, so my first wash was this AM.  A little goes a long way, and it rinses clean.  No feeling of residual soap like regular shampoos.  There really isn&#x27;t a smell, but that&#x27;s ok, as I&#x27;ve paired it with the Silk 18 and that has a pleasant natural vanilla scent.  I have dry curly hair, it frizzes when it dries, and I&#x27;ve tried many different products.  I&#x27;m hoping I found a winner in this one.</li>
            <li> Just got this shampoo this week and have made the switch forever.  I was looking for a sulfate and chemical-free shampoo and took a chance on the Argan Oil shampoo.  I have long hair that is washed and styled daily.  My scalp was dry and irritated by all of the hair products I have been using. From the first use my hair is softer and shinier than it has been in years.  My scalp feels squeaky clean and it is on the mend.  This shampoo is concentrated, so you only need a small amount; even with long hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos and usually get an over dry scalp &amp; end up using oils and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;But this year I wanted to try something more natural, I&#x27;m super glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use my hair felt thick and smooth. I love the neutral scent.&lt;br /&gt;It just feels completely clean and I don&#x27;t use oils anymore. I am completely satisfied with the product and will continue to use it. Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> I recently was able to try your product over the holidays at a relatives house. And let me tell you my hair never felt so amazing!! I cannot wait to get some!!</li>
            <li> I did some research not too long ago to find the best product for my hair, that will not build up and that will make my hair come back to life after years of coloring. That is when I came across this. I am very glad I did seeing it has done wonders!! I will defiantly be buying more and recommend this product. I love it!! Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> It produces a nice creamy lather. It is pretty much fragrance free. Easy to rinse it off too. I really like it so far. I am a boy, btw.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Argan Shampoo with the Silk 18 conditioner for about 4 days now.  I can already feel a difference in my dry, frizzy hair!  The shampoo lathers really well (which you don&#x27;t expect from a natural product).  My hair feels smoother, softer, and less frizzy after the first few days!  I like that it has all natural ingredients and is color safe.  I wish it came in a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> I went out on a limb to give this a try.  I was looking for something to get my hair really clean, without stripping it.  I have frizzy naturally wavy hair.  This does the trick and leaves my hair feeling super soft, once it&#x27;s dried.  It does make it a bit &amp;#34;tangle-y&amp;#34; when it is being combed out but it&#x27;s very soft once it&#x27;s dried.  It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of a pleasant smell but it isn&#x27;t terrible either.  It honestly reminds me of horse shampoo and I don&#x27;t mind it.  I like it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I know that in most shampoos, artificial products and chemical additives constitute the major ingredients. Most of the time I loose my hair or feel that the product is too strong for me. This product is great: it is soft and I love using it. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m spoiling my hair, on the contrary it gently washes it. Moreover I love the texture!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my scalp reacted badly to this shampoo. The first few times I used it I thought it was working well (lathers nicely, hair shiny and soft), but I started to notice my scalp was really itchy between washings and then I noticed it was starting to flake a little bit and had a few patches of visibly dry skin. I looked up all the ingredients and they&#x27;re all gentle and of good quality so I&#x27;m guessing I have a mild allergic reaction to something. I went back to my previous shampoo (Burt&#x27;s Bees baby shampoo) and continued using Maple Holistic&#x27;s Silk 18 conditioner (love it!) two washings ago and my scalp is almost back to healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the scent of this shampoo to be bad, it just isn&#x27;t good. It smells like plastic. My guess would be as a result of the argan oil? It smells like something truly &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; ought to smell. When paired with a nice smelling conditioner there&#x27;s no issue.</li>
            <li> The ingredients sounded promising, but I would not buy this shampoo again because I do not like the way it smells.  Despite all of the natural ingredients, the shampoo has an icky plastic/chemical aroma.  It does, however, leave my fine, dry hair feeling soft and full.</li>
            <li> Just purchased my second bottle of Argan Oil Shampoo.  Love the way it makes my hair feel and look!  Also appreciate this product does not have all the other ingredients that I don&#x27;t know what they are, let alone can pronounce!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It makes my hair very smooth, shiny, and soft. Thank you Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> Works as intended. My hair feels thicker within the first 2 weeks of use. It feels good knowing I&#x27;m using all natural ingredients and will definitely buy more products of maple holistics!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Read my review for the Silk 18.  The shampoo and conditioner go hand in hand</li>
            <li> This is the best natural shampoo!!  All the good healthy ingredients!! Love it&lt;br /&gt;  Order # 113-1382673-9967430</li>
            <li> My hair felt surprisingly soft after using this shampoo. It did not cause my scalp to itch like my previous shampoo and the price is great to! Definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about this product as I have not had much luck with natural products. However, because there were positive comments from others, I gave it a try. I am so happy I did. Many products have left my hair feeling a little on the greasy side with a filmy feel that was tough to get rid of. This product, however, left my hair feeling so clean and it styles great! This is definitely a product I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> NICE product! Great lather, although not like what I&#x27;m used to, but hey.... it&#x27;s not supposed to be! Love the shine it gave back to my hair and the fullness it has now!</li>
            <li> Not thrilled for very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Gentle on my colored hair and rinses well.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  I have very long, thick hair which was breaking and very frizzy due to coloring.  This product has assisted in calming down the frizz, smells great and I have had a ton of compliments.  My hair will look fantastic for my wedding.</li>
            <li> I used a sample of this shampoo. It has no smell, makes my hair feel soft and look straight. The only bad thing is it made my hair dry. Rest everything is good about this product. Im going to try with their conditioner to get a complete feel about it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product with winter being so harsh this product makes my scalp feel good.</li>
            <li> This is truly a wonderful shampoo. Often I&#x27;ve tried natural shampoos being careful to steer clear of all the chemicals in most shampoos, and been less than satisfied with the results. The Maple Holistics line is true to it&#x27;s word leaving my hair, clean, soft, manageable, smelling great and easy to style. I never find it leaves my hair dry or brittle, which I can say has been the result with many other natural brands.</li>
            <li> Been using for about two weeks and hair feels healthier.  Also using the Natural Conditioner Silk 18.  Good combo.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good but makes my hair really clean and soft.</li>
            <li> This product has lefty hair feeling clean, soft, and full.  I&#x27;ve been surprised that my kids have less knots in their hair using the shampoo with the matching conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service was amazing!  They answered ally questions faster than I&#x27;ve ever had a company respond.  Their emails were always friendly and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My latest order is their dandruff shampoo to have another family member try.  I have confidence this will work just as well.</li>
            <li> For years, I have tried shampoos that promise to make my scalp flake-free &amp; itch-free while still moisturizing my hair so that it doesn&#x27;t break off when I brush it. Sadly, all promises have been broken, until I met Maple Holistics&#x27; Argan Oil Shampoo. Argoil, as I like to call him, is the chocolate ice cream, the whip cream, the chocolate drizzle, &amp; the cherry on top of my beautiful head. I don&#x27;t even like cherries!!! After ONE use, my hair was bouncing &amp; swaying in the wind as if I had never color-treated, blow-dried, or flat-ironed her. My scalp was no longer itchy or dry. This is a HUGE feat, considering I&#x27;ve been having itchy &amp; dry scalp for over 15 years now. Sometimes, out of habit (&amp; because it feels good:), I scratch at my scalp. But unlike before, I only have few flakes appearing on my jet black hair, which can be easily removed with the flick of a wrist.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as a very-much-in-debt college student, I don&#x27;t have a large amount of funds appropriated for pricier beauty supplies such as this (compared to the large bottles of Head &amp; Shoulders I&#x27;ve been purchasing....&amp; that one Paul Mitchell set I splurged on;). Although the bottle is only 8 oz, it doesn&#x27;t take much (1/3 to 1/2 tablespoon) to lather all of my thick, waist-length hair. I also purchased the conditioner, which doesn&#x27;t take much either, as long as you add a little bit of water as you work your way through the shampoo/conditioner. These products are WELL worth the money, &amp; I will continue to purchase Argoil, so long as the formula stays the same. Maple Holistics has a new loyal customer &amp; that says a lot, since I am not the type of person to commit to 1 brand.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did not work well for me.  It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling especially clean afterwards, and I felt like my hair texture was a little rougher after use.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a Keratin treatment and colors her hair; with the keratin treatment I bought her the products they sell you at the salon. She was running low and I started looking for good sulfate free shampoos online. This came up; she gave it a try, and WOW great product! Her hair is curly, frizzy, and gets split ends easily. Now her hair is soft, shiny, and her ends look and feel so much better. I am excited to see how it keeps doing wonders to her hair.</li>
            <li> After a long and thorough study of the market for shampoo without toxic products in it, firmly stopped on Maple Holistics Argan Oil  Shampoo. I dare say without any exaggeration that the shampoo works perfectly for my hair. It is alive in touch, with glitter. Here is my second order for the same shampoo. Thanks for a great product: surely become  one  regular customer! I have a recommendation to Maple Holistics: if  it is possible  let the shampoo to be available in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> Fabulous shampoo for my thin dry damaged frizzy hair - looks softer and healthier after just one wash.</li>
            <li> Amazing love this shampoo..I have tangly hair and color treated hair it doesn&#x27;t strip the coloring.. Its safe ,very happy will purchase again.</li>
