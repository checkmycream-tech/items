            <li>The best thing is that it works for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I know that astraxanthin is a very good anti-oxidant.  </li>
            <li>Happy with the product and the service was excellent.</li>
            <li>so that is a good thing!</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great and the tone and texture have greatly improved.</li>
            <li>Great product and great price.</li>
            <li>Goes on great ..very absorbent not greasy..feels soothing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>It works great under my make up as well.</li>
            <li>They work great and they&#x27;re inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Derma e products are great.  </li>
            <li>However, it is a great creme.</li>
            <li>(I kid you not) but has a very nice texture and it absorbs well  into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I have used that with good result however it has a slippery consistency that I don&#x27;t like to use under eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>My face feels good after I put it on.  </li>
            <li>Good service.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful rich cream.</li>
            <li>night creme is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>Another really great feature of this cream is that it is Pariben free.</li>
            <li>I think this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have found this  product to be just as good or even better</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so thrilled-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this Night Creme is good, too....</li>
            <li>However, I liked the smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and feels nice</li>
            <li>kind of gives your skin a temporary orange tone as you put it on.  </li>
            <li>I find this cream light and coverage good.  </li>
            <li>and I think my search of the best products for my skin stops with Derma e (I&#x27;m using the Antioxidant Gel daily and the Microdermabrasion Scrub weekly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this product for 6 weeks, my skin is now silky smooth!  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better, smoother and more</li>
            <li>Even better is that it has improved the Howdy Doody lines around my nose and mouth.</li>
            <li>I sure do hope that it works.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know about those two rave reviews - do NOT expect anything magical to happen with this cream.   </li>
            <li>I love this night cream.</li>
            <li>Love the e derma product.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy more.</li>
            <li>their hyaloronic night cream is way better</li>
            <li>I bought yet another cream that is an ok moisturizer - but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the day creme, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I have tried several varieties of derma e products and i&#x27;m very happy with all of them.  </li>
            <li>I use all derma-e products for my face and I love them.</li>
            <li>But, I will say, I think my skin started to look more youthful after using these products.  </li>
            <li>Mostly, I&#x27;ve been using the wrinkle-reverse, which I like, but I decided to mix it up and try this one.</li>
            <li>My favorite night cream.</li>
            <li>the good reviews, this may be a final product in my search for good skin</li>
            <li>It is okay but certainly not the best I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of it, and love to put plenty on clean face when I am retiring for the day.</li>
            <li>Absorbs great and makes my skin feel both firmer and soft.</li>
            <li>and they are not harsh and feel great on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS - There is a product out there with a strong concentration of astraxanthin called Ocean 6 Illuminus.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27; say its reversing the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I used it for maybe 3 nights before throwing it in the trash, so I wasn&#x27;t able to determine if it&#x27;s an effective product as far as night cremes go.</li>
            <li>All perform very well; I feel I&#x27;m being nice to my skin when I use them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, and my skin is smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I am surprised by how I reacted to this, since I&#x27;ve figured Derma E made good, quality products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special for the price.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding a cream that will not breakout my face, so this is perfect if you want to keep from breaking out.</li>
            <li>Within 3 mins of putting this product on my face and neck, I started burning and turning bright red.</li>
            <li>It has no harmful ingredients, but full of goodies for you.  </li>
            <li>but since using this, it has been much healthier and more even.</li>
            <li>It has very mild scent and is very emollient.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product due to very good reviews and all the supposedly beneficial ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The scariest part was probably opening the jar for the first time - this cream is orange!</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, it leaves my skin feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>astaxanthin is more effective in pill form - don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Derma e consumer, all the products I have tried so far I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and nourished without the greasy feeling so many have.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is just right: feels effective but is not heavy -- is absorbed readily.</li>
            <li>Over time it is very nourishing and has given my older person complexion a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>The product works the way it is described and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It made my skin burn a bit right after applying it, however that part was tolerable and the burning disappeared quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my face very soft and smooth in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Ocean 6 is very reasonably PRICED though.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I felt I could do better on Amazon than locally.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll read the list of ingredients more closely before buying it.</li>
            <li>Most telling of all, the sticker on the jar is completely crooked -</li>
            <li>The two work well with Derma E Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Glycolic Toner being used first.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the product!  </li>
            <li>When I first opened up the jar 5 years ago I was hesitant because product is orange.  </li>
            <li>So since then I use it on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it actually works any better then</li>
            <li>First of all, the cream is orange-y and</li>
            <li>I also noticed more new large \\&quot;pores\\&quot; or what appears to be new dented scars/areas all over my face the morning after.  </li>
            <li>but, I really haven&#x27;t used it enough to give it a better rating.</li>
            <li>Great skin care product...use this and alternate with other Derma E products.</li>
            <li>$25 for a LARGE bottle.  </li>
            <li>I see a big difference in my fine lines around my eyes when using this cream.</li>
            <li>It does a fine job moisturizing, but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin overall.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, but the bottle came with a broken lid.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I like the cream so much that I have it set-up as a reoccurring order every couple of months.  </li>
            <li>but I absolutely can not stomach the smell of Lavender.</li>
            <li>This product works better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare this to them,  since I haven&#x27;t used them.  </li>
            <li>I saw on Dr. Oz the benefits of Pycnogenol, which I&#x27;ve used before but didn&#x27;t really think it did anything to reduce wrinkles or improve skin.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in terms of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My skin appears firmer, my skin tone is more even, pores are getting smaller and the wrinkles are becoming softer and less noticeable -</li>
            <li>One of the problems that I have with many skin care products is that they actually cause tiny rips or cuts on my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I gave it another chance the second night, only to wake up to even more new pores and dented scars.  </li>
            <li>I wish this creme give a little more moisture.  </li>
            <li>Cannot live without.</li>
            <li>I was a little put off by the bright orange color, but once a thin layer is applied to my skin (which is really light) you can&#x27;t tell.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different Derma E products (moisturizers, toner, scar gel, antiseptic creme) and find I prefer them over products made by other manufacturers.</li>
            <li>However I prefer the smell of some of derma e&#x27;s other products over this one, but its really not bad.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, it goes on clear and you can&#x27;t see it at all.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, my skin looks clear and radiant.  </li>
            <li>As for the scent, it reminds me of essential oils, very soothing.</li>
            <li>I am a 63 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough.</li>
            <li>I do not think anything about this product is natural.</li>
            <li>Natural feeling.</li>
            <li>I use them because i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell, not sure how to describe it, but you either tolerate or not.</li>
            <li>Deep ones I can understand, the fine lines, the product it too expensive to be a cheap moisturizer.</li>
            <li>At this point, I will have a complete Derma E line of facial care.</li>
            <li>The next morning I face was naturally glowing</li>
            <li>The cream itself is dark orange and has a distinctly putrid smell, and it had separated into sort of an oil and solid.</li>
            <li>quickly arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Product quality was past expiration date&lt;br /&gt;stamped</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the cream does seem to moisturize my skin somewhat it also enlarged my pores and enhanced many problems I wanted to get rid of such as scars and broken capillaries.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin &amp;amp; thus far, this has been the only all natural lotion I&#x27;ve found that actually works.</li>

            <li> but I absolutely can not stomach the smell of Lavender.</li>
            <li> This product works better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really compare this to them,  since I haven&#x27;t used them.  </li>
            <li> I saw on Dr. Oz the benefits of Pycnogenol, which I&#x27;ve used before but didn&#x27;t really think it did anything to reduce wrinkles or improve skin.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in terms of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My skin appears firmer, my skin tone is more even, pores are getting smaller and the wrinkles are becoming softer and less noticeable -</li>
            <li> One of the problems that I have with many skin care products is that they actually cause tiny rips or cuts on my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I gave it another chance the second night, only to wake up to even more new pores and dented scars.  </li>
            <li> I wish this creme give a little more moisture.  </li>
            <li> Cannot live without.</li>
            <li> I was a little put off by the bright orange color, but once a thin layer is applied to my skin (which is really light) you can&#x27;t tell.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different Derma E products (moisturizers, toner, scar gel, antiseptic creme) and find I prefer them over products made by other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> However I prefer the smell of some of derma e&#x27;s other products over this one, but its really not bad.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, it goes on clear and you can&#x27;t see it at all.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, my skin looks clear and radiant.  </li>
            <li> As for the scent, it reminds me of essential oils, very soothing.</li>
            <li> I am a 63 year old woman.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough.</li>
            <li> I do not think anything about this product is natural.</li>
            <li> Natural feeling.</li>
            <li> I use them because i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell, not sure how to describe it, but you either tolerate or not.</li>
            <li> Deep ones I can understand, the fine lines, the product it too expensive to be a cheap moisturizer.</li>
            <li> At this point, I will have a complete Derma E line of facial care.</li>
            <li> The next morning I face was naturally glowing</li>
            <li> The cream itself is dark orange and has a distinctly putrid smell, and it had separated into sort of an oil and solid.</li>
            <li> quickly arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Product quality was past expiration date&lt;br /&gt;stamped</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the cream does seem to moisturize my skin somewhat it also enlarged my pores and enhanced many problems I wanted to get rid of such as scars and broken capillaries.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin &amp;amp; thus far, this has been the only all natural lotion I&#x27;ve found that actually works.</li>
            <li> I use a prescription retinol product every other night, so this cream is necessary to keep my skin soft and moist.  </li>
            <li> What I can see are the little fine lines slowly disappearing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  too cheap to go for the really expensive anti-aging cremes,  </li>
            <li> My skin is sometimes dry, sometimes oily -</li>
            <li> not a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I get very dry skin in the winter and this has kept it from happening.</li>
            <li> It came in a crushed envelope in the mail and the cream had leaked out of the lid everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see what my skin will look like in another month!  </li>
            <li> It has a thicker consistency than other night creams I have used.  </li>
            <li> next time will return if past exp.</li>
            <li> I used to get dry patches on my cheeks or around my mouth in the winter (while the T-Zone was oily)-  no more dry skin and skin flakes.  </li>
            <li> I believe this product is fake, and I am very reluctant to put whatever this is on my face.</li>
            <li> The color is odd  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sit heavy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I found this product few years ago and have been using every night since.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked on how much my skin loves this product.  </li>
            <li> Forget those fancy overpriced department store products that are not much more than water.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I couldn&#x27;t get past it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would try it again.</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s been my experience.   </li>
            <li> way too thick.</li>
            <li> It did not absorb quickly, it is thick.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a single bad thing to say about it.</li>
            <li> I am over 60 and have very delicate skin,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great cream! The orange color threw me off a bit but it doesn&#x27;t stay orange so that is a good thing! I have been using it day and night. It&#x27;s not greasy and has been keeping my skin moisturized. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Derma e consumer, all the products I have tried so far I absolutely love.  I&#x27;ve been using different products over the years and I think my search of the best products for my skin stops with Derma e (I&#x27;m using the Antioxidant Gel daily and the Microdermabrasion Scrub weekly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This night creme is absolutely amazing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and I can already see a difference in my skin. I used to get dry patches on my cheeks or around my mouth in the winter (while the T-Zone was oily)-  no more dry skin and skin flakes.  My skin appears firmer, my skin tone is more even, pores are getting smaller and the wrinkles are becoming softer and less noticeable - I&#x27;m curious to see what my skin will look like in another month!  Anyway, definitely a creme to recommend.  The scariest part was probably opening the jar for the first time - this cream is orange! (I kid you not) but has a very nice texture and it absorbs well  into the skin.  No orange on the pillow case.  As for the scent, it reminds me of essential oils, very soothing.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is just right: feels effective but is not heavy -- is absorbed readily. I have used many different Derma E products (moisturizers, toner, scar gel, antiseptic creme) and find I prefer them over products made by other manufacturers. All perform very well; I feel I&#x27;m being nice to my skin when I use them.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, but the bottle came with a broken lid.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream daily for about six weeks.  I am a 63 year old woman.  My skin wasn&#x27;t particularly bad, but I noticed that it felt rough when I ran my hand over my cheeks.  After using this product for 6 weeks, my skin is now silky smooth!  (Actually, I&#x27;ve been meaning to write this review for some time, so I&#x27;d say I began to notice the difference about 3-4 wks after I began to use this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the cream is orange.  Don&#x27;t worry, it goes on clear and you can&#x27;t see it at all.  Nor does it come off on your pillow.  It is so non-greasy I actually use it under my make-up.  After 6 weeks of daily use I have used about 1/4 of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t find me writing reviews of skin-care products often but I want others to know this actually works.  My skin looks better, smoother and more taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be re-ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast shipping. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> the product has a pronounced fragrance.  astaxanthin is more effective in pill form - don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> Can see results overnight.  Over time it is very nourishing and has given my older person complexion a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I have found this  product to be just as good or even better then department store face creams.I am over 60 and have very delicate skin, One of the problems that I have with many skin care products is that they actually cause tiny rips or cuts on my skin. Not so with this product! I am also using it as my eye cream with out any problems.    Another really great feature of this cream is that it is Pariben free. It has very mild scent and is very emollient. The best thing is that it works for me. It is not greasy, it leaves my skin feeling very smooth and soft. Even better is that it has improved the Howdy Doody lines around my nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  I sure do hope that it works.  I felt I could do better on Amazon than locally.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about those two rave reviews - do NOT expect anything magical to happen with this cream.   At least that&#x27;s been my experience.   It&#x27;s nothing special for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Forget those fancy overpriced department store products that are not much more than water.  I use this day and night and I would give this as gifts to my friends if I weren&#x27;t afraid they might be insulted.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream. It has a thicker consistency than other night creams I have used.  It leaves my face very soft and smooth in the morning.  I like the cream so much that I have it set-up as a reoccurring order every couple of months.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Used for years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so thrilled- I have been using this formula for 2 months. My skin looks great and the tone and texture have greatly improved.</li>
            <li> I am a dermatologist by trades so I read every ingredient.  Have only used the products for two days.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this night lotion for years now. I have very dry skin &amp;amp; thus far, this has been the only all natural lotion I&#x27;ve found that actually works. It is orange, yes, but soaks in immediately &amp;amp; I wake up with rejuvinated skin. Cannot live without.</li>
            <li> I am surprised by how I reacted to this, since I&#x27;ve figured Derma E made good, quality products. I&#x27;m sure this Night Creme is good, too....but I absolutely can not stomach the smell of Lavender. I used it for maybe 3 nights before throwing it in the trash, so I wasn&#x27;t able to determine if it&#x27;s an effective product as far as night cremes go. Next time I&#x27;ll read the list of ingredients more closely before buying it. The smell of lavender just makes my stomach turn &amp; I couldn&#x27;t get past it.</li>
            <li> I only had a sample of this.  However, I liked the smell.  I know that astraxanthin is a very good anti-oxidant.  And I was NOT allergic to this!  Here is a list of ingredients from their web page.  There are no parabens as someone commented:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Stearic Acid, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil*, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Haematococcus Pluvialis (Astaxanthin, BioAstin®), Pinus Pinaster (Pycnogenol®) Bark Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Essential Oil, Polysorbate-20, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Potassium Sorbate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the good reviews, this may be a final product in my search for good skin cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - There is a product out there with a strong concentration of astraxanthin called Ocean 6 Illuminus.  I have used that with good result however it has a slippery consistency that I don&#x27;t like to use under eye makeup.  It is not a cream.  Ocean 6 is very reasonably PRICED though.  $25 for a LARGE bottle.  YAY for that.  I use it for hands and decolletage.  AND it has an SPF.  You can find it in health food stores and on it&#x27;s web page.  It only has 6 ingredients, hence the 6.</li>
            <li> I apply this cream at night.  In the morning, my skin looks clear and radiant.  Leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of things to try and reverse time off my face and neck.  It smells nice and feels nice but I can&#x27; say its reversing the fine lines.  Deep ones I can understand, the fine lines, the product it too expensive to be a cheap moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is okay but certainly not the best I have tried.  I am not sure I would try it again.</li>
            <li> It came in a crushed envelope in the mail and the cream had leaked out of the lid everywhere. The cream itself is dark orange and has a distinctly putrid smell, and it had separated into sort of an oil and solid. Most telling of all, the sticker on the jar is completely crooked - I believe this product is fake, and I am very reluctant to put whatever this is on my face.</li>
            <li> Love the e derma product. The product works the way it is described and the price is right. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Goes on great ..very absorbent not greasy..feels soothing.  The delivery was speedy, but the product was a bit pricey. All in all I&#x27;d do it again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest feeling night moisturizers I have ever bought.  My skin feels soft and nourished without the greasy feeling so many have.  I love it and will buy more.</li>
            <li> way too thick. and leaves an orange residue on face. not a high quality product. their hyaloronic night cream is way better</li>
            <li> This product works better than expected.  It applied properly, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on sheets or pillow cases.</li>
            <li> I have been using this night cream for five months, having switched from an Estee Lauder night cream.  I find this cream light and coverage good.  It doesn&#x27;t stick to my pillow!  I use a prescription retinol product every other night, so this cream is necessary to keep my skin soft and moist.  I also use the Derma E Age-Defying Moisturizer with SPF 15.  The two work well with Derma E Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Glycolic Toner being used first.  In addition, I use  Derma E DMAE Alpha Lipoic C-Ester Serum, and when I use up my Ester Lauder facial wash,  I will buy the Derma E Glycolic Facial Cleanser with Marine Plant Extracts.  At this point, I will have a complete Derma E line of facial care.</li>
            <li> Great skin care product...use this and alternate with other Derma E products.</li>
            <li> I bought yet another cream that is an ok moisturizer - but that&#x27;s about it.  Don&#x27;t see anything stupendous in this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, and my skin is smooth and moisturized.  It doesn&#x27;t sit heavy on the skin.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I was a little put off by the bright orange color, but once a thin layer is applied to my skin (which is really light) you can&#x27;t tell.  What I can see are the little fine lines slowly disappearing.  YEAH!</li>
            <li> I found this product few years ago and have been using every night since.  It has no harmful ingredients, but full of goodies for you.  I love the smell of it, and love to put plenty on clean face when I am retiring for the day.</li>
            <li> Absorbs great and makes my skin feel both firmer and soft.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the product!  However I prefer the smell of some of derma e&#x27;s other products over this one, but its really not bad.</li>
            <li> Within 3 mins of putting this product on my face and neck, I started burning and turning bright red. I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough. I had to take a 20 min shower with the water running over my face to relieve the burn. I do not think anything about this product is natural. I threw it away immediately. I will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> I also bought the day creme, and I LOVE it. My skin is sometimes dry, sometimes oily - but since using this, it has been much healthier and more even. It works great under my make up as well. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have tried several varieties of derma e products and i&#x27;m very happy with all of them.  This one is no exception.</li>
            <li> Natural feeling. Does not breakout my face. I have a hard time finding a cream that will not breakout my face, so this is perfect if you want to keep from breaking out.</li>
            <li> I use all derma-e products for my face and I love them. They work great and they&#x27;re inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for about 5 years. I think this product is amazing.  I was shocked on how much my skin loves this product.  When I first opened up the jar 5 years ago I was hesitant because product is orange.  But, who cares if it works well.  The next morning I face was naturally glowing and I knew it was because of this product.  So since then I use it on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> Great product. The color is odd  but the cream itself is moisturizing without being greasy. I guess the color has to do with the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I see a big difference in my fine lines around my eyes when using this cream. I use it both night and day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using derma-e products for a couple of years, and I must say.. I like them.  I&#x27;m  too cheap to go for the really expensive anti-aging cremes,  so I can&#x27;t really compare this to them,  since I haven&#x27;t used them.  But, I will say, I think my skin started to look more youthful after using these products.  Mostly, I&#x27;ve been using the wrinkle-reverse, which I like, but I decided to mix it up and try this one. I don&#x27;t know if it actually works any better then the wrinkle-reverse, but I do like the thicker consistency of this one, and I also the smell.  My face feels good after I put it on.  I can&#x27;t think of a single bad thing to say about it.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product and the service was excellent.</li>
            <li> Derma e products are great.  I use them because i have sensitive skin and they are not harsh and feel great on my face.</li>
            <li> just started to use this night cream recommended to me but, I really haven&#x27;t used it enough to give it a better rating.</li>
            <li> I wish this creme give a little more moisture.  I need to apply another moisturizer after this creme.</li>
            <li> Good service.&lt;br /&gt;Very quickly arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Product quality was past expiration date&lt;br /&gt;stamped on bottom of product.&lt;br /&gt;I chose to use the product regardless.&lt;br /&gt;But next time will return if past exp. date on product.</li>
            <li> I saw on Dr. Oz the benefits of Pycnogenol, which I&#x27;ve used before but didn&#x27;t really think it did anything to reduce wrinkles or improve skin.  But I decided give this ingredient a try again.  First of all, the cream is orange-y and kind of gives your skin a temporary orange tone as you put it on.  It does have a strong smell, not sure how to describe it, but you either tolerate or not. It did not absorb quickly, it is thick.  It does a fine job moisturizing, but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin overall.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful rich cream. My favorite night cream.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product due to very good reviews and all the supposedly beneficial ingredients.  It made my skin burn a bit right after applying it, however that part was tolerable and the burning disappeared quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the cream does seem to moisturize my skin somewhat it also enlarged my pores and enhanced many problems I wanted to get rid of such as scars and broken capillaries.  I also noticed more new large \\&quot;pores\\&quot; or what appears to be new dented scars/areas all over my face the morning after.  I gave it another chance the second night, only to wake up to even more new pores and dented scars.  I won&#x27;t risk my face to further damages so I had to stop using it.  Very unhappy and disappointed!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in terms of wrinkles. However, it is a great creme. I get very dry skin in the winter and this has kept it from happening.</li>
