            <li>I get amazing results</li>
            <li>but then I get amazing results with Kanechom alone.  </li>
            <li>it kind of almost smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li>I love it and will tell anyone this is good stuff.</li>
            <li>But honestly I mix my products together.</li>
            <li>THE SMELL WAS NICE.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably keep it around, but I don&#x27;t expect anything spectacular.</li>
            <li>Has a floral rose like scent.</li>
            <li>You know the kind.  </li>
            <li>I have also used the Karite butter Kanechom formula which I liked just as well.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair very nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>The product works good and makes hair easy to comb.</li>
            <li>I love using this product on my own hair and weave hair.  </li>
            <li>Very good, it mmake the hair very soft.</li>
            <li>But its not a stink smell at all just a nice but STRONG smell.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong perfumey smell but it smells nice to me</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really cute).</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li>I just think the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have even better results than my wash n go</li>
            <li>I love it and will purchase again.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really love it</li>
            <li>but it was ok</li>
            <li>so it was ok</li>
            <li>I like this product, is very ship and great.</li>
            <li>the hair was more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I mix this product with the leche de cabra or &amp;#34;goats milk&amp;#34; conditioner for better results.</li>
            <li>You can use it alone or mix it with your favorite hydrating conditioner.</li>
            <li>For me the product was okay.</li>
            <li>IT WAS JUST OKAY.  </li>
            <li>Ok so I found out about this on amazon then checked out some YouTube reviews.</li>
            <li>I have used silicon mix for years and I love it.</li>
            <li>ends and breakage are no longer a factor&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to get another one :)</li>
            <li>It works well, but the smell is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>The Bambu version from my experience works better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>I dont believe you got an authentic product.</li>
            <li>Having my hair done at one of the best salons in atlanta have allowed me to understand the difference in this product being used in a dominican salon with the blow out technique vs traditional wash, conditioning and blow drying.</li>
            <li>If you go to a dominican salon with this product on your hair or in hand make sure the dominican salon is reputable cause</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Your extensions will get shiny and smooth though!</li>
            <li>Love this product ordered two.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I feel great knowing that I am getting salon worthy deep conditioner for a great price.</li>
            <li>just soft beautiful hair...</li>
            <li>I does work pretty good, i will buy again.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m leaving my original review of 3 stars because I&#x27;m so speechless!</li>
            <li>Smells great, delivered on time, made my hair feel really nice mixed with the Kanechom Brazilian Goat Milk!</li>
            <li>This is very good for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I had to leave it on more than directed to get a smooth ending</li>
            <li>Shipping was perfect, I have used silicon mix before so there&#x27;s not much to say about the product.</li>
            <li>Curls came out soft, beautiful and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Works great on natural and relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>Great product my hair is soft and lots of body</li>
            <li>Either way you&#x27;ll notice the difference and how easy it is to put a comb through the wig once you do that.  </li>
            <li>love it, makes hair soft and smells good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooooo strong like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li>the smell from this container was sooooo strong, that I could smell this the minute I opened the box..</li>
            <li>It does have a strong floral odor</li>
            <li>It has a strong soapy smell, that clings like a perfume scent and  </li>
            <li>Remember the really strong, perfumey, girly scented products they would use -</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and this stuff makes my hair sooooo amazing, not to mention the growth I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li>Very good for my freezy and dry hair.</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell is a lil strong ( combo of baby powder and the salon lol)</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of restoring the hair back to being shiny and tangle-free.</li>
            <li>great product, brought Brazilian hair back to life!!!!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>After one use, my hair was silky and smooth …for about 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Shine and smooth hair..</li>
            <li>Its original</li>
            <li>I was so excited to test it out again</li>
            <li>Would have given it 5 stars, but the smell is a bit strong, pretty, but strong.</li>
            <li>far, I recommend this combination as an awesome deep conditioner...</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just the magic that a professional hair dresser can yield or the product.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair very managable, soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>Your natural hair will love it!</li>
            <li>When I rinsed my hair in warm then cool water my hair felt soooooooo soft.</li>
            <li>Once the credits were rolling, I put her back in the shower for a good rinse and</li>
            <li>but yeah i love this product it works very well.</li>
            <li>If anything made them feel like they needed a good wash faster than with regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, love the producte.</li>
            <li>Works good on human lace wigs.highly recommended!</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s still a good conditioner I mixed with Kenechom.</li>
            <li>keeps my hair nice and soft</li>
            <li>But if the results aren&#x27;t as good, I&#x27;ll be back.  </li>
            <li>I used it on virgin hair to make it more soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product from reading and seeing the many reviews on its efficacy.</li>
            <li>and i love the way it smells great when mixed with Kanechom deep conditioning mask</li>
            <li>I love trying new products</li>
            <li>but this time it was a completely different story; I was able to run the paddle brush through her hair on the first pass, followed by a fine toothed comb!</li>
            <li>Smell is much too strong</li>
            <li>Not to mention that I paid a PRETTY penny for it!</li>
            <li>Fast deliver and fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair so in most cases.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in combination with another deep conditioner, and used both of them together--therefore, I can&#x27;t say how Silicon Mix works on its own.  </li>
            <li>Because I am going the more natural route (no silicones, sulfates, or parabens)</li>
            <li>So useful, I&#x27;m almost done with the one I have now</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny, soft, and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every kind of deep conditioner...</li>
            <li>Kanechom is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve tried in a long time and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>My hair was silky and i noticed the difference right away</li>
            <li>It just dries, soft, shiny, healthy looking and pretty.  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell that I personally like</li>
            <li>I have type 3 wavy long hair, and it is amazing on my hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use on your own hair because the silicone build up will cause dryness in the long run.</li>
            <li>Omg I love this deep conditioner sooooooooooooo much!!</li>
            <li>Tried to use it on a sewin that started to tangle easily and is beginning to look old.  </li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong and though it doesn&#x27;t bother me, I can see it might bother someone who is sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>and I would have loved to love it, it is reasonably priced, not good however</li>
            <li>Good product, but I am sensitive to smells, and it&#x27;s a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I left the conditioner in for about 8 to 10 minutes in order to get moisture in her hair since  Silicon Mix seals the hair, I wanted to make sure the hair was sealed with moisture within.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and tangle free after use.  </li>
            <li>It did give my hair incredible slip and my hair felt soft after washing this product out and continuing  with my usual styling routine.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my human hair wig!  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product by my hair dresser.</li>
            <li>I love this creamy conditioner and have definitely recommended it to all my friends!</li>
            <li>TRUST ME, I&#x27;ve seen it first hand</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work the same for my type of hair, but IT DID!  </li>
            <li>My hair feels lighter and softer every time: it never fails.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m glad I kept my receipt because they&#x27;re all going back!</li>
            <li>But these products became a cult favorite overnight and several posters did a YouTube review.  </li>
            <li>The smell is good, but it lingers a few days after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>I really love what this product does but it is very heavily fragranced, so I have to make sure to let my extensions air out after.</li>
            <li>Afterwords I can already feel the difference, my hair becomes soft and curly and most importantly completely detangled!</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s not an insipidly sweet and super strong smell that has become the trademark smell for products for the African American</li>
            <li>she has a lot of corkscrew to her hair...but just like my hair and most curly hair, her hair gets dry...</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is so amazing after using this for a few months.</li>
            <li>and when it&#x27;s flatironed straight, it&#x27;s to her waist, so</li>
            <li>I was really impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I really commend this seller.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It leaves my Satai remy soft and tangle free and last longer looking fresh.</li>
            <li>Some people like this but for a person like me who likes wearing fragrances it is just too much.</li>
            <li>then when i straightened it my hair was so straight and felt like and looked like i went to she shop to get my hair done.</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely grade</li>
            <li>and all in all this product doesn&#x27;t really so much restore hair</li>
            <li>The smell is very overpowering like baby powder, and the smell doesn&#x27;t come out for days and days when washing.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>This product really makes my hair feeling smoother and stronger.</li>
            <li>and then 1 hr under a hooded dryer, but the product didn&#x27;t really do anything.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to have much slip.</li>
            <li>Love it just what I expected</li>
            <li>It worked really well.  </li>
            <li>And  probably even if you aren&#x27;t, this will probably be a bit much.  </li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>and I bet very toxic</li>
            <li>and I bet it is very toxic...awful product</li>
            <li>I love to use this as a deep treatment before I straighten my hair or even just to leave my hair naturally curly.</li>
            <li>If you are as old as I am - as old as dirt, then you might remember having your  hair done at salons in department stores like Macy&#x27;s and Rich&#x27;s and Penney&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>The third time, I used just a dollip and used it with another conditioner and it helped significantly.  </li>
            <li>Great for revitalizing limp and dry hair.</li>
            <li>but I  ended up using it on my 5 year old biracial daughter who has 3a hair first.</li>
            <li>generously to her hair, slapped a showercap on her and parked her under the dryer for one full episode of Martha Speaks (and for those of you who don&#x27;t have a children in that demographic and are completely unaware of the Martha Speaks cartoon</li>
            <li>It left my frizzy hair smooth and soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beyond excited to see how long my hair will get now that split</li>
            <li>Did nothing for my hair extensions which are extremely high quality.</li>
            <li>it does repair it in most cases for people that have relaxed there hair or from heat styling such has flat iron or pressing combs.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li>but I may have to use shampoo a little more if I notice any build up.</li>
            <li>in this case this product is from Dominican Republic and a lot of the sand from below the surface in the oceans originally where rocks and the water gets inside of the rocks so where it stars erosion to where it breaks the rocks into smaller pieces and over a long period of time it becomes sand and appears to wash up a pound the beach shores and the sun naturally bleaches the sand to where the sand looks white or becomes lighter and this product is mixed with natural oils and minerals and later they add alcohol to help preserve it&#x27;s contents and it pretty much has a pudding like consistency and in my opinion it smells pleasant</li>
            <li>Really smooths natural and extension hair.</li>
            <li>I think people use it in a variety of ways, but when I condition the wig, I normally put the silicon mix in water, mix it around and then dunk my wig into the water.  </li>
            <li>I think this may be too harsh for most hair textures</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I&#x27;ve recommended it on several hair care forums where the posters are pretty picky.  </li>
            <li>I also put a little directly on the wig which I know is a no-no, but I just love the silky feel of the wig when I do that.  </li>
            <li>that time I have bought and installed a new set of extensions and thought I would give this product another try.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for me originally, I have African American  4a/4b combination hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but not a magic</li>
            <li>Pantene Truly Natural Co-wash then applied the Silicon Mix, detangled (which was a dream!) and put 2 plastic caps on.</li>
            <li>I usually cowash more often</li>
            <li>Just a little worried about the strong chemical use</li>
            <li>(Which, for true African American hair, is a victory in and of it</li>
            <li>This helped my hair dramatically and made it very soft and alive again.</li>
            <li>silicone is actually sand that comes from certain places.</li>
            <li>It certainly did not cure my human hair weave of all its ills.  </li>
            <li>I can say that when combined with the other product, it worked very well in deep-conditioning my fine, dry, relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li>I used the entire bottle but never really saw a huge &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor difference.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>Always leaves my hair soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>Made my hair soft</li>
            <li>and it made them soft as butter.  </li>
            <li>this product actually masks your real hair or puts a coating around your real hair to where it actually blows your hair.</li>
            <li>just know that you will have to wash this product out of your hair in do time because it will only condition it so much after a period of time.</li>
            <li>This review is the use of the product on extensions, not my natural hair.</li>
            <li>It makes it so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Mixed very well with the Kanechom Brazilian Hair Treatment Goat&#x27;s Milk, that I used this with.</li>
            <li>Smells like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried on my natural hair however.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair, about the texture of cree summers or lisa bonet</li>
            <li>it made my hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smells...</li>
            <li>I used on my Brazilian weave and it made it soft</li>
            <li>Your hair will be so soft and manageable</li>
            <li>and I have natural hair</li>
            <li>It also makes my transitioning to natural curls pop when I apply it.</li>
            <li>My waves are so defined a soft as cotton.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft.</li>
            <li>Like unbelievably soft...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a natural that doesn&#x27;t care about that.</li>
            <li>I think people with coarse hair could really benefit from mixing the two products.  </li>
            <li>I love how a little goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I use it straight, not realizing, and the smell was strong - Strong enough to be annoying and distracting.  </li>
            <li>Also, the product arrived in two days--one full week before the other one did, though I purchased both at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Beings back the natural state of your wig with soft texture!</li>
            <li>This is my second time buying this product and it continues to leave my hair natural soft, shiny and bouncy!</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my hair incredibly soft, it detangles my hair completely.</li>
            <li>I am bi racial ( African American/white) and i have used every product u can name from high end products such as Aveda and Agave Oil to cheaper products....</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>but just know that silicone itself is actually some what natural and some what lab made.</li>
            <li>apparently it needed to take sometime time to set??</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling so soft i was amazed.</li>
            <li>When I comb through it after a wash, there is barely any hair coming out.</li>
            <li>it even protects your hair from some of the most unbelievable humidities in other words you can blow and stretch hair out literally without using heat from a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the product, it keeps my hair soft and when I flat iron my hair</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell but the smell can be a little over powering at least for me</li>
            <li>A MUST in your hair diet if you&#x27;re natural or just have really dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, just exactly what my dry, thin (after hair dying and use of heat, my hair is naturally curly and thick), without shine, no body, hair needed...</li>

            <li> I get amazing results</li>
            <li> but then I get amazing results with Kanechom alone.  </li>
            <li> it kind of almost smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li> I love it and will tell anyone this is good stuff.</li>
            <li> But honestly I mix my products together.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL WAS NICE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably keep it around, but I don&#x27;t expect anything spectacular.</li>
            <li> Has a floral rose like scent.</li>
            <li> You know the kind.  </li>
            <li> I have also used the Karite butter Kanechom formula which I liked just as well.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair very nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> The product works good and makes hair easy to comb.</li>
            <li> I love using this product on my own hair and weave hair.  </li>
            <li> Very good, it mmake the hair very soft.</li>
            <li> But its not a stink smell at all just a nice but STRONG smell.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong perfumey smell but it smells nice to me</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really cute).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> I just think the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have even better results than my wash n go</li>
            <li> I love it and will purchase again.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really love it</li>
            <li> but it was ok</li>
            <li> so it was ok</li>
            <li> I like this product, is very ship and great.</li>
            <li> the hair was more manageable.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I mix this product with the leche de cabra or &amp;#34;goats milk&amp;#34; conditioner for better results.</li>
            <li> You can use it alone or mix it with your favorite hydrating conditioner.</li>
            <li> For me the product was okay.</li>
            <li> IT WAS JUST OKAY.  </li>
            <li> Ok so I found out about this on amazon then checked out some YouTube reviews.</li>
            <li> I have used silicon mix for years and I love it.</li>
            <li> ends and breakage are no longer a factor&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to get another one :)</li>
            <li> It works well, but the smell is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> The Bambu version from my experience works better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> I dont believe you got an authentic product.</li>
            <li> Having my hair done at one of the best salons in atlanta have allowed me to understand the difference in this product being used in a dominican salon with the blow out technique vs traditional wash, conditioning and blow drying.</li>
            <li> If you go to a dominican salon with this product on your hair or in hand make sure the dominican salon is reputable cause</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Your extensions will get shiny and smooth though!</li>
            <li> Love this product ordered two.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I feel great knowing that I am getting salon worthy deep conditioner for a great price.</li>
            <li> just soft beautiful hair...</li>
            <li> I does work pretty good, i will buy again.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m leaving my original review of 3 stars because I&#x27;m so speechless!</li>
            <li> Smells great, delivered on time, made my hair feel really nice mixed with the Kanechom Brazilian Goat Milk!</li>
            <li> This is very good for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I had to leave it on more than directed to get a smooth ending</li>
            <li> Shipping was perfect, I have used silicon mix before so there&#x27;s not much to say about the product.</li>
            <li> Curls came out soft, beautiful and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Works great on natural and relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Great product my hair is soft and lots of body</li>
            <li> Either way you&#x27;ll notice the difference and how easy it is to put a comb through the wig once you do that.  </li>
            <li> love it, makes hair soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooooo strong like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li> the smell from this container was sooooo strong, that I could smell this the minute I opened the box..</li>
            <li> It does have a strong floral odor</li>
            <li> It has a strong soapy smell, that clings like a perfume scent and  </li>
            <li> Remember the really strong, perfumey, girly scented products they would use -</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and this stuff makes my hair sooooo amazing, not to mention the growth I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li> Very good for my freezy and dry hair.</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell is a lil strong ( combo of baby powder and the salon lol)</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of restoring the hair back to being shiny and tangle-free.</li>
            <li> great product, brought Brazilian hair back to life!!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> After one use, my hair was silky and smooth …for about 12 hours.</li>
            <li> Shine and smooth hair..</li>
            <li> Its original</li>
            <li> I was so excited to test it out again</li>
            <li> Would have given it 5 stars, but the smell is a bit strong, pretty, but strong.</li>
            <li> far, I recommend this combination as an awesome deep conditioner...</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just the magic that a professional hair dresser can yield or the product.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very managable, soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> Your natural hair will love it!</li>
            <li> When I rinsed my hair in warm then cool water my hair felt soooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> Once the credits were rolling, I put her back in the shower for a good rinse and</li>
            <li> but yeah i love this product it works very well.</li>
            <li> If anything made them feel like they needed a good wash faster than with regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, love the producte.</li>
            <li> Works good on human lace wigs.highly recommended!</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s still a good conditioner I mixed with Kenechom.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair nice and soft</li>
            <li> But if the results aren&#x27;t as good, I&#x27;ll be back.  </li>
            <li> I used it on virgin hair to make it more soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product from reading and seeing the many reviews on its efficacy.</li>
            <li> and i love the way it smells great when mixed with Kanechom deep conditioning mask</li>
            <li> I love trying new products</li>
            <li> but this time it was a completely different story; I was able to run the paddle brush through her hair on the first pass, followed by a fine toothed comb!</li>
            <li> Smell is much too strong</li>
            <li> Not to mention that I paid a PRETTY penny for it!</li>
            <li> Fast deliver and fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair so in most cases.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in combination with another deep conditioner, and used both of them together--therefore, I can&#x27;t say how Silicon Mix works on its own.  </li>
            <li> Because I am going the more natural route (no silicones, sulfates, or parabens)</li>
            <li> So useful, I&#x27;m almost done with the one I have now</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny, soft, and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of deep conditioner...</li>
            <li> Kanechom is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve tried in a long time and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> My hair was silky and i noticed the difference right away</li>
            <li> It just dries, soft, shiny, healthy looking and pretty.  </li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell that I personally like</li>
            <li> I have type 3 wavy long hair, and it is amazing on my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use on your own hair because the silicone build up will cause dryness in the long run.</li>
            <li> Omg I love this deep conditioner sooooooooooooo much!!</li>
            <li> Tried to use it on a sewin that started to tangle easily and is beginning to look old.  </li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong and though it doesn&#x27;t bother me, I can see it might bother someone who is sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> and I would have loved to love it, it is reasonably priced, not good however</li>
            <li> Good product, but I am sensitive to smells, and it&#x27;s a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I left the conditioner in for about 8 to 10 minutes in order to get moisture in her hair since  Silicon Mix seals the hair, I wanted to make sure the hair was sealed with moisture within.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and tangle free after use.  </li>
            <li> It did give my hair incredible slip and my hair felt soft after washing this product out and continuing  with my usual styling routine.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my human hair wig!  </li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my hair dresser.</li>
            <li> I love this creamy conditioner and have definitely recommended it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> TRUST ME, I&#x27;ve seen it first hand</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work the same for my type of hair, but IT DID!  </li>
            <li> My hair feels lighter and softer every time: it never fails.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m glad I kept my receipt because they&#x27;re all going back!</li>
            <li> But these products became a cult favorite overnight and several posters did a YouTube review.  </li>
            <li> The smell is good, but it lingers a few days after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> I really love what this product does but it is very heavily fragranced, so I have to make sure to let my extensions air out after.</li>
            <li> Afterwords I can already feel the difference, my hair becomes soft and curly and most importantly completely detangled!</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s not an insipidly sweet and super strong smell that has become the trademark smell for products for the African American</li>
            <li> she has a lot of corkscrew to her hair...but just like my hair and most curly hair, her hair gets dry...</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is so amazing after using this for a few months.</li>
            <li> and when it&#x27;s flatironed straight, it&#x27;s to her waist, so</li>
            <li> I was really impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> and I really commend this seller.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It leaves my Satai remy soft and tangle free and last longer looking fresh.</li>
            <li> Some people like this but for a person like me who likes wearing fragrances it is just too much.</li>
            <li> then when i straightened it my hair was so straight and felt like and looked like i went to she shop to get my hair done.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely grade</li>
            <li> and all in all this product doesn&#x27;t really so much restore hair</li>
            <li> The smell is very overpowering like baby powder, and the smell doesn&#x27;t come out for days and days when washing.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> This product really makes my hair feeling smoother and stronger.</li>
            <li> and then 1 hr under a hooded dryer, but the product didn&#x27;t really do anything.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to have much slip.</li>
            <li> Love it just what I expected</li>
            <li> It worked really well.  </li>
            <li> And  probably even if you aren&#x27;t, this will probably be a bit much.  </li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> and I bet very toxic</li>
            <li> and I bet it is very toxic...awful product</li>
            <li> I love to use this as a deep treatment before I straighten my hair or even just to leave my hair naturally curly.</li>
            <li> If you are as old as I am - as old as dirt, then you might remember having your  hair done at salons in department stores like Macy&#x27;s and Rich&#x27;s and Penney&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> The third time, I used just a dollip and used it with another conditioner and it helped significantly.  </li>
            <li> Great for revitalizing limp and dry hair.</li>
            <li> but I  ended up using it on my 5 year old biracial daughter who has 3a hair first.</li>
            <li> generously to her hair, slapped a showercap on her and parked her under the dryer for one full episode of Martha Speaks (and for those of you who don&#x27;t have a children in that demographic and are completely unaware of the Martha Speaks cartoon</li>
            <li> It left my frizzy hair smooth and soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond excited to see how long my hair will get now that split</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair extensions which are extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> it does repair it in most cases for people that have relaxed there hair or from heat styling such has flat iron or pressing combs.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li> but I may have to use shampoo a little more if I notice any build up.</li>
            <li> in this case this product is from Dominican Republic and a lot of the sand from below the surface in the oceans originally where rocks and the water gets inside of the rocks so where it stars erosion to where it breaks the rocks into smaller pieces and over a long period of time it becomes sand and appears to wash up a pound the beach shores and the sun naturally bleaches the sand to where the sand looks white or becomes lighter and this product is mixed with natural oils and minerals and later they add alcohol to help preserve it&#x27;s contents and it pretty much has a pudding like consistency and in my opinion it smells pleasant</li>
            <li> Really smooths natural and extension hair.</li>
            <li> I think people use it in a variety of ways, but when I condition the wig, I normally put the silicon mix in water, mix it around and then dunk my wig into the water.  </li>
            <li> I think this may be too harsh for most hair textures</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I&#x27;ve recommended it on several hair care forums where the posters are pretty picky.  </li>
            <li> I also put a little directly on the wig which I know is a no-no, but I just love the silky feel of the wig when I do that.  </li>
            <li> that time I have bought and installed a new set of extensions and thought I would give this product another try.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for me originally, I have African American  4a/4b combination hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not a magic</li>
            <li> Pantene Truly Natural Co-wash then applied the Silicon Mix, detangled (which was a dream!) and put 2 plastic caps on.</li>
            <li> I usually cowash more often</li>
            <li> Just a little worried about the strong chemical use</li>
            <li> (Which, for true African American hair, is a victory in and of it</li>
            <li> This helped my hair dramatically and made it very soft and alive again.</li>
            <li> silicone is actually sand that comes from certain places.</li>
            <li> It certainly did not cure my human hair weave of all its ills.  </li>
            <li> I can say that when combined with the other product, it worked very well in deep-conditioning my fine, dry, relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle but never really saw a huge &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor difference.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> Always leaves my hair soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft</li>
            <li> and it made them soft as butter.  </li>
            <li> this product actually masks your real hair or puts a coating around your real hair to where it actually blows your hair.</li>
            <li> just know that you will have to wash this product out of your hair in do time because it will only condition it so much after a period of time.</li>
            <li> This review is the use of the product on extensions, not my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It makes it so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Mixed very well with the Kanechom Brazilian Hair Treatment Goat&#x27;s Milk, that I used this with.</li>
            <li> Smells like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried on my natural hair however.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, about the texture of cree summers or lisa bonet</li>
            <li> it made my hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smells...</li>
            <li> I used on my Brazilian weave and it made it soft</li>
            <li> Your hair will be so soft and manageable</li>
            <li> and I have natural hair</li>
            <li> It also makes my transitioning to natural curls pop when I apply it.</li>
            <li> My waves are so defined a soft as cotton.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft.</li>
            <li> Like unbelievably soft...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a natural that doesn&#x27;t care about that.</li>
            <li> I think people with coarse hair could really benefit from mixing the two products.  </li>
            <li> I love how a little goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I use it straight, not realizing, and the smell was strong - Strong enough to be annoying and distracting.  </li>
            <li> Also, the product arrived in two days--one full week before the other one did, though I purchased both at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Beings back the natural state of your wig with soft texture!</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this product and it continues to leave my hair natural soft, shiny and bouncy!</li>
            <li> Not only does it make my hair incredibly soft, it detangles my hair completely.</li>
            <li> I am bi racial ( African American/white) and i have used every product u can name from high end products such as Aveda and Agave Oil to cheaper products....</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> but just know that silicone itself is actually some what natural and some what lab made.</li>
            <li> apparently it needed to take sometime time to set??</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling so soft i was amazed.</li>
            <li> When I comb through it after a wash, there is barely any hair coming out.</li>
            <li> it even protects your hair from some of the most unbelievable humidities in other words you can blow and stretch hair out literally without using heat from a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product, it keeps my hair soft and when I flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell but the smell can be a little over powering at least for me</li>
            <li> A MUST in your hair diet if you&#x27;re natural or just have really dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, just exactly what my dry, thin (after hair dying and use of heat, my hair is naturally curly and thick), without shine, no body, hair needed...</li>
            <li> So... I continue my search on finding a deep conditioner that can bring &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; back into my extensions after several weeks of flat ironing and California heat/sun damage.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair, it grows pretty long but the dryness, breakage, and split ends are usually a problem.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair that&#x27;s not super coarse, 3b &amp; some 3c.</li>
            <li> I would not mind it if it went away, but it actually stays for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> When I got home I decided to try flat ironing it again with my garnier fructis conditioner and oil.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t press or flat iron</li>
            <li> The mix did make it easier for me to de-tangle the next morning, but nothing different than when I would use other deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> My hair was like silk after I flat ironed it!</li>
            <li> and I think this product left my hair feeling a bit dry.</li>
            <li> flat ironed my hair, French braided it in one long braid down my back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think that Silicon Mix adds any benefit, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> As far as this product being over powering in smell, watery, filmy or heavy on the hair ?????</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not surprised that I can NOT for</li>
            <li> I kept my hair sections, oiled and styled as usual and it isn&#x27;t any better (or worse) than before I used the mix.</li>
            <li> By the next morning my hair is usually dry and rough to the touch.</li>
            <li> to where you can layer other products in your hair for styling such has braids/cornrows/twists/ ponytails ect.</li>
            <li> And the other item that came in the same box had the smell too.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase again, but I will use the remaining product I have left by mixing it with other products that seem to respond to my hair type.</li>
            <li> Soften dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> When I blow dried my hair it felt very product heavy.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a whole &amp;#34;hydra steam system&amp;#34; that shall remain nameless.</li>
            <li> this product must be use carefully.</li>
            <li> if you co-wash your hair which means instead of washing your hair with shampoo you will wash your hair with conditioner but you are not really washing your hair.</li>
            <li> Updated: it&#x27;s only been a few days..</li>
            <li> I saw a few YouTube reviews that raved about the product bringing swing and vibrancy back into their extensions.</li>
            <li> When I wash it, it feels sooooo rough.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but if so are you, I&#x27;d suggest you to look up the ingredients in it just in case you might be allergic or something (which I think it&#x27;s unlikely to happen) over all it came just in time and product looked exactly how it looks in the picture, also it did all that it claim it does.</li>
            <li> I didnt leave it on for hours like other people have.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the results as mentioned from the other consumers.</li>
            <li> (Due to heat damage.</li>
            <li> Makes hair slick when wet and airy when dry</li>
            <li> I believe the negative reviews may have been due to the&lt;br /&gt;shampoo that was used on the hair prior to conditioning.</li>
            <li> It then turned into a dry matted mess!</li>
            <li> The consistency is like a regular thick conditioner.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair hard and dry</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly 3a-3b biracial hair, and this did nothing but leave a film on it and made it feel dry.</li>
            <li> I put this on my afro weave extentions which were crunchy, dry and hard from dye and heavy styling</li>
            <li> The smell takes a little getting used to, but I like it now.</li>
            <li> then towel dried (with paper towel ) her hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I know I was long-winded</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I know I was long-winded</li>
            <li> I literally walked around the house sniffing for a dead animal or something until I realized it was the hair.</li>
            <li> , my hands even stung, I used it on a few clients with thik hair</li>
            <li> Maybe it was too harsh for the body wave hair, who knows.</li>
            <li> All the other things I&#x27;ve used that don&#x27;t contain the bad things have left my hair dry and longing for moisture.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, especially after all the positive reviews out there for this product.</li>
            <li> When her hair air dries, it&#x27;s about 4 inches past her shoulders</li>
            <li> , I took the advice from another review and washed and conditioned her hair as usual.</li>
            <li> not sure what the rave is all about.</li>
            <li> no more fizz</li>
            <li> I noticed very few split ends &amp;</li>
            <li> Usually I let the conditioner sit on the hair for at least an hour and then rinse it out.</li>
            <li> and I can comb thru her hair with hardly any kinks.</li>
            <li> Cheap and awful product, I would ck ingredient</li>
            <li> Really disappointed to see so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> this product was the worst hair treatment I have ever use after the treatment hand full of hair was falling out .unreal</li>
            <li> I seriously don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of perfume mixed with roses, though not too bad.</li>
            <li> and my hair is very thick...</li>
            <li> awful, left my hair liveless, has a strong chemical stink to it, horrible</li>
            <li> Not great by itself and wasn&#x27;t the mix I was trying to get.</li>
            <li> I saw a girl rave on utube about it which has thought me not to believe all the false &amp;#34; advertisers &amp;#34; on utube, ... sad cannot trust those girls on utube as a result.</li>
            <li> It left me very disappointed.</li>
            <li> (perhaps this is where I went wrong: over processed??).</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work well on fake extensions.  </li>
            <li> the blow out technique if done wrong can leave your hair on the floor.</li>
            <li> After one use I felt a dramatic difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be stupid not to at the least try it.</li>
            <li> dye crazy</li>
            <li> I saw that some people mentioned they may have received a bad batch.</li>
            <li> when I put this on my hair, my hand smelled so bad..</li>
            <li> It feels awful.</li>
            <li> And the smell... smells GOD AWFUL AWFUL.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is amazing! If you mix it with Kanechom products, they will do wonders with your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for me originally, I have African American  4a/4b combination hair but I  ended up using it on my 5 year old biracial daughter who has 3a hair first. When her hair air dries, it&#x27;s about 4 inches past her shoulders and when it&#x27;s flatironed straight, it&#x27;s to her waist, so she has a lot of corkscrew to her hair...but just like my hair and most curly hair, her hair gets dry...especially at the ends so I decided to give this a go!&lt;br /&gt;So to start, I took the advice from another review and washed and conditioned her hair as usual. I left the conditioner in for about 8 to 10 minutes in order to get moisture in her hair since  Silicon Mix seals the hair, I wanted to make sure the hair was sealed with moisture within. After rinsing the conditioner out, I added the combination of the Silicon Mix and Kanechom with Goats Milk (a 2 parts Silicon Mix to 3 parts Kanechom ratio) generously to her hair, slapped a showercap on her and parked her under the dryer for one full episode of Martha Speaks (and for those of you who don&#x27;t have a children in that demographic and are completely unaware of the Martha Speaks cartoon well, one episode equals 30 minutes...but do check out the cartoon, it&#x27;s really cute). Once the credits were rolling, I put her back in the shower for a good rinse and then towel dried (with paper towel ) her hair.  This was the moment of truth because this is when we would normally have to detangle...which is never fun for me or her but this time it was a completely different story; I was able to run the paddle brush through her hair on the first pass, followed by a fine toothed comb! Her knots were just detangling as the comb ran through! I was really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I recommend this combination as an awesome deep conditioner...I really like it. As for the smell(s), I love it! I don&#x27;t find it over powering or offensive at all. I like when my hair smells great when I move my hair. I also like that it&#x27;s not an insipidly sweet and super strong smell that has become the trademark smell for products for the African American market.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I know I was long-winded but I hope it helps.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - I forgot to mention that my daughter&#x27;s hair was shiny and her curly were bouncy and defined...no frizz and no knots to be found!trong smell that has become the trademark smell for products for the African American market.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I know I was long-winded but I hope it helps.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - I forgot to mention that my daughter&#x27;s hair was shiny and her curly were bouncy and defined...no frizz and no knots to be found!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product. Its original and I really commend this seller. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have loved this since I seen a you tube video suggesting it being mix with kachenom conditioner. It leaves my Satai remy soft and tangle free and last longer looking fresh.</li>
            <li> I probably will not be ordering it again. I just think the smell is overwhelming. I would not mind it if it went away, but it actually stays for quite a long time. Some people like this but for a person like me who likes wearing fragrances it is just too much.</li>
            <li> Love this product, just exactly what my dry, thin (after hair dying and use of heat, my hair is naturally curly and thick), without shine, no body, hair needed...

            <li> Always leaves my hair soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> I heard about this masque treatment from Makeup By Camila 2 on YouTube and thought I would give it a try.  It has a very strong smell that I personally like but I can see others not liking it.  It left my hair feeling soft and conditioned.  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great product! My hair is so soft and tangle free after use.  Would have given it 5 stars, but the smell is a bit strong, pretty, but strong.</li>
            <li> Best Conditioner ever! Your natural hair will love it!</li>
            <li> love it, makes hair soft and smells good. I always use it before straightening my hair</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I have relaxed hair, and I mix this product with a moisturizing conditioner and get the strengthening and moisturization that my hair needs and loves. I feel very confident flat-ironing my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li> I am bi racial ( African American/white) and i have used every product u can name from high end products such as Aveda and Agave Oil to cheaper products....but this conditioner is amazing. It left my frizzy hair smooth and soft and hydrated. I will be reordering this in the larger size....only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell is a lil strong ( combo of baby powder and the salon lol) but I can tolerate that for the results. U should order ASAP!! Great for all Ethnicities&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to blow out my hair with this product I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have even better results than my wash n go</li>
            <li> Great product ... Super fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> Used this product mixed with kanechom brazilian conditioner and omg my hair felt like butter after i washed it out. then when i straightened it my hair was so straight and felt like and looked like i went to she shop to get my hair done. I got knowledge of this mix on youtube from omgitsvictoria. i wish i would of tried it sooner but it works great! i have 4a-4b hair type also and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Good product. Made my hair soft</li>
            <li> Great hair product! Love it !!! Leaves hair soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li> Very good for my freezy and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I used it on a human lace front. Works wonders</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely grade A AMAZING!!!!!  I put this on my afro weave extentions which were crunchy, dry and hard from dye and heavy styling and it made them soft as butter.  A MUST in your hair diet if you&#x27;re natural or just have really dry hair.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not a magic</li>
            <li> This is excellent product at great pruce. Lightning speed delivery.</li>
            <li> This product is really good. I have naturally curly hair so in most cases. this product must be use carefully. if you co-wash your hair which means instead of washing your hair with shampoo you will wash your hair with conditioner but you are not really washing your hair. conditioner is meant to soften that hair and allow it to retain and maintain moister. but just know that silicone itself is actually some what natural and some what lab made. silicone is actually sand that comes from certain places. in this case this product is from Dominican Republic and a lot of the sand from below the surface in the oceans originally where rocks and the water gets inside of the rocks so where it stars erosion to where it breaks the rocks into smaller pieces and over a long period of time it becomes sand and appears to wash up a pound the beach shores and the sun naturally bleaches the sand to where the sand looks white or becomes lighter and this product is mixed with natural oils and minerals and later they add alcohol to help preserve it&#x27;s contents and it pretty much has a pudding like consistency and in my opinion it smells pleasant it kind of almost smells like baby powder. and all in all this product doesn&#x27;t really so much restore hair it does repair it in most cases for people that have relaxed there hair or from heat styling such has flat iron or pressing combs. this product actually masks your real hair or puts a coating around your real hair to where it actually blows your hair. it even protects your hair from some of the most unbelievable humidities in other words you can blow and stretch hair out literally without using heat from a blow dryer. just know that you will have to wash this product out of your hair in do time because it will only condition it so much after a period of time. to where you can layer other products in your hair for styling such has braids/cornrows/twists/ ponytails ect. but yeah i love this product it works very well.</li>
            <li> OMG! You&#x27;ll be stupid not to at the least try it. For once i didn&#x27;t have to use olive oil in the shower to comb out my hair.</li>
            <li> Updated: it&#x27;s only been a few days..apparently it needed to take sometime time to set?? I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m leaving my original review of 3 stars because I&#x27;m so speechless! Here is what I did AFTER I left the review: flat ironed my hair, French braided it in one long braid down my back. Went to work. When I got home I decided to try flat ironing it again with my garnier fructis conditioner and oil. My hair was like silk! I think it was a combination of the silicon mix and my oil conditioner process! Whoop hoo&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the rave is all about. This review is the use of the product on extensions, not my natural hair. I saw a few YouTube reviews that raved about the product bringing swing and vibrancy back into their extensions. I ordered this and tried it several months ago. I used the entire bottle but never really saw a huge &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor difference.&lt;br /&gt;Since that time I have bought and installed a new set of extensions and thought I would give this product another try. I saw that some people mentioned they may have received a bad batch. I figured maybe the product I ordered months back was one of those &amp;#34;bad batches&amp;#34; too. Anyway, I received my order yesterday. I was so excited to test it out again I washed my extensions (which I will refer to as &#x27;my hair&#x27;) immediately, blotted my hair with a towel, sectioned into 4 parts and applied the mix generously. I put a shower cap over my head and kept it in over night (perhaps this is where I went wrong: over processed??). The mix did make it easier for me to de-tangle the next morning, but nothing different than when I would use other deep conditioners. When I blow dried my hair it felt very product heavy. I kept my hair sections, oiled and styled as usual and it isn&#x27;t any better (or worse) than before I used the mix. So... I continue my search on finding a deep conditioner that can bring &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; back into my extensions after several weeks of flat ironing and California heat/sun damage.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in combination with another deep conditioner, and used both of them together--therefore, I can&#x27;t say how Silicon Mix works on its own.  I can say that when combined with the other product, it worked very well in deep-conditioning my fine, dry, relaxed hair.  I love it and will purchase again.  Also, the product arrived in two days--one full week before the other one did, though I purchased both at the same time.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I seriously don&#x27;t get it. This product made my hair dryer and build up, thicker. My hair feels like a chunk of cotton ball. It feels awful. And the smell... smells GOD AWFUL AWFUL. It&#x27;s sooooo strong like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I purchased something totally unrelated to this product from amz and it came in a same box.. the smell from this container was sooooo strong, that I could smell this the minute I opened the box.. And the other item that came in the same box had the smell too. Yuck.  Imagine your grandma&#x27;s house, mixed with 10 different kinds of floral chemicals. when I put this on my hair, my hand smelled so bad.. I almost wanted to dip my hands in bleach. It&#x27;s giving me a headache now. I guess it works on some hair types, because it had over 300+ five star reviews.. but for me, never again. I&#x27;m throwing this away.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, even for naturals. I love to use this as a deep treatment before I straighten my hair or even just to leave my hair naturally curly. I think I will always keep silicon mix in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> I love using this product on my own hair and weave hair.  It makes it so soft and shiny.  Great!</li>
            <li> Made hair smoother. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This stuff works, however gave the hair a smell that made me think something gross had died. I literally walked around the house sniffing for a dead animal or something until I realized it was the hair. I&#x27;ve since bagged the bundles up in hopes I can get the smell out</li>
            <li> Definitely Works when you&#x27;re trying to bring your extensions back to life. A little goes a long way. Starts working the minute you use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really love it but it was ok I had to leave it on more than directed to get a smooth ending so it was ok but I have tried othe silicon products and they have been great!</li>
            <li> Mixed very well with the Kanechom Brazilian Hair Treatment Goat&#x27;s Milk, that I used this with. Because I am going the more natural route (no silicones, sulfates, or parabens) I am no longer using this treatment. It did give my hair incredible slip and my hair felt soft after washing this product out and continuing  with my usual styling routine.</li>
            <li> I like this product, is very ship and great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really perfect. I loved it.</li>
            <li> Have to disagree... Did nothing for my hair extensions which are extremely high quality. If anything made them feel like they needed a good wash faster than with regular conditioner. Will not order again</li>
            <li> Smells like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> Love the product great for your hair. Arrived in timely manner will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, love the producte. Defiantly will buy it again</li>
            <li> Makes hair slick when wet and airy when dry</li>
            <li> I love the silicon mix, it was great... I applied the mix with the conditioner I purchased all went well! I will continue to use the product, it keeps my hair soft and when I flat iron my hair it stays longer no more fizz just soft beautiful hair... I love it and will tell anyone this is good stuff. I don&#x27;t have time to use it as often as I would like, but it gets the job done. I&#x27;m bless to have found this amazing product...Leona/ Augusta GA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this short. This is a great conditioner. I used it on virgin hair to make it more soft &amp; smooth. It did it&#x27;s job. But honestly I mix my products together. 1st time I used the silicon mix alone. 2nd I mixed it with Wen &amp; garnier conditioner. I like to experiment. I didnt leave it on for hours like other people have. But it does help restore hair back to life. Haven&#x27;t tried on my natural hair however. I suppose it should work the same. &amp; when I used the silicon mix by itself, it also worked well. I noticed very few split ends &amp; the hair was more manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is so amazing after using this for a few months. Defintely buying another once I run out!  It does have a strong floral odor but I always get compliments on how great my hair smells :)</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. I always get great results and it leaves the hair smelly great in between washes. I mix this product with the leche de cabra or &amp;#34;goats milk&amp;#34; conditioner for better results. You can use it alone or mix it with your favorite hydrating conditioner. This is great for a pre blowout treatment.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing! especially if you want to bring your weaves back to life. I left this on for a hr and sat under the dryer before washing it out. It left my hair feeling so soft i was amazed. My friend recommended this product to me and I&#x27;m a very happy customer. It also has a nice smell but the smell can be a little over powering at least for me it was. But its not a stink smell at all just a nice but STRONG smell. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product from reading and seeing the many reviews on its efficacy. For me the product was okay. I didn&#x27;t get the results as mentioned from the other consumers.I have natural hair, about the texture of cree summers or lisa bonet and I think this product left my hair feeling a bit dry. I would not purchase again, but I will use the remaining product I have left by mixing it with other products that seem to respond to my hair type.</li>
            <li> NO BIG REVIEWS.  IT WAS JUST OKAY.  THE SMELL WAS NICE.  HOWEVER, IF YOU DO NOT LIKE BIG FLOWERY SMELLS, DON&#x27;T GET THIS ONE.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! I could feel the difference in my hair after just one use! I used with the Kanechom. My hair was like silk after I flat ironed it!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. I have thick, curly 3a-3b biracial hair, and this did nothing but leave a film on it and made it feel dry. The smell is very overpowering like baby powder, and the smell doesn&#x27;t come out for days and days when washing. No moisture whatsoever. Very disappointed, especially after all the positive reviews out there for this product.</li>
            <li> I loved it...reasonable price and my hair is very thick...it made my hair soft and bouncy. ..I recommend this product to anyone who conditions their hair!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my human hair wig!  I think people use it in a variety of ways, but when I condition the wig, I normally put the silicon mix in water, mix it around and then dunk my wig into the water.  I also put a little directly on the wig which I know is a no-no, but I just love the silky feel of the wig when I do that.  Either way you&#x27;ll notice the difference and how easy it is to put a comb through the wig once you do that.  It just dries, soft, shiny, healthy looking and pretty.  The smell takes a little getting used to, but I like it now.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders on my hair ☺️</li>
            <li> This product really makes my hair feeling smoother and stronger.</li>
            <li> Ok so I found out about this on amazon then checked out some YouTube reviews. So i figured that I had to try it. Omg I love this deep conditioner sooooooooooooo much!! I use it in conjunction with the Kanechome goat milk conditioner and it does wonders for my hair (I have relaxed African American hair). Also, today I found out that my hair stylist uses the bambu Silicon mix (she is from Brazil). I feel great knowing that I am getting salon worthy deep conditioner for a great price.</li>
            <li> Tried to use it on a sewin that started to tangle easily and is beginning to look old.  I tried leaving it on with a plastic cap with and without heat  for 30 min  and then 1 hr under a hooded dryer, but the product didn&#x27;t really do anything.  It certainly did not cure my human hair weave of all its ills.  It seems to work about the same as the drugstore products do and not as well as some.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to have much slip. It has a strong soapy smell, that clings like a perfume scent and  I like it. It reminds me of Dove soap. My boyfriend, best friend and nephews love the smell. I&#x27;ll probably keep it around, but I don&#x27;t expect anything spectacular.</li>
            <li> I have used silicon mix for years and I love it. The shampoo is awesome and the treatment mask is the best mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Whatever your hair type is-- buy it. I love how a little goes a long way with this. Detangles and moisturizes, and smells like heaven. Been using this for years.</li>
            <li> Has a floral rose like scent. The consistency is like a regular thick conditioner. The smell is quite strong and though it doesn&#x27;t bother me, I can see it might bother someone who is sensitive to smells. It made my hair very nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use Silicon mix on my human hair extensions. It does a great job of restoring the hair back to being shiny and tangle-free. Usually I let the conditioner sit on the hair for at least an hour and then rinse it out. I really love what this product does but it is very heavily fragranced, so I have to make sure to let my extensions air out after.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my hair dresser. I have relaxed hair, it grows pretty long but the dryness, breakage, and split ends are usually a problem. I loved the smell and the results but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just the magic that a professional hair dresser can yield or the product. I love trying new products so I decided to try this product and I am  OFFICIALLY IN LOVE !!!!! Not only does it make my hair incredibly soft, it detangles my hair completely. When I comb through it after a wash, there is barely any hair coming out. I&#x27;m beyond excited to see how long my hair will get now that split ends and breakage are no longer a factor&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> So useful, I&#x27;m almost done with the one I have now so I&#x27;m going to get another one :)</li>
            <li> Shipping was perfect, I have used silicon mix before so there&#x27;s not much to say about the product. Lol</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, she loves it</li>
            <li> This stuff is literally amazing!!! I have natural hair and this stuff makes my hair sooooo amazing, not to mention the growth I&#x27;ve seen! I put one scoop of this for every two scoops of the kanechom and it like coats my hair beautifully. I put on a plastic cap and let it condition my hair for 15 minutes. Afterwords I can already feel the difference, my hair becomes soft and curly and most importantly completely detangled! (Which, for true African American hair, is a victory in and of it self) I love this creamy conditioner and have definitely recommended it to all my friends! My hair has never looked this good! Also this works MIRACLES on weaves too! TRUST ME, I&#x27;ve seen it first hand lol</li>
            <li> great product, brought Brazilian hair back to life!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it just what I expected</li>
            <li> I does work pretty good, i will buy again. My hair was silky and i noticed the difference right away</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses the product so I wanted to maintain the continuity. It makes my hair shiny, soft, and I love the smell.  I cannot find the product in my area so I knew I could get from Amazon. It arrived on time and I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Soften dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> the greatest conditioner known to man. will leave ur hair silky smooth and also smelling great. was recommended by my hairdresser and im never going back to anything else</li>
            <li> It was great and worked excellent!</li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve used for my hair.  I am Mexican American and I was worried if this would work on my hair, since I have heard a lot of reviews from African American girls.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work the same for my type of hair, but IT DID!  It worked really well.  My hair is usually dry and frizzy.  This helped my hair dramatically and made it very soft and alive again.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and silky. Definitely a hair staple. I&#x27;m ordering the  larger size soon</li>
            <li> Repeated use will melt your extensions. After one use, my hair was silky and smooth …for about 12 hours. It then turned into a dry matted mess! I think this may be too harsh for most hair textures</li>
            <li> Fast deliver and fantastic product. Very happy I order it</li>
            <li> It works well, but the smell is overwhelming.  If you are as old as I am - as old as dirt, then you might remember having your  hair done at salons in department stores like Macy&#x27;s and Rich&#x27;s and Penney&#x27;s...Remember the really strong, perfumey, girly scented products they would use - You know the kind.  If you are sensitive to smells...And  probably even if you aren&#x27;t, this will probably be a bit much.  The first time I used it, I use it straight, not realizing, and the smell was strong - Strong enough to be annoying and distracting.  Even a couple of days later.  And in humidity, or if out working and sweating, the moisture reactivates the smell.  The second time I used it, I mixed it with something else, and it helped.  The third time, I used just a dollip and used it with another conditioner and it helped significantly.  Every so often I will get a hint of it, but it&#x27;s not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works.  I like what it does to my hair, but the smell...Not so much.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Shine and smooth hair..</li>
            <li> Works good on human lace wigs.highly recommended! Beings back the natural state of your wig with soft texture! Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and i love the way it smells great when mixed with Kanechom deep conditioning mask it is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> this product was the worst hair treatment I have ever use after the treatment hand full of hair was falling out .unreal</li>
            <li> awful, left my hair liveless, has a strong chemical stink to it, horrible and I bet very toxic, my hands even stung, I used it on a few clients with thik hair and it did not work well at all in conjunction with the goat milk from Brazil. I saw a girl rave on utube about it which has thought me not to believe all the false &amp;#34; advertisers &amp;#34; on utube, ... sad cannot trust those girls on utube as a result. Cheap and awful product, I would ck ingredient and I bet it is very toxic...awful product, I have been in the beauty field since 1989 and always looking to try great product was exited and I would have loved to love it, it is reasonably priced, not good however</li>
            <li> This is definatly the BEST conditioner I have ever used. Try it, I bet you wl like it! It can also be used on synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> Not great by itself and wasn&#x27;t the mix I was trying to get. The Bambu version from my experience works better. However it&#x27;s still a good conditioner I mixed with Kenechom.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used on my Brazilian weave and it made it soft it has to be good weave it doesn&#x27;t work well on fake extensions.  Love the smell</li>
            <li> This is very good for deep conditioning. Makes hair feel silky. Has a salon smell to it. But it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I used this on virgin body wave hair that was prone to tangling. Only thing it did for it was make the colors define and softer. But the tangling increased. I also used this on my virgin curly Brazilian bundles that were trashed. Curls came out soft, beautiful and tangle free. Maybe it was too harsh for the body wave hair, who knows. Three stars because it actually came to use but didn&#x27;t work on what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> Always works great for my virgin extensions!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff with my deep conditioning. I mix it with conditioner and let it sit for 1-2 hours...Your hair will be so soft and manageable and I have natural hair so I&#x27;m so happy it works for me</li>
            <li> This conditioner is heaven. It softens my hair so well. It enables me to detangle with ease after applying the product. It also makes my transitioning to natural curls pop when I apply it. The smell is good, but it lingers a few days after rinsing it out. It reminds me of perfume mixed with roses, though not too bad. My hair feels like butter after using the Silicon Mix. Warning, do not apply to your scalp and if you are against silicones, then this is not the product for you. Works great on natural and relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> All I can say is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t press or flat iron the hair afters not agood product at all</li>
            <li> Good product I recommend</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Makes your hair very managable, soft and smells great. Will recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Very good, it mmake the hair very soft. An shiny. I loved.</li>
            <li> GREAT Product!!!! Really disappointed to see so many bad reviews. My mother owns a salon and we use this product on every hair type, Cajun, course  African American hair ect.. I believe the negative reviews may have been due to the&lt;br /&gt;shampoo that was used on the hair prior to conditioning. I would recommend using a clarifying shampoo or the shampoo for this product line. As far as this product being over powering in smell, watery, filmy or heavy on the hair ?????? I dont believe you got an authentic product. I did notice a serial number on the front label of my product. Having my hair done at one of the best salons in atlanta have allowed me to understand the difference in this product being used in a dominican salon with the blow out technique vs traditional wash, conditioning and blow drying. For home use this product does everthing the label says in my opinion. If you go to a dominican salon with this product on your hair or in hand make sure the dominican salon is reputable cause the blow out technique if done wrong can leave your hair on the floor. (Due to heat damage.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew of this product before now. Smh! I love it. I have type 3 wavy long hair, and it is amazing on my hair. My waves are so defined a soft as cotton. My oldest daughter has type 4 kinky curly hair and I can comb thru her hair with hardly any kinks. I love it.</li>
            <li> Smell is much too strong</li>
            <li> Great product my hair is soft and lots of body</li>
            <li> Love it! Will be ordering more of it!</li>
            <li> Amazing for remy hair. Don&#x27;t use on your own hair because the silicone build up will cause dryness in the long run. Your extensions will get shiny and smooth though!</li>
            <li> Love this product ordered two.</li>
            <li> I love this product make my hair feels great</li>
            <li> This product is awsome</li>
            <li> I use this ever time I wash my hair and leave it for about 30 minutes to an hour, and it works great. My hair feels lighter and softer every time: it never fails. Must have!</li>
            <li> keeps my hair nice and soft</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft. I use it once a month with my deep conditioning products.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because of the smell. The product works good and makes hair easy to comb. Makes hair soft.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this product and it continues to leave my hair natural soft, shiny and bouncy!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. Really smooths natural and extension hair. I use it together with Kancehom Manteiga.</li>
            <li> OMG! Finally what my hair has been needing! I have natural hair that&#x27;s not super coarse, 3b &amp; some 3c. Last yeah I went dye crazy and I admit I wasn&#x27;t very kind to my hair. So I&#x27;m not surprised that I can NOT for the life of me keep my hair moisturized. When I wash it, it feels sooooo rough. I&#x27;ve tried every kind of deep conditioner...nothing! By the next morning my hair is usually dry and rough to the touch. I went to my local beauty store looking for another product that someone suggested and the lady working there told me to try this. I recently bought a whole &amp;#34;hydra steam system&amp;#34; that shall remain nameless. It left me very disappointed. Not to mention that I paid a PRETTY penny for it! I&#x27;m talking $15+ EACH! I bought all 5. Well I&#x27;m glad I kept my receipt because they&#x27;re all going back! After one use I felt a dramatic difference in my hair! I cowashed with Pantene Truly Natural Co-wash then applied the Silicon Mix, detangled (which was a dream!) and put 2 plastic caps on. I wrapped my turby towel on my head and left it for 45 minutes (which turned into an hour+ because I fell asleep) When I rinsed my hair in warm then cool water my hair felt soooooooo soft. Like unbelievably soft...It felt like my hair before alllll the dying. I couldn&#x27;t believe this $10.99 product did what an entire $65+ line couldn&#x27;t! I do understand that this product contains some &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; ingredients but I&#x27;m a natural that doesn&#x27;t care about that. At all. I only care about how my hair responds and it hasn&#x27;t felt like this...maybe ever! It does have a strong perfumey smell but it smells nice to me so I don&#x27;t mind it. I usually cowash more often but I may have to use shampoo a little more if I notice any build up. No big deal. All the other things I&#x27;ve used that don&#x27;t contain the bad things have left my hair dry and longing for moisture. I think this may FINALLY be the one!</li>
            <li> I use this with the Kanechom goat milk conditioner, about two tablespoons of Kanechom and 1 tablespoon of Silicon Mix.  I get amazing results but then I get amazing results with Kanechom alone.  I don&#x27;t really think that Silicon Mix adds any benefit, at least for me.  But I will continue to use them together until I use up the Silicon Mix.  My hair is color treated, medium texture, somewhat wavy and prone to dryness/frizz.  I use this recipe with a heat cap for about 45 minutes to an hour, once a week or so.  I get silky shiny hair that doesn&#x27;t frizz at all for several days.  My hair likes whatever ingredients are in Kanechom and Silicon Mix.  Kanechom is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve tried in a long time and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.  My research indicates that Kanechom is the best selling hair care line in Brazil.  And we all know what beautiful hair Brazilian women have!!  I have also used the Karite butter Kanechom formula which I liked just as well.  And both formulas smell amazing!  I know Kanechom and Silicon Mix contain mineral oil and silicone, but my hair loves these formulas.  I like it so much that I&#x27;ve recommended it on several hair care forums where the posters are pretty picky.  But these products became a cult favorite overnight and several posters did a YouTube review.  Once I&#x27;ve used up the Silicon Mix, I&#x27;ll go back to using Kanechom by itself.  But if the results aren&#x27;t as good, I&#x27;ll be back.  I think people with coarse hair could really benefit from mixing the two products.  I just didn&#x27;t see better results probably because my results were already excellent.</li>
            <li> Good product, but I am sensitive to smells, and it&#x27;s a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Smells great, delivered on time, made my hair feel really nice mixed with the Kanechom Brazilian Goat Milk! Haven&#x27;t used this product alone yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using Silicon Mix for years and I love it. It&#x27;s the only conditioner I use. I recommend to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Great for revitalizing limp and dry hair. This stuff has a great smell and works amazingly. I use it a deep conditioning treatment!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair hard and dry</li>
