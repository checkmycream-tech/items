            <li>Good buy would recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good set of nail grooming tools.</li>
            <li>The clippers inside, not so good.  </li>

            <li>The pieces are strong and work great.</li>
            <li>This product is very good and useful.</li>
            <li>It is a great manicure set and it is cheap.  </li>
            <li>BUT I ordered the nice brown leather vintage looking style.</li>
            <li>Nicely organized mani/pedi set.  </li>
            <li>HE NEEDED HIS OWN</li>
            <li>case keeps everything handy and it pleasing to the touch as well.</li>
            <li>Nice nail clippers that don&#x27;t leave ragged nails.</li>
            <li>Nice construction, sturdy implements, and conveniently sized package for travel.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to see a picture of the case before I bought it</li>
            <li>In addition to the folding kit it comes in, it comes nicely packaged in a gift box.  </li>
            <li>The case is nice as well.</li>
            <li>The case itself is a nice material, too.</li>
            <li>Nice options in tools.</li>
            <li>It comes in its own case.</li>
            <li>This set had everything I needed and it arrived in a nice case</li>
            <li>The case is gorgeous with brown padded leather, although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s synthetic.</li>
            <li>This is a nice quality carrying case with all of the tools you need.  </li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s a really nice nail grooming kit.</li>
            <li>This product allows one to give themselves a manicure and pedicure in their own home.</li>
            <li>I plan to do my own.  </li>
            <li>Or have some kind of flaw.</li>
            <li>nice casing too.</li>
            <li>But given the price, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I like it, too, and am impressed with the obvious quality of the products inside the very nice case.  </li>
            <li>Every single item is quality; I am very happy with this product and will recommend to others because of its great quality and price.</li>
            <li>Compact, great for a quick getaway.</li>
            <li>They would do better by making the case more durable in staying together rather than looking good for a month or two.</li>
            <li>All the items in this case are great and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>nice piece, has many tools, inexpensive but durable</li>
            <li>Really handy and well made product and the price made it even better.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product and everything in it is top notch with one exception.</li>
            <li>Love the case but the nail trimmers are kind of crappy.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband as a general grooming &amp;#34;tool kit&amp;#34; and it has been perfect.</li>
            <li>The set come in a beautiful box ready for gift giving.</li>
            <li>This is a complete set of very good quality tools.  </li>
            <li>Spend more money.</li>
            <li>I thought \\&quot;finally, a manly looking set perfect for me.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like it mashes</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re all about looks, you&#x27;ll love it...</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>The tools felt and looked top notch, but since I gave it as a gift, I am waiting to see how they stand up over time.  </li>
            <li>I was most pleased.</li>
            <li>This set contains everything you could ever need for a manicure or pedicure, and more.  </li>
            <li>I would have been better off with another brand.</li>
            <li>I bought this to keep in my desk at work, and I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li>A bit too many things for me, but</li>
            <li>You get more then what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my hubby for Christmas and it was one of his favorite gifts.  </li>
            <li>The price is great for such good quality.  </li>
            <li>The case looks nice and it seems like it will stand up to my light travel.  </li>
            <li>This set is beautiful - a beautiful soft leather case with a strong clasp mechanism, and a full, finely made set of grooming tools.</li>
            <li>Ok for the price.</li>
            <li>The set of personal care is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I got this set</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to keep my nails in order, but still appear manly.</li>
            <li>The case is nice, light weight....</li>
            <li>I can safely say that I am satisfied with this purchase and recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s toenails are getting out of hand like mine were.</li>
            <li>I really love my set.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this set.  </li>
            <li>Top quality.  </li>
            <li>Quality is better than I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>it came it which btw is lovely</li>
            <li>The fingernail clippers alone seem to be better quality than the type of clippers you would buy at the drug store.</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend for this last Christmas as a stocking stuffer and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Seems to be pretty good quality materials.</li>
            <li>Made great gift for new in-laws</li>
            <li>Love this product, it is easy to carry.</li>
            <li>This is a handsome set that will suit me just fine.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a very complete kit and it comes in the zippered case and in a very nice gift box.  </li>
            <li>It was made from very good quality metal and the finish was a brushed metal look.</li>
            <li>This ALICE 10-piece Vogue Nail care personal Manicure and Pedicure Set is ideal for the traveler.  </li>
            <li>My partner loved this and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>The other items in this set aren&#x27;t the best either.</li>
            <li>Also, it shipped out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li>It will be easy to fix when I can be bothered to do it, though.</li>
            <li>The leather case will make it easy for travel and to store.  </li>
            <li>Some grooming kits contain flimsy instruments that fall apart easily and don&#x27;t hold up to routine use.</li>
            <li>The tools are strong and durable, too.  </li>
            <li>The price was good, delivery was prompt, and the set looks nice, BUT it did not come in the case shown, which was red.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality product made of good material.</li>
            <li>Nice, very useful way to stay organized for both men and women, very compact and stylish looking.</li>
            <li>Fine shopping experience.</li>
            <li>I was less impressed with the toenail clippers, but so it goes.</li>
            <li>Perfect little set .</li>
            <li>It has several tools that you probably won&#x27;t ever use, but you will have everything you need with this kit all in an attractive case.</li>
            <li>The nail file has a particularly cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li>I thought it cheap for the price, and it is just that.  </li>
            <li>Very durable and the case is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Overall great set.</li>
            <li>This set looks nice, but on close inspection the set looks very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>The set is cheap, and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product is outstanding,  stainless steel,  cuts well,  we love it</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m not completely disappointed by my purchase (after all you pay for what you get), I would not buy these again nor recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>Compact, everything in one place, and accessible when I want it.</li>
            <li>but I am not 100% they really clean their tools between usage)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, and the quality of the tools were amazing!!</li>
            <li>just right so you can shut the lid!</li>
            <li>The case is nice and compact, and it has pretty much anything you could think of for hand and feet grooming.</li>
            <li>you actually want a manicure set that does a good job, keep looking.</li>
            <li>I really like this nail kit, I bought it mostly for the cuticle clippers</li>
            <li>This looked kinda cool</li>
            <li>and like it so much I bought two more and sent them to friends.</li>
            <li>The tools are not the finest quality, but they are adequate for my needs and the price was right!</li>
            <li>This is a really nice, high quality set in a nice solid container.</li>
            <li>This is a quite nice manicure kit, well worth the modest price.</li>
            <li>There are 4 different styles of cutters a file, scissors, skin and cuticle pusher and more and all are top quality.  </li>
            <li>This fits the bill and was a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and it is packaged really nicely.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this new set.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know what half of the stuff in this set is used for, but I am happy about the purchased.</li>
            <li>These tools are solid and the case is lovely!</li>
            <li>I bought some better ones and keep them in the same case so it was an easy fix.</li>
            <li>Great little manicure set.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a guy and it is discrete and a great little case.</li>
            <li>The metal itself is nice, no coating to slough off no fingerprints left.</li>
            <li>definitely worth it</li>
            <li>It looks nice, and everything seems to work well enough.  </li>
            <li>Is a shame been such a nice case.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>The instruments in this set are substantial, have nice weight and feel solid.  </li>
            <li>I rarely review anything, but in this case I&#x27;ll say that you get what you pay</li>
            <li>Hard to tell from looking at the pictures, but this is a high quality travel kit, very happy with ths purchase!</li>
            <li>Other then that, all good.</li>
            <li>Serves me right.</li>
            <li>The price was just right too.</li>
            <li>the price was right and everything works.</li>
            <li>A little more masculine than I had wanted for my teenage grand daughter, but she was happy with it</li>
            <li>I had a similar nail file and it was very stiff/rigid and worked nicely, the nail file in this kit isn&#x27;t worth the metal it took to make/</li>
            <li>Technically, as soon as possible and at high quality and I am very happy, I really trust this company.</li>
            <li>HE CHERISHES THIS VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is a beautiful gift.</li>
            <li>the clippers are strong and very sharp, even the most stubborn nail puts up little fight and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Good little travel kit</li>
            <li>It seems like all of these pieces are mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>A very well made and useful product.</li>
            <li>It comes in an attractive case that I suspect will not hold up over time; the case does not close securely enough to instill faith in it&#x27;s long term durability</li>
            <li>The nail clipper broke the first time it was used from one of the two sets.</li>
            <li>These were rated pretty well, so even though they were inexpensive, I ordered them.  </li>
            <li>The clippers broke the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>The product I received was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>My husband bought me a manicure, pedicure set over 25 years ago and he decided it was time to replace it as a piece or two were missing and the parts were contained in a cloth enclosure which was holding up good for it&#x27;s age, but this set, enclosed in the lovely and sturdy case should last me for the rest of my life as I am pushing 80.  </li>
            <li>It looks expensive and the tools work perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is the most critical tool in the kit for my purposes</li>
            <li>this item and continue shopping for a set that is higher in quality.</li>
            <li>Nice set of sharp instruments for the money.</li>
            <li>Everything is sharp and has nice grips.  </li>
            <li>The only thing was it was kinda hard to close, but my brother loves it, so I am happy!</li>
            <li>It looks really nice, comes in a nice box, and has held up to his tough wear and tear so far!</li>
            <li>All the clippers and other things are very high end as is the really nice case.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!  </li>
            <li>It has pretty much everything I need to cut and trim and take care of my finger nails and toe nails</li>
            <li>I go through manicure sets all the time, usually they are flimsy and cheap, this set is heavy duty great for men, not easy to break and great for the price.</li>
            <li>The implements are stainless steel and well made, the case is strong and built to last.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is sharp enough to be really good and the items used to push are too blunt to be effective or shaped oddly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, the entire rest of the kit&#x27;s items are built like a tank out of rigid heavy duty metal and feels as great as they</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The box doesn&#x27;t close very well.</li>
            <li>guess you just really need to see/feel this type of thing to get an idea of quality.</li>
            <li>product as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very embarrassing.</li>
            <li>If you are not a multi-billionaire entrepreneur and don&#x27;t need your products to be made out of platinum, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really could use some instructions...</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made quality product.</li>
            <li>I just really bought kit for looks and cuticle trimmer.</li>
            <li>This was purchase as part of a &amp;#34;care&amp;#34; package for a friend serving in Afghanistan and was much better than expected.  </li>
            <li>The finish on theese clippers are really nice, i find myself using 2 pices on this whole set because i only use it for personal use.</li>
            <li>Case is cheap and doesn&#x27;t close properly but the manicure items are decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve resorted to incorporating other items ( from another set that do a better job ).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything is really cute and fancy, the only problem I have with this kit is the nail clippers on top make it hard to close all the way</li>
            <li>Very cheap set,  half</li>
            <li>The nail clippers are pretty strong and nail sharp!</li>
            <li>Its small and handy .</li>
            <li>It is a very complete set of tools that are very high quality and perform well.  </li>
            <li>The case was very soft and everything looked durable!</li>
            <li>When it finally arrived it came in a nice red box with a very fancy red fabric inside.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>As a gift it appears to be really high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I like that all the tools in the manicure set are made of metal, nothing to brake so it will hold up to use for years, some of the pieces have a cutout design to give it a little more style.  </li>
            <li>case for the tools is a nice hard case with a faux leather finish.</li>
            <li>pieces aren&#x27;t as strong and as sharp as I thought they would be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And as far as looks goes, it is really nice!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have to start by saying that as a man, buying a manicure set was a new experience for me.  </li>
            <li>I reseached so many sets on amazon and read so many reviews that I was driving myself crazy.</li>
            <li>The outside of the case in the picture is shown as smooth red, but what came was a brown case both inside and out with a textured exterior.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the high quality case and tools.</li>
            <li>I think the set is very complete and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a deal!  </li>
            <li>Only had a short time but not disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a ton of other stuff that I&#x27;m not even sure what to do with, but if you&#x27;re big into nail-care, I assume you&#x27;ll know.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something that I plan on always keeping and never getting a new one, even into my old years.</li>
            <li>Just a one-click purchase at Amazon&#x27;s online site made it easy and the kit arrived in just a few days.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for the nail file but the nail file unfortunately is the single item in this 10 pc set that isn&#x27;t built like a tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail file metal is extremely &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;  and it bends out of shape very easily, the nail file should be fairly rigid and it&#x27;s anything but.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The biggest issue is that one of the little straps holding one of the pieces in place is only attached at one end, so closing the case is challenging.  </li>
            <li>love the little clippers, especially.</li>
            <li>5/5 stars and this is why, solid construction, very high quality items.</li>
            <li>Overall for the price given its a nice little set of everything you need for personal manicure or pedicure.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t close properly, the tools are dull and just don&#x27;t work effectively.  </li>
            <li>The large clipper is a little too big for me, but the other tools are well-made and nice quality.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I received the Alice kit.  </li>
            <li>It is a very manly looking set of tools, with a brushed metal finish.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t believe that I got a set of manicure tools of this quality for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The smaller clipper really doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;clip the nail\\&quot; well.</li>
            <li>I bought this nail care set for my 29 year old son because he has nail issues.  </li>
            <li>I havent used the nail clippers yet only because I bought myself a straight edge one for my toes.</li>
            <li>Complete set with all the nail clippers and trimmers you need.</li>
            <li>The case looked masculine and well made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to any female that wants her hubby to maintain his nails.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 16 year old son.  </li>
            <li>Believe it or not he loves it and has used it every day of his 16 year old career</li>
            <li>All the pieces are quality made unlike some kits that claim to be professional kits.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to return this kit as soon as I&#x27;d received it, but I had to pay for shipping it back almost as much as the kit costs.</li>
            <li>For some odd reason he likes to have his nails clean and with this kit lying in front of the TV, it seems to get used daily.</li>
            <li>It is larger than I expected (think pocketbook size) but the quality is well worth it.</li>
            <li>my old set was several years old and I needed to replace it.  </li>
            <li>Nail clippers could be more tough.</li>
            <li>THE CASE WOULD NOT CLOSED WHEN GIVEN AS ABIRTHDAY</li>
            <li>Back to my old manicure set.</li>
            <li>It looks like a nice set, but the quality is mediocre.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a little more durable case with less padding, but with a name like &amp;#34;Alice&amp;#34; I guess it&#x27;s not intended for men&#x27;s tastes.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp scissors as well as cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li>The blades of the nail clippers have gaps and sometimes you have to use a specific place on them to be able to cut a thin piece of skin/nail.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that the tool used to push back the cuticle prior to trimming has a little too much of a rounded edge</li>

            <li> It appears to be of good quailty.</li>

            <li> Good buy would recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good set of nail grooming tools.</li>
            <li> The clippers inside, not so good.  </li>

            <li> I got this because my kids keep take my chippers , and it has been great easy to find around the house and has everything you need</li>
            <li> The pieces are strong and work great.</li>
            <li> This product is very good and useful.</li>
            <li> It is a great manicure set and it is cheap.  </li>
            <li> BUT I ordered the nice brown leather vintage looking style.</li>
            <li> Nicely organized mani/pedi set.  </li>
            <li> HE NEEDED HIS OWN</li>
            <li> case keeps everything handy and it pleasing to the touch as well.</li>
            <li> Nice nail clippers that don&#x27;t leave ragged nails.</li>
            <li> Nice construction, sturdy implements, and conveniently sized package for travel.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to see a picture of the case before I bought it</li>
            <li> In addition to the folding kit it comes in, it comes nicely packaged in a gift box.  </li>
            <li> The case is nice as well.</li>
            <li> The case itself is a nice material, too.</li>
            <li> Nice options in tools.</li>
            <li> It comes in its own case.</li>
            <li> This set had everything I needed and it arrived in a nice case</li>
            <li> The case is gorgeous with brown padded leather, although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s synthetic.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality carrying case with all of the tools you need.  </li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a really nice nail grooming kit.</li>
            <li> This product allows one to give themselves a manicure and pedicure in their own home.</li>
            <li> I plan to do my own.  </li>
            <li> Or have some kind of flaw.</li>
            <li> nice casing too.</li>
            <li> But given the price, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I like it, too, and am impressed with the obvious quality of the products inside the very nice case.  </li>
            <li> Every single item is quality; I am very happy with this product and will recommend to others because of its great quality and price.</li>
            <li> Compact, great for a quick getaway.</li>
            <li> They would do better by making the case more durable in staying together rather than looking good for a month or two.</li>
            <li> All the items in this case are great and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> nice piece, has many tools, inexpensive but durable</li>
            <li> Really handy and well made product and the price made it even better.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and everything in it is top notch with one exception.</li>
            <li> Love the case but the nail trimmers are kind of crappy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a general grooming &amp;#34;tool kit&amp;#34; and it has been perfect.</li>
            <li> The set come in a beautiful box ready for gift giving.</li>
            <li> This is a complete set of very good quality tools.  </li>
            <li> Spend more money.</li>
            <li> I thought \\&quot;finally, a manly looking set perfect for me.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like it mashes</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re all about looks, you&#x27;ll love it...</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> The tools felt and looked top notch, but since I gave it as a gift, I am waiting to see how they stand up over time.  </li>
            <li> I was most pleased.</li>
            <li> This set contains everything you could ever need for a manicure or pedicure, and more.  </li>
            <li> I would have been better off with another brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep in my desk at work, and I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li> A bit too many things for me, but</li>
            <li> You get more then what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my hubby for Christmas and it was one of his favorite gifts.  </li>
            <li> The price is great for such good quality.  </li>
            <li> The case looks nice and it seems like it will stand up to my light travel.  </li>
            <li> This set is beautiful - a beautiful soft leather case with a strong clasp mechanism, and a full, finely made set of grooming tools.</li>
            <li> Ok for the price.</li>
            <li> The set of personal care is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I got this set</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to keep my nails in order, but still appear manly.</li>
            <li> The case is nice, light weight....</li>
            <li> I can safely say that I am satisfied with this purchase and recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s toenails are getting out of hand like mine were.</li>
            <li> I really love my set.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this set.  </li>
            <li> Top quality.  </li>
            <li> Quality is better than I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> it came it which btw is lovely</li>
            <li> The fingernail clippers alone seem to be better quality than the type of clippers you would buy at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for this last Christmas as a stocking stuffer and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Seems to be pretty good quality materials.</li>
            <li> Made great gift for new in-laws</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is easy to carry.</li>
            <li> This is a handsome set that will suit me just fine.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a very complete kit and it comes in the zippered case and in a very nice gift box.  </li>
            <li> It was made from very good quality metal and the finish was a brushed metal look.</li>
            <li> This ALICE 10-piece Vogue Nail care personal Manicure and Pedicure Set is ideal for the traveler.  </li>
            <li> My partner loved this and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> The other items in this set aren&#x27;t the best either.</li>
            <li> Also, it shipped out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li> It will be easy to fix when I can be bothered to do it, though.</li>
            <li> The leather case will make it easy for travel and to store.  </li>
            <li> Some grooming kits contain flimsy instruments that fall apart easily and don&#x27;t hold up to routine use.</li>
            <li> The tools are strong and durable, too.  </li>
            <li> The price was good, delivery was prompt, and the set looks nice, BUT it did not come in the case shown, which was red.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality product made of good material.</li>
            <li> Nice, very useful way to stay organized for both men and women, very compact and stylish looking.</li>
            <li> Fine shopping experience.</li>
            <li> I was less impressed with the toenail clippers, but so it goes.</li>
            <li> Perfect little set .</li>
            <li> It has several tools that you probably won&#x27;t ever use, but you will have everything you need with this kit all in an attractive case.</li>
            <li> The nail file has a particularly cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li> I thought it cheap for the price, and it is just that.  </li>
            <li> Very durable and the case is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Overall great set.</li>
            <li> This set looks nice, but on close inspection the set looks very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> The set is cheap, and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product is outstanding,  stainless steel,  cuts well,  we love it</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not completely disappointed by my purchase (after all you pay for what you get), I would not buy these again nor recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Compact, everything in one place, and accessible when I want it.</li>
            <li> but I am not 100% they really clean their tools between usage)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, and the quality of the tools were amazing!!</li>
            <li> just right so you can shut the lid!</li>
            <li> The case is nice and compact, and it has pretty much anything you could think of for hand and feet grooming.</li>
            <li> you actually want a manicure set that does a good job, keep looking.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail kit, I bought it mostly for the cuticle clippers</li>
            <li> This looked kinda cool</li>
            <li> and like it so much I bought two more and sent them to friends.</li>
            <li> The tools are not the finest quality, but they are adequate for my needs and the price was right!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, high quality set in a nice solid container.</li>
            <li> This is a quite nice manicure kit, well worth the modest price.</li>
            <li> There are 4 different styles of cutters a file, scissors, skin and cuticle pusher and more and all are top quality.  </li>
            <li> This fits the bill and was a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and it is packaged really nicely.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this new set.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know what half of the stuff in this set is used for, but I am happy about the purchased.</li>
            <li> These tools are solid and the case is lovely!</li>
            <li> I bought some better ones and keep them in the same case so it was an easy fix.</li>
            <li> Great little manicure set.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a guy and it is discrete and a great little case.</li>
            <li> The metal itself is nice, no coating to slough off no fingerprints left.</li>
            <li> definitely worth it</li>
            <li> It looks nice, and everything seems to work well enough.  </li>
            <li> Is a shame been such a nice case.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> The instruments in this set are substantial, have nice weight and feel solid.  </li>
            <li> I rarely review anything, but in this case I&#x27;ll say that you get what you pay</li>
            <li> Hard to tell from looking at the pictures, but this is a high quality travel kit, very happy with ths purchase!</li>
            <li> Other then that, all good.</li>
            <li> Serves me right.</li>
            <li> The price was just right too.</li>
            <li> the price was right and everything works.</li>
            <li> A little more masculine than I had wanted for my teenage grand daughter, but she was happy with it</li>
            <li> I had a similar nail file and it was very stiff/rigid and worked nicely, the nail file in this kit isn&#x27;t worth the metal it took to make/</li>
            <li> Technically, as soon as possible and at high quality and I am very happy, I really trust this company.</li>
            <li> HE CHERISHES THIS VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is a beautiful gift.</li>
            <li> the clippers are strong and very sharp, even the most stubborn nail puts up little fight and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Good little travel kit</li>
            <li> It seems like all of these pieces are mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> A very well made and useful product.</li>
            <li> It comes in an attractive case that I suspect will not hold up over time; the case does not close securely enough to instill faith in it&#x27;s long term durability</li>
            <li> The nail clipper broke the first time it was used from one of the two sets.</li>
            <li> These were rated pretty well, so even though they were inexpensive, I ordered them.  </li>
            <li> The clippers broke the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> The product I received was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me a manicure, pedicure set over 25 years ago and he decided it was time to replace it as a piece or two were missing and the parts were contained in a cloth enclosure which was holding up good for it&#x27;s age, but this set, enclosed in the lovely and sturdy case should last me for the rest of my life as I am pushing 80.  </li>
            <li> It looks expensive and the tools work perfectly.</li>
            <li> It is the most critical tool in the kit for my purposes</li>
            <li> this item and continue shopping for a set that is higher in quality.</li>
            <li> Nice set of sharp instruments for the money.</li>
            <li> Everything is sharp and has nice grips.  </li>
            <li> The only thing was it was kinda hard to close, but my brother loves it, so I am happy!</li>
            <li> It looks really nice, comes in a nice box, and has held up to his tough wear and tear so far!</li>
            <li> All the clippers and other things are very high end as is the really nice case.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!  </li>
            <li> It has pretty much everything I need to cut and trim and take care of my finger nails and toe nails</li>
            <li> I go through manicure sets all the time, usually they are flimsy and cheap, this set is heavy duty great for men, not easy to break and great for the price.</li>
            <li> The implements are stainless steel and well made, the case is strong and built to last.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is sharp enough to be really good and the items used to push are too blunt to be effective or shaped oddly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, the entire rest of the kit&#x27;s items are built like a tank out of rigid heavy duty metal and feels as great as they</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The box doesn&#x27;t close very well.</li>
            <li> guess you just really need to see/feel this type of thing to get an idea of quality.</li>
            <li> product as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very embarrassing.</li>
            <li> If you are not a multi-billionaire entrepreneur and don&#x27;t need your products to be made out of platinum, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really could use some instructions...</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made quality product.</li>
            <li> I just really bought kit for looks and cuticle trimmer.</li>
            <li> This was purchase as part of a &amp;#34;care&amp;#34; package for a friend serving in Afghanistan and was much better than expected.  </li>
            <li> The finish on theese clippers are really nice, i find myself using 2 pices on this whole set because i only use it for personal use.</li>
            <li> Case is cheap and doesn&#x27;t close properly but the manicure items are decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve resorted to incorporating other items ( from another set that do a better job ).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything is really cute and fancy, the only problem I have with this kit is the nail clippers on top make it hard to close all the way</li>
            <li> Very cheap set,  half</li>
            <li> The nail clippers are pretty strong and nail sharp!</li>
            <li> Its small and handy .</li>
            <li> It is a very complete set of tools that are very high quality and perform well.  </li>
            <li> The case was very soft and everything looked durable!</li>
            <li> When it finally arrived it came in a nice red box with a very fancy red fabric inside.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> As a gift it appears to be really high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I like that all the tools in the manicure set are made of metal, nothing to brake so it will hold up to use for years, some of the pieces have a cutout design to give it a little more style.  </li>
            <li> case for the tools is a nice hard case with a faux leather finish.</li>
            <li> pieces aren&#x27;t as strong and as sharp as I thought they would be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And as far as looks goes, it is really nice!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying that as a man, buying a manicure set was a new experience for me.  </li>
            <li> I reseached so many sets on amazon and read so many reviews that I was driving myself crazy.</li>
            <li> The outside of the case in the picture is shown as smooth red, but what came was a brown case both inside and out with a textured exterior.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the high quality case and tools.</li>
            <li> I think the set is very complete and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a deal!  </li>
            <li> Only had a short time but not disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a ton of other stuff that I&#x27;m not even sure what to do with, but if you&#x27;re big into nail-care, I assume you&#x27;ll know.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something that I plan on always keeping and never getting a new one, even into my old years.</li>
            <li> Just a one-click purchase at Amazon&#x27;s online site made it easy and the kit arrived in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for the nail file but the nail file unfortunately is the single item in this 10 pc set that isn&#x27;t built like a tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail file metal is extremely &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;  and it bends out of shape very easily, the nail file should be fairly rigid and it&#x27;s anything but.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The biggest issue is that one of the little straps holding one of the pieces in place is only attached at one end, so closing the case is challenging.  </li>
            <li> love the little clippers, especially.</li>
            <li> 5/5 stars and this is why, solid construction, very high quality items.</li>
            <li> Overall for the price given its a nice little set of everything you need for personal manicure or pedicure.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t close properly, the tools are dull and just don&#x27;t work effectively.  </li>
            <li> The large clipper is a little too big for me, but the other tools are well-made and nice quality.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received the Alice kit.  </li>
            <li> It is a very manly looking set of tools, with a brushed metal finish.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t believe that I got a set of manicure tools of this quality for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The smaller clipper really doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;clip the nail\\&quot; well.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail care set for my 29 year old son because he has nail issues.  </li>
            <li> I havent used the nail clippers yet only because I bought myself a straight edge one for my toes.</li>
            <li> Complete set with all the nail clippers and trimmers you need.</li>
            <li> The case looked masculine and well made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to any female that wants her hubby to maintain his nails.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 16 year old son.  </li>
            <li> Believe it or not he loves it and has used it every day of his 16 year old career</li>
            <li> All the pieces are quality made unlike some kits that claim to be professional kits.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to return this kit as soon as I&#x27;d received it, but I had to pay for shipping it back almost as much as the kit costs.</li>
            <li> For some odd reason he likes to have his nails clean and with this kit lying in front of the TV, it seems to get used daily.</li>
            <li> It is larger than I expected (think pocketbook size) but the quality is well worth it.</li>
            <li> my old set was several years old and I needed to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Nail clippers could be more tough.</li>
            <li> THE CASE WOULD NOT CLOSED WHEN GIVEN AS ABIRTHDAY</li>
            <li> Back to my old manicure set.</li>
            <li> It looks like a nice set, but the quality is mediocre.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a little more durable case with less padding, but with a name like &amp;#34;Alice&amp;#34; I guess it&#x27;s not intended for men&#x27;s tastes.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp scissors as well as cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li> The blades of the nail clippers have gaps and sometimes you have to use a specific place on them to be able to cut a thin piece of skin/nail.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that the tool used to push back the cuticle prior to trimming has a little too much of a rounded edge</li>
            <li> I highly recommend grabbing a few for gifts and such as well as personal use.</li>
            <li> makes tough trims clean and painless.</li>
            <li> A very minor beef might be that the file could be a tad larger and heavier</li>
            <li> The case does not look like the clasps will last very long.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am a large guy with hard to cut nails.</li>
            <li> However, the cutting tools inside the case are just ok.  </li>
            <li> This is going to work for me for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why but the tweezers are a much weaker metal than the other tools and do not work at all.</li>
            <li> The clippers in this set are really hard to use it takes a lot of strength to use them and because of an old work related injury I don&#x27;t have the strength in my hands to use them</li>
            <li> I had to go out and buy a single version which was $27.  </li>
            <li> (sorry don&#x27;t know what you call it) as not sharp enough and long enough for her to work on my big toe which has a permanent ingrown problem.  </li>
            <li> i got Gothic black leather with a Red Racing stripe</li>
            <li> leather on the outside came unbound after second day in small area.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and wanted something like this taking up as little space as possible in my overnight kit</li>
            <li> A heavy duty item that does the job so you can do what is necessary.  </li>
            <li> Looks a hell of a lot cooler that i expected it to as well.</li>
            <li> The finish looked rough and had a pitted appearance.  </li>
            <li> The box this comes in is a red box with a fluffy velvet lining.</li>
            <li> Buy this as a gift and the recipient will think you spent a lot of money on this.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected.  </li>
            <li> Cutting edges are sharp and I can nibble small slivers away from my nails very easily.</li>
            <li> Nail file is so rough that I&#x27;m not sure it was designed for human&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of nail care sets in my life and was never able to find one that was made to last.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the other set I&#x27;ve had for about 15yrs just wasn&#x27;t doing the job anymore.</li>
            <li> Clippers and scissors are sharp.  </li>
            <li> This product cannot be beat by any other one I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already purchased two because I gave the other one as a gift.</li>
            <li> The edges are too sharp and after I hurt myself twice, I gave up.</li>
            <li> late).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this as a gift, and though I was disappointed with the shipping time (it arrived 5 days after the latest estimated delivery date), this seems to have been a shipping and not a seller problem.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t sharp at all so my finger nails kept shredding.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered this fingernail and toenail grooming kit because I lost all of my other nail clippers</li>
            <li> other than that....</li>
            <li> The clippers aren&#x27;t even sharp, and the case doesn&#x27;t latch shut.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worries that it wouldn&#x27;t be sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the price will always be ridiculously low</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it took a little longer than expected to get here.</li>
            <li> Unusually well made and it looks expensive.</li>
            <li> The cutters are not very smooth, feels like a metal on metal grind when you move them around.</li>
            <li> do not work.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs Down.</li>
            <li> Some of the tools are ok, like the clippers and cuticle trimmers, but be careful with  the other tools, they are awkward to use, and sharp in the wrong places.</li>
            <li> A slightly thicker case would have been nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what half this stuff is for, but I like that it has a case for everything</li>
            <li> Tweezers are the only thing that was weak in the set</li>
            <li> This did the job with little effort on my part.</li>
            <li> Cheap and stupid.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not going to get heavy use</li>
            <li> the set broke after just a few uses</li>
            <li> Poor quality item.....does not close properly.</li>
            <li> The items are not cheap quality...</li>
            <li> The case is a bit too shallow and when it closes it strains to close, so when closed there is a gap between the 2 sides held together by the clasp.  </li>
            <li> The one complaint that I have is that the case is a little feminine for me.</li>
            <li> I was to lazy to return it</li>
            <li> No more $30-$40 trips to the nail shop</li>
            <li> very heavy and durable set.</li>
            <li> A serious waste of money</li>
            <li> The case is a bit hard to close with all of the tools in it, but I can usually get it to close.</li>
            <li> If the items aren&#x27;t placed in just so, it is hard to close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They feel like clippers that have gone dull.  </li>
            <li> Items were so crammed into case that it&#x27;s hard to get them out as well.</li>
            <li> - they are just dull and are not doing their job.</li>
            <li> I sent in a complaint and within 2 hours I had a response.  </li>
            <li> I use mine at least 3 times a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly replacing the tools with separately bought items.</li>
            <li> Arrived in just a few days!!</li>
            <li> You seriously can&#x27;t beat that.  </li>
            <li> This is a serious manicure set, no junky tools here.</li>
            <li> The nail kid is is not good at all the case reped of after tow days.</li>
            <li> It is a bit too thin for the tools and can be a little difficult to latch, and I had some concerns about damaging the tools that were pressed against one another.</li>
            <li> Since then I made several attempts to use it and was disappointed every time.</li>
            <li> The manicure kit itself is of poor quality.</li>
            <li> It is like an extremely limp hand saw that wobbles and bends all out of shape on every cutting</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the quality of some of the things in it.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> PRESENT VERY DISAPPOINTED AND</li>
            <li> they also sent me the wrong style of case</li>
            <li> and I find it a bit difficult to move the cuticle with</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but the worksmanship is not perfect by any means.</li>
            <li> Made me feel like I ordered something really expensive.</li>
            <li> Almost every piece of the kit is useless.</li>
            <li> The cutting items do not clip as well as they should.</li>
            <li> it is really disappointing</li>
            <li> The product look very expensive when in fact I purchased it on sale.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was very expensive looking.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, mind you, but its not what I thought I ordered from the pictures that are shown here.  </li>
            <li> The way it attaches in the case is by sliding them under a leather loop stitched to the base...</li>
            <li> Had this product for a while and ordered it to give husband pedicures and steel rusts bad!</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>

            <li> Cheap and stupid. Spend more money. they also sent me the wrong style of case i got Gothic black leather with a Red Racing stripe BUT I ordered the nice brown leather vintage looking style. I was to lazy to return it but the case is cheap and doesn&#x27;t close and the utensils are cheep thin aluminum and the nail clippers do not work.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs Down. Serves me right. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying that as a man, buying a manicure set was a new experience for me.  I was pleasantly surprised when I received the Alice kit.  It is a very manly looking set of tools, with a brushed metal finish. The style and finish remind me of a good quality hunting knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with the manly stuff out of the way, let&#x27;s talk about quality and functionality.  It is a very complete set of tools that are very high quality and perform well.  Cutting edges are sharp and I can nibble small slivers away from my nails very easily. The cuticle trimmer (v-shaped cutter) works very nicely and my cuticles are smoother than they have ever been. My only criticism is that the tool used to push back the cuticle prior to trimming has a little too much of a rounded edge and I find it a bit difficult to move the cuticle with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case for the tools is a nice hard case with a faux leather finish. It is a bit too thin for the tools and can be a little difficult to latch, and I had some concerns about damaging the tools that were pressed against one another. A slightly thicker case would have been nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I couldn&#x27;t believe that I got a set of manicure tools of this quality for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a deal!  I was not prepared for the quality of this item because the price was low.  You will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> When I saw this manicure set I thought \\&quot;finally, a manly looking set perfect for me.\\&quot; And as far as looks goes, it is really nice!!!&lt;br /&gt;This set does have it&#x27;s issues:&lt;br /&gt;* If the items aren&#x27;t placed in just so, it is hard to close.&lt;br /&gt;* The smaller clipper really doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;clip the nail\\&quot; well. It&#x27;s more like it mashes it.&lt;br /&gt;* The other items in this set aren&#x27;t the best either. I&#x27;ve resorted to incorporating other items ( from another set that do a better job ).&lt;br /&gt;* The way it attaches in the case is by sliding them under a leather loop stitched to the base...I can see this ripping over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, the only thing going for this set is it&#x27;s looks and that is about it. If you&#x27;re all about looks, you&#x27;ll love it...&lt;br /&gt;if you actually want a manicure set that does a good job, keep looking.</li>
            <li> What a handy, comprehensive set! Everything I need for great nail care is in here, and I&#x27;m more than happy with the quality. Thank you. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great gift, he loved it.</li>
            <li> Nicely organized mani/pedi set.  I gave this as a gift for Christmas and he loved it.  It has several tools that you probably won&#x27;t ever use, but you will have everything you need with this kit all in an attractive case.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother for Christmas. It came in a very pretty and impressive box! The case was very soft and everything looked durable! The only thing was it was kinda hard to close, but my brother loves it, so I am happy!</li>
            <li> Technically, as soon as possible and at high quality and I am very happy, I really trust this company. The order is without prejudice to arrive undamaged</li>
            <li> I bought this nail care set for my 29 year old son because he has nail issues.  He always has to borrow ours. He loves this set from Alice!  It seems to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> I got this because my kids keep take my chippers , and it has been great easy to find around the house and has everything you need</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, and the quality of the tools were amazing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of nail care sets in my life and was never able to find one that was made to last. This set, however, is incredible. Very nice. I won&#x27;t have to buy another set ever again. The price was just right too.</li>
            <li> Product is outstanding,  stainless steel,  cuts well,  we love it</li>
            <li> The product was bought for a gift.  It was a kit of instruments to groom and take care of your fingernails and toenails.  It was made from very good quality metal and the finish was a brushed metal look. The product look very expensive when in fact I purchased it on sale.  I was very pleased with the product, the price, and the shipping.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it took a little longer than expected to get here. Between the order time and when I got it, I got a letter in the mail from the seller saying something along the lines of they had accidentally sent me 2 of them and would I mind sending them some money to cover the cost of the second one. I only ever got 1 set and think it may have been a scam. It&#x27;s a good quality set, but I gave it 4 stars because of the letter.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but the worksmanship is not perfect by any means. The blades of the nail clippers have gaps and sometimes you have to use a specific place on them to be able to cut a thin piece of skin/nail. The nail file has a particularly cheap feel to it. The case is a bit too shallow and when it closes it strains to close, so when closed there is a gap between the 2 sides held together by the clasp.  The metal itself is nice, no coating to slough off no fingerprints left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this set. I reseached so many sets on amazon and read so many reviews that I was driving myself crazy. I decided to just give up on all the research and just settle and I&#x27;m happy everything turned out perfect. The pieces are strong and work great. Tweezers are the only thing that was weak in the set but I have plenty of tweezers so I wasn&#x27;t upset. I havent used the nail clippers yet only because I bought myself a straight edge one for my toes. Great set and I think I might buy a set or two as gifts. Also, it shipped out very quickly.</li>
            <li> It seems like all of these pieces are mediocre at best. Nothing is sharp enough to be really good and the items used to push are too blunt to be effective or shaped oddly. The cutting items do not clip as well as they should. I gave this away within minutes of opening and trying.</li>
            <li> IM SO GLAD I FOUND A COMPACT MANI/PEDI SYSTEM FOR MY HUSBAND. HE NEEDED HIS OWN AND THIS WAS A WONDERFUL VALUE. HE CHERISHES THIS VERY MUCH. NOTHING HAS BROKE, THEY ALL CAME ENCLOSED AND SANITARY AND STILL USES IT ALMOST DAILY.</li>
            <li> A very well made and useful product. I was surprised at the high quality case and tools. I&#x27;d buy for gifts</li>
            <li> very nice kit! The nail clippers are pretty strong and nail sharp! Recommended!</li>
            <li> Made great gift for new in-laws</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and the recipient was happy with it.</li>
            <li> 5/5 stars and this is why, solid construction, very high quality items. Complete set with all the nail clippers and trimmers you need. case keeps everything handy and it pleasing to the touch as well. the clippers are strong and very sharp, even the most stubborn nail puts up little fight and that&#x27;s a good thing. makes tough trims clean and painless. definitely worth it</li>
            <li> I thought it cheap for the price, and it is just that.  It doesn&#x27;t close properly, the tools are dull and just don&#x27;t work effectively.  A serious waste of money</li>
            <li> Quality nail care kit. Nice nail clippers that don&#x27;t leave ragged nails. Easy to hold onto. Would buy again</li>
            <li> THE CASE WOULD NOT CLOSED WHEN GIVEN AS ABIRTHDAY PRESENT VERY DISAPPOINTED AND WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS SITE AGAIN  BOB DURETTE</li>
            <li> This is a quite nice manicure kit, well worth the modest price. A very minor beef might be that the file could be a tad larger and heavier but it&#x27;s no big deal. This is a handsome set that will suit me just fine. It comes in an attractive case that I suspect will not hold up over time; the case does not close securely enough to instill faith in it&#x27;s long term durability but it&#x27;s not going to get heavy use so I&#x27;m unconcerned. I don&#x27;t regret this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> Nice construction, sturdy implements, and conveniently sized package for travel. I&#x27;d recommend this for any regular traveler who doesn&#x27;t want to be caught by surprise in need of grooming items.</li>
            <li> The case looked masculine and well made. The tools felt and looked top notch, but since I gave it as a gift, I am waiting to see how they stand up over time.  The packaging was very expensive looking.  I was most pleased.</li>
            <li> Best of the best for the price.  My daughter&lt;br /&gt; Like it  She use on every day. For the price looks very good</li>
            <li> This is a great travel set. I bought this because the other set I&#x27;ve had for about 15yrs just wasn&#x27;t doing the job anymore. All the items in this case are great and well worth the money. My wife loves using the kit for just about everything. The one complaint that I have is that the case is a little feminine for me. It would have been nice to see a picture of the case before I bought it</li>
            <li> leather on the outside came unbound after second day in small area. nice piece, has many tools, inexpensive but durable</li>
            <li> I bought two 10 Pcs Vogue Nail Care Personal Manicure &amp; Pedicure Set, Travel &amp; Grooming Kit. The nail clipper broke the first time it was used from one of the two sets. I sent in a complaint and within 2 hours I had a response.  They replaced both 10 PCS Nail Sets and sent them out priority mail.  The customer service was very good and I would buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, high quality set in a nice solid container. Perfect for every man. My husband keeps one in his car.</li>
            <li> This set contains everything you could ever need for a manicure or pedicure, and more.  I can&#x27;t believe I paid only $12.99 for it.  In addition to the folding kit it comes in, it comes nicely packaged in a gift box.  The tools are not the finest quality, but they are adequate for my needs and the price was right!</li>
            <li> All the tools work well. The large clipper is a little too big for me, but the other tools are well-made and nice quality.</li>
            <li> These were rated pretty well, so even though they were inexpensive, I ordered them.  The clippers broke the first time I used them.Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the best review, good quality. i would buy another or recommend someone to purchase one. as described.</li>
            <li> Overall for the price given its a nice little set of everything you need for personal manicure or pedicure. Good little travel kit</li>
            <li> Great quality. My partner loved this and the shipping was fast. I&#x27;d recommend this to any female that wants her hubby to maintain his nails. Manly feel - LOVE!</li>
            <li> Nice set of sharp instruments for the money. Only had a short time but not disappointed with the quality. The only nit-picky thing is trying to keep them in the case just right so you can shut the lid!</li>
            <li> Really handy and well made product and the price made it even better. I would have loved having a pair of nose hair scissors but the items included in the kit work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell from looking at the pictures, but this is a high quality travel kit, very happy with ths purchase!</li>
            <li> I go through manicure sets all the time, usually they are flimsy and cheap, this set is heavy duty great for men, not easy to break and great for the price.</li>
            <li> It looks like a nice set, but the quality is mediocre. I would have been better off with another brand.</li>
            <li> The cutters are not very smooth, feels like a metal on metal grind when you move them around. Other then that, all good.</li>
            <li> Case is cheap and doesn&#x27;t close properly but the manicure items are decent.</li>
            <li> Quality, Solid metal construction.  Clippers and scissors are sharp.  Travel case looks nice, and the lock works good.</li>
            <li> Nail clippers could be more tough.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep in my desk at work, and I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  It looks nice, and everything seems to work well enough.  The biggest issue is that one of the little straps holding one of the pieces in place is only attached at one end, so closing the case is challenging.  It will be easy to fix when I can be bothered to do it, though.</li>
            <li> This ALICE 10-piece Vogue Nail care personal Manicure and Pedicure Set is ideal for the traveler.  It comes in a sturdy case with the tools one needs to trim and groom one&#x27;s nails.  The tools are strong and durable, too.  I was attracted to it because the cost makes it a great value.  Just a one-click purchase at Amazon&#x27;s online site made it easy and the kit arrived in just a few days.  Fine shopping experience.</li>
            <li> Very nice kit. A bit too many things for me, but the price was right and everything works.</li>
            <li> This looked really great in the photos. Then I received it. The case is nice, and looks good. The manicure kit itself is of poor quality. I&#x27;m slowly replacing the tools with separately bought items.</li>
            <li> You get more then what you pay for. Very happy</li>
            <li> Perfect little set . It has everything that u need to keep ur nails in shape . Its small and handy . The case is well made and is about the size of a palm. Can be a good gift as well.</li>
            <li> I got these for my husband last year as a stocking stuffer. He loves this kit and uses it all the time. The case is very nice and keeps everything organized.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my hubby for Christmas and it was one of his favorite gifts.  I like it, too, and am impressed with the obvious quality of the products inside the very nice case.  One of my best purchases this Christmas season.</li>
            <li> This is a complete set of very good quality tools.  My wife and I have made good use of it and are very satisfied.  The price is great for such good quality.  The case is nice as well.</li>
            <li> Had this product for a while and ordered it to give husband pedicures and steel rusts bad!</li>
            <li> It was just what I was looking for myself to give myself a mani and pedi. Thanks and I recommend these</li>
            <li> All the tools are great, except for the tweezers. I am not sure why but the tweezers are a much weaker metal than the other tools and do not work at all. I bought some better ones and keep them in the same case so it was an easy fix. The case itself is a nice material, too.</li>
            <li> Very cheap set,  half the set broke after just a few uses</li>
            <li> I got this for my 16 year old son.  Believe it or not he loves it and has used it every day of his 16 year old career (he&#x27;s now 17).  For some odd reason he likes to have his nails clean and with this kit lying in front of the TV, it seems to get used daily.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the money :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail care set for my uncle, and he was very pleased with the quality assortment of items.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Alice(tm) 10 Pcs Vogue Nail Care Personal Manicure &amp; Pedicure Set, Travel &amp; Grooming Kit from ATAFA at the Amazon marketplace.  I am truly happy with everything about this set.  All the pieces are quality made unlike some kits that claim to be professional kits.  There are 4 different styles of cutters a file, scissors, skin and cuticle pusher and more and all are top quality.  This product cannot be beat by any other one I have ever bought.  I have had experiences when I bought a set that the clippers were great but the scissors were junk or vice versa, but that is not the case with this set.  Every single item is quality; I am very happy with this product and will recommend to others because of its great quality and price.</li>
            <li> I really like this set. I&#x27;ve already purchased two because I gave the other one as a gift. I think the set is very complete and you get what you pay for. The price is fair.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail kit, I bought it mostly for the cuticle clippers so I didn&#x27;t have to pay $10.00 + tip to go get a manicure anymore. It&#x27;s something that I plan on always keeping and never getting a new one, even into my old years. Everything is really cute and fancy, the only problem I have with this kit is the nail clippers on top make it hard to close all the way, I can see this maybe causing problems with the latch in the future, but currently not a problem. Maybe I will take out one of the things I never use and put the nail clippers in it&#x27;s place.... (o_ o)?</li>
            <li> The product came in on time.&lt;br /&gt;The pieces aren&#x27;t as strong and as sharp as I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;The box doesn&#x27;t close very well.</li>
            <li> The edges are too sharp and after I hurt myself twice, I gave up. Back to my old manicure set.</li>
            <li> A heavy duty item that does the job so you can do what is necessary.  It appears to be of good quailty.</li>
            <li> The case looks nice and it seems like it will stand up to my light travel.  However, the cutting tools inside the case are just ok.  They look good (which wasn&#x27;t a concern of mine), but they need to be sharper.  They feel like clippers that have gone dull.  Although I&#x27;m not completely disappointed by my purchase (after all you pay for what you get), I would not buy these again nor recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and wanted something like this taking up as little space as possible in my overnight kit and it&#x27;s just what I needed. Compact, everything in one place, and accessible when I want it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling but when I got it, the case was ripped. Is a shame been such a nice case.</li>
            <li> This set is beautiful - a beautiful soft leather case with a strong clasp mechanism, and a full, finely made set of grooming tools. It is larger than I expected (think pocketbook size) but the quality is well worth it. It is a well made set which I am proud to give as a gift (albeit 3 days late).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this as a gift, and though I was disappointed with the shipping time (it arrived 5 days after the latest estimated delivery date), this seems to have been a shipping and not a seller problem.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is an awesome investment. Very durable and the case is a nice touch. I would definately recommend checking this out.</li>
            <li> Poor quality item.....does not close properly. Not very sharp scissors as well as cuticle pusher. Ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice options in tools. Overall great set.</li>
            <li> The clippers in this set are really hard to use it takes a lot of strength to use them and because of an old work related injury I don&#x27;t have the strength in my hands to use them it is really disappointing</li>
            <li> guess you just really need to see/feel this type of thing to get an idea of quality. Items were so crammed into case that it&#x27;s hard to get them out as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on Amazon based on the reviews and it did not disappoint. My hubby ended up &amp;#34;stealing it&amp;#34; (now we share). It has everything nail wise in it for both finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and everything in it is top notch with one exception. I purchased this for the nail file but the nail file unfortunately is the single item in this 10 pc set that isn&#x27;t built like a tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail file metal is extremely &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;  and it bends out of shape very easily, the nail file should be fairly rigid and it&#x27;s anything but.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for that but it&#x27;s the truth. I had a similar nail file and it was very stiff/rigid and worked nicely, the nail file in this kit isn&#x27;t worth the metal it took to make/stamp it out. It is like an extremely limp hand saw that wobbles and bends all out of shape on every cutting stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the entire rest of the kit&#x27;s items are built like a tank out of rigid heavy duty metal and feels as great as they look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just a 4 star because of the nail file...if it was of the same quality as the rest of the included tools...it would have been a homerun for the kit and I mean...a HomeRun!</li>
            <li> Well built case, that is manly enough for me and everything inside seems well built and quality!!!......Deff cant beat it for the price</li>
            <li> Great little manicure set. It as all the pieces you would need. I bought this for a guy and it is discrete and a great little case. Good buy would recommend. Arrived in just a few days!!</li>
            <li> great sevice and vakue and and and adn and and and great value and service cannot complain about anything bye</li>
            <li> The set of personal care is wonderful. All of the set is durable and works well. It comes in its own case. I am glad that I got this set</li>
            <li> I have no idea how it will work out.  I was a little disappointed in the quality of some of the things in it. But I am hopeful</li>
            <li> The product I received was exactly what I wanted. I wanted to be able to keep my nails in order, but still appear manly. This kit is basically the manliest manicure kit ever, just look at it! The steel used in the tools is flawless but still matte looks manly. MEN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good set of nail grooming tools. I like it.</li>
            <li> These tools are solid and the case is lovely! Everything is sharp and has nice grips.  This set is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> Looks like a surgical kit. Very nice quality tools. I would have preferred a little more durable case with less padding, but with a name like &amp;#34;Alice&amp;#34; I guess it&#x27;s not intended for men&#x27;s tastes.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she loves it. Thanks so much!  I will definitely be back in the future! Cheers!</li>
            <li> The case is nice, light weight....The clippers inside, not so good.  They weren&#x27;t sharp at all so my finger nails kept shredding.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> my old set was several years old and I needed to replace it.  This set had everything I needed and it arrived in a nice case</li>
            <li> So I ordered this fingernail and toenail grooming kit because I lost all of my other nail clippers and my toenails were getting out of hand... I decided to get something that I can keep all pieces of together in one place. This looked kinda cool and I decided to order it. When it finally arrived it came in a nice red box with a very fancy red fabric inside. Made me feel like I ordered something really expensive. The case is gorgeous with brown padded leather, although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s synthetic. The inside looks just as good in person as it does in the images.When I pulled out the toenail clipper and got to work I had no issues. I have to say I am a large guy with hard to cut nails. This did the job with little effort on my part. It&#x27;s really a solid bunch of equipment. Looks a hell of a lot cooler that i expected it to as well. I can safely say that I am satisfied with this purchase and recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s toenails are getting out of hand like mine were.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the quality of the manicure set. It arrived promptly. For under $10.00 it waas a steal!</li>
            <li> This set is great.  The nail clippers are the sharpest I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Everything works great.  I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> product as described, fast shipping. Compact, great for a quick getaway. Contains what you need for basic nail grooming. At this price, cannot beat it.</li>
            <li> It looks like it will be what I need. My wife is happy with the kit and so am I.</li>
            <li> the tools themselves, are of a lower quality steel. other than that.... great presentation. great gifts. def. worth the price.</li>
            <li> I really love my set.  The implements are stainless steel and well made, the case is strong and built to last.  I use mine at least 3 times a week and I have had no problems.  I have owned it for over a year now and like it so much I bought two more and sent them to friends.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me a manicure, pedicure set over 25 years ago and he decided it was time to replace it as a piece or two were missing and the parts were contained in a cloth enclosure which was holding up good for it&#x27;s age, but this set, enclosed in the lovely and sturdy case should last me for the rest of my life as I am pushing 80.  I am so pleased with this new set.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nail kit to pack when going abroad. This fits the bill and was a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and it is packaged really nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a general grooming &amp;#34;tool kit&amp;#34; and it has been perfect. The case is nice and compact, and it has pretty much anything you could think of for hand and feet grooming.</li>
            <li> Gave husband this for Christmas. The clippers aren&#x27;t even sharp, and the case doesn&#x27;t latch shut. Very embarrassing. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I like that all the tools in the manicure set are made of metal, nothing to brake so it will hold up to use for years, some of the pieces have a cutout design to give it a little more style.  The leather case will make it easy for travel and to store.  It is also a great gift idea for friends.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is easy to carry. It looks expensive and the tools work perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product is very good and useful. I like how its made, I recommend this product to everyone. You won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Nice, very useful way to stay organized for both men and women, very compact and stylish looking. Seems to be pretty good quality materials.</li>
            <li> The price was good, delivery was prompt, and the set looks nice, BUT it did not come in the case shown, which was red.  I bought this as a &amp;#34;stocking stuffer&amp;#34; for someone who loves all things RED.  The outside of the case in the picture is shown as smooth red, but what came was a brown case both inside and out with a textured exterior.  It isn&#x27;t bad, mind you, but its not what I thought I ordered from the pictures that are shown here.  I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this set.  I would give the quality of the items a four out of five stars, as well as the case.  I would, also, not hesitate to buy another.  The implements all work well ... love the little clippers, especially.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my girls, to keep in the car (or anywhere else).  Very attractive case and the tools are of very good grade.</li>
            <li> I received my product as described in great working order!  It is a great manicure set and it is cheap.  You seriously can&#x27;t beat that.  If you are not a multi-billionaire entrepreneur and don&#x27;t need your products to be made out of platinum, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality carrying case with all of the tools you need.  This is going to work for me for a long time.</li>
            <li> My person who does the pedicure and manicure did not like the one tool which has the bowed handle (sorry don&#x27;t know what you call it) as not sharp enough and long enough for her to work on my big toe which has a permanent ingrown problem.  I had to go out and buy a single version which was $27.  It is the most critical tool in the kit for my purposes and so I bought a replacement.  (my salon does a terrific job but I am not 100% they really clean their tools between usage)</li>
            <li> A little more masculine than I had wanted for my teenage grand daughter, but she was happy with it and  thought it would travel well.  Implements appeared to be well made as well as the case.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Top quality.  Some grooming kits contain flimsy instruments that fall apart easily and don&#x27;t hold up to routine use. The instruments in this set are substantial, have nice weight and feel solid.  The set come in a beautiful box ready for gift giving.</li>
            <li> This product is not just beautiful but it contains everything needed to do you nails. This is a high quality product made of good material.</li>
            <li> This set looks nice, but on close inspection the set looks very inexpensive.  The finish looked rough and had a pitted appearance.  The case does not look like the clasps will last very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy. I don&#x27;t know what some of these things are for or the correct way to use them. Really could use some instructions...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is great. Has the tools I wanted and then some...</li>
            <li> Kit is wonderful and has everything you need for your nails.  It works great at home and when you travel.</li>
            <li> This is a serious manicure set, no junky tools here. Bought this as a gift for my husband, going to buy another one for myself!</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a really nice nail grooming kit. Great for traveling and makes for a really good gift idea for birthdays, or holidays.</li>
            <li> This product allows one to give themselves a manicure and pedicure in their own home. It has everything you have to give yourself a professoional mani or pedi.&lt;br /&gt;I highy recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent kit for grooming and upkeep of your nails.  It has everything you need.  No more $30-$40 trips to the nail shop I plan to do my own.  Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I do like this kit. It has pretty much everything I need to cut and trim and take care of my finger nails and toe nails</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know what half of the stuff in this set is used for, but I am happy about the purchased. The items are not cheap quality...good steel...nice case, and great item.</li>
            <li> Great value here. I don&#x27;t know what half this stuff is for, but I like that it has a case for everything and I can do everything I need as a guy.</li>
            <li> Some of the tools are ok, like the clippers and cuticle trimmers, but be careful with  the other tools, they are awkward to use, and sharp in the wrong places.</li>
            <li> I really like this set. I was a bit worries that it wouldn&#x27;t be sharp. Or have some kind of flaw. I am so impressed my the quality!</li>
            <li> This item is great for the price fits in any shaving kit and the utensils are excellent</li>
            <li> I rarely review anything, but in this case I&#x27;ll say that you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I received wasn&#x27;t the same as the one pictured. The set is cheap, and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this item and continue shopping for a set that is higher in quality.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made quality product. Slim style so you can carry around in your purse if you want. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY nice product. Unusually well made and it looks expensive. As a gift it appears to be really high quality. All the clippers and other things are very high end as is the really nice case. The box this comes in is a red box with a fluffy velvet lining. Seriously, this is a beautiful gift. I bought it for myself and ever time I use it I&#x27;m really impressed. Buy this as a gift and the recipient will think you spent a lot of money on this.</li>
            <li> The tools work well, but the case leaves something to be desired. They would do better by making the case more durable in staying together rather than looking good for a month or two.</li>
            <li> Junk.  Clippers fell apart the second time I used them.  Buyer Beware!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any of them yet but got the package over a week and i must say- I like the set and options of cutters. nice casing too.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected.  Quality is better than I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> just got these in the mail today. An immense bargain! I highly recommend grabbing a few for gifts and such as well as personal use.</li>
            <li> The nail kid is is not good at all the case reped of after tow days.</li>
            <li> I bought this because well I wanted it and its usefull and all but the &#x27;leather&#x27; cover was coming off so I threw it away and put the contents in the red box it came it which btw is lovely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the price will always be ridiculously low or if I got a one-time bargain. But given the price, I was thrilled. The fingernail clippers alone seem to be better quality than the type of clippers you would buy at the drug store. I was less impressed with the toenail clippers, but so it goes. There&#x27;s also a ton of other stuff that I&#x27;m not even sure what to do with, but if you&#x27;re big into nail-care, I assume you&#x27;ll know.</li>
            <li> I purchased the ALICE travel set as a gift.  The leather case was well made.  The items in the set also looked well made but I did not try them.  I was very pleased with the shipping and packaging.  The set was in a box that looked like a jewelery box and the set was surrounded by a red satin like material.  The set made a perfect gift.</li>
            <li> I have waited for awhile to review this product, because I wanted to see how they would hold up with use.  Well, I am happy to report that after continued use, the effectiveness of the manicure set is as good as the day I received it.  Clippers, scissors, cuticle cutter have all retained sharpness and ease of use.  The kit itself has held up to wear, and is generally of good quality.  So glad I found these!</li>
            <li> I wanted to return this kit as soon as I&#x27;d received it, but I had to pay for shipping it back almost as much as the kit costs. So I kept it. Since then I made several attempts to use it and was disappointed every time. Almost every piece of the kit is useless. Scissors, clippers, cuticle trimmer - they are just dull and are not doing their job. Nail file is so rough that I&#x27;m not sure it was designed for human&#x27;s nails. I would not recommend this kit to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the case but the nail trimmers are kind of crappy. I just really bought kit for looks and cuticle trimmer. Great for those reasons.</li>
            <li> This was purchase as part of a &amp;#34;care&amp;#34; package for a friend serving in Afghanistan and was much better than expected.  For the price it is a very complete kit and it comes in the zippered case and in a very nice gift box.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister, Alice.  She told me it was the nicest gift she had received for her birthday.</li>
            <li> The finish on theese clippers are really nice, i find myself using 2 pices on this whole set because i only use it for personal use. A guide on what the rest of the pices are and how to use them would be great.</li>
            <li> very heavy and durable set. I&#x27;m happy with it. The case is a bit hard to close with all of the tools in it, but I can usually get it to close.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for this last Christmas as a stocking stuffer and it was perfect. It looks really nice, comes in a nice box, and has held up to his tough wear and tear so far! Manly and refined.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very good price, I love, is as I saw it on the internet. I arrive at his time, very good, I recommend the product. Excellent product, beautiful color, good material, it received in due time, very good price. I am delighted with my purchase.</li>
