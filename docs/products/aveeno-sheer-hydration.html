            <li>It rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you oily, you could turn a door knob moments after using it.</li>

            <li>my skin looked healthy and felt hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion</li>
            <li>I was able to use it on my face too.</li>

            <li>I liked how light this was, I often breakout a lot during the summer months and feel like this wouldn&#x27;t make matters</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin and this is just wonderful.</li>
            <li>Although I received this as a sample these are my honest opinions and true review of the product.</li>
            <li>This product was really nice and light and perfect to use everyday.</li>
            <li>(I receive nothing addition for a positive review, I just really love this lotion!)</li>
            <li>What makes this Aveeno lotion even better is the quick absorption.</li>
            <li>, I love Aveeno products, I even use the baby collection on the baby girl who will be 1 and the night time lotion puts her calmly to sleep.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of aveeno and this is just another great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a member of Crowdtap aveeno and I received a free sample of this item.</li>
            <li>I found that this lotion is scent free and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so impressed by this stuff that I got a bottle for my ten year old, who has eczema, but HATES the feeling of lotion on her skin.</li>
            <li>it dries matte and feels cool to the touch after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>product is super absorbent, fragrance free and leaves your skin feeling hydrated, moisturized, soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this lotion to be honest, though I love other Aveeno products, this one is not my fave.</li>
            <li>I love how hydrating and light weight this lotion is, it makes my skin feeling smooth and does not leave the sticky grossly residue , I am a crowdtapper</li>
            <li>This so much better because it soaks into my skin quickly and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>so when I got this sample I finally tried it myself and love it</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell to it that is very subtle and so light</li>
            <li>I love how the product rehydrated my dry skin</li>
            <li>the lightest of lotions leave a super sticky, moist sheen that feels gross and never gets absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>It works right away and makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I loved this lotion my boys have sensitive skin and have been using it since they were little</li>
            <li>She tried it hesitantly, and turned out liking it so much that she started using it</li>
            <li>It says it absorbs in seconds with a powder feel, but to me it didn&#x27;t absorb any better or faster than other lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I love Aveeno&#x27;s Original Daily Moisturizing lotion but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it left a sticky feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love that this product works fast, leaves no greasy feeling and doesn;t feel heavy or waxy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to review a sample and let me tell you, there is no turning back to a different lotion</li>
            <li>I was already a fan of Aveeno lotions before trying the Daily Moisturizing Sheer Hydration lotion, but I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It really worked to get my skin soft and did not leave it feeling greasy or oily!</li>
            <li>There are other Aveeno lotions that I can find easily</li>
            <li>great product, weird scent.</li>
            <li>and I can get dressed right after applying it, and it goes easily onto wet or dry skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very light, whereas I usually prefer a thicker lotion.  </li>
            <li>live in Florida so lotion is a challenge- even when my skin is SUPER dry from the air conditioning and pool chemicals, etc.</li>
            <li>, I use it just to want to feel my soft silky skin, I recommend this to men and women.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft but it has a non-greasy, powder-like feel to it.</li>
            <li>I have severely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>the lotion has been absorbed leaving just smooth skin behind, no sticky or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>it immediately soaks into the skin, leaving barely any residue.</li>
            <li>It left my hands feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Despite it being labelled as unscented it has a slight but distinct smell, reminiscent of medical grade ointments.</li>
            <li>So I was surprised, though this seemed watery, it left me with deep moisture that lasted a long time &amp; left my skin very soft.</li>

            <li> This is a must for anyone looking for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product that works without irritating skin, without the need to reapply and without the greasy, heavy, waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> I wear compression stockings all the time and this is the only lotion that was recommended because it has no petroleum in it; petroleum is bad for compression stockings.  </li>
            <li> I just hate that I feel like I have to air dry for an hour after applying lotion to my skin.&lt;br</li>

            <li> “I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its SHEER HYDRATION DAILY MOISTURIZING LOTION to review.”  I received a tiny sample bottle.  This lotion is very light, whereas I usually prefer a thicker lotion.  It says it absorbs in seconds with a powder feel, but to me it didn&#x27;t absorb any better or faster than other lotions I&#x27;ve used.  I also didn&#x27;t notice anything about a &amp;#34;powder feel&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t care for the scent either,  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this lotion to be honest, though I love other Aveeno products, this one is not my fave.</li>

I love that this product works fast, leaves no greasy feeling and doesn;t feel heavy or waxy on the skin.  When using this product, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to keep reapplying it during the day...my skin looked healthy and felt hydrated.  This is a must for anyone looking for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product that works without irritating skin, without the need to reapply and without the greasy, heavy, waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> I love how hydrating and light weight this lotion is, it makes my skin feeling smooth and does not leave the sticky grossly residue , I am a crowdtapper and I was able to review a sample and let me tell you, there is no turning back to a different lotion, I love Aveeno products, I even use the baby collection on the baby girl who will be 1 and the night time lotion puts her calmly to sleep. But the daily hydration lotion I dont have to worry about over using it, I use it just to want to feel my soft silky skin, I recommend this to men and women. Its amazing</li>

            <li> I was already a fan of Aveeno lotions before trying the Daily Moisturizing Sheer Hydration lotion, but I love this lotion. My skin feels softer, smoother and does not have the scaly dry look after using Aveeno lotions. What makes this Aveeno lotion even better is the quick absorption. It does not make your skin feel sticky or greasy at all. Almost as soon as you are done applying it the lotion has been absorbed leaving just smooth skin behind, no sticky or greasy feeling. I LOVE this lotion and I would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its SHEER HYDRATION DAILY MOISTURIZING LOTION to review. (I receive nothing addition for a positive review, I just really love this lotion!)</li>
            <li> I was really pleasantly happy after trying this moisturizer. It rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you oily, you could turn a door knob moments after using it. It has a pleasant smell to it that is very subtle and so light I was able to use it on my face too. Perfect for use daily but I&#x27;d use a heavier lotion occasionally during the winter or at times when your skin is really dry, this wouldn&#x27;t cut it. I liked how light this was, I often breakout a lot during the summer months and feel like this wouldn&#x27;t make matters worse.&lt;br /&gt;I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its SHEER HYDRATION DAILY MOISTURIZING LOTION to review. Although I received this as a sample these are my honest opinions and true review of the product.</li>
            <li> “I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its SHEER HYDRATION DAILY MOISTURIZING LOTION to review.” I love how the product rehydrated my dry skin</li>
            <li> Usually I get deeper moisturizing with body butters or creams, not lotions. So I was surprised, though this seemed watery, it left me with deep moisture that lasted a long time &amp; left my skin very soft. Just a little goes a long way!  I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its SHEER HYDRATION DAILY MOISTURIZING LOTION to review.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I wear compression stockings all the time and this is the only lotion that was recommended because it has no petroleum in it; petroleum is bad for compression stockings.  There are other Aveeno lotions that I can find easily but they DO have petroleum.  It keeps my skin soft but it has a non-greasy, powder-like feel to it.</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno&#x27;s Original Daily Moisturizing lotion but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it left a sticky feel on my skin. This so much better because it soaks into my skin quickly and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> live in Florida so lotion is a challenge- even when my skin is SUPER dry from the air conditioning and pool chemicals, etc. the lightest of lotions leave a super sticky, moist sheen that feels gross and never gets absorbed into my skin. So, I&#x27;ll often skip the lotion, even when my skin is feeling super dry and painful. I just hate that I feel like I have to air dry for an hour after applying lotion to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is completely different- it immediately soaks into the skin, leaving barely any residue. No oily sheen on the skin, either- it dries matte and feels cool to the touch after it&#x27;s applied. There&#x27;s definitely no sticky feeling on my skin and I can get dressed right after applying it, and it goes easily onto wet or dry skin. Despite how lightweight it is, it does a great job of moisturizing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed by this stuff that I got a bottle for my ten year old, who has eczema, but HATES the feeling of lotion on her skin. Any lotion. She tried it hesitantly, and turned out liking it so much that she started using it every day- on her own- because it helps her skin feel less itchy and isn&#x27;t sticky. So that was a definite added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a lighter-weight lotion that leaves no residue on your skin and doesn&#x27;t make you feel sticky or sweaty, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its SHEER HYDRATION DAILY MOISTURIZING LOTION to review. I found that this lotion is scent free and non-greasy.  It left my hands feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> great product, weird scent. Despite it being labelled as unscented it has a slight but distinct smell, reminiscent of medical grade ointments.</li>
            <li> Soothing feeling on dry skin. prevents itching and peeling. Great for sunburns too</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It works right away and makes my skin feel very soft. Say goodbye to dry and itchy skin.  The oatmeal included helps with the itchiness as well as the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its SHEER HYDRATION DAILY MOISTURIZING LOTION to review.</li>

            <li> I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its SHEER HYDRATION DAILY MOISTURIZING LOTION to review.  I have severely sensitive skin and I found this product to be especially soothing.  There&#x27;s no flowery scent to aggravate my skin and assault my nose.  It&#x27;s not greasy and feels great.</li>
