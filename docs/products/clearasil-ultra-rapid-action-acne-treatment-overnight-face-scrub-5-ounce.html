    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have had excellent luck with weekly use of [[ASIN:B003UZ4R24</li>
            <li>The best thing up</li>
            <li>Grains - good!</li>
            <li>And the smell makes you feel happy before going to sleep which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clearasil is great for teenagers.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell but that is not over powering.  </li>
            <li>It is just a good scrub.</li>
            <li>I have used it before bed and it cleans the face, there is no reaction, no chemicals that have caused me any sensitivity issues so that&#x27;s good, and the smell is fairly nice.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s kind of a lot.</li>
            <li>but this product is more effective.  </li>
            <li>It does leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed, and I found the very light scent to be pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I have used several scrubs over the years and this has to be one of the best for the suggested retail price.  </li>
            <li>All in all this is a good product and worth the shot.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things before including prescription Metrogel, as well as Prosacea (from Amazon)which</li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s been more than 2 weeks and there has been no improvement.</li>
            <li>I do know that I did not use this product too many times.</li>
            <li>, I prefer \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; scent, like soap etc  Texture - OK, on the oily/heavy side  </li>
            <li>Hope you&#x27;ll find this helpful :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this OTC product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work like the product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the promised improvement \\&quot;overnight\\&quot;, but maybe over a bit more time it will make a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen no improvement, and in fact seem to be breaking out a bit more now than I was before.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for adults, but more for teenagers that have acne.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting greater results though</li>
            <li>love the way my skin feels immediately after using this product, but it seems as though teh exfoliating granuales are clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>This Clearasil scrub feels good, smells good and actually works.</li>
            <li>It also is a great scrub that really seems to get the skin clean.</li>
            <li>My son has suffered from acne on his forehead since becoming a teenager.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t really tell a difference between using this product and a good quality soap.</li>
            <li>It has a fragrance that reminds me of those floral scented nail polish removers, albeit not as strong.  </li>
            <li>It could be that it&#x27;s too strong for her skin.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle, yet effective exfoliant.</li>
            <li>She also said that it makes her skin smooth, but \\&quot;it kinda burns</li>
            <li>This lightly scented scrub worked well on my oily skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more diluted but it still has the right scrubbing feeling.</li>
            <li>When first applying, it feels very light and doesn&#x27;t make your face feel like it is cleaning, but overnight, it is working.</li>
            <li>This scrub may not be prescription strength, but it is worth a try!</li>
            <li>I was excited for him to try this Clearasil Ultra Overnight Scrub.  </li>
            <li>Great product, cleans my skin well without leaving a greasy feeling and does not over dry my skin.</li>
            <li>It felt good and left my skin clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I do have a problem with my very fair skin having uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>The scrub lathers quickly and easily and and rinses right off.</li>
            <li>Following your nightly cleanse its good to use a non-greasy formula moisturizer  to help lock in the cleansing affect.  </li>
            <li>like, a bit too sweet in my opinion</li>
            <li>My 13-year old daughter uses this product and it does work, but, in her words \\&quot; kind of works.</li>
            <li>I think the exfoliating qualities of the cleanser are also good for brightening up my old skin in general - it just looks better all around.</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it, it foams and feels like its really getting my skin clean</li>
            <li>and I find it to be pretty significant</li>
            <li>The abrasive compound is relatively fine and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as St Ives Apricot Scrub (SIAS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per</li>
            <li>If you have the $$$ then I would suggest purchasing a premium brand such as Kiehls or Pangea Organics, but if you are working on a budget then this Clearasil Ulta Overnight gives you a nice bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li>But for an OTC product, I say it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I found this scrub refreshing for my adult acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be the perfect cleanser except after using it I&#x27;ve broken out.</li>
            <li>I will say, be realistic: acne is normally a lifelong problem, but it can be controlled with a great skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good at exfoliating as other scrubs I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t vouch that it really improved the color of my skin, but it did leave it clean and oil-free in the morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not as great as some prescriptions I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I would love for this to work better than my 5% benzoyl peroxide foam (the bleaching of everything drives me a little bananas)....</li>
            <li>The scrub is soft yet feels like a scrub and is easily applied to your face and neck area.  </li>
            <li>It washes off easily leaving my skin feeling refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Regardless of its acne fighting claims this is actually a fairly decent night time face wash that has a pleasant scent and a rich, buttery feel to it that feels nothing like acne washes i&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>This product contains tiny exfoliating granules that leave my skin clean, smooth and softer than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My son has started getting acne this year and the first thing I wanted to try was Clearasil.  </li>
            <li>Rather, I think that when I use this I actually had more skin irritation.</li>
            <li>But the remarkable thing--and the reason I&#x27;ll keep using it--is that this is the first 2% salicylic acid product I&#x27;ve used that hasn&#x27;t left my face red and feeling burned.  </li>
            <li>when you first out it on.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m running through the tube pretty</li>
            <li>/&gt;It claims to do some magic overnight while you sleep because your skin is different at night.</li>
            <li>Most face scrubs are the same to me.</li>
            <li>OK, so I have not personally used it ...</li>
            <li>If used consistently every night, it does clear up light acne.</li>
            <li>The whole &#x27;overnight&#x27; aspect of this particular wash has to do with its purported special formulation that works continuously through the night while your skin is in the process of cellular regeneration.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B001GIOW36 Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Control Kit]]</li>
            <li>and my skin is much better - not totally back to normal but</li>
            <li>Some people swear my certain products, while others see no benefit in them.  </li>
            <li>THe Ultra Overnight really works wonders.  </li>
            <li>, but I found that one to be really drying until my skin adjusted to it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it as a facial cleanser, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it miraculously cleared up my skin.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have much use for it, but here is what my wife has to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However if you have sensitive skin that is fair (and hence shows up every little variation in color) - I cannot recommend it based on MY experience, but it may be just right for someone younger with more regular break-outs.</li>
            <li>more than in other similar products  Results - to be honest, except for me feeling cleaner, I never really see results from these products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had new breakouts while using this scrub, so I don&#x27;t have much confidence in their claims.</li>
            <li>My skin seems less oily and feels better.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife who has occasional mild acne.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this scrub if you are prone to frequeny break outs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the scrub for 3 weeks now and it really does clear up blemishes overnight.</li>
            <li>I gve this cleanser a try on my normal, not-dry-not-oily skin.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note, I do like it simply as a scrub - it seems to leave on a moisturizing layer even after rinsing, so</li>
            <li>This is one of those situations where individual response is going to vary so much.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite sensitive to products like this).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have what you would call sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult with no history of blemish problems.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never had an adverse reaction to a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry or flakey after using, so if you have skin with mild imperfections or occasional breakouts, it may work well for you -</li>
            <li>My face started becoming extremely itchy, irritated, and dry almost immediately.</li>
            <li>The scrub has exfoliating beads in it but the scrub is so creamy that the beads don&#x27;t feel too harsh and it washes off cleanly.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t leave it feeling tight or dry like other or cleansers that target acne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll keep up with this for the next few weeks and see if breakouts are diminished more than just the week long adjustment to a new medication/treatment.  </li>
            <li>skin is left feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>After using the SCRUB for about 2 months, I noticed that the pimples didn&#x27;t last as long and that probably has to do with the salicylic acid that causes the skin to breakdown and repair itself faster, basically shedding dead skin cells faster, so I&#x27;m sure that had a lot to do with</li>
            <li>In the case of the Ultra Overnight, even though you&#x27;re supposed to use this just prior to retiring for the night, i&#x27;ve washed up and mulled around for a few hours around the house and surprisingly have not encountered the typical dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly clear 30ish skin with occasional pimples.</li>
            <li>After several weeks our 14 year old is not seeing any results, has given up on the product and moved on to something else.</li>
            <li>So far we&#x27;ve found only 1 OTC acne product that has worked for her</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not a big fan of the fragrance, though at least it is very mild and it doesn&#x27;t linger for too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38 and have pretty clear skin but have small breakouts everynow and then.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a really nice wash and for those in need of overnight acne assistance you certainly can&#x27;t go wrong giving this a try.</li>
            <li>Actually, at this moment I seem to have acquired four large, red pimples in painfully obvious places, and that&#x27;s not normal for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin had a noticeable improvement over the next 15 days after I started using it and during this period I consumed more sugar than I normally do which usually affects my skin in a negative way.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it has microbeads makes it feel like it does a good job cleansing, but with only 2% salicylic acid, I can&#x27;t see it doing major repair work if you have a bad case of acne.  </li>
            <li>SCRUB didn&#x27;t lather too much and had larger granules than say Pro-Activ Face Wash, and it has that odd smell like medicinal perfume.</li>

            <li> more than in other similar products  Results - to be honest, except for me feeling cleaner, I never really see results from these products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had new breakouts while using this scrub, so I don&#x27;t have much confidence in their claims.</li>
            <li> My skin seems less oily and feels better.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife who has occasional mild acne.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this scrub if you are prone to frequeny break outs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the scrub for 3 weeks now and it really does clear up blemishes overnight.</li>
            <li> I gve this cleanser a try on my normal, not-dry-not-oily skin.  </li>
            <li> On a positive note, I do like it simply as a scrub - it seems to leave on a moisturizing layer even after rinsing, so</li>
            <li> This is one of those situations where individual response is going to vary so much.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite sensitive to products like this).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have what you would call sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult with no history of blemish problems.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never had an adverse reaction to a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry or flakey after using, so if you have skin with mild imperfections or occasional breakouts, it may work well for you -</li>
            <li> My face started becoming extremely itchy, irritated, and dry almost immediately.</li>
            <li> The scrub has exfoliating beads in it but the scrub is so creamy that the beads don&#x27;t feel too harsh and it washes off cleanly.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t leave it feeling tight or dry like other or cleansers that target acne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep up with this for the next few weeks and see if breakouts are diminished more than just the week long adjustment to a new medication/treatment.  </li>
            <li> skin is left feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> After using the SCRUB for about 2 months, I noticed that the pimples didn&#x27;t last as long and that probably has to do with the salicylic acid that causes the skin to breakdown and repair itself faster, basically shedding dead skin cells faster, so I&#x27;m sure that had a lot to do with</li>
            <li> In the case of the Ultra Overnight, even though you&#x27;re supposed to use this just prior to retiring for the night, i&#x27;ve washed up and mulled around for a few hours around the house and surprisingly have not encountered the typical dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly clear 30ish skin with occasional pimples.</li>
            <li> After several weeks our 14 year old is not seeing any results, has given up on the product and moved on to something else.</li>
            <li> So far we&#x27;ve found only 1 OTC acne product that has worked for her</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big fan of the fragrance, though at least it is very mild and it doesn&#x27;t linger for too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 and have pretty clear skin but have small breakouts everynow and then.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a really nice wash and for those in need of overnight acne assistance you certainly can&#x27;t go wrong giving this a try.</li>
            <li> Actually, at this moment I seem to have acquired four large, red pimples in painfully obvious places, and that&#x27;s not normal for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin had a noticeable improvement over the next 15 days after I started using it and during this period I consumed more sugar than I normally do which usually affects my skin in a negative way.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it has microbeads makes it feel like it does a good job cleansing, but with only 2% salicylic acid, I can&#x27;t see it doing major repair work if you have a bad case of acne.  </li>
            <li> SCRUB didn&#x27;t lather too much and had larger granules than say Pro-Activ Face Wash, and it has that odd smell like medicinal perfume.</li>
            <li> I woke up that next morning, and every morning after that I have been using it, with less new bumps and my skin was so extremely and fantastically soft</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and over-the-counter (OTC) products typically irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I got this cream and other Clearasil products when I was having some strange skin reactions on my face and right now, they have all cleared up, thank heavens, but I am not entirely sure what did the trick.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product is going to get mixed reviews just like every other facial scrub on the market.  </li>
            <li> I takes a really long time to get started working.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this if it&#x27;s cheaper than the other face scrubs.</li>
            <li> I have had difficulty with acne and other facial blemishes on and off throughout my life.</li>
            <li> She states that it also makes her skin dry.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t get all patchy and dry</li>
            <li> My last attempt at using a Salicylic Acid (as active ingredient) product was with Neutrogena&#x27;s Grapefruit Body Scrub.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily and whenever a blemish shows up during the day it&#x27;s usually gone by the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past, whenever i&#x27;ve used washes with Salicylic Acid as the active ingredient (in this particular wash it contains 2% which is fairly typical of such products) i typically experience dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and while I had a little peeling, it wasn&#x27;t the same sort of irritated, dry flaking I&#x27;ve had with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin as much as other products containing 2% salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t use it everyday, which would be too drying for my skin type -- normal/oily combination -- and so I would use it every two to three days and only once a day.</li>
            <li> I would have to express my disappointment in this product, although the packaging is fine and it does slightly improve the skin.</li>
            <li> I like that this scrub does not smell medicated like other products.</li>
            <li> His acne has not progressed, and it has improved as well as it does with other products when he remembers to use them.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this, I&#x27;ve had numerous pimples, both large and painful and smaller whitehead ones.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product is average.  </li>
            <li> However, on a cyclical cycle I do get small quasi-break-outs that usually appear as red spots on my chin and T zone.</li>

            <li> This product made a slight improvement to the skin but did not produce the desired clearing up of the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually I&#x27;ll breakout with one or two small to medium sized pimples that would take about a week to clear up, sometimes leaving a mark behind.</li>
            <li> but probably no better than any other scrub/cleanser on the market.</li>
            <li> In fact, my face still feels a little oily when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Our duaghter has a persistent cluster of little white-heads on her forehead.  </li>
            <li> I have used quite a few acne preparations over the years.  </li>
            <li> It is not as thick as my other scrubs and I like that.</li>
            <li> That was so irritating that the thought of trying yet another one had me a little anxious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> one complaint,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was not the miracle product I was looking for, yet it did work as well as other things we have tried.  </li>
            <li> We were hopeful, and I wish we could say we had seen \\&quot;something\\&quot; improved at least, but alas we cannot.</li>
            <li> it seems as though it&#x27;s making it a bit worse.</li>
            <li> If a product must be scented, why not something faint and herbal like peppermint or lavender?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My son has started getting acne this year and the first thing I wanted to try was Clearasil.  THe Ultra Overnight really works wonders.  After 2 days of using it I could see a big difference in his face.  Now he uses it each night instead of every once in a while and the acne stays away.  The girls are starting to notice as well.</li>
            <li> After several weeks our 14 year old is not seeing any results, has given up on the product and moved on to something else. We were hopeful, and I wish we could say we had seen \\&quot;something\\&quot; improved at least, but alas we cannot. He did not have any adverse effects from the product, as others have stated here, like redness or irritation, but it just didn&#x27;t work for him :(  All bodies are different, results cannot be the same for everyone.  We thank Amazon for the opportunity to test and review this product for their  Vine program.</li>
            <li> I have fairly clear 30ish skin with occasional pimples. I do have a problem with my very fair skin having uneven skin tone. However, on a cyclical cycle I do get small quasi-break-outs that usually appear as red spots on my chin and T zone. This product promises reduced redness overnight, which just didn&#x27;t happen for me. Nor did I find that it exfoliates. Rather, I think that when I use this I actually had more skin irritation. This is one of those situations where individual response is going to vary so much. However if you have sensitive skin that is fair (and hence shows up every little variation in color) - I cannot recommend it based on MY experience, but it may be just right for someone younger with more regular break-outs. I have had excellent luck with weekly use of [[ASIN:B003UZ4R24 Boscia Luminizing Black Mask 2.8 oz]].</li>
            <li> I have used several scrubs over the years and this has to be one of the best for the suggested retail price.  If you have the $$$ then I would suggest purchasing a premium brand such as Kiehls or Pangea Organics, but if you are working on a budget then this Clearasil Ulta Overnight gives you a nice bang for the buck.  The scrub is soft yet feels like a scrub and is easily applied to your face and neck area.  Following your nightly cleanse its good to use a non-greasy formula moisturizer  to help lock in the cleansing affect.  My skin had a noticeable improvement over the next 15 days after I started using it and during this period I consumed more sugar than I normally do which usually affects my skin in a negative way.  All in all this is a good product and worth the shot.</li>
            <li> Clearasil&#x27;s Ultra Overnight Scrub claims to provide &#x27;visibly, clearer skin and reduced pimple redness overnight.&#x27;  The whole &#x27;overnight&#x27; aspect of this particular wash has to do with its purported special formulation that works continuously through the night while your skin is in the process of cellular regeneration.  Regardless of its acne fighting claims this is actually a fairly decent night time face wash that has a pleasant scent and a rich, buttery feel to it that feels nothing like acne washes i&#x27;ve used in the past.  In the past, whenever i&#x27;ve used washes with Salicylic Acid as the active ingredient (in this particular wash it contains 2% which is fairly typical of such products) i typically experience dry skin.  In the case of the Ultra Overnight, even though you&#x27;re supposed to use this just prior to retiring for the night, i&#x27;ve washed up and mulled around for a few hours around the house and surprisingly have not encountered the typical dry skin.  Overall this is a really nice wash and for those in need of overnight acne assistance you certainly can&#x27;t go wrong giving this a try.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try and improve my rosacea which causes redness, especially on my nose, and occasional persistent pimples.  I enjoy using it, it foams and feels like its really getting my skin clean and I like the smell.  I have been using it at night for about two weeks and my skin is much better - not totally back to normal but definitely getting there.  Will continue to use it and post a progress report when I&#x27;ve finished the tube.  I have tried many things before including prescription Metrogel, as well as Prosacea (from Amazon)which did not help.  The best thing up til now has been A &amp; D ointment which also helped to hide the redness but this product is more effective.  I think the exfoliating qualities of the cleanser are also good for brightening up my old skin in general - it just looks better all around.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 15 and has had problems with acne so when this offered in the Vine program I decided to get it. Well it&#x27;s been more than 2 weeks and there has been no improvement. She uses it as directed and instead of clearing up her face it seems as though it&#x27;s making it a bit worse. She states that it also makes her skin dry. I know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different so don&#x27;t let my review discourage you from getting it. What didn&#x27;t work for her might verily work for you. So far we&#x27;ve found only 1 OTC acne product that has worked for her and we may just stick with that. [[ASIN:B001GIOW36 Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Control Kit]]</li>
            <li> The CLEARASIL ULTRA OVERNIGHT SCRUB didn&#x27;t keep me from breaking-out but it did seem to make the pimples go away quicker than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I&#x27;ll breakout with one or two small to medium sized pimples that would take about a week to clear up, sometimes leaving a mark behind. After using the SCRUB for about 2 months, I noticed that the pimples didn&#x27;t last as long and that probably has to do with the salicylic acid that causes the skin to breakdown and repair itself faster, basically shedding dead skin cells faster, so I&#x27;m sure that had a lot to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use it everyday, which would be too drying for my skin type -- normal/oily combination -- and so I would use it every two to three days and only once a day. BTW, I also use an SPF moisturizer in the day time to combat dryness and to protect from UV rays because your skin tends to be hypersensitive to sunlight while using these types of products. If you have a sensitivity to salicylic acid this could be too drying for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SCRUB didn&#x27;t lather too much and had larger granules than say Pro-Activ Face Wash, and it has that odd smell like medicinal perfume. Anyway, if you don&#x27;t like the abrasive scrubs CLEARASIL also has [[ASIN:B004MKEGWM Clearasil Ultra Acne + Marks Wash and Mask: 6.78 OZ]], but I found that one to be really drying until my skin adjusted to it.</li>
            <li> I got this cream and other Clearasil products when I was having some strange skin reactions on my face and right now, they have all cleared up, thank heavens, but I am not entirely sure what did the trick. I do know that I did not use this product too many times. It is just a good scrub. I have used it before bed and it cleans the face, there is no reaction, no chemicals that have caused me any sensitivity issues so that&#x27;s good, and the smell is fairly nice. I use a toner and then apply lotion after using it. It is not as thick as my other scrubs and I like that. It&#x27;s more diluted but it still has the right scrubbing feeling. I&#x27;d say try it. The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Here is my brief review:  Scent - Perfume like, a bit too sweet in my opinion, I prefer \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; scent, like soap etc  Texture - OK, on the oily/heavy side  Grains - good! more than in other similar products  Results - to be honest, except for me feeling cleaner, I never really see results from these products.  Hope you&#x27;ll find this helpful :)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and over-the-counter (OTC) products typically irritate my skin. This did not. This Clearasil scrub feels good, smells good and actually works. However, it is definitely not a cure for acne, especially for a woman&#x27;s monthly breakouts. That&#x27;s just life. It&#x27;s also not as great as some prescriptions I&#x27;ve used in the past. But for an OTC product, I say it&#x27;s worth trying. It makes your face feel fresh and clean. And the smell makes you feel happy before going to sleep which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this OTC product. I will say, be realistic: acne is normally a lifelong problem, but it can be controlled with a great skin care regimen. Every 2-3 months, I change my regimen so that my skin never becomes resistant to any product or combination of products I use. I also change my pillowcase every night before bed. This scrub may not be prescription strength, but it is worth a try!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife who has occasional mild acne.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work like the product said it would but she found that when she used it, any acne was gone or reduced by the morning.  It also is a great scrub that really seems to get the skin clean.</li>
            <li> Those are two promises that this scrub makes, and after a couple of weeks I haven&#x27;t seen those results.  Actually, at this moment I seem to have acquired four large, red pimples in painfully obvious places, and that&#x27;s not normal for me.  (I don&#x27;t think this scrub caused them, of course, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping the situation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big fan of the fragrance, though at least it is very mild and it doesn&#x27;t linger for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub is not greasy and not drying.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good at exfoliating as other scrubs I&#x27;ve used.  But the remarkable thing--and the reason I&#x27;ll keep using it--is that this is the first 2% salicylic acid product I&#x27;ve used that hasn&#x27;t left my face red and feeling burned.  I don&#x27;t have the promised improvement \\&quot;overnight\\&quot;, but maybe over a bit more time it will make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/4/11: Five weeks is enough.  I&#x27;ve seen no improvement, and in fact seem to be breaking out a bit more now than I was before.  (I&#x27;m thinking of naming the flame-red lump on the tip of my nose \\&quot;Bertha\\&quot;.)  I&#x27;m done with this scrub, and it&#x27;s back to soap and water for me.</li>
            <li> I like that this scrub does not smell medicated like other products. It is a gentle, yet effective exfoliant. It isn&#x27;t too abrasive. It left my skin looking and feeling cleaner and healthier.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few acne preparations over the years.  My last attempt at using a Salicylic Acid (as active ingredient) product was with Neutrogena&#x27;s Grapefruit Body Scrub.  That was so irritating that the thought of trying yet another one had me a little anxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in the shower, on my face, neck, and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited for the redness and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;But I woke up that next morning, and every morning after that I have been using it, with less new bumps and my skin was so extremely and fantastically soft and it didn&#x27;t get all patchy and dry and while I had a little peeling, it wasn&#x27;t the same sort of irritated, dry flaking I&#x27;ve had with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this came in a bigger tube as I am using it all over.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance. It has a fragrance that reminds me of those floral scented nail polish removers, albeit not as strong.  The fragrance does dissipate with rinsing and drying off (thankfully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep up with this for the next few weeks and see if breakouts are diminished more than just the week long adjustment to a new medication/treatment.  I would love for this to work better than my 5% benzoyl peroxide foam (the bleaching of everything drives me a little bananas).... I will update once I give this a longer run.</li>
            <li> Clearasil Ultra Overnight Scrup has a pleasing texture that includes exfoliating beads. I&#x27;ve used the product for a few weeks and it works very well. It fights redness and clears up blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint, and I find it to be pretty significant, is the product&#x27;s smell. For the life of me, I don&#x27;t understand why each and every skin product has to be scented. I don&#x27;t need my overnight acne medicine to be perfumed! It&#x27;s distracting and gets in the way of my sleep. If a product must be scented, why not something faint and herbal like peppermint or lavender?</li>
            <li> I found this scrub refreshing for my adult acne prone skin.  It has a pleasant smell but that is not over powering.  It washes off easily leaving my skin feeling refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> My 13-year old daughter uses this product and it does work, but, in her words \\&quot; kind of works. I takes a really long time to get started working. it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing.\\&quot;  She uses it nightly.  She also said that it makes her skin smooth, but \\&quot;it kinda burns when you first out it on.\\&quot;  It could be that it&#x27;s too strong for her skin.</li>
            <li> This lightly scented scrub worked well on my oily skin and I did not experience any allergic reactions (and I&#x27;m quite sensitive to products like this). The scrub leaves your face feeling refreshed and noticeably clearer the next morning. The scrub lathers quickly and easily and and rinses right off. My skin seems less oily and feels better.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product is going to get mixed reviews just like every other facial scrub on the market.  Some people swear my certain products, while others see no benefit in them.  My experience with this product is average.  I enjoy it as a facial cleanser, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it miraculously cleared up my skin.  The fact that it has microbeads makes it feel like it does a good job cleansing, but with only 2% salicylic acid, I can&#x27;t see it doing major repair work if you have a bad case of acne.  It does leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed, and I found the very light scent to be pleasant.  My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry or flakey after using, so if you have skin with mild imperfections or occasional breakouts, it may work well for you - but probably no better than any other scrub/cleanser on the market.</li>
            <li> It works well as a scrub. The abrasive compound is relatively fine and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as St Ives Apricot Scrub (SIAS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per wash, I need approx 2 teaspoons or a blob the size of a quarter. That&#x27;s kind of a lot. I&#x27;m running through the tube pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to do some magic overnight while you sleep because your skin is different at night. I don&#x27;t buy it. I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement over the SIAS I had been using. In fact, my face still feels a little oily when I&#x27;m done. Never had that issue with SIAS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Most face scrubs are the same to me. I would only recommend this if it&#x27;s cheaper than the other face scrubs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 and have pretty clear skin but have small breakouts everynow and then. I&#x27;ve been using the scrub for 3 weeks now and it really does clear up blemishes overnight. I use it daily and whenever a blemish shows up during the day it&#x27;s usually gone by the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is left feeling very soft. The scrub has exfoliating beads in it but the scrub is so creamy that the beads don&#x27;t feel too harsh and it washes off cleanly. I will definitely be purchasing this product when my current supply runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this scrub if you are prone to frequeny break outs.</li>
            <li> This scrub has microbeads which do seem to help exfoliate the skin. The 2% salicylic acid is supposed to help with the pimples. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t really tell a difference between using this product and a good quality soap. I&#x27;ve had new breakouts while using this scrub, so I don&#x27;t have much confidence in their claims. On a positive note, I do like it simply as a scrub - it seems to leave on a moisturizing layer even after rinsing, so it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin as much as other products containing 2% salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> OK, so I have not personally used it ... don&#x27;t have much use for it, but here is what my wife has to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearasil is great for teenagers. If used consistently every night, it does clear up light acne. When first applying, it feels very light and doesn&#x27;t make your face feel like it is cleaning, but overnight, it is working. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for adults, but more for teenagers that have acne.  Our duaghter has a persistent cluster of little white-heads on her forehead.  This is the only product that made them go away.</li>
            <li> Given the name \\&quot;overnight scrub,\\&quot; I was expecting something you would leave on your skin overnight.  Instead, this is just a cleanser to use at night time.  I don&#x27;t know why one couldn&#x27;t use it in the morning as well.  I gve this cleanser a try on my normal, not-dry-not-oily skin.  It felt good and left my skin clean and refreshed.  Surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t leave it feeling tight or dry like other or cleansers that target acne.  I can&#x27;t vouch that it really improved the color of my skin, but it did leave it clean and oil-free in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product made a slight improvement to the skin but did not produce the desired clearing up of the skin. I would have to express my disappointment in this product, although the packaging is fine and it does slightly improve the skin. I was expecting greater results though, so I can&#x27;t recommend this product with a lot of enthusiasm.</li>
            <li> I have had difficulty with acne and other facial blemishes on and off throughout my life. I was hoping this would help with my acne outbreaks without drying out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, I had to stop using it after 2 weeks. My face started becoming extremely itchy, irritated, and dry almost immediately. I thought maybe my face would adjust so I continued using it. But then I started waking up scratching my face like crazy. I don&#x27;t have what you would call sensitive skin. In addition, I did not see any improvements in my skin. Granted, I did only get to use it for 2 weeks. But I would have thought if it was working I would have started to see some improvement, however slight.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I have to say I would not recommend this product. Of course, it is totally possible that it would work for someone else.</li>
            <li> Great product, cleans my skin well without leaving a greasy feeling and does not over dry my skin. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> My son has suffered from acne on his forehead since becoming a teenager. I was excited for him to try this Clearasil Ultra Overnight Scrub.  Unfortunately, it was not the miracle product I was looking for, yet it did work as well as other things we have tried.  His acne has not progressed, and it has improved as well as it does with other products when he remembers to use them.</li>
            <li> This product contains tiny exfoliating granules that leave my skin clean, smooth and softer than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be the perfect cleanser except after using it I&#x27;ve broken out. I&#x27;m an adult with no history of blemish problems. I get one or two a year with the use of a cleanser and astringent, both of which are in this product. After a few weeks of using this, I&#x27;ve had numerous pimples, both large and painful and smaller whitehead ones. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never had an adverse reaction to a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my skin feels immediately after using this product, but it seems as though teh exfoliating granuales are clogging my pores. I won&#x27;t be continuing use.</li>
