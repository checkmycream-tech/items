            <li>I love this wonderful, perfumed oil.  </li>
            <li>You are better off trying  the samples of perfumes, colognes,and body oils in person at the stores before you make a purchase to see which one is best for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a staple, it just smells warm and delicious and clean and perfect!</li>
            <li>When I started wearing this scent over a decade ago it was a wonderfully pleasant, pungent scent with staying power; one that I could smell throughout the day and even on my sweaters after wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a pleasant and non-overpowering way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li>I had to laugh!!!!</li>
            <li>Smells like I took a very strong incense stick and rubbed it all over me!</li>
            <li>I loved it but the seller ran out.</li>

            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell good then &amp; it doesn&#x27;t smell good now.</li>
            <li>I gave it to a friend who loved it.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It was shipped in a timely fashion and all that good stuff.</li>
            <li>I never knew a oil could smell so good.  </li>
            <li>You will smell,look and feel good.  </li>
            <li>Good service provided.</li>

            <li>good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good change of pace.</li>
            <li>Have always loved this oil,  Everyone comments how clean and wonderful I smell.</li>
            <li>Have you corrected your formula for Egyptian Goddess into it&#x27;s original WONDERFUL pungent smell?!?!  </li>
            <li>when they are up close the Egyptian Goddess works the rest of the magic and your skin will smell so good all night!</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and has a rich yet feminine smell.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I would love to recommend this scent to everyone, but I&#x27;m torn because I don&#x27;t want everyone to smell like me!</li>

            <li>Lovely scent!</li>
            <li>but this is quite possibly my favorite find!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something more remarkable.</li>
            <li>My favorite oil ever!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of Egyptian Musk!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It has been my favorite scent!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>love the smell of it!</li>
            <li>and I will be orderering more soon!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild, great if you are like me and can&#x27;t stand 90% of all the perfumes out there.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>I am more of a bright fragrance person</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This smells so amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, I am always asked what I am wearing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>so I was sweating, and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing scent.  </li>
            <li>Shipped with amazing timing.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil because of the reviews that I saw saying how amazing it smelled.</li>
            <li>You get a good amount of this product for the money, and after reading a ton of rave reviews for the scent online I was convinced that I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s warm and inviting.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and it very alluring.</li>
            <li>but surprisingly others are able to still smell it on me.</li>
            <li>But everyone agreed it smelled nice.</li>
            <li>but my mother liked it if mixing it with musk</li>
            <li>This fragrance is a nice start  </li>
            <li>But anyways, it was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but not to light because I can still smell it throughout the day especially if it&#x27;s a warm day.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the love scent.</li>
            <li>So if you like fragrance that isn&#x27;t overwhelming then this might be a good one for you.</li>
            <li>Great price order more than one :)</li>
            <li>This kind of defeats the purpose of applying a scent at all.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a bit more, but it was good too.</li>
            <li>Honestly it smells like a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I liked the way this smells in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It did warm as I rubbed my wrists together.</li>
            <li>Excellent and fast shipping</li>
            <li>which, imo, is kinda nice.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice...</li>
            <li>had to have my own.</li>
            <li>The bottle was shipped nicely and came in one piece and rolls</li>
            <li>Nice smell it won&#x27;t have women all over you as it is often sold as a compliment to men pheromones cologne however for the price</li>
            <li>I honestly think that it&#x27;s a hit or miss with this product (Egyptian Goddess).</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Shaunna for an awesome gift!</li>
            <li>I love this smell and it smells so good on me</li>
            <li>I have used Egyptian Goddess for many years and everytime I wear it, I get many many compliments, men and women both come up and ask what I&#x27;m wearing!!</li>
            <li>Very.. strong and kind of musky.</li>
            <li>Anyway, my point is simple--this is a great scent that&#x27;s easy to fall in love with.</li>
            <li>So, for awhile I was ordering it from a place in California which always had great prices and sweet thank</li>
            <li>I LOVE this oil, it smells fantastic and is my very favorite body oil!  </li>
            <li>All i can say it is amazing, I&#x27;m in my early twenties and its a very great mixture for everyone of all ages.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and easy to carry around in the roller bottle.</li>
            <li>Great price and quick turn around.</li>
            <li>Have repurchased many, many times!</li>
            <li>This oil is so amazing &amp; smells more lushious as time goes on but never overpowering.</li>
            <li>This is a nice smelling oil, I am not in love with it.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing egyptian musk for a while and by far this is one of the best scent oil out there.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, soft, feminine roll-on perfume oil.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best...</li>
            <li>By far the BEST fragrance ever.</li>
            <li>A beautiful natural fragrance, the perfect sweet aroma, fast deliver, great seller.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special.</li>
            <li>It can easily be 5 stars if the company makes it stronger!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>This causes most perfumes to smell very overwhelming on her (breathtakingly strong).</li>
            <li>its just ok like of not as natural smelling as I wish, bit potent bit nice..not best though</li>
            <li>It is a very sexy scent on my wife, yes it starts out light</li>
            <li>Very light-</li>
            <li>People would stop me and ask me what do I have on because the scent is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Good thing that the price is good ( except s&amp;h are high)  </li>
            <li>My order of Egyptian Musk oil arrived quickly and in good shape...</li>
            <li>Light, refreshing, and reminds me of spring weather!</li>
            <li>I really love the smell, it is very light and sensual,thing is you can&#x27;t smell it anymore after 30 min,</li>
            <li>Nice light, fresh, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a subtle musty and beautiful scent that is perfect for any season.</li>
            <li>Huge bummer!</li>
            <li>my fav &amp; so glad I found it</li>
            <li>I also love the roller ball better than sprays as you have more control of the amount applied and the location</li>
            <li>I will definately be order more.</li>
            <li>If you put it on your wrists before you go out in the evening, you&#x27;ll wake up the next morning still smelling wonderful!</li>

            <li>So happy I found this because Whole Foods no longer carries this line of body oil.</li>

            <li>I just hope it smells better as time goes on.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Goddess is my FAVORITE scent.</li>
            <li>Shipping was okay.</li>
            <li>We run quality control checks on all of our perfumes before we bottle them to be sure that the blends are within our acceptable fragrance range.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with this scent.</li>
            <li>although I love the Egytiian scent.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered him more.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Goddess is a version of the famous Egyptian Musk Body Oil but like its parent they have been diluted into non-scents(sic).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love all of the oils except the Auric Blend.  </li>
            <li>and I could not believe how many people wanted to hug me and the commits they gave me</li>
            <li>If you like Egyptian musk, you will love this.  </li>
            <li>I really love the smell of this body oil.</li>

            <li>I LOVE this scent..</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Not the exotic smell</li>
            <li>Amazon being a reliable and great source to purchase items from at a reasonable price, should choose not to sell the product.</li>
            <li>Auric Blends smells more like Juicy or Baby Phat oil.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and THIS is probably our favorite.</li>
            <li>Have never had an oil that gets so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did .</li>

            <li>I love that it&#x27;s an oil and that it is a roll-on...</li>
            <li>While this buyer adores many Musk oils, this is not one of them.  </li>

            <li>There is someting captivating about this scent.  </li>
            <li>All most missed the anniversary this year, but this got me out of it.</li>
            <li>Was my favorite go-to perfume, I even preferred it over perfumes I owned that were hundreds of dollars more.  </li>
            <li>Smells okay.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still in love with it.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day but isn&#x27;t overpowering like so many oils are.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>It replaced my favorite Ralph Lauren scent.</li>
            <li>I love it, and would recommend it for anyone to try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>otherwise love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the Auric Blends oils.  </li>
            <li>lovely smell.</li>
            <li>it smells exotic and regal.</li>
            <li>There are many people here raving about this  and many receiving bottles with no smell .</li>
            <li>I love Auric Blends Egypitan Goddess oil.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin at all, it sits on top, so don&#x27;t let your clothes touch it.</li>
            <li>It smells ok.</li>
            <li>but the more I wear it the better it gets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tons of Egyptian musk/goddess but this one is my favorite blend.</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Now, I smell yummy, too.  :-)</li>
            <li>The scent that people described as &#x27;sexy&#x27; was not even close to the word.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t appealing to me at all</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>When I applied it I got a headache, wish I had been  able to contact seller before purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was an inexpensive purchase, but I&#x27;ll stick with the one I was using before.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Goddess seemed to be much more fragrant.</li>
            <li>So yes, I can&#x27;t stand the smell, but I do love Auric Blends Body Oils.  </li>
            <li>I just did a review on one of these but on the Love scent...</li>
            <li>Non-stop compliments from mostly men but women as well</li>
            <li>My most favorite scent of all time - including the $120 an ounce perfume from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>was immediately intrigued with the exotic scents and names.</li>
            <li>sure whether there is any truth to the oils being &#x27;diluted&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and all the smiles.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite perfume oils.</li>

            <li>back-into-the-head potent to affect you.&amp;#34</li>

            <li>Smells good, but too much</li>

            <li>LOL I am excited because people always ask me what I am wearing or is that my natural scent!</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it, it smelled wonderful, but thereafter, I can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li>It can easily be 5 stars if the company makes it stronger!this.</li>
            <li>Not musky or strong like nag champa or patchouli.  </li>
            <li>It is too strong, it reminds me Shalimar fragrance</li>
            <li>Anyway you DO NOT need to use a lot or people might gag because it IS strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too strong.</li>
            <li>seems like it is not as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li>scent is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>and you know if you can smell yourself, it is too strong.  </li>
            <li>She had noticed her newer bottle not being as strong also.  </li>
            <li>,I didn&#x27;t like it much,a bit too strong for my taste</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as strong as it was when I opened it</li>
            <li>Omg, I loved this stuff when I was in high school.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell and it is very mild and sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>Fragrance was nice at first and then seemed to disappear.</li>
            <li>Altogether no a bad product, the reason I gave three stare is because the oil seemed to heat and put out even more of a sent than what I wanted</li>
            <li>Not a bad muskiness, but more of a warmer depth to the flowery smell.</li>
            <li>I have used it for over half of my life, and this company makes the best blend.</li>
            <li>They used to mix the scented oils with your choice of lotion and this quickly became my favorite.</li>
            <li>It goes quickly so stock up!</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>Smells light and floral to me,not to strong.</li>
            <li>Very sensual and makes me feel sexy!</li>
            <li>Love this perfume oil so much!!</li>
            <li>I often wondered what in the world cheap deodorant woman were wearing in NYC</li>
            <li>I decided to buy it again since it used to be a great product and now the scent is completely different.</li>
            <li>I just recieved my bottle today, I am EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THIS OIL, I have been wearing egyptian musk for years, the first bottle that I had purchased years ago, smelled exactly like this egyptian goddess, have not been able to find this scent now that I have , I will purchase more, pls don&#x27;t change this scent.</li>
            <li>Come on ladies, isn&#x27;t it fabulous when strangers stop you and say &amp;#34;you smell like a goddess&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would enjoy something with \\&quot;musk\\&quot; in it&#x27;s description,  </li>
            <li>It smells like cheap dollar store perfume.</li>
            <li>I know it was cheap</li>
            <li>I read the reviews about this fragrance oil, some said it was too light and others said that when it warms up the fragrance gets stronger as it warms up.</li>
            <li>I found that it was a bit light for me</li>
            <li>Heard such great reviews about the smell</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the scent, but I couldn&#x27;t even smell it 30 minutes after application.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but makes an impression, I&#x27;ve had people follow me after they passed by to ask what it is i&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
            <li>It is a light scent.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, it has a fresh smell &amp; it&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
            <li>The Sceny is to light  </li>
            <li>As it warms on the skin, it evolves into an earthy light, floral musk.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented so it&#x27;s nothing that will make you sneeze.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a perfume to wear lightly.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and last all day.</li>
            <li>But, happily, it was just the opposite!  </li>
            <li>Perfect if you don&#x27;t like too heavy a smell.</li>
            <li>Light yet sensual.</li>
            <li>But I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It last all day and I get great complaints.  </li>
            <li>Feminine, light.</li>
            <li>I waited awhile and put a good amount more on the same spot.  </li>
            <li>and I love the fact that she smells good all day especially up close.</li>
            <li>Such a good buy :)</li>
            <li>and it is just NOT the same as the wonderful ones I could always buy at Whole Foods in Atlanta, GA.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and a lovely sweet scent.</li>
            <li>It fits right in your makeup kit and it makes you feel sexy wearing it.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the African Musk and Rose oils, which I also liked very much, but the Egyptian Goddess is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly how I remembered!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>VERY MUSKY!!!</li>
            <li>The oil is a very nice scent, especially after showering.</li>
            <li>The scent lingers all day and it is a lovely fresh, clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Very clean, fresh.</li>
            <li>Its a light clean scent and every where I go</li>
            <li>The service was quick and my product arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This particular scent is nice, not as aggressive as patchouli.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like super strong smells.</li>
            <li>I cannot get enough of this body oil, I wish it came in a huge bottle I love love love this</li>
            <li>I was hopping to love this scent, but it smelled really synthetic and overly strong.</li>
            <li>(Their white musk is amazing too, by the way!)  </li>
            <li>Originally bought a couple of these for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to put these in some stockings because I wear it</li>
            <li>When im hot in summer it doesnt wear off it brings out scent more.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Smelled nothing like what I&#x27;m familiar with.  </li>
            <li>I got 2 of these without trying them first and was so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this oil in the past and absolutely loved it!!!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this purchase, based on the one Egyptian musk I&#x27;ve used (not this one) and all the raves this one gets.  </li>
            <li>The original order of Auric Blends</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this oil after reading all the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>Have got many compliments, Very inexpensive!</li>
            <li>It smells nothing like the original brand scent.  </li>
            <li>I opened it up and was so excited... unroll the wrapping..</li>
            <li>Unique smell that lasts day.</li>
            <li>My friends think that this perfume has been diluted or weakened in some way from the original she bought.  </li>
            <li>The sent is clean and smells for hours.  </li>
            <li>I just knew it smelled like clean laundry, so I googled around till I was convinced this product was what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I like the clean</li>
            <li>best description would be old powder that back in the day women used to coat themselves in.</li>
            <li>It has an amazing scent that only gets better as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft and sexy it is.</li>
            <li>I ordered it from Amazon instead of Auric Blends website because their website doesn&#x27;t seem safe enough to make purchases on honestly.</li>
            <li>However, to my pleasant surprise, when I got my bottle of EG in the mail, I opened it, put it on, and the smell was obviously present.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes me feel special.</li>
            <li>The bottle of Egyptian Goddess Body Oil roll on I received was nothing special.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li>I have purchased several of the different oils, most smell very nice and sexy</li>
            <li>I was super excited when I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li>Its strange that this is one of the most popular scents by Auric Blends.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance also lasts without fade much longer than most I have purchased in my life.  </li>
            <li>This is a very different smell, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>Gave this as a gift and it is true that is does change with each persons body chemistry.</li>
            <li>It is very floral, and almost overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This scent linger a soft and warm.  </li>
            <li>Not overpowering, so no headaches and very clean.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not my favorite, but good enough to wear until I find the one.</li>
            <li>It came in a Big box with one in it and pkg good.</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to respond: )  </li>
            <li>Nice replacement for the old egyptian musks.  </li>
            <li>I honestly love this one very much.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Love the scent so much...</li>
            <li>I was really nervous buying something I have not smelled but every review seems to say that people love the sent on them.</li>
            <li>On me it is this sultry scent, slightly sweet but not \\&quot;preteen body</li>
            <li>spray\\&quot; sweet.</li>
            <li>It is a light fresh scent that is a touch grassy with a hint of muskness (muskness?)</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Egyptian musk, but after years and years I had finally run out of oil.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and same scent as always.</li>
            <li>It smells really good on her and seems to last all day on her.  </li>
            <li>It definitely smells just as good as that pricey stuff you can get at passion parties.</li>
            <li>This stuff is sweet yet musky.</li>
            <li>~good~~good~~~i am a fastidious about smelling, but I really like this:)</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t need to be sickly sweet or rolled-eyes-</li>
            <li>used to more sweet and floral scents so this is quite the change for me, but I am certainly adapting quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used all the other oils that I purchased and I knew they would be great, as they were.</li>
            <li>Also works great with other smells.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh n clean not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend likes it and it is so mild</li>
            <li>The oil is great, but my hubs can only smell it on me if he gets really close.</li>
            <li>Amazon along with the many outstanding sellers on Amazon make is possible.</li>
            <li>However ,the product was packed well and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I definitely can understand the reviews that says it&#x27;s not as strong as it used to be, because it isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>This roll on bottle will last forever ;) thanks so much for this wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very fast service!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but the problem is that you can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li>At first, it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>I use the perfume and soap, this oil is a good addition to my favorite scent in the whole wide world.</li>
            <li>I usually wear the Rose, which is amazing, by the way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a light, clean, lovely scent when applied correctly.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting, beautiful scent!</li>
            <li>It may be alright for some people, but I really don&#x27;t prefer nor can stand smelling strongly of incense and my grandma.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it one last try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>I was realy excited about it at first until I opened it...</li>
            <li>Its a clean crisp smell.</li>
            <li>Very nice slightly musky but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The scent is warm and sexy without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li>cheap price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Womanly, fresh, sexy, light and something I can wear every day.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to enjoy this scent.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a few days, and smells great.</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday perfume I have been wearing this for along time and always get compliment on it..</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li>I put it on after my shower, and if I place it under my garments, it stays on and fresh for hours.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have been satisfied by this fragrant oil.</li>
            <li>but ifthe scent ever returns to how it should smell, please let me know as THAT is worth buying</li>
            <li>Smells fresh, stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Plus love is soft smell.</li>
            <li>If you could actually smell the scent, I think it would be nice.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and pleasing to me though.</li>
            <li>It was a breath of fresh air, and I had to find out what it was.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered it,but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Soft elegant scent.</li>
            <li>and I thought I was going to get a lovely scent, but it smells like an old woman.</li>
            <li>The only scent my boyfriend has liked and I&#x27;ve bought a lot of perfumes because I like variety</li>
            <li>but anyone who comes near me can smell it and they love it.</li>
            <li>The thing about it though is that it clings close to the skin because it is a soft smell, so I apply a lot on (under my ears, under my jaw, creases of my elbows, and my wrists) because if I don&#x27;t then the only way to smell it is by putting my wrists to my nose, lol.</li>
            <li>I rarely review things because I never have time</li>
            <li>It smells understated and powerful.</li>
            <li>It has a mild sweet smell that stays around for a while, which is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more potent but from other reviews</li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This item came super fast and it smells HEAVENLY!  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells great, lasts all day, is neither too strong nor weak</li>
            <li>so I can put it right</li>
            <li>This seller has the right scent-</li>
            <li>if that helps you decide if right for you.</li>
            <li>But, Amazon is always easier--especially since I purchase right from my phone.</li>
            <li>Try it out on yourself before deciding if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li>I ordered right away.  </li>
            <li>first few dabs smell great</li>
            <li>Personally, I like my EM to be more sweet and musky.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, but barely there, I have to put a ton on to smell it and hubby, who has a strong background in aromatherapy, could barely smell it either.  </li>
            <li>A very lovely scent for both young and mature ladies.</li>
            <li>Very feminine and clean scent.</li>
            <li>Not a bad frangrance -- definitely musky -- but not my favorite either.  </li>
            <li>if I put a little vanilla musk or coconut fragrance with it, it smells nice!</li>
            <li>The first thing we recommend is to allow the fragrance to sit for a coupleof weeks and see if it gets stronger as it ages because “fresh” blends haven’t been allowed the time for all the components to coalesce.  </li>
            <li>but the scent wasn&#x27;t sweet although I don&#x27;t think I really knew what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the real thing, better to opt for another brand, such as an Original Musk Oil.</li>
            <li>OK this is my absolute favorite perfume of all time it has such a clean sweet smell with light hidden notes</li>
            <li>way too strong and smells like old lady.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t wanna get in trouble with my girl, so it&#x27;s totally a 10/10 :D</li>
            <li>definitely had a great mood changing effect to my boyfriend, he smelled it and started cleaning the house ( which is totally unlike him).</li>
            <li>They FIRST thing he did was lean down to smell me and told me I smelled good.</li>
            <li>It was in such high demand, they could never stay on top of it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a warm, light, very slightly musky scent.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 bottles and not one of them smelled, very very dissatisfied</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because shipping was very fast and the scent doesn&#x27;t go away within 5 mins.</li>
            <li>I received this very fast.</li>
            <li>He could smell it, but I couldn&#x27;t smell it very much.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it smells like incense to me, or an earthy and warm scent, sometimes it smells like a fresh river, and other times it smells like a sensual massage oil with a bit of spice to it.</li>
            <li>It seems my review is not of the original scent and according to them, the original scent is far superior than the new watered down and altered scent which is what I have reviewed.</li>
            <li>I got this because of all the great reviews, but it hardly smells at all.......</li>
            <li>A lady at work uses this oil and told me how mild, long lasting and pleasant it is, so I bought it.</li>
            <li>This little one lasts for a long time and smells delicious.</li>
            <li>Very sultry!</li>
            <li>I purchased this out of curiosity, as it was my first body oil ever.</li>
            <li>I just prefer more musky oils, so it is probably just a personal bias.  </li>
            <li>Very well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Thiese arrived and I was totally dissapointed as this is my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This one is nice however, and has a lingering scent that changes sweet after a few hours.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in just 3 days and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This Egyptian Goddess blend is a great scent, but tends to be on the thick side, almost sticky when first applied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;m wondering if this scent, prior to the formula change about which many have posted, was actually quite lovely.</li>
            <li>It was to light of a smell as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>As of right now it smells like pure oil, no fragrance</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy a perfume until you can smell it first.</li>
            <li>Are you quite sure you are back to the smell of what Egyptian Goddess should be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time ordering this.</li>
            <li>Way better than spending $60-$100 on the same bottles of prime everyone else wears.</li>
            <li>I tried this scent for the first time at a bath and body shop.</li>
            <li>was my first experience with Auric Blends.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand of oils!</li>
            <li>and  it  was  exactly  the  smell</li>
            <li>This is may first time buying this one.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be repurchasing, hopefully the bottle lasts for a while :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of this oil, but I think the solid perfume&#x27;s scent lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this perfume for years, but this is the first time I bought from an internet vendor.</li>
            <li>So glad I finally chose to purchase this</li>
            <li>I find myself constantly sniffing my wrist and dabbing more on.  </li>
            <li>Wish it were an open top bottle or spray.  </li>
            <li>it got here pretty quicklly</li>
            <li>There it is, the scent was much stronger!</li>
            <li>And he really likes it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still interested in these oils</li>
            <li>This was the first time to use Egyptian Goddess Body Oil.  </li>
            <li>I would be willing to order it again.</li>
            <li>I am going to try a different seller to see if I have better chances.</li>
            <li>Especially when Amazon said I might not be able to receive this product until after Christmas....  </li>
            <li>the first night I had it on it</li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;ve only worn it twice, but it seems off to me, not at all feminine or sexy.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of the Egyptian Goddess Oil.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how exactly this works.</li>
            <li>(and unlike some other reviewers I&#x27;ve had no issues with being able to smell it!)</li>
            <li>I ordered the Rasta oil too, and that one smelled only slighty better.</li>
            <li>This unfortunately, is not that.</li>
            <li>However I am updating my review still love the product however company offered me 10% off my next amazon order and did not follow through</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying fragrances online anymore without smelling and trying them first.</li>
            <li>The smell was different to me at first, but let your body chemistry get use to it, and you will fall in love with smell.</li>
            <li>I find myself not having to reapply, and I smell it on me all day pretty much!</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume oil for the last 10+ years.</li>
            <li>I put some on my wrist to test it when I first got it and</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients and chemical free</li>
            <li>I more than likely won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li>It did when I first opened the bottle , now I can&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
            <li>She had bought it locally the first time, but had found it on Amazon at a much better rate.  </li>
            <li>I also ordered more about a year ago and they were not the same either.  </li>
            <li>but I will most definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>I have many skin allergies (certain soaps and metals such as nickel), but this didn&#x27;t cause me any problems.</li>
            <li>bought this for my wife on a whim because I liked the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>It mixes with my natural scent for a unique aroma.</li>
            <li>This however enhances my own scent and make me feel sensual without making other people in the elevator cough and sneeze.  </li>
            <li>it smells clean and soft and is the richest I put a dab on and</li>
            <li>-a light scent of mixed fresh flowers yet a hint of sweetness&lt;</li>
            <li>I bought this because the reviews on here were so positive.</li>
            <li>I have nothing but positive feedback.  </li>
            <li>Can blend easily with other essential oil to create your own signature scent.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this product and it is my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; and one vial lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>,so be aware of how much you put on because it does go as long as 10hours or more there(even after shower).</li>
            <li>At first I really didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>When you first smell Egyptian Goddess from the roller, there isn&#x27;t much smell.</li>
            <li>Which is what this pretty much is.  </li>
            <li>My other really smells nice , and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>It pretty much just smells like oil now.</li>
            <li>I love this smell, it&#x27;s so subtle but sexy.</li>
            <li>I had such high expectations for this scent based on the many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Goes on a little strong, but mellows out quickly and even though I can&#x27;t smell it, others compliment me on it all day!  </li>
            <li>My bottle came with the new design and full label on it instead of the older design that had the painted feathers on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I used it after showers and its very refreshing,  Not strong or had a lingering aroma.</li>
            <li>smells good, but the smell doesn&#x60;t last as long as it used to.</li>
            <li>It is just strong enough.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very different, musky and strong.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing scent, very mysterious, sexy, and alluring, yet soft and almost smoldering, and you only have to use a couple drops worth too.</li>
            <li>My search continues for the PURE Egyptian Musk Unisex Body Oils.</li>
            <li>It is pure Egyptian Musk oil...</li>
            <li>so I figured it&#x27;d be a cute small gift that someone could enjoy as much as I do.</li>
            <li>We try to ship only those batches that have had the time needed to age properly, but sometimes we find ourselves in a situation where the demand is greater than our supply and we must ship out what we have!  </li>
            <li>I literally get maybe two seconds of rolling the oil on my wrists (smells fine) and the scent disappears from whatever&#x27;s left in the vile.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is how quickly it has disappeared!</li>
            <li>And if they are simply contentselling this version, shame on them as they are robbing themselves of loyal customers (I know I am not alone!)</li>
            <li>It has a very soft and musky scent to it,I love it very much,wish I had a bigger bottle now.</li>
            <li>The smell was nice, but a little soapy, my boyfriend said it smelled like bathroom air freshener, which isn&#x27;t what I was going for.  </li>
            <li>The large bottle of Egyptian Goddess appeared one day and it was a bargain for such a huge size.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too heavy for my taste to wear during the day, but it&#x27;s perfect to wear out in the evening.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, but it&#x27;s kind of light and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other I got from the same company.</li>
            <li>Love it, subtle and sweet!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s certainly cheap enough, but as they say &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>Not so much...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s absolutely nothing goddess about this scent.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I say thanks to all who sell to us at A.com</li>
            <li>not to bash the company because they are making a quality product, but the smell is just way too much for me.</li>
            <li>Nothing absolutely nothing fragrance.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I really tried to like it but</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much she wears this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very Egyptian musty.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>thank you for the fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>They ship fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Much too musky,</li>
            <li>Its really a gamble.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for the smell</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be wearing this oil much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>I did not care for the powdery notes in this, as they really came out once it was on my skin and my warmth &amp;#34;activated&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am satisfied because it is what I expected.</li>
            <li>Everytime I wear this someone remarks on it and wants to know what it is.&lt;br /&gt;I will always recommend it.</li>
            <li>but men are really attracted to this smell.</li>
            <li>so i cant wear much</li>
            <li>My mother has very oily skin.</li>
            <li>No matter how much i put on, i end-up smelling myself all day</li>
            <li>brings me back to my college days...smells fantastic</li>
            <li>The roll on feature of the bottle keeps you from putting too much on too.</li>
            <li>I recommend for anyone looking for a simple light empowering fragrance.</li>
            <li>Definitely much stronger than the one I had smelled in the shop.</li>
            <li>Where can I get the real thing?</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really smell much of anything at all.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle scent with a really commanding presence, as if to say &amp;#34;I&#x27;m here</li>
            <li>This product has no fragrance I question if the retailer is even selling the real product.  </li>
            <li>Its subtle aroma is sooo pleasant.</li>
            <li>It smells classy and sophisticated but I am only 21</li>
            <li>I have a pretty sensitive nose, and it&#x27;s like \\&quot;there&#x27;s a hint of something pretty there\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The Egyptian goddess is a soft musk smell simular to a white musk smell but better.</li>
            <li>It takes on your individual, natural scent while simultaneously enhancing it with exotic undertones.</li>
            <li>The retailer I purchased from for the past couple  years was very good about taking shipment back and reshipping new.</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Changes over time (affected by body heat and skin chemistry).. so go easy and test it out.</li>
            <li>so maybe some mix better on others or if put with other scents right-maybe its not 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It smelled ok.... never noticed the smell change or disappear like other oils.</li>
            <li>my original email to them on August 18, my replacement perfumes didn&#x27;t arrive until November 4 and after smellingmy &amp;#34;replacements&amp;#34;, I emailed them this: I will be expressing this sentiment on paper when I return what you FINALLY shipped to me.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m using it in combination with other fragrances in hopes of getting more durability.</li>
            <li>but I put some of this on my neck the other day and this one guy was giving me an innocent massage.</li>
            <li>it smells clean, but I notice some days it smell different.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I generally have only used amber oil roll on oil, so I was hoping for something more musky and sensual.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to be getting this body oil due to the rave reviews.</li>
            <li>I do miss the older formula and hope that Auric Blends will go back to the original)</li>
            <li>A little to strong for my senses!</li>
            <li>Its got an old lady perfume smell at first.</li>
            <li>What is so cool is people describe the scent differently on each of them.</li>
            <li>I also like that it is a small drool on bottle that fits nicely in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS OIL WENT CRAZY TRYING TO FIND IT SOFT LINGERING SCENT PEOPLE TELL HOW GOOD I SMELL</li>
            <li>hope it was just a fluke because this is my new signature scent!</li>
            <li>oh and black coconut for a summery exotic scent</li>
            <li>This is a better perfume than most of the expensive brands on the market.</li>
            <li>Basically, the older the fragrance gets, the stronger it gets.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has some sort of magic love potion in it or what&#x27;s going on over there at Auric Blends, but a mere whiff of this stuff now lets me know &amp;</li>
            <li>My order arrived incredibly fast &amp; I am really liking this fragrance so far.  </li>
            <li>PLEASE TAKE CAUTION that the older reviews of this scent are reviews of the scent you can no longer attain and the more recent reviews, like mine, are reviews of this different version of Egyptian Goddess.</li>
            <li>Please pay attention to only the more recent reviews of this scented oil.</li>
            <li>Like if I decided ten minutes later I want to add more somewhere else, like maybe my neck or whatever, the oil in the vile is virtually unscented.</li>
            <li>This particular oil has a lighter smell than some, as if it has been diluted.  </li>
            <li>, this particular oil came and literally has NO SCENT to it.</li>
            <li>this has such a mild effect that it seems to disappear before i leave the house.</li>
            <li>The special Egyptian packaging is cheap and kind of ugly.  </li>
            <li>Excellent scent, thick and the scent last a long time when wearing it, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Within the last 2 months, I have noticed that my new orders smell like nothing, or at best very weak.</li>
            <li>light and fresh but not strong.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this to anyone looking to break away from all those immature perfumes and body sprays, and looking to be that Egyptian Goddess to the man in your life.  </li>
            <li>.. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so I am going to try the coco mango scent and see if I like that a little bit more.  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt, this inexpensive little product has changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li>I smelled like an old woman for HOURS!!</li>
            <li>I opened it, dabbed a little on, and fell completely in love with myself.</li>
            <li>previously purchased this from Whole Foods and it had a strong scent.</li>
            <li>Soft and intimate.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it works with my natural smell.</li>
            <li>This goes on real soft and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The smell softens the longer its on and really compliments my natural chemistry.</li>
            <li>: I emailed a few weeks ago and thought I&#x27;d try again: )  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more in the near future!</li>
            <li>Also if you want a perfume that is smelled from a distance spray a few sprays of your favorite one on your clothes, It captures at a distance then</li>
            <li>love it wear it everyday and always receive compliments</li>
            <li>It last all day long and that what I love about this body oil.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money only reason this product didn&#x27;t get 5 stars</li>
            <li>Nice thick consistency but not sticky.</li>
            <li>And the oils had such a strong, different</li>
            <li>There are other recent good reviews which leads me to believe that the formula must have been changed recently or something like that</li>
            <li>Which means it doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied during any time of day and its perfectly subtle for us ladies whereas Egyptian Musk is pretty much for men because its strong.</li>
            <li>I wore it ONLY on my wrists and met my boyfriend at the gym to workout (only because I got it in the mail today, I usually don&#x27;t wear perfume to the gym lol).</li>
            <li>Low price, great quality, and a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li>I think this is my new signature scent.</li>
            <li>but I thought I would try some new ones.</li>
            <li>I love this roll-on because it is such a simple yet complex sophisticated scent, as far as attracting the opposite sex, um well my husband hasn&#x27;t really reacted to much</li>
            <li>It smells so good and is very subtle.</li>
            <li>Auric Blends makes quite a few very nicely scented oils and with the oils, a little bit is all you need.  </li>
            <li>Very soft</li>
            <li>This smelled very old lady for me.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it, it is very soft.</li>
            <li>so if you are looking for something strong and long lasting this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Last a long time and isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>Smells like old lady!</li>
            <li>Nice body oil not good as I was hoping</li>
            <li>soft and musky!</li>
            <li>I will always wear this scent for as long as it exists; it has been my long standing favorite for nearly 14 years now.</li>
            <li>So pretty and feminine and different.  </li>
            <li>I usually mix it with Love.</li>
            <li>I have fond memories of Auric Memories when the roll ons first came out in the mid 90s.</li>
            <li>I posted a review earlier when I first got the product.</li>
            <li>Ive bought many times before and usually stronger.</li>
            <li>, This was my first and last time.</li>
            <li>Start with a little dab and wait to see how strong it gets on</li>
            <li>This is a very sophisticated roll-on oil and lasts about half the day but small enough that you can toss it in your bag, it is light, and classy</li>
            <li>My biggest tip if you want to get the full effects, is to put this around the hot spots on your body, such as in between your cleavage, back of neck, and inner elbow.</li>
            <li>and it was half filled bc</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick , and the product was as expected.</li>
            <li>I am still on a search for a true Egyptian Musk Oil that actually lasts on your skin and one that you can actually smell!!!</li>
            <li>At first when i rolled it on, i could smell it, but after the initial use, the smell COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED.</li>
            <li>At first when I rolled it on, I could smell it, but after the initial use, the smell COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and sensual and last a very long time.</li>
            <li>it is very profound....</li>
            <li>I called the company and complained and was told that the fragrance was enhanced with time which seemed logical to me as the original order sat for some time before I used it.</li>
            <li>But on the contrary Kuumba Made brand makes a good Egyptian Musk, but the scent of their oil is still on the weak side, but it is definitely there.  </li>
            <li>I have seen this time and again in multiple venues for oils where they dilute the pure oils to stretch profits.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to buy the large bottle, but it had mixed reviews, so I got 3 of the roll-ons.</li>
            <li>, I received a run around that consisted of large gaps between their responses, excuses for why their &amp;#34;resending&amp;#34; of my perfumes didn&#x27;t arrive and that they would put a rush on sending it AGAIN only to have literally nearly a month go by before I received ANY replacement perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you like deeper scents with a little more musk then you will definitely like this.</li>
            <li>But i definitely get compliments at the start of the day, and a little faded remnants of the scent when I ask people if they can smell it still (making sure it&#x27;s not me just used to the smell).</li>
            <li>The scent of Egyptian Goddess is hard to discribe for me but get it you will love it too!&lt;br /&gt;Super</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance, but this one I ordered had hardly any smell to it.</li>
            <li>and some sellers may have old stock of it.</li>
            <li>Of all I&#x27;ve sampled from Amazon.com, this is by far the nicest.  </li>
            <li>It is cheaply priced, but not cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>something young person scent maybe</li>
            <li>I did not get any compliments while wearing it, while my adult son did say &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>I was on and off about ordering some reviews said old lady smell</li>
            <li>wow  </li>
            <li>So far I think its a 50/50 with Auric Perfume.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for mature women.</li>
            <li>It literally just smells like nasty plastic void of all that made that scent the wonderful scent it should be: (  If you EVER make it the way your company used to, please let me be the first to know as I would be so very happy to buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that I am HOPING you have fixed it</li>
            <li>shopping in a tourist town near my home town, I happened into a medievil shop by chance and there on the counter</li>
            <li>I would not say that the oil smells old, it just seems that the ratio of scent to carrier oil has been reduced.</li>
            <li>: smells like old oil and it has no smell</li>
            <li>It smelled like a perfume that&#x27;s been overtaken by sweat or natural body order ( not BO) .</li>
            <li>The bottle I have lasted me a year so far</li>
            <li>and I am not even near done with it.</li>
            <li>Everyone in the house (even the boys) applied it on our wrists, the smell is soft yet the aroma has a noticeable presence.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t smell the \\&quot;old lady smell\\</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 scents this was my least favorite</li>
            <li>I personally think it smells musty and is very overpowering.</li>
            <li>The smell is for an old lady.</li>
            <li>this oil,  saying there was either NO SCENT or a scent that smelled musty like an old lady.  </li>
            <li>Masculine?</li>
            <li>I like getting it in person, but the last time I bought Egyptian Goddess online, the smell was really &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>smells like old hoe house.</li>
            <li>It really changes to blend with different body chemistries.  </li>
            <li>Would still recommend product but just know they will not come through with offers..</li>
            <li>The smell lasts all day and it is really intensified when your body warms up from physical activity, which I like as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a perfume fanatic and am in love with this perfume oil.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered my Egyptian Goddess perfume oil on Amazon, it was being sold by Old Glory.</li>
            <li>These oils must have been old because they didn&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
            <li>Which, btw, this is marked as though it&#x27;s sold by Auric Blends</li>
            <li>choose another fragrance if you want to have a soft scent, this has none.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of roller ball bottle - no spilling, no waste.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this blend at my local whole foods store for years</li>
            <li>It is not what I expected, I expected more of a spicy/balsamic and heady musk.</li>
            <li>Very strong, musky, but not pleasant, scent.</li>
            <li>refund posted and although I appreciate your gesture in sending those smaller amounts of perfume, I am saddened all over again that the Egyptian Goddess is FAR from the correct smell, yet again!!!  </li>
            <li>This is a very light subtle musk smell reminiscent of the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s musk cologne, but much cleaner and lighter.</li>
            <li>It has an OK fragrance but is not exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>It is strong enough that other people notice apparently.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Goddess has a warm &amp; sensual musky tone to it, but is subtle at the same time.  </li>
            <li>My personal description of the scent is green like new grass, powdery, a bit spicy, and light floral sweetness.</li>
            <li>Subtle, sexy, earthy smell.  </li>
            <li>Subtle, Sexy ...</li>
            <li>I love this subtle yet ever-present scent!&lt;br /&gt;Never overpowering...</li>
            <li>When previously using this scent, I don&#x27;t remember the scent fading so quickly.</li>
            <li>It has long been my favorite everyday perfume.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even sure that it would smell like Egyptian musk, but it does - maybe a tiny bit lighter, but I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li>Love it, hard to find anywhere else because it&#x27;s such a great scent it sells out like crazy.</li>
            <li>It is a little sweet smelling for me</li>
            <li>The roller ball applicator is really cool, I just wish the scent was a little stronger and lasted longer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s it fresh, new &amp; not watered down!</li>
            <li>Some reviewers complained that the scent was too soft, but I found it to be way to strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>The  musk tones down other perfumes making them more palatable.</li>
            <li>I read such rave reviews of Egyptian Goddess, so when I ordered it I had high hopes, however it barely has ANY scent to it.</li>
            <li>(name) FINALLY followed up with my phone calls and emails weeks after I began contacting her and eventually sent out two new bottles which contained oils that literally smelled like NO SCENT and almost like plastic in fact.</li>
            <li>the years the line has grown to include new scents, solid fragrance and now lotion!  </li>
            <li>You can get the same stuff from your local whole foods.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked this scent my whole life and finally got it, only to have this happen.  </li>
            <li>I have random people tell me how good I smell constantly.</li>
            <li>it smells like no other egyptian musk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been sensitive to scents and other perfumes, and most make me quite ill, but as Auric Blends uses REAL OILS to make REAL PERFUME it doesn&#x27;t bother me or make me ill.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It a strong smell, use it only in small amounts.</li>
            <li>Please consider going back to the original full scent that I have become obsessed with.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend as long as you know what Egyptian musk oil smells like heck</li>
            <li>the smell is so light its hard to smell it.</li>
            <li>My initial inquiry began in August of 2013 as I had ordered a bottle for my Mom and myself only to be gravely disappointed that there was only the faintest of smells (at best) in our oil.  </li>
            <li>I even took the bottle and rolled it ALL over me and asked others if they could smell it and they could barely smell it as well.  </li>
            <li>i can barely smell it</li>
            <li>The scent is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I could barely smell anything so here</li>
            <li>I only applied the oil to my arm near my wrist and it&#x27;s been 5 hours</li>
            <li>kinda like wet dog, I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>I have smelled this smell on several old ladies before.</li>
            <li>and he threw his head back and said eewww that smells like old lady.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to let it age or heat it up or do any sort of these bogus things to make the scent apparent.</li>
            <li>I put some on and can barely smell it .  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how hippie it is maybe if it were a little less potent.</li>
            <li>their went so far as to send me smaller &amp;#34;samples&amp;#34; of Egyptian Goddes which were worse than the first replacements!!!  </li>
            <li>My only complaint was the roller, it was crooked which prevented my from closing the top properly.</li>
            <li>I have been so disappointed these last eight months that I haven&#x27;t been able to enjoy this scent</li>
            <li>I get compliments on this scent all the time, even from people with those extra sensitive noses that don&#x27;t care for traditional &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; types of smells.</li>
            <li>Most commercial perfumes leave me feeling naseous, headache, dizzy or confused.</li>
            <li>not alot needed being oil, and it does not dry your skin like perfume because it does not contian alcohol</li>
            <li>for the scent, a lot of reviews are very general about the actual scent</li>
            <li>I discovered this scent 16 yrs ago in a tiny gift shop and have worn no other scent since.</li>
            <li>I first came across it at a little boutique.</li>
            <li>So, if first time use, a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li>such a subtle smell but strong enough to call attention.&lt;br /&gt;everyone</li>
            <li>suspicion is they &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down their once great smell with so much oil that it no longer has any scent or that perhaps they ran out of the correct ingredients and are sellling these awful versions until they are back on track with the right formula.  </li>
            <li>little goes a long way; just stick to a little over the pulse points to keep from overwhelming the people around you.</li>
            <li>There is a slight musk to it and the smell really does change according to your body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Like the small size to carry in my purse, soft very feminine smell.  </li>
            <li>I brought my new bottle on a girls getaway weekend with a friend and was SO disappointed in the product that I called Auric Blends right from our hotel room, left a detailed message and followed up with an email after I returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light and slightly weak sent.</li>
            <li>Thick Oil Based not watered down, Speedy delivery, Last all day scent no need to reapply, Definitely purchase if looking for authentic Egyptian musk</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s a staple, it just smells warm and delicious and clean and perfect!</li>
            <li> When I started wearing this scent over a decade ago it was a wonderfully pleasant, pungent scent with staying power; one that I could smell throughout the day and even on my sweaters after wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a pleasant and non-overpowering way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li> I had to laugh!!!!</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I would love to recommend this scent to everyone, but I&#x27;m torn because I don&#x27;t want everyone to smell like me!</li>

            <li> Lovely scent!</li>
            <li> but this is quite possibly my favorite find!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something more remarkable.</li>
            <li> My favorite oil ever!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of Egyptian Musk!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> It has been my favorite scent!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> love the smell of it!</li>
            <li> and I will be orderering more soon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild, great if you are like me and can&#x27;t stand 90% of all the perfumes out there.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing</li>
            <li> I am more of a bright fragrance person</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This smells so amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, I am always asked what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> so I was sweating, and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent.  </li>
            <li> Shipped with amazing timing.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because of the reviews that I saw saying how amazing it smelled.</li>
            <li> You get a good amount of this product for the money, and after reading a ton of rave reviews for the scent online I was convinced that I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s warm and inviting.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and it very alluring.</li>
            <li> but surprisingly others are able to still smell it on me.</li>
            <li> But everyone agreed it smelled nice.</li>
            <li> but my mother liked it if mixing it with musk</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a nice start  </li>
            <li> But anyways, it was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but not to light because I can still smell it throughout the day especially if it&#x27;s a warm day.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the love scent.</li>
            <li> So if you like fragrance that isn&#x27;t overwhelming then this might be a good one for you.</li>
            <li> Great price order more than one :)</li>
            <li> This kind of defeats the purpose of applying a scent at all.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bit more, but it was good too.</li>
            <li> Honestly it smells like a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I liked the way this smells in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It did warm as I rubbed my wrists together.</li>
            <li> Excellent and fast shipping</li>
            <li> which, imo, is kinda nice.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice...</li>
            <li> had to have my own.</li>
            <li> The bottle was shipped nicely and came in one piece and rolls</li>
            <li> Nice smell it won&#x27;t have women all over you as it is often sold as a compliment to men pheromones cologne however for the price</li>
            <li> I honestly think that it&#x27;s a hit or miss with this product (Egyptian Goddess).</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Shaunna for an awesome gift!</li>
            <li> I love this smell and it smells so good on me</li>
            <li> I have used Egyptian Goddess for many years and everytime I wear it, I get many many compliments, men and women both come up and ask what I&#x27;m wearing!!</li>
            <li> Very.. strong and kind of musky.</li>
            <li> Anyway, my point is simple--this is a great scent that&#x27;s easy to fall in love with.</li>
            <li> So, for awhile I was ordering it from a place in California which always had great prices and sweet thank</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil, it smells fantastic and is my very favorite body oil!  </li>
            <li> All i can say it is amazing, I&#x27;m in my early twenties and its a very great mixture for everyone of all ages.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and easy to carry around in the roller bottle.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick turn around.</li>
            <li> Have repurchased many, many times!</li>
            <li> This oil is so amazing &amp; smells more lushious as time goes on but never overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling oil, I am not in love with it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing egyptian musk for a while and by far this is one of the best scent oil out there.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, soft, feminine roll-on perfume oil.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best...</li>
            <li> By far the BEST fragrance ever.</li>
            <li> A beautiful natural fragrance, the perfect sweet aroma, fast deliver, great seller.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special.</li>
            <li> It can easily be 5 stars if the company makes it stronger!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> This causes most perfumes to smell very overwhelming on her (breathtakingly strong).</li>
            <li> its just ok like of not as natural smelling as I wish, bit potent bit nice..not best though</li>
            <li> It is a very sexy scent on my wife, yes it starts out light</li>
            <li> Very light-</li>
            <li> People would stop me and ask me what do I have on because the scent is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Good thing that the price is good ( except s&amp;h are high)  </li>
            <li> My order of Egyptian Musk oil arrived quickly and in good shape...</li>
            <li> Light, refreshing, and reminds me of spring weather!</li>
            <li> I really love the smell, it is very light and sensual,thing is you can&#x27;t smell it anymore after 30 min,</li>
            <li> Nice light, fresh, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle musty and beautiful scent that is perfect for any season.</li>
            <li> Huge bummer!</li>
            <li> my fav &amp; so glad I found it</li>
            <li> I also love the roller ball better than sprays as you have more control of the amount applied and the location</li>
            <li> I will definately be order more.</li>
            <li> If you put it on your wrists before you go out in the evening, you&#x27;ll wake up the next morning still smelling wonderful!</li>

            <li> I will probably give it to someone else they may have better luck with it than I did.</li>
            <li> So happy I found this because Whole Foods no longer carries this line of body oil.</li>
            <li> Sexy?</li>
            <li> I just hope it smells better as time goes on.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess is my FAVORITE scent.</li>
            <li> Shipping was okay.</li>
            <li> We run quality control checks on all of our perfumes before we bottle them to be sure that the blends are within our acceptable fragrance range.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with this scent.</li>
            <li> although I love the Egytiian scent.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered him more.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess is a version of the famous Egyptian Musk Body Oil but like its parent they have been diluted into non-scents(sic).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I love all of the oils except the Auric Blend.  </li>
            <li> and I could not believe how many people wanted to hug me and the commits they gave me</li>
            <li> If you like Egyptian musk, you will love this.  </li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this body oil.</li>
            <li> I think this will be my signature scent :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent..</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Not the exotic smell</li>
            <li> Amazon being a reliable and great source to purchase items from at a reasonable price, should choose not to sell the product.</li>
            <li> Auric Blends smells more like Juicy or Baby Phat oil.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and THIS is probably our favorite.</li>
            <li> Have never had an oil that gets so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did .</li>
            <li> This has always been a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li> I just received my Egyptian Goddess and Love body oils in the mail today.</li>

            <li> I get so many compliments on this oil.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and will be purchasing more of it.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s an oil and that it is a roll-on...</li>
            <li> While this buyer adores many Musk oils, this is not one of them.  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more immediately for friends and family.</li>

            <li> There is someting captivating about this scent.  </li>
            <li> All most missed the anniversary this year, but this got me out of it.</li>
            <li> Was my favorite go-to perfume, I even preferred it over perfumes I owned that were hundreds of dollars more.  </li>
            <li> Smells okay.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still in love with it.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day but isn&#x27;t overpowering like so many oils are.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> It replaced my favorite Ralph Lauren scent.</li>
            <li> I love it, and would recommend it for anyone to try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> otherwise love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the Auric Blends oils.  </li>
            <li> lovely smell.</li>
            <li> it smells exotic and regal.</li>
            <li> There are many people here raving about this  and many receiving bottles with no smell .</li>
            <li> I love Auric Blends Egypitan Goddess oil.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin at all, it sits on top, so don&#x27;t let your clothes touch it.</li>
            <li> It smells ok.</li>
            <li> but the more I wear it the better it gets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of Egyptian musk/goddess but this one is my favorite blend.</li>
            <li> but I love it.  </li>
            <li> Now, I smell yummy, too.  :-)</li>
            <li> The scent that people described as &#x27;sexy&#x27; was not even close to the word.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t appealing to me at all</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> When I applied it I got a headache, wish I had been  able to contact seller before purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was an inexpensive purchase, but I&#x27;ll stick with the one I was using before.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess seemed to be much more fragrant.</li>
            <li> So yes, I can&#x27;t stand the smell, but I do love Auric Blends Body Oils.  </li>
            <li> I just did a review on one of these but on the Love scent...</li>
            <li> Non-stop compliments from mostly men but women as well</li>
            <li> My most favorite scent of all time - including the $120 an ounce perfume from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> was immediately intrigued with the exotic scents and names.</li>
            <li> sure whether there is any truth to the oils being &#x27;diluted&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and all the smiles.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite perfume oils.</li>
            <li> Was worried when I read those, but am now glad I took the chance.</li>

            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> But its not terrible for others I can tell, just not for me.</li>
            <li> but this one makes me feel sexy.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought the Egyptian Goddess oil.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what or why, but I just didn&#x27;t feel safe putting my card information on their website.</li>
            <li> I found that this fragrance works excellent in the heat, so it&#x27;s definitely a Spring and Summer fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d be reimbursing more than they&#x27;d be selling...</li>

            <li> I love it</li>

            <li> Also, my wife is happy because it put the spark back in to our love life just in time</li>
            <li> I love the smell so clean and fragrant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOL I am excited because people always ask me what I am wearing or is that my natural scent!</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it, it smelled wonderful, but thereafter, I can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li> It can easily be 5 stars if the company makes it stronger!this.</li>
            <li> Not musky or strong like nag champa or patchouli.  </li>
            <li> It is too strong, it reminds me Shalimar fragrance</li>
            <li> Anyway you DO NOT need to use a lot or people might gag because it IS strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too strong.</li>
            <li> seems like it is not as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li> scent is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> and you know if you can smell yourself, it is too strong.  </li>
            <li> She had noticed her newer bottle not being as strong also.  </li>
            <li> ,I didn&#x27;t like it much,a bit too strong for my taste</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as strong as it was when I opened it</li>
            <li> Omg, I loved this stuff when I was in high school.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell and it is very mild and sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> Fragrance was nice at first and then seemed to disappear.</li>
            <li> Altogether no a bad product, the reason I gave three stare is because the oil seemed to heat and put out even more of a sent than what I wanted</li>
            <li> Not a bad muskiness, but more of a warmer depth to the flowery smell.</li>
            <li> I have used it for over half of my life, and this company makes the best blend.</li>
            <li> They used to mix the scented oils with your choice of lotion and this quickly became my favorite.</li>
            <li> It goes quickly so stock up!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> Smells light and floral to me,not to strong.</li>
            <li> Very sensual and makes me feel sexy!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume oil so much!!</li>
            <li> I often wondered what in the world cheap deodorant woman were wearing in NYC</li>
            <li> I decided to buy it again since it used to be a great product and now the scent is completely different.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my bottle today, I am EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THIS OIL, I have been wearing egyptian musk for years, the first bottle that I had purchased years ago, smelled exactly like this egyptian goddess, have not been able to find this scent now that I have , I will purchase more, pls don&#x27;t change this scent.</li>
            <li> Come on ladies, isn&#x27;t it fabulous when strangers stop you and say &amp;#34;you smell like a goddess&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would enjoy something with \\&quot;musk\\&quot; in it&#x27;s description,  </li>
            <li> It smells like cheap dollar store perfume.</li>
            <li> I know it was cheap</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this fragrance oil, some said it was too light and others said that when it warms up the fragrance gets stronger as it warms up.</li>
            <li> I found that it was a bit light for me</li>
            <li> Heard such great reviews about the smell</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the scent, but I couldn&#x27;t even smell it 30 minutes after application.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but makes an impression, I&#x27;ve had people follow me after they passed by to ask what it is i&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
            <li> It is a light scent.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, it has a fresh smell &amp; it&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
            <li> The Sceny is to light  </li>
            <li> As it warms on the skin, it evolves into an earthy light, floral musk.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightly scented so it&#x27;s nothing that will make you sneeze.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a perfume to wear lightly.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and last all day.</li>
            <li> But, happily, it was just the opposite!  </li>
            <li> Perfect if you don&#x27;t like too heavy a smell.</li>
            <li> Light yet sensual.</li>
            <li> But I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It last all day and I get great complaints.  </li>
            <li> Feminine, light.</li>
            <li> I waited awhile and put a good amount more on the same spot.  </li>
            <li> and I love the fact that she smells good all day especially up close.</li>
            <li> Such a good buy :)</li>
            <li> and it is just NOT the same as the wonderful ones I could always buy at Whole Foods in Atlanta, GA.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and a lovely sweet scent.</li>
            <li> It fits right in your makeup kit and it makes you feel sexy wearing it.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the African Musk and Rose oils, which I also liked very much, but the Egyptian Goddess is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly how I remembered!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> VERY MUSKY!!!</li>
            <li> The oil is a very nice scent, especially after showering.</li>
            <li> The scent lingers all day and it is a lovely fresh, clean smell.  </li>
            <li> Very clean, fresh.</li>
            <li> Its a light clean scent and every where I go</li>
            <li> The service was quick and my product arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This particular scent is nice, not as aggressive as patchouli.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like super strong smells.</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough of this body oil, I wish it came in a huge bottle I love love love this</li>
            <li> I was hopping to love this scent, but it smelled really synthetic and overly strong.</li>
            <li> (Their white musk is amazing too, by the way!)  </li>
            <li> Originally bought a couple of these for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to put these in some stockings because I wear it</li>
            <li> When im hot in summer it doesnt wear off it brings out scent more.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Smelled nothing like what I&#x27;m familiar with.  </li>
            <li> I got 2 of these without trying them first and was so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this oil in the past and absolutely loved it!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this purchase, based on the one Egyptian musk I&#x27;ve used (not this one) and all the raves this one gets.  </li>
            <li> The original order of Auric Blends</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this oil after reading all the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> Have got many compliments, Very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> It smells nothing like the original brand scent.  </li>
            <li> I opened it up and was so excited... unroll the wrapping..</li>
            <li> Unique smell that lasts day.</li>
            <li> My friends think that this perfume has been diluted or weakened in some way from the original she bought.  </li>
            <li> The sent is clean and smells for hours.  </li>
            <li> I just knew it smelled like clean laundry, so I googled around till I was convinced this product was what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I like the clean</li>
            <li> best description would be old powder that back in the day women used to coat themselves in.</li>
            <li> It has an amazing scent that only gets better as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft and sexy it is.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from Amazon instead of Auric Blends website because their website doesn&#x27;t seem safe enough to make purchases on honestly.</li>
            <li> However, to my pleasant surprise, when I got my bottle of EG in the mail, I opened it, put it on, and the smell was obviously present.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes me feel special.</li>
            <li> The bottle of Egyptian Goddess Body Oil roll on I received was nothing special.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li> I have purchased several of the different oils, most smell very nice and sexy</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Its strange that this is one of the most popular scents by Auric Blends.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance also lasts without fade much longer than most I have purchased in my life.  </li>
            <li> This is a very different smell, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift and it is true that is does change with each persons body chemistry.</li>
            <li> It is very floral, and almost overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> This scent linger a soft and warm.  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering, so no headaches and very clean.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not my favorite, but good enough to wear until I find the one.</li>
            <li> It came in a Big box with one in it and pkg good.</li>
            <li> Thanks for taking the time to respond: )  </li>
            <li> Nice replacement for the old egyptian musks.  </li>
            <li> I honestly love this one very much.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Love the scent so much...</li>
            <li> I was really nervous buying something I have not smelled but every review seems to say that people love the sent on them.</li>
            <li> On me it is this sultry scent, slightly sweet but not \\&quot;preteen body</li>
            <li> spray\\&quot; sweet.</li>
            <li> It is a light fresh scent that is a touch grassy with a hint of muskness (muskness?)</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Egyptian musk, but after years and years I had finally run out of oil.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and same scent as always.</li>
            <li> It smells really good on her and seems to last all day on her.  </li>
            <li> It definitely smells just as good as that pricey stuff you can get at passion parties.</li>
            <li> This stuff is sweet yet musky.</li>
            <li> ~good~~good~~~i am a fastidious about smelling, but I really like this:)</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t need to be sickly sweet or rolled-eyes-</li>
            <li> used to more sweet and floral scents so this is quite the change for me, but I am certainly adapting quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used all the other oils that I purchased and I knew they would be great, as they were.</li>
            <li> Also works great with other smells.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh n clean not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend likes it and it is so mild</li>
            <li> The oil is great, but my hubs can only smell it on me if he gets really close.</li>
            <li> Amazon along with the many outstanding sellers on Amazon make is possible.</li>
            <li> However ,the product was packed well and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I definitely can understand the reviews that says it&#x27;s not as strong as it used to be, because it isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> This roll on bottle will last forever ;) thanks so much for this wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very fast service!</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but the problem is that you can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li> At first, it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> I use the perfume and soap, this oil is a good addition to my favorite scent in the whole wide world.</li>
            <li> I usually wear the Rose, which is amazing, by the way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a light, clean, lovely scent when applied correctly.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting, beautiful scent!</li>
            <li> It may be alright for some people, but I really don&#x27;t prefer nor can stand smelling strongly of incense and my grandma.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it one last try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I was realy excited about it at first until I opened it...</li>
            <li> Its a clean crisp smell.</li>
            <li> Very nice slightly musky but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The scent is warm and sexy without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> cheap price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Womanly, fresh, sexy, light and something I can wear every day.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to enjoy this scent.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a few days, and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday perfume I have been wearing this for along time and always get compliment on it..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li> I put it on after my shower, and if I place it under my garments, it stays on and fresh for hours.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have been satisfied by this fragrant oil.</li>
            <li> but ifthe scent ever returns to how it should smell, please let me know as THAT is worth buying</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Plus love is soft smell.</li>
            <li> If you could actually smell the scent, I think it would be nice.  </li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and pleasing to me though.</li>
            <li> It was a breath of fresh air, and I had to find out what it was.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered it,but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Soft elegant scent.</li>
            <li> and I thought I was going to get a lovely scent, but it smells like an old woman.</li>
            <li> The only scent my boyfriend has liked and I&#x27;ve bought a lot of perfumes because I like variety</li>
            <li> but anyone who comes near me can smell it and they love it.</li>
            <li> The thing about it though is that it clings close to the skin because it is a soft smell, so I apply a lot on (under my ears, under my jaw, creases of my elbows, and my wrists) because if I don&#x27;t then the only way to smell it is by putting my wrists to my nose, lol.</li>
            <li> I rarely review things because I never have time</li>
            <li> It smells understated and powerful.</li>
            <li> It has a mild sweet smell that stays around for a while, which is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more potent but from other reviews</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This item came super fast and it smells HEAVENLY!  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, lasts all day, is neither too strong nor weak</li>
            <li> so I can put it right</li>
            <li> This seller has the right scent-</li>
            <li> if that helps you decide if right for you.</li>
            <li> But, Amazon is always easier--especially since I purchase right from my phone.</li>
            <li> Try it out on yourself before deciding if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li> I ordered right away.  </li>
            <li> first few dabs smell great</li>
            <li> Personally, I like my EM to be more sweet and musky.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, but barely there, I have to put a ton on to smell it and hubby, who has a strong background in aromatherapy, could barely smell it either.  </li>
            <li> A very lovely scent for both young and mature ladies.</li>
            <li> Very feminine and clean scent.</li>
            <li> Not a bad frangrance -- definitely musky -- but not my favorite either.  </li>
            <li> if I put a little vanilla musk or coconut fragrance with it, it smells nice!</li>
            <li> The first thing we recommend is to allow the fragrance to sit for a coupleof weeks and see if it gets stronger as it ages because “fresh” blends haven’t been allowed the time for all the components to coalesce.  </li>
            <li> but the scent wasn&#x27;t sweet although I don&#x27;t think I really knew what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the real thing, better to opt for another brand, such as an Original Musk Oil.</li>
            <li> OK this is my absolute favorite perfume of all time it has such a clean sweet smell with light hidden notes</li>
            <li> way too strong and smells like old lady.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t wanna get in trouble with my girl, so it&#x27;s totally a 10/10 :D</li>
            <li> definitely had a great mood changing effect to my boyfriend, he smelled it and started cleaning the house ( which is totally unlike him).</li>
            <li> They FIRST thing he did was lean down to smell me and told me I smelled good.</li>
            <li> It was in such high demand, they could never stay on top of it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a warm, light, very slightly musky scent.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 bottles and not one of them smelled, very very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because shipping was very fast and the scent doesn&#x27;t go away within 5 mins.</li>
            <li> I received this very fast.</li>
            <li> He could smell it, but I couldn&#x27;t smell it very much.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it smells like incense to me, or an earthy and warm scent, sometimes it smells like a fresh river, and other times it smells like a sensual massage oil with a bit of spice to it.</li>
            <li> It seems my review is not of the original scent and according to them, the original scent is far superior than the new watered down and altered scent which is what I have reviewed.</li>
            <li> I got this because of all the great reviews, but it hardly smells at all.......</li>
            <li> A lady at work uses this oil and told me how mild, long lasting and pleasant it is, so I bought it.</li>
            <li> This little one lasts for a long time and smells delicious.</li>
            <li> Very sultry!</li>
            <li> I purchased this out of curiosity, as it was my first body oil ever.</li>
            <li> I just prefer more musky oils, so it is probably just a personal bias.  </li>
            <li> Very well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Thiese arrived and I was totally dissapointed as this is my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This one is nice however, and has a lingering scent that changes sweet after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in just 3 days and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This Egyptian Goddess blend is a great scent, but tends to be on the thick side, almost sticky when first applied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;m wondering if this scent, prior to the formula change about which many have posted, was actually quite lovely.</li>
            <li> It was to light of a smell as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> As of right now it smells like pure oil, no fragrance</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy a perfume until you can smell it first.</li>
            <li> Are you quite sure you are back to the smell of what Egyptian Goddess should be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time ordering this.</li>
            <li> Way better than spending $60-$100 on the same bottles of prime everyone else wears.</li>
            <li> I tried this scent for the first time at a bath and body shop.</li>
            <li> was my first experience with Auric Blends.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of oils!</li>
            <li> and  it  was  exactly  the  smell</li>
            <li> This is may first time buying this one.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be repurchasing, hopefully the bottle lasts for a while :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this oil, but I think the solid perfume&#x27;s scent lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this perfume for years, but this is the first time I bought from an internet vendor.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally chose to purchase this</li>
            <li> I find myself constantly sniffing my wrist and dabbing more on.  </li>
            <li> Wish it were an open top bottle or spray.  </li>
            <li> it got here pretty quicklly</li>
            <li> There it is, the scent was much stronger!</li>
            <li> And he really likes it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still interested in these oils</li>
            <li> This was the first time to use Egyptian Goddess Body Oil.  </li>
            <li> I would be willing to order it again.</li>
            <li> I am going to try a different seller to see if I have better chances.</li>
            <li> Especially when Amazon said I might not be able to receive this product until after Christmas....  </li>
            <li> the first night I had it on it</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only worn it twice, but it seems off to me, not at all feminine or sexy.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of the Egyptian Goddess Oil.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how exactly this works.</li>
            <li> (and unlike some other reviewers I&#x27;ve had no issues with being able to smell it!)</li>
            <li> I ordered the Rasta oil too, and that one smelled only slighty better.</li>
            <li> This unfortunately, is not that.</li>
            <li> However I am updating my review still love the product however company offered me 10% off my next amazon order and did not follow through</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying fragrances online anymore without smelling and trying them first.</li>
            <li> The smell was different to me at first, but let your body chemistry get use to it, and you will fall in love with smell.</li>
            <li> I find myself not having to reapply, and I smell it on me all day pretty much!</li>
            <li> Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume oil for the last 10+ years.</li>
            <li> I put some on my wrist to test it when I first got it and</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients and chemical free</li>
            <li> I more than likely won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> It did when I first opened the bottle , now I can&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
            <li> She had bought it locally the first time, but had found it on Amazon at a much better rate.  </li>
            <li> I also ordered more about a year ago and they were not the same either.  </li>
            <li> but I will most definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I have many skin allergies (certain soaps and metals such as nickel), but this didn&#x27;t cause me any problems.</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife on a whim because I liked the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> It mixes with my natural scent for a unique aroma.</li>
            <li> This however enhances my own scent and make me feel sensual without making other people in the elevator cough and sneeze.  </li>
            <li> it smells clean and soft and is the richest I put a dab on and</li>
            <li> -a light scent of mixed fresh flowers yet a hint of sweetness&lt;</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews on here were so positive.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but positive feedback.  </li>
            <li> Can blend easily with other essential oil to create your own signature scent.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product and it is my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; and one vial lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> ,so be aware of how much you put on because it does go as long as 10hours or more there(even after shower).</li>
            <li> At first I really didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> When you first smell Egyptian Goddess from the roller, there isn&#x27;t much smell.</li>
            <li> Which is what this pretty much is.  </li>
            <li> My other really smells nice , and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It pretty much just smells like oil now.</li>
            <li> I love this smell, it&#x27;s so subtle but sexy.</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations for this scent based on the many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Goes on a little strong, but mellows out quickly and even though I can&#x27;t smell it, others compliment me on it all day!  </li>
            <li> My bottle came with the new design and full label on it instead of the older design that had the painted feathers on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I used it after showers and its very refreshing,  Not strong or had a lingering aroma.</li>
            <li> smells good, but the smell doesn&#x60;t last as long as it used to.</li>
            <li> It is just strong enough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very different, musky and strong.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing scent, very mysterious, sexy, and alluring, yet soft and almost smoldering, and you only have to use a couple drops worth too.</li>
            <li> My search continues for the PURE Egyptian Musk Unisex Body Oils.</li>
            <li> It is pure Egyptian Musk oil...</li>
            <li> so I figured it&#x27;d be a cute small gift that someone could enjoy as much as I do.</li>
            <li> We try to ship only those batches that have had the time needed to age properly, but sometimes we find ourselves in a situation where the demand is greater than our supply and we must ship out what we have!  </li>
            <li> I literally get maybe two seconds of rolling the oil on my wrists (smells fine) and the scent disappears from whatever&#x27;s left in the vile.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is how quickly it has disappeared!</li>
            <li> And if they are simply contentselling this version, shame on them as they are robbing themselves of loyal customers (I know I am not alone!)</li>
            <li> It has a very soft and musky scent to it,I love it very much,wish I had a bigger bottle now.</li>
            <li> The smell was nice, but a little soapy, my boyfriend said it smelled like bathroom air freshener, which isn&#x27;t what I was going for.  </li>
            <li> The large bottle of Egyptian Goddess appeared one day and it was a bargain for such a huge size.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too heavy for my taste to wear during the day, but it&#x27;s perfect to wear out in the evening.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, but it&#x27;s kind of light and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other I got from the same company.</li>
            <li> Love it, subtle and sweet!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s certainly cheap enough, but as they say &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> Not so much...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely nothing goddess about this scent.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I say thanks to all who sell to us at A.com</li>
            <li> not to bash the company because they are making a quality product, but the smell is just way too much for me.</li>
            <li> Nothing absolutely nothing fragrance.</li>
            <li> It was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I really tried to like it but</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much she wears this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very Egyptian musty.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> thank you for the fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> They ship fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Much too musky,</li>
            <li> Its really a gamble.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the smell</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be wearing this oil much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> I did not care for the powdery notes in this, as they really came out once it was on my skin and my warmth &amp;#34;activated&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am satisfied because it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this someone remarks on it and wants to know what it is.&lt;br /&gt;I will always recommend it.</li>
            <li> but men are really attracted to this smell.</li>
            <li> so i cant wear much</li>
            <li> My mother has very oily skin.</li>
            <li> No matter how much i put on, i end-up smelling myself all day</li>
            <li> brings me back to my college days...smells fantastic</li>
            <li> The roll on feature of the bottle keeps you from putting too much on too.</li>
            <li> I recommend for anyone looking for a simple light empowering fragrance.</li>
            <li> Definitely much stronger than the one I had smelled in the shop.</li>
            <li> Where can I get the real thing?</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really smell much of anything at all.</li>
            <li> It has a gentle scent with a really commanding presence, as if to say &amp;#34;I&#x27;m here</li>
            <li> This product has no fragrance I question if the retailer is even selling the real product.  </li>
            <li> Its subtle aroma is sooo pleasant.</li>
            <li> It smells classy and sophisticated but I am only 21</li>
            <li> I have a pretty sensitive nose, and it&#x27;s like \\&quot;there&#x27;s a hint of something pretty there\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The Egyptian goddess is a soft musk smell simular to a white musk smell but better.</li>
            <li> It takes on your individual, natural scent while simultaneously enhancing it with exotic undertones.</li>
            <li> The retailer I purchased from for the past couple  years was very good about taking shipment back and reshipping new.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Changes over time (affected by body heat and skin chemistry).. so go easy and test it out.</li>
            <li> so maybe some mix better on others or if put with other scents right-maybe its not 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It smelled ok.... never noticed the smell change or disappear like other oils.</li>
            <li> my original email to them on August 18, my replacement perfumes didn&#x27;t arrive until November 4 and after smellingmy &amp;#34;replacements&amp;#34;, I emailed them this: I will be expressing this sentiment on paper when I return what you FINALLY shipped to me.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m using it in combination with other fragrances in hopes of getting more durability.</li>
            <li> but I put some of this on my neck the other day and this one guy was giving me an innocent massage.</li>
            <li> it smells clean, but I notice some days it smell different.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I generally have only used amber oil roll on oil, so I was hoping for something more musky and sensual.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to be getting this body oil due to the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> I do miss the older formula and hope that Auric Blends will go back to the original)</li>
            <li> A little to strong for my senses!</li>
            <li> Its got an old lady perfume smell at first.</li>
            <li> What is so cool is people describe the scent differently on each of them.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is a small drool on bottle that fits nicely in my purse.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS OIL WENT CRAZY TRYING TO FIND IT SOFT LINGERING SCENT PEOPLE TELL HOW GOOD I SMELL</li>
            <li> hope it was just a fluke because this is my new signature scent!</li>
            <li> oh and black coconut for a summery exotic scent</li>
            <li> This is a better perfume than most of the expensive brands on the market.</li>
            <li> Basically, the older the fragrance gets, the stronger it gets.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has some sort of magic love potion in it or what&#x27;s going on over there at Auric Blends, but a mere whiff of this stuff now lets me know &amp;</li>
            <li> My order arrived incredibly fast &amp; I am really liking this fragrance so far.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE TAKE CAUTION that the older reviews of this scent are reviews of the scent you can no longer attain and the more recent reviews, like mine, are reviews of this different version of Egyptian Goddess.</li>
            <li> Please pay attention to only the more recent reviews of this scented oil.</li>
            <li> Like if I decided ten minutes later I want to add more somewhere else, like maybe my neck or whatever, the oil in the vile is virtually unscented.</li>
            <li> This particular oil has a lighter smell than some, as if it has been diluted.  </li>
            <li> , this particular oil came and literally has NO SCENT to it.</li>
            <li> this has such a mild effect that it seems to disappear before i leave the house.</li>
            <li> The special Egyptian packaging is cheap and kind of ugly.  </li>
            <li> Excellent scent, thick and the scent last a long time when wearing it, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Within the last 2 months, I have noticed that my new orders smell like nothing, or at best very weak.</li>
            <li> light and fresh but not strong.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this to anyone looking to break away from all those immature perfumes and body sprays, and looking to be that Egyptian Goddess to the man in your life.  </li>
            <li> .. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> so I am going to try the coco mango scent and see if I like that a little bit more.  </li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this inexpensive little product has changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li> I smelled like an old woman for HOURS!!</li>
            <li> I opened it, dabbed a little on, and fell completely in love with myself.</li>
            <li> previously purchased this from Whole Foods and it had a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Soft and intimate.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it works with my natural smell.</li>
            <li> This goes on real soft and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The smell softens the longer its on and really compliments my natural chemistry.</li>
            <li> : I emailed a few weeks ago and thought I&#x27;d try again: )  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more in the near future!</li>
            <li> Also if you want a perfume that is smelled from a distance spray a few sprays of your favorite one on your clothes, It captures at a distance then</li>
            <li> love it wear it everyday and always receive compliments</li>
            <li> It last all day long and that what I love about this body oil.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money only reason this product didn&#x27;t get 5 stars</li>
            <li> Nice thick consistency but not sticky.</li>
            <li> And the oils had such a strong, different</li>
            <li> There are other recent good reviews which leads me to believe that the formula must have been changed recently or something like that</li>
            <li> Which means it doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied during any time of day and its perfectly subtle for us ladies whereas Egyptian Musk is pretty much for men because its strong.</li>
            <li> I wore it ONLY on my wrists and met my boyfriend at the gym to workout (only because I got it in the mail today, I usually don&#x27;t wear perfume to the gym lol).</li>
            <li> Low price, great quality, and a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I think this is my new signature scent.</li>
            <li> but I thought I would try some new ones.</li>
            <li> I love this roll-on because it is such a simple yet complex sophisticated scent, as far as attracting the opposite sex, um well my husband hasn&#x27;t really reacted to much</li>
            <li> It smells so good and is very subtle.</li>
            <li> Auric Blends makes quite a few very nicely scented oils and with the oils, a little bit is all you need.  </li>
            <li> Very soft</li>
            <li> This smelled very old lady for me.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it, it is very soft.</li>
            <li> so if you are looking for something strong and long lasting this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Last a long time and isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Smells like old lady!</li>
            <li> Nice body oil not good as I was hoping</li>
            <li> soft and musky!</li>
            <li> I will always wear this scent for as long as it exists; it has been my long standing favorite for nearly 14 years now.</li>
            <li> So pretty and feminine and different.  </li>
            <li> I usually mix it with Love.</li>
            <li> I have fond memories of Auric Memories when the roll ons first came out in the mid 90s.</li>
            <li> I posted a review earlier when I first got the product.</li>
            <li> Ive bought many times before and usually stronger.</li>
            <li> , This was my first and last time.</li>
            <li> Start with a little dab and wait to see how strong it gets on</li>
            <li> This is a very sophisticated roll-on oil and lasts about half the day but small enough that you can toss it in your bag, it is light, and classy</li>
            <li> My biggest tip if you want to get the full effects, is to put this around the hot spots on your body, such as in between your cleavage, back of neck, and inner elbow.</li>
            <li> and it was half filled bc</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick , and the product was as expected.</li>
            <li> I am still on a search for a true Egyptian Musk Oil that actually lasts on your skin and one that you can actually smell!!!</li>
            <li> At first when i rolled it on, i could smell it, but after the initial use, the smell COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED.</li>
            <li> At first when I rolled it on, I could smell it, but after the initial use, the smell COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and sensual and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> it is very profound....</li>
            <li> I called the company and complained and was told that the fragrance was enhanced with time which seemed logical to me as the original order sat for some time before I used it.</li>
            <li> But on the contrary Kuumba Made brand makes a good Egyptian Musk, but the scent of their oil is still on the weak side, but it is definitely there.  </li>
            <li> I have seen this time and again in multiple venues for oils where they dilute the pure oils to stretch profits.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to buy the large bottle, but it had mixed reviews, so I got 3 of the roll-ons.</li>
            <li> , I received a run around that consisted of large gaps between their responses, excuses for why their &amp;#34;resending&amp;#34; of my perfumes didn&#x27;t arrive and that they would put a rush on sending it AGAIN only to have literally nearly a month go by before I received ANY replacement perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you like deeper scents with a little more musk then you will definitely like this.</li>
            <li> But i definitely get compliments at the start of the day, and a little faded remnants of the scent when I ask people if they can smell it still (making sure it&#x27;s not me just used to the smell).</li>
            <li> The scent of Egyptian Goddess is hard to discribe for me but get it you will love it too!&lt;br /&gt;Super</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, but this one I ordered had hardly any smell to it.</li>
            <li> and some sellers may have old stock of it.</li>
            <li> Of all I&#x27;ve sampled from Amazon.com, this is by far the nicest.  </li>
            <li> It is cheaply priced, but not cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> something young person scent maybe</li>
            <li> I did not get any compliments while wearing it, while my adult son did say &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was on and off about ordering some reviews said old lady smell</li>
            <li> wow  </li>
            <li> So far I think its a 50/50 with Auric Perfume.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for mature women.</li>
            <li> It literally just smells like nasty plastic void of all that made that scent the wonderful scent it should be: (  If you EVER make it the way your company used to, please let me be the first to know as I would be so very happy to buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that I am HOPING you have fixed it</li>
            <li> shopping in a tourist town near my home town, I happened into a medievil shop by chance and there on the counter</li>
            <li> I would not say that the oil smells old, it just seems that the ratio of scent to carrier oil has been reduced.</li>
            <li> : smells like old oil and it has no smell</li>
            <li> It smelled like a perfume that&#x27;s been overtaken by sweat or natural body order ( not BO) .</li>
            <li> The bottle I have lasted me a year so far</li>
            <li> and I am not even near done with it.</li>
            <li> Everyone in the house (even the boys) applied it on our wrists, the smell is soft yet the aroma has a noticeable presence.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t smell the \\&quot;old lady smell\\</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 scents this was my least favorite</li>
            <li> I personally think it smells musty and is very overpowering.</li>
            <li> The smell is for an old lady.</li>
            <li> this oil,  saying there was either NO SCENT or a scent that smelled musty like an old lady.  </li>
            <li> Masculine?</li>
            <li> I like getting it in person, but the last time I bought Egyptian Goddess online, the smell was really &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> smells like old hoe house.</li>
            <li> It really changes to blend with different body chemistries.  </li>
            <li> Would still recommend product but just know they will not come through with offers..</li>
            <li> The smell lasts all day and it is really intensified when your body warms up from physical activity, which I like as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a perfume fanatic and am in love with this perfume oil.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered my Egyptian Goddess perfume oil on Amazon, it was being sold by Old Glory.</li>
            <li> These oils must have been old because they didn&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
            <li> Which, btw, this is marked as though it&#x27;s sold by Auric Blends</li>
            <li> choose another fragrance if you want to have a soft scent, this has none.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of roller ball bottle - no spilling, no waste.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this blend at my local whole foods store for years</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected, I expected more of a spicy/balsamic and heady musk.</li>
            <li> Very strong, musky, but not pleasant, scent.</li>
            <li> refund posted and although I appreciate your gesture in sending those smaller amounts of perfume, I am saddened all over again that the Egyptian Goddess is FAR from the correct smell, yet again!!!  </li>
            <li> This is a very light subtle musk smell reminiscent of the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s musk cologne, but much cleaner and lighter.</li>
            <li> It has an OK fragrance but is not exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It is strong enough that other people notice apparently.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess has a warm &amp; sensual musky tone to it, but is subtle at the same time.  </li>
            <li> My personal description of the scent is green like new grass, powdery, a bit spicy, and light floral sweetness.</li>
            <li> Subtle, sexy, earthy smell.  </li>
            <li> Subtle, Sexy ...</li>
            <li> I love this subtle yet ever-present scent!&lt;br /&gt;Never overpowering...</li>
            <li> When previously using this scent, I don&#x27;t remember the scent fading so quickly.</li>
            <li> It has long been my favorite everyday perfume.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even sure that it would smell like Egyptian musk, but it does - maybe a tiny bit lighter, but I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> Love it, hard to find anywhere else because it&#x27;s such a great scent it sells out like crazy.</li>
            <li> It is a little sweet smelling for me</li>
            <li> The roller ball applicator is really cool, I just wish the scent was a little stronger and lasted longer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s it fresh, new &amp; not watered down!</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained that the scent was too soft, but I found it to be way to strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> The  musk tones down other perfumes making them more palatable.</li>
            <li> I read such rave reviews of Egyptian Goddess, so when I ordered it I had high hopes, however it barely has ANY scent to it.</li>
            <li> (name) FINALLY followed up with my phone calls and emails weeks after I began contacting her and eventually sent out two new bottles which contained oils that literally smelled like NO SCENT and almost like plastic in fact.</li>
            <li> the years the line has grown to include new scents, solid fragrance and now lotion!  </li>
            <li> You can get the same stuff from your local whole foods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked this scent my whole life and finally got it, only to have this happen.  </li>
            <li> I have random people tell me how good I smell constantly.</li>
            <li> it smells like no other egyptian musk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been sensitive to scents and other perfumes, and most make me quite ill, but as Auric Blends uses REAL OILS to make REAL PERFUME it doesn&#x27;t bother me or make me ill.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It a strong smell, use it only in small amounts.</li>
            <li> Please consider going back to the original full scent that I have become obsessed with.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend as long as you know what Egyptian musk oil smells like heck</li>
            <li> the smell is so light its hard to smell it.</li>
            <li> My initial inquiry began in August of 2013 as I had ordered a bottle for my Mom and myself only to be gravely disappointed that there was only the faintest of smells (at best) in our oil.  </li>
            <li> I even took the bottle and rolled it ALL over me and asked others if they could smell it and they could barely smell it as well.  </li>
            <li> i can barely smell it</li>
            <li> The scent is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I could barely smell anything so here</li>
            <li> I only applied the oil to my arm near my wrist and it&#x27;s been 5 hours</li>
            <li> kinda like wet dog, I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li> I have smelled this smell on several old ladies before.</li>
            <li> and he threw his head back and said eewww that smells like old lady.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to let it age or heat it up or do any sort of these bogus things to make the scent apparent.</li>
            <li> I put some on and can barely smell it .  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how hippie it is maybe if it were a little less potent.</li>
            <li> their went so far as to send me smaller &amp;#34;samples&amp;#34; of Egyptian Goddes which were worse than the first replacements!!!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was the roller, it was crooked which prevented my from closing the top properly.</li>
            <li> I have been so disappointed these last eight months that I haven&#x27;t been able to enjoy this scent</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this scent all the time, even from people with those extra sensitive noses that don&#x27;t care for traditional &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; types of smells.</li>
            <li> Most commercial perfumes leave me feeling naseous, headache, dizzy or confused.</li>
            <li> not alot needed being oil, and it does not dry your skin like perfume because it does not contian alcohol</li>
            <li> for the scent, a lot of reviews are very general about the actual scent</li>
            <li> I discovered this scent 16 yrs ago in a tiny gift shop and have worn no other scent since.</li>
            <li> I first came across it at a little boutique.</li>
            <li> So, if first time use, a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> such a subtle smell but strong enough to call attention.&lt;br /&gt;everyone</li>
            <li> suspicion is they &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down their once great smell with so much oil that it no longer has any scent or that perhaps they ran out of the correct ingredients and are sellling these awful versions until they are back on track with the right formula.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way; just stick to a little over the pulse points to keep from overwhelming the people around you.</li>
            <li> There is a slight musk to it and the smell really does change according to your body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Like the small size to carry in my purse, soft very feminine smell.  </li>
            <li> I brought my new bottle on a girls getaway weekend with a friend and was SO disappointed in the product that I called Auric Blends right from our hotel room, left a detailed message and followed up with an email after I returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light and slightly weak sent.</li>
            <li> Thick Oil Based not watered down, Speedy delivery, Last all day scent no need to reapply, Definitely purchase if looking for authentic Egyptian musk</li>
            <li> I am confused and wondering if the less positive reviews were true and this perfume really had little to no scent!</li>
            <li> It is similar to my Clinique Aromatics Elixir but a little more subtle.  </li>
            <li> The scent is barely noticeable less fragrant than the oils I bought directly from manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This particular one is a little powdery for my taste.</li>
            <li> Guess I learned my lesson: pay full price through the actual distributor instead of some random shop with old stock at discounted prices.</li>
            <li> Same as other, barely can smell it and does not last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle and very fresh.</li>
            <li> This is quite unfortunate because the scent was nice from the samples I tried previously...</li>
            <li> Leaving my very pale skin with a very noticeable red mark.</li>
            <li> It is twice as much as the product I usually buy and a fraction of the strength.</li>
            <li> never sure if I like this brand much</li>
            <li> Not sure if you mix your oils or buy them ready made,</li>
            <li> Would not buy again very musty and not sexy.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> This definitely lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> but I dont know if she had a different brand because the smell doesnt stay on as long</li>
            <li> Defiantly a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> This was a barely if not unnoticeable fragrance.  </li>
            <li> but it doesnt last long at all..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely returning this, especially after reading that the same thing happened to several other customers.</li>
            <li> this smell is intoxicating and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they are diluting it down or using old oils, or</li>
            <li> I was so surprised he could smell it when I only rolled a little bit on my wrist.</li>
            <li> IT LAST A VERY LONG TIME IN YOU</li>
            <li> The last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why some of the other comments say it barely has any scent...?</li>
            <li> This new formula is definitely not as fragrant as in the past</li>
            <li> so disappointed got me all excited the first day then nothing.</li>
            <li> older person too not sure..</li>
            <li> Almost smells a little bit \\&quot;old lady-ish.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought a little vial of it one summer afternoon in a crystal shop in Old Town and it lasted forever.</li>
            <li> a little testimomy to an old friend that still remains affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do smell the musk that people were talking about on reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t make you smell like an old lady like the heavy musky scents.</li>
            <li> only spent 4 bucks</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It lasts long.</li>
            <li> you have to try this and lasts a long time too</li>
            <li> and it was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> No old lady nonsense, but a scent gives off an aura of mystery, sensuality, and power.</li>
            <li> The oil lasts a long time but does not overpower.</li>
            <li> long as they still make them I will remain a repeat customer.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The Auric Blends Egyptian arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Its very subtle but bold...</li>
            <li> I first came across this sensual smelling oil years ago at a local drug store, but the business went under, and I was never able to locate this little product down until I recently, when I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Egyptian musk from other companies, this one doesn&#x27;t last as long as others I have bought.</li>
            <li> but it is long lasting and only takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other recent 1 star reviews, something has been changed with this perfume oil.</li>
            <li> I even asked several other people what they thought of it, and they could not detect any fragrance at all.  </li>
            <li> but I will try other oils as they cost next to nothing.</li>
            <li> but I personally have to mix it with other fragrances to come up with something that I like.  </li>
            <li> I have bought some other brands that smell stronger and last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A week later a different person from the original person I had been emailing back and forth with from Auric Blends sent me this: Hello, I am sorry to hear you are not satisfied with our product.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the same, but close.</li>
            <li> We also noticed the smell changed person to person due to pheromones and individual body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I have learned from other users of this product that Auric Blends has changed the Egyptian Goddess scent in the last six months or so.</li>
            <li> and I asked several other people what they thought of it</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the scent wasn&#x27;t as strong as my first purchase from another vendor.</li>
            <li> This product lasts a VERY long time beings its oil.</li>
            <li> The scent is virtually very minimal and not lasting.</li>
            <li> But I can barely smell this, and what I do smell is the already mentioned pencil shavings, rubber and a little bit of sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> After receiving the first one that was broken, this seller sent a second bottle at no charge to me.it was wrapped very carefully and arrived in one piece.</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase when the fragrance smelled like Jovan musk oil that anyone can buy in a local drugstore.</li>
            <li> the oil is really loose you can smell it but to me you have to put alot on.</li>
            <li> I just wish it came in a bigger size, a little goes a long way but still.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it does last all day.</li>
            <li> I used almost half the bottle on my entire legs and arms and still no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I bought this same item previously, and still have half of a bottle left.</li>
            <li> but I think it is super silly.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, so an oilier skin type may hold the fragrance longer.</li>
            <li> That shop closed several years ago and I was disappointed to find that there wasn&#x27;t another shop who could duplicate my favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> The only issues I have is there was no true sent..smells like veggie oil.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my purse in case I go out for lunch and come back to work smelling like food; I can put on a little touch up.  </li>
            <li> So this little bottle will last for years.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long LONG way with this product.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, to go from bad to worse was extremely disappointing as I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Egyptian Goddess and have worn it for years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so weak that I can&#x27;t really smell anything other than an oily fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This was money well spent.</li>
            <li> It was beyond what I expected.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s no real scent.</li>
            <li> The seller was prompt in getting these to me, well before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27; figure out why they would sell perfume that has absolutely no aroma.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no fragrance whatsoever to this oil.  </li>
            <li> I spent $30 on this</li>
            <li> Both bottles had absolutely no smell to them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known only a few people who wear this scent, but it&#x27;s one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I knew being oil it would be oily so thats expected, but I really do not like the scent.</li>
            <li> but that is expected with oil/perfumes....</li>
            <li> A few days after ordering online I was in a local shop that happened to have bottles of Auric Blends&#x27;s Egyptian Goddess.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money .</li>
            <li> This product was the same old smell that I have grown addicted to.</li>
            <li> it sucked plain and simple</li>
            <li> Nothing, other than a heavy oil smell reminiscent of vegetable oil.  </li>
            <li> E Goddess and a few other Auric scents tend to appear and  re-appear during the course of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Am fond of the entire line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrives quickly and is less expensive than what I can buy it for in my area.</li>
            <li> Was excited to find it at Amazon-so disappointing as I purchased two and neither had any fragrance.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed in this one considering it was a little pricier than some of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I only used a small dab on my wrists and had to wash it off a few hours later because I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore.</li>
            <li> It is soft and subtle.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and I always get complimented on the scent.</li>
            <li> Your body heat will sort of amplify the scent, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Also, the scent stays with you and doesn&#x27;t disappear and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the other &amp;#34;aromas&amp;#34; that others describe, and it&#x27;s certainly not scent-less, or abrasive to the skin as I&#x27;ve read in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> So I picked up a few as they were inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Names like Night Queen, Black Coconut and Egyptian Goddess were novel back then.  </li>
            <li> Usually I get my oil from the African man with a cart of oils and incense in the city, but it&#x27;s winter</li>
            <li> I have tried it before, and knew it worked for me, which not to other buyers: try scents BEFORE you buy them.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I received it and the aroma was not as potent as I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li> I layer it with other scents and it lifts my mood.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle and sprayed I could faintly smell the scent of Egyptian Musk, but once I sprayed it on it, the scent was non-existent on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I will order it again,and any other fragrance that they might offer for sale.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had heeded the warnings given by the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed as it was an  extremely sexy fragrance when she walked by.....</li>
            <li> It also depends on how other people like these smells.</li>
            <li> I have tried other scents from Auric throughout the years, and this one I must say is the nicest.</li>
            <li> Seems like this one is a winner amongst men according to other reviews.</li>
            <li> Also when you roll the oil onto your wrist and try to rub it with your other to distribute the smell.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell this product, at least I think I can smell it.</li>
            <li> but it can be layered with other scents.</li>
            <li> I have other Egyptian musks from other brands that have a stronger scent than this brand.</li>
            <li> but it can be cranked up by adding other scents from the line.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> So sad I believe other review and but it without smell it first.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews re:</li>
            <li> From now on I will take heed in what I read from other customers.  </li>
            <li> I would now like to try some of the other perfumes this seller has to offer.</li>
            <li> I have asked 4 other adults and nobody can smell a thing.</li>
            <li> I wear it  in combo with other scents.  </li>
            <li> after I got it I realized I did smell this before on other women.</li>
            <li> For the past 7 years auric Blends Egyptian goddess oil has been the only scent I have worn.</li>
            <li> Sadly, as other reviews have stated...</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no smell, whatsoever!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a small hint of smell which you can only smell when you&#x27;re close by</li>
            <li> Other products are diluted or do not have the correct blend.</li>
            <li> It changes as my body heats up when I work out or when I&#x27;m otherwise active.</li>
            <li> Learned the hard way Egyptian Musk does not smell the same as Egyptian Goddess!</li>
            <li> Who wants to smell like a stale and musty grandma?</li>
            <li> but sadly it will go straight in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I will not ask seller for a return as it is not worth the postage but will not order again</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Needless to say i will absolutely purchase this product again</li>
            <li> It was just average.</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations after reading all the positive reviews, but this oil smells absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> Already halfway down two bottles</li>
            <li> The formula must have changed, it&#x27;s almost unrecognizable now, and the smell isn&#x27;t just watered down now</li>
            <li> is it being watered down a bit?</li>
            <li> $7 down the drain.</li>
            <li> This small, glass roll-on lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my bottle for over a year and just getting down to half.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the scent lasts all day, other times it fades after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Wish it was stronger and less oily feeling.</li>
            <li> and it goes hand in hand with what I said with the previous one.</li>
            <li> Not even subtly, I even bought a separate batch in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> It goes on slightly sticky and I smell ZERO Egyp.</li>
            <li> I agree with previous posters.</li>
            <li> but there is a slight difference.</li>
            <li> Has a richer scent than previous Egyptian musks I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Not good enough for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not sweet.</li>
            <li> Really wish roll-on came in bigger size :(</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it does not last long on my skin.</li>
            <li> I must add that I recently purchased a new one before my other one ran out and it was weaker :(</li>
            <li> All i do is rub a little on my arms and neck in the morning and thats it.</li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant in purchasing this after reading some of the review of others.</li>
            <li> I rolled a little on each arm crook (elbow pit?)</li>
            <li> I rolled on just a little.</li>
            <li> A little floral without being &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;d like to sweeten it a little bit,</li>
            <li> I want something a little stronger</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just a little...</li>
            <li> a little goes</li>
            <li> so when I saw the Auric Blends little roll on bottle</li>
            <li> A little dab on my wrists is all it takes</li>
            <li> I typically apply it to my collarbone, inner elbows, wrists, behind my ears.</li>
            <li> A very faint smell u can barely even smell it at all, its not a bad faint smell just not strong enouhh</li>
            <li> I can only say it was a big disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this before a few years ago</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday</li>
            <li> Waited a few days longer after Xmas.</li>
            <li> I hv gotten few of my friends hooked also.</li>
            <li> People literally stop me everyday and tell me I smell heavenly.</li>
            <li> If you purchase this &amp; can&#x27;t smell it, try it for a few days.</li>
            <li> But then after a few weeks or so (1/3 of the bottom has been used)</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money as it was a scentless oil.  </li>
            <li> I asked my husband to smell it after I had worn it for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I put it on, and after a few minutes I kept getting this smell that reminded me of summer flowers, blowing in the breeze with a hint of muskiness.</li>
            <li> You apply just a bit on your wrists and behind your ears, and it will last all day, afternoon, and evening.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles and totally wasted my dough.  </li>
            <li> My husband says he smells a &amp;#34;little something&amp;#34; but he has to put his nose right on my wrist or neck (which isn&#x27;t so bad...</li>
            <li> I totally concur with &amp;#34;jenerous&amp;#34; on the serious decline in quality of Egyptian Goddess!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not strong or overbearing.</li>
            <li> And it drives my high school sweetheart crazy.  </li>
            <li> oh my gosh, I loooove this little roller ball of heaven!</li>
            <li> Of course,  I found that a little hard to believe,  so decided to give it a chance being</li>
            <li> a little thick since its oil</li>
            <li> The last order seemed to be a very weak scent.</li>
            <li> not sure why</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk, because thats what it is !</li>
            <li> (I usually stay away from musky smells).</li>
            <li> It smells like old soap and musk, just dirty smelling.  </li>
            <li> I usually price check on this.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they no longer carry it locally.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered another scent from this seller as well and am anxious to give it a try when it arrives.</li>
            <li> To FINALLY receive my Egyptian Goddess after MONTHS of waiting only to open it and find it is NOT the Egyptian Goddess smell even in the slightest is beyond disappointing!!!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what has happened to your company since I first began order Egyptian Goddess from you, but I am terribly saddened to find that your product is no longer the same...</li>
            <li> It is normal for Egyptian Goddess to start out very faint and gain a stronger fragrance over time.</li>
            <li> I bought the small bottle because I didn&#x27;t know if either one of us would like it-</li>
            <li> What I did get was a small container of oil</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like or don&#x27;t like the cent.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the sandalwood scent</li>
            <li> and I can use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Usually he doesn&#x27;t notice my perfume</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t leave reviews on cosmetics</li>
            <li> I had purchased it a few years ago and could not find it anywhere!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mean that is not strong</li>
            <li> and it was strong) and am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> NOT sweet!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was a bootleg or what, bc after dabbing on a little, the scent vanishes and it becomes just unscented oil.  </li>
            <li> it is an oil base and it blends into the skin and the scent last a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to smell on yourself, but trust me others can smell it on you.</li>
            <li> It hardly has any smell at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li> It has hardly any scent.</li>
            <li> Hardly a scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even hardly roll it on,</li>
            <li> There is hardly any smell to it ...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money hardly has any sent , I would not</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m having a really hard time getting it to stay on me.  </li>
            <li> Not the least, tiniest bit.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts for at least 12 hours.</li>
            <li> even at the price it is such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it sucks.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive it, but once I did I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday!!</li>
            <li> But the bummer was the scent, that is, it was missing from the carrier oil!!  </li>
            <li> , I mean you can&#x27;t feel it at  all.</li>
            <li> Then tout them as delicate, subtle scents.  </li>
            <li> but...smells like old lady :(</li>
            <li> A VERY SMALL HINT.</li>
            <li> It is an oil though, and the size of the bottle should be a subtle hint-</li>
            <li> men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s subtle, not overbearing and this is scent I wear 99% of the time.</li>
            <li> I am giving two stars because the package arrived quickly, however, this scent smells awful.</li>
            <li> The smell isnt overpowering and it lasts all day even though to me the smell may become a little faint throughout the day</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this line of body oils right now.</li>
            <li> I feel bad only leaving one star..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it, but it&#x27;s not good at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t right, and gave me an awful headache.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m purchased from this seller, and when I opened the bottle, I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a pleasant smell .</li>
            <li> and it is really weak.</li>
            <li> but this oil is so weak</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the cheaper ones. :(</li>
            <li> I was hoping that once it was used and the air hit the oil it might help, but a week later and I am still disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was extremely weak (I wish my sense of smell was stronger).</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS JUNK!!!!!</li>
            <li> If my suspicion is correct, I am saddened they simply didn&#x27;t tell me the truth but continued to make a bad situation worse!  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of the poor scents sold in the 99 cent store or should I say 59 cent store.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that a perfumed oil called Egyptian Goddess was going to be too heavy.  </li>
            <li> poor customer service on their part.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering~ subtly intoxicating!</li>
            <li> Slightly musky, but not in a bad way</li>
            <li> The smell is not overpowering but very subtle.</li>
            <li> and now I can clearly identify when people are wearing disgusting chemical-y smelling perfume and cologne.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it seems it may have been watered down or something because it has no smell at all now :(.</li>
            <li> Again, the scent is very weak.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done me wrong yet.</li>
            <li> Fake product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really difficult to describe now that I&#x27;m trying, haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Something is wrong here with quality control.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this has almost no scent to me.</li>
            <li> It is clearly a fake or something is defective.</li>
            <li> Sorry, maybe I got a defective bottle.</li>
            <li> This smells faintly of plastic and soap rather than musk.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am ecstatic.</li>
            <li> even if you don&#x27;t you cant go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> It has a weird grandma/old lady smell.</li>
            <li> I think this one I got is fake .</li>
            <li> It smells weird</li>
            <li> But when I got it in the mail to say the least I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> They seem watered down, my son says the bottle spray smells like insect repellent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that what I expected in fragrance was terrible!  </li>
            <li> and she knows that something about Egyptian Goddess makes me go crazy for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> but this is definitely disappointing..</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> imagine my disappointment when I got this product and it smelled like ........</li>
            <li> #34;this didn&#x27;t work out&amp;#34; to which I replied: I too am terribly sad it didn&#x27;t work out!  </li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong for the price!?</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s actually unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Very very faint.  </li>
            <li> Very sad.</li>
            <li> Impossible to compare it to something else on the market.</li>
            <li> i got bad complements on it when i wore it</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad batch??</li>
            <li> Perhaps I received a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Even now thinking about it I can still remember how bad it smelled.</li>
            <li> This smells bad in the bottle,thought maybe body heat would improve the smell.</li>
            <li> It tugs painfully against your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get sick from it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased after reading all the rave reviews, but am a bit disappointed in its staying power.</li>
            <li> no nothing :(</li>
            <li> and i havent had anyone compliment it yet :(</li>
            <li> To say I am disappointed is an understatement.  </li>
            <li> Another disappointed customer here.</li>
            <li> Drives my husband crazy!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> but this product again ! :(</li>
            <li> And it stinks!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> but when they stopped caring this product I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just HATE being duped.  </li>
            <li> If you hate musk, then you might want to avoid; I know some people have a problem with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save your money moreover save yourself from being truly disappointed !</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!! my fav &amp; so glad I found it</li>
            <li> The best scent anywhere!</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead of schedule. smells good, but the smell doesn&#x60;t last as long as it used to. not sure why</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> Not good enough for me</li>
            <li> When I first received this product it smelled good in the bottle and when I put on.. The next day the smell was gone. It smells like nothing from the bottle and nothing when I put it on. I&#x27;m so disappointed got me all excited the first day then nothing.</li>
            <li> I got this because of all the great reviews, but it hardly smells at all.......it&#x27;s certainly cheap enough, but as they say &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;!! I&#x27;ll go back to using SKIN perfume musk....or WOMAN by Jovan....both are absolutely excellent....always get loads of compliments when i wear them.</li>
            <li> My husband got this for me and I put it on my wrists.  I smelled nothing.  I waited awhile and put a good amount more on the same spot.  My husband has a great sense of smell, yet neither of us could smell anything.  I just HATE being duped.  You got us this time, but never again!</li>
            <li> nice stuff, love the smell, i lke these blends very much thaks for your prompt service and not damaged or leaking i will be back when i get low on this oils.. thanks</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the poor scents sold in the 99 cent store or should I say 59 cent store. I often wondered what in the world cheap deodorant woman were wearing in NYC and now I know. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk, because thats what it is !&lt;br /&gt;You been warned. It should cost 25 cents at most.....and used to oil a squeaky door hinge.</li>
            <li> Smells like old lady!</li>
            <li> This light warm scent is very pleasant.  The fragrance also lasts without fade much longer than most I have purchased in my life.  I also love the roller ball better than sprays as you have more control of the amount applied and the location so I can put it right where I want it.  All of that and a great price.  I will definately be order more.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail yesterday. I rolled the Egyptian Goddess oil on my wrist to try it out about 15 hrs. ago and I can still smell it. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering it all, just enough so someone close by can detect it, which is how I like it...I don&#x27;t want to smell like an explosion at the perfume factory. It does not smell a thing like air freshener. It&#x27;s a warm, light, very slightly musky scent. I have many skin allergies (certain soaps and metals such as nickel), but this didn&#x27;t cause me any problems. I am very happy with my purchase. I also ordered the African Musk and Rose oils, which I also liked very much, but the Egyptian Goddess is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a very different smell, but in a good way. I put it on today, and couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it! I rolled the oil on at 11am and it is 9pm. I still smell it!  I also already got complimented on it. I do smell the musk that people were talking about on reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t make you smell like an old lady like the heavy musky scents. This was money well spent.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a deliciously spicy scent. If you like deeper scents with a little more musk then you will definitely like this. It&#x27;s a little too heavy for my taste to wear during the day, but it&#x27;s perfect to wear out in the evening. Very sultry! The perfume oil LASTS! If you put it on your wrists before you go out in the evening, you&#x27;ll wake up the next morning still smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I bought some Egyptian musk on Amazon before. I loved it but the seller ran out. I bought this hoping it would smell something close to what I had before. It was beyond what I expected. I love this oil and I plan to buy it often.</li>
            <li> Nice body oil not good as I was hoping but it&#x27;s worth buying. Just don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents! I get compliments all the time.... It&#x27;s a subtle musty and beautiful scent that is perfect for any season. I buy more than one at a time so I do not run out.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and it isn&#x27;t too oily</li>
            <li> You get a good amount of this product for the money, and after reading a ton of rave reviews for the scent online I was convinced that I&#x27;d love it. Not so much...it smells kinda old-lady-ish. It&#x27;s not the spicy/musky/floral scent that I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Excellent scent, thick and the scent last a long time when wearing it, but not overpowering.  I have received many request asking what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> i love this scent and get told how great i smell all the time. will buy again and again and again</li>
            <li> Good...smells good...a little thick since its oil...Yes I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments when I wear this scent than I do when I wear Creed!!!</li>
            <li> I smelled this on a friend &amp; was in love with her for the day. Bought it for myself &amp; now I&#x27;m in love with me!! This oil is so amazing &amp; smells more lushious as time goes on but never overpowering. Nice thick consistency but not sticky. This roll on bottle will last forever ;) thanks so much for this wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 bottles and not one of them smelled, very very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> Love the smell! it&#x27;s warm and inviting. Slightly musky, but not in a bad way (I usually stay away from musky smells). Anyways, I ordered it and it came in under a week, I&#x27;m very impressed with the service and the scent! Yay</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this scent.  It&#x27;s a beautiful feminine musk.  I wish it was more potent but from other reviews I guess it takes some time for the scent to get stronger in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other recent 1 star reviews, something has been changed with this perfume oil. I have purchased this before a few years ago and I loved it.  I decided to buy it again since it used to be a great product and now the scent is completely different. I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it, but it&#x27;s not good at all and it is really weak. There are other recent good reviews which leads me to believe that the formula must have been changed recently or something like that and some sellers may have old stock of it. My bottle came with the new design and full label on it instead of the older design that had the painted feathers on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am always seeking and trying out Egyptian musk fragrances.  Of all I&#x27;ve sampled from Amazon.com, this is by far the nicest.  I put it on after my shower, and if I place it under my garments, it stays on and fresh for hours.  I am almost out,  and will buy more.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is how quickly it has disappeared!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for years and love it but this oil is so weak I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money. It is twice as much as the product I usually buy and a fraction of the strength. Usually I get my oil from the African man with a cart of oils and incense in the city, but it&#x27;s winter and I haven&#x27;t seen him around. Otherwise I get it from the Indians that run the convenient store up the road, but they often don&#x27;t have my scent stocked. Thought I would give this brand a try (I remember using this brand years ago with a different scent and it was strong) and am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The best!! So many complements, and a great layering scent.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect gift. It is one of my mother&#x27;s favorite oils, and she has used it for years and it is perfect. It smells wonderful and it very alluring. I recommend this to anyone who wants to have a nice smelling oil instead of perfume!</li>
            <li> Like the small size to carry in my purse, soft very feminine smell.  The smell is not overpowering but very subtle.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this scent! It smells amazing</li>
            <li> the oil is really loose you can smell it but to me you have to put alot on. my boyfriend seems to like it though</li>
            <li> When I get hugs everyone says I smell &#x27;so good&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Once a day application is all it takes. I highly recommend this product! I will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year. All i do is rub a little on my arms and neck in the morning and thats it. The smell isnt overpowering and it lasts all day even though to me the smell may become a little faint throughout the day but surprisingly others are able to still smell it on me. I get so many compliments...from both men and women. Most commercial perfumes leave me feeling naseous, headache, dizzy or confused. Egyptian Goddess does none of that and it also gives me an uplifting and relaxed feeling. Its like peace in a bottle :) I love it. I wear it everyday!!</li>
            <li> love this stuff! soft and musky! Just need to reapply more often.</li>
            <li> There was nothing alluring about this fragrance at all!  It smells like old soap and musk, just dirty smelling.  I could not wait to get if off my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. When previously using this scent, I don&#x27;t remember the scent fading so quickly. But i definitely get compliments at the start of the day, and a little faded remnants of the scent when I ask people if they can smell it still (making sure it&#x27;s not me just used to the smell).</li>
            <li> I just recieved my bottle today, I am EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THIS OIL, I have been wearing egyptian musk for years, the first bottle that I had purchased years ago, smelled exactly like this egyptian goddess, have not been able to find this scent now that I have , I will purchase more, pls don&#x27;t change this scent. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I usually price check on this.  I don&#x27;t always buy from Amazon.  This perfume oil is wonderful and I am always getting compliments on it.  It is cheaply priced, but not cheaply made.  This is a better perfume than most of the expensive brands on the market.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it almost everyday and I (as well as my friends) consider it my “signature scent”. It arrives quickly and is less expensive than what I can buy it for in my area. I would recommend this to any woman who likes an exotic scent that isn&#x27;t like anything from B&amp;B works.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these at a local vegetable market and loved it immediately - the scent is so amazing.  However, the ones I received just didn&#x27;t carry the scent of the one I bought locally.  Unfortunately, they no longer carry it locally.  Wish it was stronger and less oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I love love love the scent.  It is musky and floral at the same time.  Very light- but people ALWAYS notice the awesome smell... they always ask where I got it.  This seller has the right scent- Dont buy this from another seller, because it is not the same scent.</li>
            <li> Originally bought a couple of these for Christmas gifts. I was so excited to put these in some stockings because I wear it and I love the smell. People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing so I figured it&#x27;d be a cute small gift that someone could enjoy as much as I do. I was suppose to receive them the day before Xmas eve. The day came and went. Waited a few days longer after Xmas. And nothing. I emailed the seller and they said &amp;#34;it got lost in the mail&amp;#34;, and then said they recently out of stock. Bunch of BS to me. You can get the same stuff from your local whole foods. So that&#x27;s what I did.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh n clean not overpowering. When im hot in summer it doesnt wear off it brings out scent more. I have always been complimented on it n I hv gotten few of my friends hooked also. Really wish roll-on came in bigger size :(</li>
            <li> I smell so good! People literally stop me everyday and tell me I smell heavenly. Not overpowering~ subtly intoxicating! If you purchase this &amp; can&#x27;t smell it, try it for a few days. I put it on the top of my hands &amp; rub together (not my palms) and then I put it on my wrists &amp; rub my wrists on my shirt. I bet you will get compliments. It&#x27;s hard to smell on yourself, but trust me others can smell it on you. Come on ladies, isn&#x27;t it fabulous when strangers stop you and say &amp;#34;you smell like a goddess&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not a sales person. I&#x27;m simply in love with Egyptian Goddess!!</li>
            <li> My order of Egyptian Musk oil arrived quickly and in good shape...I LOVE this oil, it smells fantastic and is my very favorite body oil!  The service was quick and my product arrived very quickly.  Thank You!!!   :o)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the scent ...only thing it did for me was give me a headache an with that I could definitely have done without! But to each thier own!</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift and it is true that is does change with each persons body chemistry. There were 4 of us that tried it on and it smelled differently on each of us. But everyone agreed it smelled nice.</li>
            <li> A very faint smell u can barely even smell it at all, its not a bad faint smell just not strong enouhh</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that there was no sent to this oil and they&#x27;re right! I used almost half the bottle on my entire legs and arms and still no fragrance.  Shipping was good so I would probably buy a different product from them in the future, just not this. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this product. It&#x27;s very mysterious and I receive compliments on it every time I wear it. Will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this out of curiosity, as it was my first body oil ever. It has a mild sweet smell that stays around for a while, which is very pleasing. I&#x27;ve ordered another scent from this seller as well and am anxious to give it a try when it arrives. So far, I have been satisfied by this fragrant oil.</li>
            <li> never sure if I like this brand much and I bought several. its just ok like of not as natural smelling as I wish, bit potent bit nice..not best though but my mother liked it if mixing it with musk she said helped get her compliments when I gave it to her, so maybe some mix better on others or if put with other scents right-maybe its not 30&#x27;s something young person scent maybe older person too not sure..if that helps you decide if right for you.</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations for this scent based on the many positive reviews.  But I just don&#x27;t like the smell.  It is very floral, and almost overwhelming.  I just prefer more musky oils, so it is probably just a personal bias.  I did not get any compliments while wearing it, while my adult son did say &#x27;&#x27;what&#x27;s that smell?&#x27;&#x27; once.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing scent, very mysterious, sexy, and alluring, yet soft and almost smoldering, and you only have to use a couple drops worth too. Very well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough good about it! not alot needed being oil, and it does not dry your skin like perfume because it does not contian alcohol, my girlfriend has been wearing this for years and it smells like a goddess should!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful musk oil. Soft and intimate.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but there&#x27;s no real scent. I put it on and waited a while for it to react to my body chemistry...nothing.</li>
            <li> Thiese arrived and I was totally dissapointed as this is my favorite fragrance.  They did not smell at all!!  Sent them back.</li>
            <li> Purchased this never having tried any Auric Blends products.  Love this and get LOTS of compliments when I wear it.  Subtle, sexy, earthy smell.  NOT sweet!! Will definately buy this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Nice light, fresh, pleasant scent.  Not musky or strong like nag champa or patchouli.  It has long been my favorite everyday perfume.  I love the roller oil- it doesn&#x27;t stick and absorbs into skin well.  Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I was on and off about ordering some reviews said old lady smell lol  I  bought egyption musk at an outdoor sale it sucked plain and simple only spent 4 bucks but I don&#x27;t like wasting money....I just recieved today and wow  it smells clean and soft and is the richest I put a dab on and it is very profound....get this it&#x27;s great and I&#x27;m picky believe it</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the good reviews...  It is too strong, it reminds me Shalimar fragrance but if you planning to use it to scare a man go for it.  OMG it is horrible.</li>
            <li> Have repurchased many, many times! LOVE. It&#x27;s a staple, it just smells warm and delicious and clean and perfect! I layer this under practically everything. Will never be without!</li>
            <li> This scent linger a soft and warm.  I am regularly complimented when I wear this. I do wish that it came in a bigger roll-on.  I tend to use a lot of it. It just smells so good. I never thought I would enjoy something with \\&quot;musk\\&quot; in it&#x27;s description,  but it&#x27;s such a womanly and sensual scent. I&#x27;m only 20 and adore this.</li>
            <li> I like this smell, but mostly because I love EM. This particular one is a little powdery for my taste. Personally, I like my EM to be more sweet and musky. This one is nice however, and has a lingering scent that changes sweet after a few hours. Not overpowering, so no headaches and very clean.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not my favorite, but good enough to wear until I find the one.</li>
            <li> Wear it every day, have for years. always gets compliments.</li>
            <li> The smell was nice, but a little soapy, my boyfriend said it smelled like bathroom air freshener, which isn&#x27;t what I was going for.  It also made me break out in a red, itchy rash on my neck the next morning.  Not for me.  I will probably give it to someone else they may have better luck with it than I did.</li>
            <li> This definitely lasts all day long.  I put it on in the morning and could smell it on my skin when I got into bed at night.  Not a bad frangrance -- definitely musky -- but not my favorite either.  I am more of a bright fragrance person so I am going to try the coco mango scent and see if I like that a little bit more.  I don&#x27;t dislike Egyptian Goddess but I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.  Almost smells a little bit \\&quot;old lady-ish.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have bought this scent for the 2nd time, trying to give it a second chance.  There is absolutely NO lasting smell to this oil  whatsoever.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS JUNK!!!!!</li>
            <li> Has no scent whatsoever!  I even asked several other people what they thought of it, and they could not detect any fragrance at all.  Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> So happy I found this because Whole Foods no longer carries this line of body oil. Product arrived in just 3 days and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling oil, I am not in love with it. It is not what I expected, I expected more of a spicy/balsamic and heady musk. It is a little sweet smelling for me but I will try other oils as they cost next to nothing. This came before the estimated delivery date so I am happy with this seller.</li>
            <li> This Egyptian Goddess blend is a great scent, but tends to be on the thick side, almost sticky when first applied. I have very dry skin, so an oilier skin type may hold the fragrance longer. I can&#x27;t smell it after 30 minutes or so. I purchased after reading all the rave reviews, but am a bit disappointed in its staying power. Just keep reapplying!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a nice start  but I personally have to mix it with other fragrances to come up with something that I like.  if I put a little vanilla musk or coconut fragrance with it, it smells nice!</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells wonderful! Gave it for a gift!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for personal use, or for a gift!</li>
            <li> Sexy? Sensual? Not the least, tiniest bit. Who wants to smell like a stale and musty grandma? There&#x27;s absolutely nothing goddess about this scent. Very disappointed. This almost feels like a practical joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m wondering if this scent, prior to the formula change about which many have posted, was actually quite lovely. I&#x27;ll probably never know.</li>
            <li> Felt like I had to keep putting this on and the smell is so light its hard to smell it. It came in a Big box with one in it and pkg good. I just hope it smells better as time goes on. I like to smell my Perfume. It was to light of a smell as far as I am concerned. So far I think its a 50/50 with Auric Perfume. I have bought some other brands that smell stronger and last.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing egyptian musk for a while and by far this is one of the best scent oil out there.  I recently try the Auric Blends and I must say I have heads turning.  People would stop me and ask me what do I have on because the scent is very smooth.  This oil stays on you all day.  I would recommend this oil to anyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with the add on program. Once received it was everything you could ever dream of... But then after a few weeks or so (1/3 of the bottom has been used) the fragrance stated to diminish? As of right now it smells like pure oil, no fragrance no nothing :(.. But anyways, it was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li> great to keep in a makeup bag to reapply if you like during the day. Egyptian musk is one of my favorites. this one smells very nice.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Egyptian musk from other companies, this one doesn&#x27;t last as long as others I have bought. Kind of disappointed in this one considering it was a little pricier than some of the others I have tried. I&#x27;m going back to the cheaper ones. :(</li>
            <li> Great scent. Received quickly. I would recommend this product for mature women. My daughter preferred &amp;#34;love&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Can be a great stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff!!! The scent never goes away! All of my friends are hooked on egyptian goddess now too!!!</li>
            <li> It smelled ok.... never noticed the smell change or disappear like other oils.</li>
            <li> This new formula is definitely not as fragrant as in the past (But I knew to expect this as I have purchased Egyptian Goddess and worn it for years. I do miss the older formula and hope that Auric Blends will go back to the original) The seller was prompt in getting these to me, well before the expected delivery date. Well protected packaging materials and I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> This is a sexy smell! I love it. It works well with my body chemistry and  I can still smell it by the end of the day. I have tried it before, and knew it worked for me, which not to other buyers: try scents BEFORE you buy them. The shipping was quick , and the product was as expected.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess is my FAVORITE scent. A little goes a long way and I always get complimented on the scent.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for about ten years. It is a great price I have seen it in stores for a lot of money but, great and better price here</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to take a chance and buy a perfume I&#x27;ve never smelt before. Won&#x27;t be making that mistake again. It smells like cheap dollar store perfume. I held up my wrist to everyone in my family and asked if they like it and everyone wrinkled their noses and said not at all. To add insult to injury, I had to jump through hoops corresponding with the seller and Amazon over the course of over 2 weeks. Don&#x27;t make this mistake. Don&#x27;t buy a perfume until you can smell it first.</li>
            <li> My favorite smell! I have been wearing it for 15 years and I&#x27;m never disappointed. This seller is great! I am going to buy another bottle today actually!!</li>
            <li> I smelled this on a lady when I went out to a bar and she told me it was this. It does smell the same way but I dont know if she had a different brand because the smell doesnt stay on as long and i havent had anyone compliment it yet :(</li>
            <li> Shipping was okay. I like the smell of this and I would buy this again. I wear this to work. It lasts long.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother ordering this.  It has no fragrance at all.  Nothing, other than a heavy oil smell reminiscent of vegetable oil.  I can&#x27; figure out why they would sell perfume that has absolutely no aroma.  I know it was cheap but so is Jovan musk oil and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I get complemented all the time on this fragrance and people always ask what I&#x27;m wearing and where they can buy it.</li>
            <li> I totally concur with &amp;#34;jenerous&amp;#34; on the serious decline in quality of Egyptian Goddess!  When I started wearing this scent over a decade ago it was a wonderfully pleasant, pungent scent with staying power; one that I could smell throughout the day and even on my sweaters after wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last summer, I purchased two bottles (one for me and one for my Mom who happened to smell it on me and fall in love with it &amp;#34;first smell&amp;#34; just as I had done!) only to be gravely dissapointed in the smell (or lack thereof!).  I brought my new bottle on a girls getaway weekend with a friend and was SO disappointed in the product that I called Auric Blends right from our hotel room, left a detailed message and followed up with an email after I returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From that email on, I received a run around that consisted of large gaps between their responses, excuses for why their &amp;#34;resending&amp;#34; of my perfumes didn&#x27;t arrive and that they would put a rush on sending it AGAIN only to have literally nearly a month go by before I received ANY replacement perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my original email to them on August 18, my replacement perfumes didn&#x27;t arrive until November 4 and after smellingmy &amp;#34;replacements&amp;#34;, I emailed them this: I will be expressing this sentiment on paper when I return what you FINALLY shipped to me. To say I am disappointed is an understatement.  To FINALLY receive my Egyptian Goddess after MONTHS of waiting only to open it and find it is NOT the Egyptian Goddess smell even in the slightest is beyond disappointing!!!!  I don&#x27;t know what has happened to your company since I first began order Egyptian Goddess from you, but I am terribly saddened to find that your product is no longer the same...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed them again once I knew my return had arrived and then they apologized &amp;#34;this didn&#x27;t work out&amp;#34; to which I replied: I too am terribly sad it didn&#x27;t work out!  Not sure if you mix your oils or buy them ready made, but ifthe scent ever returns to how it should smell, please let me know as THAT is worth buying and I would be happy to buy it again at that time: )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even their went so far as to send me smaller &amp;#34;samples&amp;#34; of Egyptian Goddes which were worse than the first replacements!!!  I followed THAT package receipt with this email:&lt;br /&gt;My refund posted and although I appreciate your gesture in sending those smaller amounts of perfume, I am saddened all over again that the Egyptian Goddess is FAR from the correct smell, yet again!!!  It literally just smells like nasty plastic void of all that made that scent the wonderful scent it should be: (  If you EVER make it the way your company used to, please let me be the first to know as I would be so very happy to buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In February I emailed them this: Have you been able to make Egyptian Goddess the correct way yet!?  I cannot tell you how DAILY, I am wishing for this scent to be what it once was so I can buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They never responded to that email so I email them this in April: I emailed a few weeks ago and thought I&#x27;d try again: )  Have you corrected your formula for Egyptian Goddess into it&#x27;s original WONDERFUL pungent smell?!?!  I have been so disappointed these last eight months that I haven&#x27;t been able to enjoy this scent that I am HOPING you have fixed it and I can try ordering it again.  Let me know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later a different person from the original person I had been emailing back and forth with from Auric Blends sent me this: Hello, I am sorry to hear you are not satisfied with our product. It is normal for Egyptian Goddess to start out very faint and gain a stronger fragrance over time. Egyptian Goddess is a musk based fragrance and is somewhat volatile in nature which causes it to fluctuate a bit based on the age of the blend. Basically, the older the fragrance gets, the stronger it gets.  The first thing we recommend is to allow the fragrance to sit for a coupleof weeks and see if it gets stronger as it ages because “fresh” blends haven’t been allowed the time for all the components to coalesce.  We try to ship only those batches that have had the time needed to age properly, but sometimes we find ourselves in a situation where the demand is greater than our supply and we must ship out what we have!  We run quality control checks on all of our perfumes before we bottle them to be sure that the blends are within our acceptable fragrance range. The product you received has passed this testing.  Please let me know if you need further assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I THEN REPLIED: Thanks for taking the time to respond: )  My initial inquiry began in August of 2013 as I had ordered a bottle for my Mom and myself only to be gravely disappointed that there was only the faintest of smells (at best) in our oil.  (name) FINALLY followed up with my phone calls and emails weeks after I began contacting her and eventually sent out two new bottles which contained oils that literally smelled like NO SCENT and almost like plastic in fact. Needless to say, to go from bad to worse was extremely disappointing as I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Egyptian Goddess and have worn it for years.With that as a background, you can now understand why I have written yet again in hopes to be assured that the wonderful, pungent smell that IS Egyptian Goddess has been the norm again for theoil you are selling.  Are you quite sure you are back to the smell of what Egyptian Goddess should be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is May 20 and they still haven&#x27;t responded!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suspicion is they &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down their once great smell with so much oil that it no longer has any scent or that perhaps they ran out of the correct ingredients and are sellling these awful versions until they are back on track with the right formula.  If my suspicion is correct, I am saddened they simply didn&#x27;t tell me the truth but continued to make a bad situation worse!  And if they are simply contentselling this version, shame on them as they are robbing themselves of loyal customers (I know I am not alone!) that are happy to pay for their original scent!</li>
            <li> First time ordering this. Smells fresh, stays on all day. I love it!</li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant in purchasing this after reading some of the review of others. My neighbor wears this and I fell in love with this scent. I was disappointed when I received it and the aroma was not as potent as I was hoping it would be. When she smelled my bottle she agreed with me. I may give it another try.</li>
            <li> Defiantly a long lasting smell. It&#x27;s light but not to light because I can still smell it throughout the day especially if it&#x27;s a warm day.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but too much and you will smell like incense.</li>
            <li> I love this smell, it&#x27;s so subtle but sexy. Everyone always asks what I&#x27;m wearing. Way better than spending $60-$100 on the same bottles of prime everyone else wears.</li>
            <li> I like the roll on best. Seems to be the strongest. Smells wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my sister. She loved it.</li>
            <li> this oil is so g00d I get compliments all day I been looking for this fragrance everywhere I found it</li>
            <li> Again, a summer oil for me, not for winter for me.  although I love the Egytiian scent.  I say thanks to all who sell to us at A.com</li>
            <li> Works as expected. No disappointments here!!</li>
            <li> My husband has asthma and cannot tolerate perfume, but I can wear this oil and it does not bother his asthma.</li>
            <li> I use the perfume and soap, this oil is a good addition to my favorite scent in the whole wide world. Love It!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews on here were so positive.I get it and put it on.It smells like those musky grandma perfumes! Awful,wish I could return it but I&#x27;ve already opened it and used it once.</li>
            <li> I ordered for my daddy and he loves it! I just ordered him more.</li>
            <li> This was a barely if not unnoticeable fragrance.  It was a waste of money as it was a scentless oil.  Egyptian Goddess is a version of the famous Egyptian Musk Body Oil but like its parent they have been diluted into non-scents(sic).  I have seen this time and again in multiple venues for oils where they dilute the pure oils to stretch profits.  Then tout them as delicate, subtle scents.  My search continues for the PURE Egyptian Musk Unisex Body Oils.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the love scent. It&#x27;s ok but I would not order again. A little to strong for my senses!</li>
            <li> I love all of the oils except the Auric Blend.  It has an OK fragrance but is not exactly what I expected.  I have used all the other oils that I purchased and I knew they would be great, as they were.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no fragrance whatsoever to this oil.  Very, very disappointed.  Just threw it away!  Would not order again.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this fragrance oil, some said it was too light and others said that when it warms up the fragrance gets stronger as it warms up. I found that it was a bit light for me but it is a beautiful scent. So if you like fragrance that isn&#x27;t overwhelming then this might be a good one for you.</li>
            <li> i got bad complements on it when i wore it and it was half filled bc it leaked out in the package it was mailed in wasnt happy</li>
            <li> I wore this and I could not believe how many people wanted to hug me and the commits they gave me you have to try this and lasts a long time too</li>
            <li> If you like Egyptian musk, you will love this.  Note there is a difference between white musk and Egyptian. (Their white musk is amazing too, by the way!)  It&#x27;s very mild, great if you are like me and can&#x27;t stand 90% of all the perfumes out there.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my purse in case I go out for lunch and come back to work smelling like food; I can put on a little touch up.  The size is also travel acceptable, which is great.  Since it&#x27;s a roll on and not a spray, it won&#x27;t overpower the people around you and be applied discreetly.</li>
            <li> I tried this scent for the first time at a bath and body shop. They used to mix the scented oils with your choice of lotion and this quickly became my favorite. That shop closed several years ago and I was disappointed to find that there wasn&#x27;t another shop who could duplicate my favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;While shopping in a tourist town near my home town, I happened into a medievil shop by chance and there on the counter was my first experience with Auric Blends. I saw the name of the perfume was Egyptian Goddess and thought, &amp;#34;Please let it be the one&amp;#34;! It was! That was 20 years ago and I haven&#x27;t worn anything but this since!&lt;br /&gt;The reactions I receive from people are always the same... they want to know where they can get this scent! I would love to recommend this scent to everyone, but I&#x27;m torn because I don&#x27;t want everyone to smell like me! lol</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this body oil. it&#x27;s not strong or overbearing. it smells clean, but I notice some days it smell different. I think this will be my signature scent :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent.. Happy to have it again..  I layer it with other scents and it lifts my mood.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear perfume anymore because this is the best smell ever!  I have random people tell me how good I smell constantly.</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough of this body oil, I wish it came in a huge bottle I love love love this</li>
            <li> Smells awful to me. Everyone is different, but I could not stand the smell. Very.. strong and kind of musky.</li>
            <li> This stuff if like crack.  Buy it.  Nice replacement for the old egyptian musks.  Not exactly the same, but close.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several of the different oils, most smell very nice and sexy, I just wish they lasted longer, the lighter the color the sooner the scent fades. I always have to reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> i used to wear this back as a teenager. when i found out they still made it, i almost died. i bought a bottle and it took me back to the day. good memories and nice scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be a Dad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my wife on a whim because I liked the other reviews.  I bought the small bottle because I didn&#x27;t know if either one of us would like it- and that was my only mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minute my wife applied just a drop of this body oil, I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands off her.  I don&#x27;t know if it has some sort of magic love potion in it or what&#x27;s going on over there at Auric Blends, but a mere whiff of this stuff now lets me know &amp;#34;it&#x27;s go time.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result:  I&#x27;m going to be a father, which is great!  Also, my wife is happy because it put the spark back in to our love life just in time and she knows that something about Egyptian Goddess makes me go crazy for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In would highly recommend this to anyone looking to break away from all those immature perfumes and body sprays, and looking to be that Egyptian Goddess to the man in your life.  Without a doubt, this inexpensive little product has changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, wife was very happy!!</li>
            <li> Very fast service! I love this scent!! Light, refreshing, and reminds me of spring weather! I intend to buy again.!</li>
            <li> Woof! Was not what I was expecting!!!!! Smells like I took a very strong incense stick and rubbed it all over me!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and was very disappointed.  When I first opened the bottle and sprayed I could faintly smell the scent of Egyptian Musk, but once I sprayed it on it, the scent was non-existent on my skin.  I even asked my husband and daughter if they could smell anything at all - nothing. I spent $30 on this and it was a complete waste of money.  I am still on a search for a true Egyptian Musk Oil that actually lasts on your skin and one that you can actually smell!!!</li>
            <li> Received......gave as gifts. And they had no scent................some gift! Thanks for the embarrassment !!!!!! Not only that. But I couldn&#x27;t return. bad gift and out the money!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Another disappointed customer here. I bought this same item previously, and still have half of a bottle left. I loved it and wanted another bottle that I could keep in my gym bag. But, this one is not the same. It hardly has any smell at all. I would not say that the oil smells old, it just seems that the ratio of scent to carrier oil has been reduced. Huge bummer!</li>
            <li> Love this smell! It goes quickly so stock up! Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Subtle, Sexy ...I love it.  I will order it again,and any other fragrance that they might offer for sale.  Word.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great!  Goes on a little strong, but mellows out quickly and even though I can&#x27;t smell it, others compliment me on it all day!  earthy but lite....</li>
            <li> Heard such great reviews about the smell and I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I received it on time&lt;br /&gt;Cons: smells like old oil and it has no smell what-so-ever.. Not the exotic smell I&#x27;m used to smelling. I don&#x27;t know what happened to the formulation of the product and why the change but this is definitely disappointing..Amazon being a reliable and great source to purchase items from at a reasonable price, should choose not to sell the product. I only purchase through Amazon because I trust the source, however, I should now think twice and read the reviews.</li>
            <li> Auric Blends smells more like Juicy or Baby Phat oil. The aroma is very sweet and nothing close to the description.</li>
            <li> Amazing. When I wear this I get compliments non stop.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! It smells great and applies great.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and THIS is probably our favorite.</li>
            <li> the best is always the auric blend even though i&#x27;ve gotten faux versions that are suitable.  i absolutely love this product and it is my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; and one vial lasts a long time. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of oils! The scent lasts for at least 12 hours. I rolled a little on each arm crook (elbow pit?) Anyway you DO NOT need to use a lot or people might gag because it IS strong. So this little bottle will last for years. This particular scent is nice, not as aggressive as patchouli. My mom bought a bottle of this in Cape May and I loved it and wanted it but she wouldn&#x27;t give it up. I tried to find it at stores but I couldn&#x27;t find Egyptian Goddess.</li>
            <li> I just love this scent! It mixes with my natural scent for a unique aroma. I actually had a customer ask me what I was wearing, and when I told him, I offered my wrist for smelling. He pretended to swoon because he loved it so much. I had to laugh!!!!</li>
            <li> way too strong and smells like old lady. not to bash the company because they are making a quality product, but the smell is just way too much for me.</li>
            <li> Nothing absolutely nothing fragrance. I cannot imagine what has happened to a product I have loved.</li>
            <li> Have never had an oil that gets so many compliments.</li>
            <li> My order arrived incredibly fast &amp; I am really liking this fragrance so far.  A co-worker told me to try it.  I am glad I did .</li>
            <li> This has always been a favorite of mine.  People stop me all the time to ask what I am wearing.  The scent is very light and clean.</li>
            <li> Thick Oil Based not watered down, Speedy delivery, Last all day scent no need to reapply, Definitely purchase if looking for authentic Egyptian musk</li>
            <li> Have gotten alot of compliments while wearing this scent. Was happy to find at delivery that it is a roll-on. Great to carry in purse or pocket.</li>
            <li> Received it promptly!  and  it  was  exactly  the  smell I  was  looming  for. I  had  used  it  years  ago  so I  knew  what  to  expect.</li>
            <li> I have used Egyptian Goddess for many years and everytime I wear it, I get many many compliments, men and women both come up and ask what I&#x27;m wearing!! Great smelling product.....</li>
            <li> I just received my Egyptian Goddess and Love body oils in the mail today. It was packaged very well. I opened the bottles put a dab of the fragrances on my wrist to smell it. It was ok I guess. It wasn&#x27;t the smell of Egyptian Goddess oil that I was used to wearing. I&#x27;ll give it a try and write another review to let you all know how it is for sure...</li>
            <li> I honestly love this one very much.&lt;br /&gt;Its such a subtle smell but strong enough to call attention.&lt;br /&gt;everyone at work loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Such a sensual smell yet relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not making any sense, I know, but you&#x27;ll understand if you buy this. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have gotten complemented with &amp;#34;you smell nice&amp;#34; almost every time I have worn this. Plus love is soft smell. I don&#x27;t like super strong smells. It is strong enough that other people notice apparently. I am now looking for lotion, and soap. Whatever smells like this perfume. LOVE !</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews I saw on it but boy do I regret buying . It smelled like a perfume that&#x27;s been overtaken by sweat or natural body order ( not BO) . It&#x27;s hard to explain but it&#x27;s not a pleasant smell . I referee buying its just sitting there in package still .</li>
            <li> I wish I had heeded the warnings given by the other reviewers.  I really tried to like it but just couldn&#x27;t...it smelled old and musty, as though it been sitting around for a long, long time. Sorry!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, ZERO Stars for this item, one star was for the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> And its stays all day on me. Very soft sense.&lt;br /&gt;barely need to apply and you will have the fragrance all day</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping! Will definitely buy more in the near future!</li>
            <li> This is may first time buying this one. It&#x27;s very subtle and very fresh. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It is a very sexy scent on my wife, yes it starts out light but it does get stronger as it heats from your skin. It does last all day and I love the fact that she smells good all day especially up close. She&#x27;s not had anyone not like it on her! she has already bought two bottles and will be upgrading to the big bottles from now on that&#x27;s how much she wears this. Also if you want a perfume that is smelled from a distance spray a few sprays of your favorite one on your clothes, It captures at a distance then when they are up close the Egyptian Goddess works the rest of the magic and your skin will smell so good all night!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! I have ordered more than once.. it smells like no other egyptian musk. The sent is clean and smells for hours.  I have woman ask me all the time what iam wearing. Great price order more than one :)</li>
            <li> I love Oils and Ive been wearing them forever because I don;t like perfumes. I find that buying th eoils off the street are better. They last longer. THis oil smells great but it doesnt last long at all..</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I buy now. I roll it on in the morning after I shower, and it stays on all day.  Its subtle aroma is sooo pleasant. I&#x27;m going to try to bath bar next!</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the scent, but I couldn&#x27;t even smell it 30 minutes after application.  This kind of defeats the purpose of applying a scent at all.</li>
            <li> This smelled wonderful on a lady who I then asked what she was wearing. She told me about this fragrance and where to purchase it. I could not wait to get it.  But it did not smell the same on me.  I do not know if it was my chemistry or the product was not up to par.  If I see that lady again I will have her check it on her to see what the problem might be.  I was so disappointed as it was an  extremely sexy fragrance when she walked by.....</li>
            <li> I discovered this scent 16 yrs ago in a tiny gift shop and have worn no other scent since. It&#x27;s light but makes an impression, I&#x27;ve had people follow me after they passed by to ask what it is i&#x27;m wearing.  Shops where I reside don&#x27;t carry it on a regular basis so i sometimes need to order online. Advice I can give....the longer you wear it, it get&#x27;s into everything and appears to be your signature scent. 16 yrs? Hasn&#x27;t done me wrong yet.</li>
            <li> I love this scent I can go on and on about how wonderful it smells but its so unique you have to smell it yourself. Its very subtle but bold...if that makes sense. I think this smell changes with your mood or something it&#x27;s always the same smell but slightly different lol I don&#x27;t know how to describe it. Just try it you&#x27;ll love it. I get so many compliments on this oil.  I use it daily and it lingers all day. I just wish it came in a bigger size, a little goes a long way but still. The bottle I have lasted me a year so far and I am not even near done with it. I recommend this to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> Smells so good my dog stole it and hid it in her kennel. I had to fight her to get it back.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a scent to it.  What I did get was a small container of oil unfortunantly</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, affordable and came quickly.</li>
            <li> Ordered this scent from another vendor and LOVED it!  I was a little disappointed that the scent wasn&#x27;t as strong as my first purchase from another vendor.</li>
            <li> I will always wear this scent for as long as it exists; it has been my long standing favorite for nearly 14 years now. Auric Blends makes quite a few very nicely scented oils and with the oils, a little bit is all you need.  I wear it every day and one bottle lasts for months.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion. It is a light scent. Good for work.  A friend if mine wears it so I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> This musk oil smells so good. I love this product and will be purchasing more of it. Its a clean crisp smell.</li>
            <li> love it wear it everyday and always receive compliments</li>
            <li> It has hardly any scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles of this oil. Both bottles had absolutely no smell to them. Fake product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that what I expected in fragrance was terrible!  Smelled nothing like what I&#x27;m familiar with.  Would never order this again.  Would not give even one star if this was optional!</li>
            <li> This smells so amazing. This was exactly what I was looking for. This is a very light subtle musk smell reminiscent of the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s musk cologne, but much cleaner and lighter. I think this is my new signature scent. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! I love that it&#x27;s an oil and that it is a roll-on... the scent lasts for ages, even overnight. I typically apply it to my collarbone, inner elbows, wrists, behind my ears. Will definitely be repurchasing, hopefully the bottle lasts for a while :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this oil, but I think the solid perfume&#x27;s scent lasts longer. Though this is easier to use, so if you don&#x27;t mind reapplying, I would go for this!</li>
            <li> Ummm. It&#x27;s very Egyptian musty. And I don&#x27;t wanna get in trouble with my girl, so it&#x27;s totally a 10/10 :D&lt;br /&gt;Smells like the Nile river up in this bitch</li>
            <li> This product lasts a VERY long time beings its oil. Which means it doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied during any time of day and its perfectly subtle for us ladies whereas Egyptian Musk is pretty much for men because its strong.</li>
            <li> Same as other, barely can smell it and does not last.</li>
            <li> While this buyer adores many Musk oils, this is not one of them.  There is no aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the real thing, better to opt for another brand, such as an Original Musk Oil.</li>
            <li> The smell is good for me.It also depends on how other people like these smells.Some might not like it and some will.IT LAST A VERY LONG TIME IN YOU,so be aware of how much you put on because it does go as long as 10hours or more there(even after shower).</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast. Not sure if I like or don&#x27;t like the cent. Once I go out I&#x27;ll see if I get compliments and I will post it.&lt;br /&gt;Other then that. Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this perfume for years, but this is the first time I bought from an internet vendor. This stuff smells great, lasts all day, is neither too strong nor weak and I&#x27;ve only ever gotten compliments.  Wanted to buy the large bottle, but it had mixed reviews, so I got 3 of the roll-ons. Not one regret in sight. Already halfway down two bottles and I&#x27;ve only had them for a month or something.  If you&#x27;re thinking of buying the roll-on body oils, stop thinking and DO IT.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but the problem is that you can barely smell it.  I even took the bottle and rolled it ALL over me and asked others if they could smell it and they could barely smell it as well.  If you could actually smell the scent, I think it would be nice.  Maybe I just got a bad batch??</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the Egyptian Goddess body oil! Everyone in the house (even the boys) applied it on our wrists, the smell is soft yet the aroma has a noticeable presence. We also noticed the smell changed person to person due to pheromones and individual body chemistry. So glad I finally chose to purchase this, just wish I had done it years ago. I will be ordering more immediately for friends and family.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful!  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.  And the price is outstanding.  Perhaps next time I can purchase auxiliaries (lotion, shower gel, etc.).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for over 15 years. I love the way it smells, it has a fresh smell &amp; it&#x27;s not over powering. I always get compliments when I put it on.</li>
            <li> This body oil is just beautiful and refreshing. I used it after showers and its very refreshing,  Not strong or had a lingering aroma.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent. I love it and everyone who is within sniffing distance loves it. I get many many compliments on it. It was a great buy and arrived in perfect condition within 2 days. They are great love Auric blends and love the seller.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> I love it.  The scent is warm and sexy without being too heavy.  It makes me feel special.</li>
            <li> It is smell very nice. My hudsband love it</li>
            <li> The Sceny is to light  i can barely smell it</li>
            <li> Love the scent so much...thank you for the fast delivery.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> There is someting captivating about this scent.  At first, it&#x27;s so light it&#x27;s almost indistinguishable.  As it warms on the skin, it evolves into an earthy light, floral musk.  I find myself constantly sniffing my wrist and dabbing more on.  So pretty and feminine and different.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t care for the rollerball application.  Wish it were an open top bottle or spray.  This would be amazing spritzed in your hair!</li>
            <li> Love it, subtle and sweet!</li>
            <li> This product is great! It smells so good and is very subtle. Arrived in no time too! I&#x27;ve ordered the pachouli oil as well and had the same results !</li>
            <li> The wife likes it and I am happy.  All most missed the anniversary this year, but this got me out of it.</li>
            <li> Nothing like it used to be.  Was my favorite go-to perfume, I even preferred it over perfumes I owned that were hundreds of dollars more.  The formula must have changed, it&#x27;s almost unrecognizable now, and the smell isn&#x27;t just watered down now, it&#x27;s actually unpleasant.  Total shame.</li>
            <li> Omg, I loved this stuff when I was in high school. I bought a little vial of it one summer afternoon in a crystal shop in Old Town and it lasted forever. Then I could never find it again. I just happened to see it in ads on Amazon, whee! Beautiful, floral scent that can tend toward musky, depending on your body chemistry. If you hate musk, then you might want to avoid; I know some people have a problem with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way; just stick to a little over the pulse points to keep from overwhelming the people around you.</li>
            <li> This was just a bottle of oil. At first when i rolled it on, i could smell it, but after the initial use, the smell COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED. I&#x27;m definitely returning this, especially after reading that the same thing happened to several other customers.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this stuff!  Wish it came in bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> Smells okay.  Have to continually reapply.  Doesn&#x27;t have any pheremones that were noticeable that made it noticible to the men.  In fact, I was told like I smelled like a &amp;#34;Glade plug in&amp;#34;.  The scent is fresh and pleasing to me though.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! I get compliments a lot overtime I wear this scent.</li>
            <li> This smells so good......love it</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter and she loves wearing it.  Smells very clean and earthy on her.</li>
            <li> came in quickly, very happy!</li>
            <li> The seller was great fast shipping and the product arived in perfect condition. But I will be returning it, the smell is rather musky with an under note of soap. I asked my husband to smell it after I had worn it for a few minutes and he said it smelled like soap. So back it goes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this oil for 12 years and I&#x27;m still in love with it. I first came across it at a little boutique. Whenever I ran out it seemed they were out of stock too. Then, I guess they gave up all together because they haven&#x27;t offered it in years. It was in such high demand, they could never stay on top of it! So, for awhile I was ordering it from a place in California which always had great prices and sweet thank you cards. But, Amazon is always easier--especially since I purchase right from my phone. Anyway, my point is simple--this is a great scent that&#x27;s easy to fall in love with. It lasts all day but isn&#x27;t overpowering like so many oils are. I have tried other scents from Auric throughout the years, and this one I must say is the nicest.</li>
            <li> cheap price, fast shipping but...smells like old lady :( Would not buy again very musty and not sexy. dissapointed  but you get what you pay for I guess</li>
            <li> I had caught a whiff of this on a nurse while working in the operating room.  It was a breath of fresh air, and I had to find out what it was.  She said it was Egyptian musk and she got it at a beauty supply store and it was inexpensive.  I could not find it there, so I took a chance and ordered it online.  I just knew it smelled like clean laundry, so I googled around till I was convinced this product was what I wanted.  I am very pleased with the fragrance.  It is just strong enough.  My boyfriend likes it and it is so mild I don&#x27;t get sick from it.  I like the clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think somebody should invent a deodorizer for hockey gear with this scent, lol.</li>
            <li> I get complimented all the time. I bought some for my mother-in-law because she commented on wonderful it smelled.  I carry a bottle in my purse at all times. I love it.  I will be ordering more. It replaced my favorite Ralph Lauren scent.</li>
            <li> terrible. no fragrance to it at all. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The scent is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I got 2 of these without trying them first and was so glad that I did. I absolutely love the smell and it is very mild and sweet smelling. So glad I went out on a limb!</li>
            <li> The roller is great, and this scent is incredible!!! I love it, and would recommend it for anyone to try. I&#x27;ve known only a few people who wear this scent, but it&#x27;s one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very different, musky and strong. I rolled on just a little. I knew being oil it would be oily so thats expected, but I really do not like the scent. It&#x27;s way too strong. I&#x27;m 35, and I think it smells...well...old. Something from an attic. It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> seems like it is not as strong as it used to be. is it being watered down a bit? otherwise love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the Auric Blends oils.  Low price, great quality, and a little goes a very long way.  The Egyptian Goddess scent is wonderful and warm.  A little floral without being &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34;.  Great stuff. They ship fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue buying these</li>
            <li> Smells exactly how I remembered!!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my friend and she loved it it got here pretty quicklly and I did not have any problems</li>
            <li> lovely smell. everyone compliments me on the way I smell when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li> Always on time, always smells great. Very happy with this product and shipper. I would recommend both to anyone. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> EDIT: 12/31/13 ***REVIEWERS*** I have learned from other users of this product that Auric Blends has changed the Egyptian Goddess scent in the last six months or so. It seems my review is not of the original scent and according to them, the original scent is far superior than the new watered down and altered scent which is what I have reviewed. PLEASE TAKE CAUTION that the older reviews of this scent are reviews of the scent you can no longer attain and the more recent reviews, like mine, are reviews of this different version of Egyptian Goddess. It&#x27;s a shame but let this knowledge aid you in your decision about this. Please pay attention to only the more recent reviews of this scented oil. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so I just received this roll on oil perfume and the moment I opened it, I sniffed the bottle. I could barely smell anything so here I am confused and wondering if the less positive reviews were true and this perfume really had little to no scent! Not only that, but the scent wasn&#x27;t sweet although I don&#x27;t think I really knew what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still I decided to give it a chance; I rolled some on my arm. 10 minutes later, I notice I can smell it a bit. I brought my arm up and sniffed- aahhhh! There it is, the scent was much stronger! The perfume needs a bit of heat to strengthen up and emanate properly so definitely don&#x27;t judge it by sniffing the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, a lot of reviews are very general about the actual scent so you might not know what to expect of the scent. I&#x27;m definitely growing to like the scent, myself. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn&#x27;t what I was used to but it&#x27;s definitely not an offensive smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not sweet. There is a slight musk to it and the smell really does change according to your body chemistry. Sometimes it smells like incense to me, or an earthy and warm scent, sometimes it smells like a fresh river, and other times it smells like a sensual massage oil with a bit of spice to it. It&#x27;s really difficult to describe now that I&#x27;m trying, haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT I can definitely say the scent is correctly named. When I smell this perfume, I imagine being in a lavish Egyptian temple as a queen with a papyrus-laden river flowing nearby. It smells \\&quot;queenly,\\&quot; it smells exotic and regal. No old lady nonsense, but a scent gives off an aura of mystery, sensuality, and power. It&#x27;s lightly scented so it&#x27;s nothing that will make you sneeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d like to sweeten it a little bit, a drop of Pure Instinct blends with it quite nicely, I must say! It still retains its aura but with a non-clashing hint of sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to more sweet and floral scents so this is quite the change for me, but I am certainly adapting quickly. I only applied the oil to my arm near my wrist and it&#x27;s been 5 hours and I can still smell it in a pleasant and non-overpowering way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> This is the same fragrance as Egyptian Musk that my husband wears. I didn&#x27;t want to smell like him. So I gave this away. It has staying power though.</li>
            <li> Much too musky, kinda like wet dog, I really wanted to like it but sadly it will go straight in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Something is wrong here with quality control. There are many people here raving about this  and many receiving bottles with no smell . I got the no smell ! I am disappoointed as I suspect the product has merit because of so many great reviews. My neighbor could not smell it either .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I ordered another bottle of oil that was great . However , this goddess formula smelled like veggie oil . ZILCH . Someone needs to correct this before customers give up.</li>
            <li> Yes it did. I love Auric Blends Egypitan Goddess oil.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special. It doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin at all, it sits on top, so don&#x27;t let your clothes touch it.</li>
            <li> It smells ok. At first I really didn&#x27;t like the smell but the more I wear it the better it gets. Its got an old lady perfume smell at first. Then floral smell and then musk smell to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of Egyptian musk/goddess but this one is my favorite blend. The carrier oil is thicker and last longer. My only complaint was the roller, it was crooked which prevented my from closing the top properly.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, I am always asked what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> This is a perfume to wear lightly.  It is very musky and can be overpowering if used with a heavy hand but I love it.  Drives my husband crazy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of buying the perfume. The oil is great, but my hubs can only smell it on me if he gets really close. I want something a little stronger so I&#x27;m thinking of buying the perfume. I love this scent! Wish there was a lotion.</li>
            <li> I got complimented about the smell from my friends. I was expecting a bit more, but it was good too.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to scent! It&#x27;s lovely! Very sensual and makes me feel sexy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was a bootleg or what, bc after dabbing on a little, the scent vanishes and it becomes just unscented oil.  I literally get maybe two seconds of rolling the oil on my wrists (smells fine) and the scent disappears from whatever&#x27;s left in the vile. Like if I decided ten minutes later I want to add more somewhere else, like maybe my neck or whatever, the oil in the vile is virtually unscented. Next morning? Same thing: first few dabs smell great, the rest is just unscented oil.  Has anyone ever experienced that before? Is that supposed to happen? I&#x27;ve looked this scent my whole life and finally got it, only to have this happen.  Is it something indigenous to an oil fragrance?</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. Don&#x27;t know what it is.</li>
            <li> I received this perfume oil in the mail and it was packaged well with bubble wrap and it was not leaking (like some people seemed to have a problem with). Immediately I opened it and rolled it on my wrist. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. And it smells AMAZING! I was really nervous buying something I have not smelled but every review seems to say that people love the sent on them. What is so cool is people describe the scent differently on each of them. This perfume changes with your chemistry. Its really a gamble. If it doesn&#x27;t smell good on you it may smell great with someone elses chemistry. On me it is this sultry scent, slightly sweet but not \\&quot;preteen body spray\\&quot; sweet. Womanly, fresh, sexy, light and something I can wear every day. I wore it ONLY on my wrists and met my boyfriend at the gym to workout (only because I got it in the mail today, I usually don&#x27;t wear perfume to the gym lol). They FIRST thing he did was lean down to smell me and told me I smelled good. I was so surprised he could smell it when I only rolled a little bit on my wrist. And he really likes it! Seems like this one is a winner amongst men according to other reviews. And I don&#x27;t smell the \\&quot;old lady smell\\&quot; like some are saying they smell. It smells classy and sophisticated but I am only 21 and it suits my age well! I will definitely repurchase this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the smell but it is long lasting and only takes a little bit. I gave it 5 stars because shipping was very fast and the scent doesn&#x27;t go away within 5 mins. I woke up the next morning and could still smell it. My best friend loved it so it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> A girl I know once walked by me.  She smelled SO good, I couldn&#x27;t help but ask her what she was wearing.  It was this perfume.  Now, I smell yummy, too.  :-)</li>
            <li> I was very excited to be getting this body oil due to the rave reviews. But when I got it in the mail to say the least I was disappointed. The scent that people described as &#x27;sexy&#x27; was not even close to the word. Honestly it smells like a bar of soap. Very clean, fresh. Not something I want to spend my money on when I could just take a shower or wash my hands. I tried pin-pointing what type of soap it smelt like and I decided it&#x27;s like a mixture of Irish Spring and Dove. Also when you roll the oil onto your wrist and try to rub it with your other to distribute the smell. It tugs painfully against your skin. Leaving my very pale skin with a very noticeable red mark. Won&#x27;t be wearing this oil much. The smell isn&#x27;t appealing to me at all and I asked several other people what they thought of it and they said it smelt like a bar of soap as well. I&#x27;m still interested in these oils so I might buy a vanilla scented one. See how that one fairs scent wise. But overall I&#x27;ll only be wearing this scent to the gym.</li>
            <li> This was the first time to use Egyptian Goddess Body Oil.  It has a nice light scent, not overpowering. I would be willing to order it again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this oil in the past and absolutely loved it!!!! Unfortunately it seems it may have been watered down or something because it has no smell at all now :(. I am going to try a different seller to see if I have better chances.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last all day. Also works great with other smells. I really like the way it works with my natural smell.</li>
            <li> Received the Egyptian goddess  Body oil recently. tried it because of the reviews I had read about . I can only say it was a big disappointment for me. The scent is virtually very minimal and not lasting. I rolled it in areas that should have warmed the scent ie: fold of elbows , cleavage etc.. there was no lasting fragrance of any sort. I will not ask seller for a return as it is not worth the postage but will not order again</li>
            <li> After receiving the first one that was broken, this seller sent a second bottle at no charge to me.it was wrapped very carefully and arrived in one piece. The only issues I have is there was no true sent..smells like veggie oil. ..hummmm but thank you for letting me try it.maby my body chemistry is just not co-insideing with this oil.</li>
            <li> Addictive scent. It fits right in your makeup kit and it makes you feel sexy wearing it. I love it!</li>
            <li> I liked the way this smells in the bottle. When I put it on, thought, it change to a different sent. So, I think it might react to your body chemistry. Also, everyone seemed to smell something different when I was wearing it. Altogether no a bad product, the reason I gave three stare is because the oil seemed to heat and put out even more of a sent than what I wanted and I got a headache form it.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell this product, at least I think I can smell it. When I applied it I got a headache, wish I had been  able to contact seller before purchase. I purchased it because the reviews were so good and I can&#x27;t understand that because I can&#x27;t even give it way. I&#x27;ve tried! Won&#x27;t be buying this fragrance again.</li>
            <li> I was hopping to love this scent, but it smelled really synthetic and overly strong. Some reviewers complained that the scent was too soft, but I found it to be way to strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how fast this came in the mail!! Especially when Amazon said I might not be able to receive this product until after Christmas....  The reason why I have this 4 stars was because it kinda exploded in the zip block bag  just a lil bit.... but that is expected with oil/perfumes....</li>
            <li> I tried this based on the reviews of everyone saying it smelled so good I ordered 4 scents this was my least favorite I prefer water goddess and desert night oh and black coconut for a summery exotic scent</li>
            <li> I was afraid that a perfumed oil called Egyptian Goddess was going to be too heavy.  But, happily, it was just the opposite!  It is a light fresh scent that is a touch grassy with a hint of muskness (muskness?) And I quite like it.  I also like that it is a small drool on bottle that fits nicely in my purse.  And it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune!!  I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell I love it would buy it again</li>
            <li> This is one of the most wonderful fragrances I have ever had the pleasure of purchasing! It smells amazing and is long lasting. I have received numerous compliments when wearing Egyptian Goddess. People have even stopped me and handed me a pen and paper to write all the product information so that they can purchase this as well! Will defiantly be buying more!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this purchase, based on the one Egyptian musk I&#x27;ve used (not this one) and all the raves this one gets.  But I can barely smell this, and what I do smell is the already mentioned pencil shavings, rubber and a little bit of sandalwood.  I&#x27;m glad it was an inexpensive purchase, but I&#x27;ll stick with the one I was using before.</li>
            <li> The original order of Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess seemed to be much more fragrant. The last order seemed to be a very weak scent. I called the company and complained and was told that the fragrance was enhanced with time which seemed logical to me as the original order sat for some time before I used it.</li>
            <li> I like this scent. It&#x27;s a musk so that must considered before purchasing but it can be layered with other scents. I usually mix it with Love.</li>
            <li> Its strange that this is one of the most popular scents by Auric Blends.  To me it smells musty.  So yes, I can&#x27;t stand the smell, but I do love Auric Blends Body Oils.  The last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I just did a review on one of these but on the Love scent... and it goes hand in hand with what I said with the previous one. Non-stop compliments from mostly men but women as well.. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to enjoy this scent. It did warm as I rubbed my wrists together. A little goes a long way and it does last all day. If I enjoyed the way it smelled it would be one of the best deals out there. I have smelled this smell on several old ladies before. I&#x27;m looking for a younger sultry scent. Does not smell like the description :(&lt;br /&gt;My best description would be old powder that back in the day women used to coat themselves in. It didn&#x27;t smell good then &amp; it doesn&#x27;t smell good now. I just had my hubby take a wiff and he threw his head back and said eewww that smells like old lady. Sorry!</li>
            <li> This goes on real soft and is not overpowering. Can blend easily with other essential oil to create your own signature scent. Stays on all day and gets softer.</li>
            <li> One word - intoxicating. My most favorite scent of all time - including the $120 an ounce perfume from Macy&#x27;s. If you&#x27;re into musky, heady smells, you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li> Have always loved this oil,  Everyone comments how clean and wonderful I smell. The oil lasts a long time but does not overpower.</li>
            <li> This smells horrible. I read all the reviews and decided to try it out. Not worth the money. I gave it to a friend who loved it. I personally think it smells musty and is very overpowering.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this oil after reading all the glowing reviews. I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect musk oil. Unfortunately, this has almost no scent to me. I have other Egyptian musks from other brands that have a stronger scent than this brand. Perhaps I received a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Excellent, soft, feminine roll-on perfume oil. Perfect if you don&#x27;t like too heavy a smell. I get compliments on this scent all the time, even from people with those extra sensitive noses that don&#x27;t care for traditional &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; types of smells.</li>
            <li> Upset with this purchase. I&#x27;ve purchased this scent from Auric Blends before and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle I received, however, just smells like vegetable oil. It&#x27;s thick,sticky and doesn&#x27;t go on well. Hardly a scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I will have to get my Egyptian Musk scent from elsewhere...</li>
            <li> Very very faint.  SO DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> I had no prior experience with this sent, I went out on a limb and purchased it. All i can say it is amazing, I&#x27;m in my early twenties and its a very great mixture for everyone of all ages. the first night I had it on it definitely had a great mood changing effect to my boyfriend, he smelled it and started cleaning the house ( which is totally unlike him). I constantly get complemented on my perfume by both men and women. Needless to say i will absolutely purchase this product again and I&#x27;d advise anyone thinking about purchaseing this oil, dont think just do it you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of all the rave reviews, and anything called Egyptian Goddess had to be sublime. The smell is nice, but barely there, I have to put a ton on to smell it and hubby, who has a strong background in aromatherapy, could barely smell it either.  Maybe it&#x27;s just us.  Wish it had been as great for me as others have found it.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite scent.  I get TONS of compliments on it</li>
            <li> I have fond memories of Auric Memories when the roll ons first came out in the mid 90s. There was a sort of &#x27;hippie-new age&#x27; shop which opened around the corner of the office building where it worked.  You could be incense, dream catchers&lt;br /&gt;and &#x27;boot leg&#x27; Grateful CDs under the counter.&lt;br /&gt;There appeared one day a display of roll on oils with a dream catcher logo on the side of the bottled.&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately intrigued with the exotic scents and names. So I picked up a few as they were inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Names like Night Queen, Black Coconut and Egyptian Goddess were novel back then.  And the oils had such a strong, different scent.&lt;br /&gt;So I got hooked on them.  No Eternity or Escape for me any more.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years the line has grown to include new scents, solid fragrance and now lotion!  The large bottle of Egyptian Goddess appeared one day and it was a bargain for such a huge size.&lt;br /&gt;I do recall the scent seems lighter now but it can be cranked up by adding other scents from the line.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure whether there is any truth to the oils being &#x27;diluted&#x27;.  E Goddess and a few other Auric scents tend to appear and  re-appear during the course of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Am fond of the entire line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little testimomy to an old friend that still remains affordable.&lt;br /&gt;As long as they still make them I will remain a repeat customer.&lt;br /&gt;And Amazon along with the many outstanding sellers on Amazon make is possible.</li>
            <li> There is no fragrance in the oil.  Not even subtly, I even bought a separate batch in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> This particular oil has a lighter smell than some, as if it has been diluted.  But all in all I love this product &amp; have been wearing it for 16 years now!  It was shipped in a timely fashion and all that good stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. So sad I believe other review and but it without smell it first. The smell is for an old lady.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews re: this oil,  saying there was either NO SCENT or a scent that smelled musty like an old lady.  Of course,  I found that a little hard to believe,  so decided to give it a chance being everyones skin is different.  Well,  I wish I would have believed what I read because now,  I am stuck with 2 bottles os oil with NO SMELL WHAT SO EVER!!!  From now on I will take heed in what I read from other customers.  I would definitely have ordered an Amber scented oil NOT EGYPTIAN GODDESS!!  I am very disappointed in this purchase!</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED. I have tried the Egyptian Goddess Perfume Oil before and it&#x27;s amazing, this particular oil came and literally has NO SCENT to it. It is clearly a fake or something is defective. I tried to return but it says I can&#x27;t. Will not order from this shop again.</li>
            <li> Excellent and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS OIL WENT CRAZY TRYING TO FIND IT SOFT LINGERING SCENT PEOPLE TELL HOW GOOD I SMELL</li>
            <li> I posted a review earlier when I first got the product. Now after wearing it I&#x27;m giving an update. When you first smell Egyptian Goddess from the roller, there isn&#x27;t much smell. I have a pretty sensitive nose, and it&#x27;s like \\&quot;there&#x27;s a hint of something pretty there\\&quot;. After putting it on and letting my body heat warm it up, oh my goodness! I&#x27;m in love with it! Make sure when putting it on, don&#x27;t rub it in because that greatly changes the scent. My biggest tip if you want to get the full effects, is to put this around the hot spots on your body, such as in between your cleavage, back of neck, and inner elbow. Then do something to bring up your body temperature, like jumping jacks. After that, then smell where you applied the oils. I put it on, and after a few minutes I kept getting this smell that reminded me of summer flowers, blowing in the breeze with a hint of muskiness. Not a bad muskiness, but more of a warmer depth to the flowery smell. I went for a run later on so I was sweating, and it was amazing. All I could smell was that smell, it was like it wasn&#x27;t even winter in my personal bubble. Try it out on yourself before deciding if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the great reviews.I figured, for six bucks, why not? I usually wear the Rose, which is amazing, by the way. I got this, put it on, and..Well, it doesn&#x27;t stink, but there&#x27;s something about it that&#x27;s just a little... Smoky? Masculine? Granted, I&#x27;ve only worn it twice, but it seems off to me, not at all feminine or sexy. It may work for some, and, based on all the gushing reviews, does, but, it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> This oil is very light and clean smelling.  I don&#x27;t get the other &amp;#34;aromas&amp;#34; that others describe, and it&#x27;s certainly not scent-less, or abrasive to the skin as I&#x27;ve read in other reviews.  It is an oil though, and the size of the bottle should be a subtle hint- you only need a TINY dab of this to smell ALL day.  In my opinion, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so great about this.  Those reviewers who are getting headaches, I can picture them rolling this product all over their arms... I don&#x27;t even hardly roll it on, I just do one dab, and then rub my wrists together.  Your body heat will sort of amplify the scent, so a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s such a light, clean, lovely scent when applied correctly.  How can you go wrong for the price!?</li>
            <li> Amazing scent.  Many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!  It has a deeper, incense-y smell that changes every time I wear it.  I get so many compliments!  The oil is different, it takes a while to soak in and brushes off on my shirts (doesn&#x27;t stain!) which, imo, is kinda nice.  Also, because its an oil, you don&#x27;t need but a dab and I can see this lasting for quite awhile. I&#x27;ve had my bottle for over a year and just getting down to half.  Love it and will be repurchasing when I run out!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent smells just like Egyptian musk. Will purchase</li>
            <li> I never knew a oil could smell so good.  You will smell,look and feel good.  Beware of all the people you are going to meet with smiles on their faces.  I wiil alway have a bottle of egyptian goddess. I love the smell and all the smiles.</li>
            <li> I love this because it is not too strong.  The scent lingers all day and it is a lovely fresh, clean smell.  My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of the Egyptian Goddess Oil. Don&#x27;t know how exactly this works. I like the settle alluring scent on my skin. Feels so addictive!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this oil, but I must say it smells great.  It last all day long and that what I love about this body oil.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I will be purchasing more!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like getting it in person, but the last time I bought Egyptian Goddess online, the smell was really &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. It just wasn&#x27;t right, and gave me an awful headache. I decided to give it one last try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Egyptian musk, but after years and years I had finally run out of oil.  I decided to give this product a try and am so glad that I did!  I wasn&#x27;t even sure that it would smell like Egyptian musk, but it does - maybe a tiny bit lighter, but I&#x27;m not sure.  I am so happy I made this purchase, I get to wear my favorite scent again! (and unlike some other reviewers I&#x27;ve had no issues with being able to smell it!)</li>
            <li> LOVED that it came from a non-smoker! It is pure Egyptian Musk oil...it&#x27;s it fresh, new &amp; not watered down!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered it,but it was worth it.It has a pleasant smell to it.Everyone else loves its smell too.It has a very soft and musky scent to it,I love it very much,wish I had a bigger bottle now.No problems from the seller or the delivery service.No problems with it atall.It really is a wonderful perfume,I wear it quite a bit.I would now like to try some of the other perfumes this seller has to offer.Love it!</li>
            <li> Sorry, maybe I got a defective bottle. It goes on slightly sticky and I smell ZERO Egyp. Oil except a hint of where it touched my shirt. A VERY SMALL HINT. And I say this as someone who hates overpowering fragrances.</li>
            <li> These oils have no smell. I have worn Egyptian Goddess (Auric Blends) for years now and this seller is selling an oil that does not have sufficient essential oil in it to have any traceable smell. I have asked 4 other adults and nobody can smell a thing.</li>
            <li> Product met my expectations.  What arrived to me was what was described.  I am happy. Smells good and same scent as always.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite perfume oils. I wear it  in combo with other scents.  apply to pressure points,  or apply oil to wrist and neck then apply perfume and it helps prolong the wear time  and enhances the scent.  The  musk tones down other perfumes making them more palatable.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a few days, and smells great. Don&#x27;t know why some of the other comments say it barely has any scent...? Was worried when I read those, but am now glad I took the chance. Bought four, all smell great...</li>
            <li> OK this is my absolute favorite perfume of all time it has such a clean sweet smell with light hidden notes people will ask you what you are wearing its up to you to share your secret!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells so good and easy to carry around in the roller bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The scent of Egyptian Goddess is hard to discribe for me but get it you will love it too!&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping and it arrived in superb condition.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> my favorite scent!  Good service provided.</li>
            <li> I did not care for the powdery notes in this, as they really came out once it was on my skin and my warmth &amp;#34;activated&amp;#34; it. Remember perfumes can change with your body chemistry!</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality oil.  The scent is light and sensual and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  The scent is light and not overpowering like most perfumes in the department store.  Great for me since I am allergic to a lot of scent.  I can wear this without problems :)</li>
            <li> The Auric Blends Egyptian arrived earlier than expected.  The oil is a very nice scent, especially after showering. I am satisfied because it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> This smells like vegetable oil. I don&#x27;t notice the difference between not wearing it and wearing it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mum, I like the smell and she loves it but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it on me.</li>
            <li> This is an ok scent. Not for me. Hoping I can find a friend to gift it to that likes the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years. I ordered 8 bottles of oil and none of them had any fragrance. Very disappointed in this line of body oils right now.</li>
            <li> I read such rave reviews of Egyptian Goddess, so when I ordered it I had high hopes, however it barely has ANY scent to it. I roll on a ton and you can&#x27;t smell anything. I was hoping that once it was used and the air hit the oil it might help, but a week later and I am still disappointed. I wish I could return it, even at the price it is such a disappointment. $7 down the drain.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years. Actually found it in a drugstore in HI for the 1st time. This product was the same old smell that I have grown addicted to. I get tons of comments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I also have the mango and coconut which I purchased first and loved it. But this one smells like insence to me.  Its ok.</li>
            <li> Smells great wished I had ordered in bulk. A very lovely scent for both young and mature ladies. Wear it all the time</li>
            <li> This smells faintly of plastic and soap rather than musk. I had to wash it off. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the sandalwood scent but I thought I would try some new ones. I love the Auric oils because the scent lasts all day and I can use a small amount. The Egyptian goddess is a soft musk smell simular to a white musk smell but better. Soft elegant scent. I get a lot of compliments from men and women when ever I wear it. Love this scent!</li>
            <li> I gave the product a 5. I love the smell so clean and fragrant.&lt;br /&gt; Have got many compliments, Very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> This smelled very old lady for me. I figured that maybe my chemistry would change it but NOPE. I smelled like an old woman for HOURS!! I even showered and but on body lotion to no avail!!! Ugh!! Even now thinking about it I can still remember how bad it smelled. Maybe it was my batch, but I would NOT recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this body oil.Very nice slightly musky but not overpowering. My husband likes it too.Usually he doesn&#x27;t notice my perfume but he commented twice on how good this smells.</li>
            <li> It smells nice... after I got it I realized I did smell this before on other women. It a strong smell, use it only in small amounts.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this someone remarks on it and wants to know what it is.&lt;br /&gt;I will always recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Everyone is always saying who smells so good. It&#x27;s me</li>
            <li> I purchased this because a friend uses this perfume oil, the Egyptian Goddess scent.  It smells really good on her and seems to last all day on her.  I love the scent but unfortunately it does not last long on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent for years. I purchased these two bottles for a couple of my girlfriends for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and it is a miss. smells like old hoe house. My wife likes the oils last longer. This is only good if it smells good. In my book this one does not get it.</li>
            <li> This was wrapped in an oily bubble wrap and was leaking. There is hardly any smell to it ...I definitely wont be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love this subtle yet ever-present scent!&lt;br /&gt;Never overpowering... a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Changes over time (affected by body heat and skin chemistry).. so go easy and test it out. Start with a little dab and wait to see how strong it gets on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make sure I don&#x27;t run out of this!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I&#x27;ve always been sensitive to scents and other perfumes, and most make me quite ill, but as Auric Blends uses REAL OILS to make REAL PERFUME it doesn&#x27;t bother me or make me ill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always get a ton of compliments on the scent from both women and plenty of men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s subtle, not overbearing and this is scent I wear 99% of the time.</li>
            <li> VERY MUSKY!!! But its not terrible for others I can tell, just not for me. I don&#x27;t like how hippie it is maybe if it were a little less potent.But its different on everyone.</li>
            <li> I just wish it would last longer. To get it to last all day, I&#x27;d have to carry it with me and reapply it all day</li>
            <li> I saw all the reviews on this product and I thought I was going to get a lovely scent, but it smells like an old woman. I ordered the Rasta oil too, and that one smelled only slighty better. It does change with your mood, but this is definetly not a smell for me. I generally have only used amber oil roll on oil, so I was hoping for something more musky and sensual. This unfortunately, is not that.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of all of the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did! Reminds me of the Pikake flower in Hawaii but then it smells different on everyone. It really changes to blend with different body chemistries.  I</li>
            <li> Great price and quick turn around.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY scent I get a lot of attention from men, and women as well but men are really attracted to this smell. The only scent my boyfriend has liked and I&#x27;ve bought a lot of perfumes because I like variety but this one makes me feel sexy. I must add that I recently purchased a new one before my other one ran out and it was weaker :( hope it was just a fluke because this is my new signature scent! please keep the quality on these</li>
            <li> Thank you my mom  Loves these gifts.</li>
            <li> I love this wonderful, perfumed oil.  It has an amazing scent that only gets better as the day goes on.  It is a must-try!</li>
            <li> this smell is intoxicating and long lasting. that said, all scents and smells work differently with each person&#x27;s body chemistry. So, if first time use, a little bit at a time. I have used this scent for years! It lasts all day and even longer. The smell softens the longer its on and really compliments my natural chemistry. Body oil is the way to go for perfume. No alcohol or fancy label price tag. Long lasting, beautiful scent!</li>
            <li> This smells really great it is an oil base and it blends into the skin and the scent last a long time, A friend of mine was wearing this one day and I loved it and she hooked me up with a sample had to have my own.</li>
            <li> Terrific stuff. Glad I bought the Egyptian Goddess oil. This stuff smells so good and now I can clearly identify when people are wearing disgusting chemical-y smelling perfume and cologne. This however enhances my own scent and make me feel sensual without making other people in the elevator cough and sneeze.  My personal description of the scent is green like new grass, powdery, a bit spicy, and light floral sweetness. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Very sad. For the past 7 years auric Blends Egyptian goddess oil has been the only scent I have worn. Strangers come up to me and tell me how good I smell! Within the last 2 months, I have noticed that my new orders smell like nothing, or at best very weak. The retailer I purchased from for the past couple  years was very good about taking shipment back and reshipping new. Again, the scent is very weak. Please consider going back to the original full scent that I have become obsessed with.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It definitely smells just as good as that pricey stuff you can get at passion parties. I love the way the pheromones smell :)</li>
            <li> I first came across this sensual smelling oil years ago at a local drug store, but the business went under, and I was never able to locate this little product down until I recently, when I found it here on Amazon. Needless to say, I am ecstatic. This small, glass roll-on lasts for a very long time. You apply just a bit on your wrists and behind your ears, and it will last all day, afternoon, and evening. It&#x27;s just a gorgeous scent, that is worth a try. Impossible to compare it to something else on the market. It will definitely leave an impression on you.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday perfume I have been wearing this for along time and always get compliment on it..</li>
            <li> Smells like a restaurant bathroom, or alternatively, my grandma&#x27;s house. Not a &amp;#34;Goddess&amp;#34; smell at all. But if you&#x27;re into that, buy away.</li>
            <li> This stuff is beautiful. Light yet sensual. If you are looking for a Egyptian musk oil this is the one for you. I would highly recommend as long as you know what Egyptian musk oil smells like heck even if you don&#x27;t you cant go wrong with this. I have asthma so i cant wear much this is by far the best...However I am updating my review still love the product however company offered me 10% off my next amazon order and did not follow through have sent 2 emails the response was they would refund $ but i did not want refund i wanted what they promised still have not received. poor customer service on their part. Would still recommend product but just know they will not come through with offers..</li>
            <li> Light and slightly weak sent. Ive bought many times before and usually stronger. Look for a  different brand.  Hhh ggg</li>
            <li> I purchased this from the Auric Blends website about a week ago and... unfortunately it sucks.  The special Egyptian packaging is cheap and kind of ugly.  But the bummer was the scent, that is, it was missing from the carrier oil!!  This is quite unfortunate because the scent was nice from the samples I tried previously... So I feel ripped off.  ...But on the contrary Kuumba Made brand makes a good Egyptian Musk, but the scent of their oil is still on the weak side, but it is definitely there.  You don&#x27;t have to let it age or heat it up or do any sort of these bogus things to make the scent apparent.</li>
            <li> Great for purse or pocket and the scent is devine, I carry it everywhere and always get compliments on my perfume.</li>
            <li> Get this:  I&#x27;ve been wearing this off and on for 20 years.  Same company!  I have nothing but positive feedback.  It is MY scent.  And it drives my high school sweetheart crazy.  Hopefully, it will be the catalyst to get us back together forever.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear this. Lovely scent!</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t leave reviews on cosmetics but this is quite possibly my favorite find! I love how soft and sexy it is. It takes on your individual, natural scent while simultaneously enhancing it with exotic undertones. YUM.</li>
            <li> BEST SCENT OF ALL TIME! I LOVE EGYPTIAN GODDESS. I WILL ALWAYS USE THIS. GOOD PRICE AS WELL!</li>
            <li> It is a very very light smell but it still smell wonderful. I was just hoping it would be a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something more remarkable. this has such a mild effect that it seems to disappear before i leave the house. i&#x27;m using it in combination with other fragrances in hopes of getting more durability.</li>
            <li> light and fresh but not strong.I get compliments every time I wear it.I love that it is made with oils and has no alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> I know this product received generally good reviews but, in the end, I feel the scent didn&#x27;t suit me. The price was right so it made a nice gift but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying fragrances online anymore without smelling and trying them first.</li>
            <li> Shipped with amazing timing. The oil was just as I remembered. I had purchased it a few years ago and could not find it anywhere! Learned the hard way Egyptian Musk does not smell the same as Egyptian Goddess! LOL I am excited because people always ask me what I am wearing or is that my natural scent!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells wonderful in the bottle but after about maybe 20 minutes on your skin it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.  The roller ball applicator is really cool, I just wish the scent was a little stronger and lasted longer.</li>
            <li> A beautiful natural fragrance, the perfect sweet aroma, fast deliver, great seller.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this for Christmas and I had never heard of it before.this is the only place that you can purchase it. Good thing that the price is good ( except s&amp;h are high)  and it smells good and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> For years I have heard of Egyptian Goddess perfume/body oil/etc... so when I saw the Auric Blends little roll on bottle I thought now was the time to try it.  Sadly, as other reviews have stated... it&#x27;s so weak that I can&#x27;t really smell anything other than an oily fragrance.  My husband says he smells a &amp;#34;little something&amp;#34; but he has to put his nose right on my wrist or neck (which isn&#x27;t so bad...lol) but you can&#x27;t smell it after 10 minutes.  It&#x27;s faded.  The bottle was shipped nicely and came in one piece and rolls well w/out tugging on my skin... but it&#x27;s basically mineral oil.</li>
            <li> Love it, hard to find anywhere else because it&#x27;s such a great scent it sells out like crazy.</li>
            <li> It smells nothing like the original brand scent.  I feel bad only leaving one star.. but what a bummer.  I opened it up and was so excited... unroll the wrapping.. Hurry up! take off the lid.. smell hmm, contact with the skin.. smell nothing! what! Roll around ahhh scent.. Ahh uhh.. NOOOOOOOOOOOO  not my scent.. what a bummer.</li>
            <li> product had no scent at all. previously purchased this from Whole Foods and it had a strong scent.</li>
            <li> My mother has very oily skin. This causes most perfumes to smell very overwhelming on her (breathtakingly strong). A lady at work uses this oil and told me how mild, long lasting and pleasant it is, so I bought it. Its perfect on her.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I agree with previous posters. I used to love EG, but this one I received has no scent.  Sad.</li>
            <li> By far the BEST fragrance ever. Second to none. Unique smell that lasts day. Gets stronger as it warms up with the body.</li>
            <li> scent is too strong for me.  No matter how much i put on, i end-up smelling myself all day and you know if you can smell yourself, it is too strong.  The scent remind me of Indian incense or something.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It is similar to my Clinique Aromatics Elixir but a little more subtle.  I purchased some for another friend who also likes this fragrance.</li>
            <li> My favorite oil ever! I have used it for over half of my life, and this company makes the best blend.</li>
            <li> Have used this fragrance before and it is a favorite. Was excited to find it at Amazon-so disappointing as I purchased two and neither had any fragrance.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money hardly has any sent , I would not but this product again ! :(</li>
            <li> brings me back to my college days...smells fantastic</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what this would smell like.  I LOVE it!  My husband LOVES it.  Will purchase more.&lt;br /&gt;I should have ordered more.</li>
            <li> The smell is there, but light! The roll on feature of the bottle keeps you from putting too much on too.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh, I loooove this little roller ball of heaven! The smell was different to me at first, but let your body chemistry get use to it, and you will fall in love with smell. I find myself not having to reapply, and I smell it on me all day pretty much! Such a good buy :)</li>
            <li> The smell is not offensive, but not for everyone. No one could smell it unless they actually closely sniffed the area of skin where I was wearing it. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I am giving two stars because the package arrived quickly, however, this scent smells awful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is sweet yet musky. It changes as my body heats up when I work out or when I&#x27;m otherwise active. I get complements on my smell often. I haven&#x27;t tried it on anyone I know because it&#x27;s not advised as you could potentially taint the roller with another person&#x27;s smell. hah. But I enjoy it. Very feminine and clean scent. Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I line the smell of Egyptian musk. This bottle doesn&#x27;t smell like it has any fragrance in it.  Just looks like vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> Ships fast&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful scents</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, but this one I ordered had hardly any smell to it. I don&#x27;t get it...won&#x27;t order again...</li>
            <li> I love this and Love. They have been staples in my scent arsenal for years. It is wonderful and has a rich yet feminine smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Egyptian Musk!  Which is what this pretty much is.  The smell lasts all day and it is really intensified when your body warms up from physical activity, which I like as well.</li>
            <li> No smell,  but got refunded no problem.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume oil for the last 10+ years. Always get compliments on it and I love the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I put it on in all the right spots and it smells wonderful. It last all day and I get great complaints.  I&#x27;m almost done with this bottle...time for a reorder. Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> Love this product would refer to anybody and everybody. No joke this stuff works!!!! Has a great smell to it.</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations after reading all the positive reviews, but this oil smells absolutely horrible. It has a weird grandma/old lady smell. I put some on my wrist to test it when I first got it and the smell gave me a headache. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling perfume oil I&#x27;ve ever tried and now the only one I will buy. Its a light clean scent and every where I go I have had someone compliment me and inquire about what I&#x27;m wearing.  Natural ingredients and chemical free,  I give this 5 stars for sure</li>
            <li> I like the roller . Smells light and floral to me,not to strong. Lasts a long time. I received this very fast.</li>
            <li> TODAY I RECEIVED IT!!! AND I LOVE THE SMELL OF IT!!!!  IT STILL IN MY WRIST!!! good~good~~good~~~i am a fastidious about smelling, but I really like this:)</li>
            <li> It smells different as the day goes on. It&#x27;s a good change of pace.Vanilla seems to be the fragrance on me as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Luv this stuff, last longer that perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a perfume fanatic and am in love with this perfume oil.  Egyptian Goddess has a warm &amp; sensual musky tone to it, but is subtle at the same time.  I would like to find a bigger bottle if possible.  LOVE :)</li>
            <li> I recommend for anyone looking for a simple light empowering fragrance. This is a very sophisticated roll-on oil and lasts about half the day but small enough that you can toss it in your bag, it is light, and classy so if you are looking for something strong and long lasting this is not for you. I love this roll-on because it is such a simple yet complex sophisticated scent, as far as attracting the opposite sex, um well my husband hasn&#x27;t really reacted to much but there is a slight difference. I would wear this to a job interview!!</li>
            <li> I really love the smell, it is very light and sensual,thing is you can&#x27;t smell it anymore after 30 min,and I don&#x27;t mean that is not strong, I mean you can&#x27;t feel it at  all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Egyptian Goddess oil in the passed and have loved it!  It has been my favorite scent!  This is the first time I&#x27;m purchased from this seller, and when I opened the bottle, I was very disappointed.  There is absolutely no smell, whatsoever!  I don&#x27;t know if they are diluting it down or using old oils, or what.  Do not buy from this seller!  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because of the reviews that I saw saying how amazing it smelled. I was so excited to receive it, but once I did I was very disappointed. It may be alright for some people, but I really don&#x27;t prefer nor can stand smelling strongly of incense and my grandma. I only used a small dab on my wrists and had to wash it off a few hours later because I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. I more than likely won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews that stated that it didnt smell.  I should have listened.  It did when I first opened the bottle , now I can&#x27;t smell anything. I put some on and can barely smell it .  I got some a while back from another vendor , and had some still left i the bottle.  I compared the two.  I think this one I got is fake . My other really smells nice , and it lasts all day.  I blame myself for not listening to the reviews</li>
            <li> Love this perfume oil so much!! Already gotten compliments on it and it&#x27;s just a small hint of smell which you can only smell when you&#x27;re close by but when you do, it&#x27;s such a beautiful and alluring smell! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because a friend of mine had it, and it smelled just wonderful as she walked by.  She had bought it locally the first time, but had found it on Amazon at a much better rate.  The first time I applied it, it smelled wonderful, but thereafter, I can barely smell it.  I thought maybe I was just used to it, but others (including the friend who also bought it) tell me the same thing that you can smell it just faintly even after more than one application.  My friends think that this perfume has been diluted or weakened in some way from the original she bought.  She had noticed her newer bottle not being as strong also.  I won&#x27;t be buying anymore...what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> Nice smell it won&#x27;t have women all over you as it is often sold as a compliment to men pheromones cologne however for the price it&#x27;s worth the money only reason this product didn&#x27;t get 5 stars I felt the concentration could have been a bit stronger! overall would buy again</li>
            <li> Smells so good! Everyone asks what im wearing.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this oil for years.  I absolutely love it!  It is my signature scent.  I may not smell it on myself anymore but anyone who comes near me can smell it and they love it.</li>
            <li> The bottle of Egyptian Goddess Body Oil roll on I received was nothing special. It was just average. Not worth the purchase when the fragrance smelled like Jovan musk oil that anyone can buy in a local drugstore. Plus the scent did not last at all and wore off. I will not buy any type of body oil, cologne, or perfume on the internet again, This was my first and last time. You are better off trying  the samples of perfumes, colognes,and body oils in person at the stores before you make a purchase to see which one is best for you. However ,the product was packed well and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I honestly think that it&#x27;s a hit or miss with this product (Egyptian Goddess). I&#x27;ve read reviews that praised it like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever seen before and I&#x27;ve read reviews that said this smelled of nothing but oil. When I ordered my Egyptian Goddess perfume oil on Amazon, it was being sold by Old Glory. I ordered it from Amazon instead of Auric Blends website because their website doesn&#x27;t seem safe enough to make purchases on honestly. I clicked on their certification on their page and it said that their page could not be verified. I didn&#x27;t know what or why, but I just didn&#x27;t feel safe putting my card information on their website. Anyways, that&#x27;s why I ordered it on Amazon. I knew that I was taking a risk because scents have been known to be diluted when buying on Amazon. A few days after ordering online I was in a local shop that happened to have bottles of Auric Blends&#x27;s Egyptian Goddess. My friend was with me and he tried some on. He could smell it, but I couldn&#x27;t smell it very much. It was extremely weak (I wish my sense of smell was stronger). So then I got worried, knowing that I had already purchased it online already. However, to my pleasant surprise, when I got my bottle of EG in the mail, I opened it, put it on, and the smell was obviously present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of it! Definitely much stronger than the one I had smelled in the shop. The thing about it though is that it clings close to the skin because it is a soft smell, so I apply a lot on (under my ears, under my jaw, creases of my elbows, and my wrists) because if I don&#x27;t then the only way to smell it is by putting my wrists to my nose, lol. I definitely can understand the reviews that says it&#x27;s not as strong as it used to be, because it isn&#x27;t very strong. I found that this fragrance works excellent in the heat, so it&#x27;s definitely a Spring and Summer fragrance. Sometimes the scent lasts all day, other times it fades after a few hours. I definitely feel like heat has something to do with this. The smell of the scent grows on you the more you use it, you begin to love it more than you did when you first put it on! I love it. I just wish it were stronger. 4 stars because of the great smell. It can easily be 5 stars if the company makes it stronger!this.

            <li> This product did not work. I guess it did not work for me. It was like this product was driving people away from me.</li>
            <li> This little one lasts for a long time and smells delicious. My husband loves it, it is very soft. Tip: keep it away from your clothes.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, but it&#x27;s kind of light and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other I got from the same company.</li>
            <li> These oils must have been old because they didn&#x27;t smell like anything. Guess I learned my lesson: pay full price through the actual distributor instead of some random shop with old stock at discounted prices. Which, btw, this is marked as though it&#x27;s sold by Auric Blends but beware! It is not!</li>
            <li> I just received my order of 7 Egyptian Goddess body oil vials and it is just NOT the same as the wonderful ones I could always buy at Whole Foods in Atlanta, GA.  WF does not stock it anymore.  I also ordered more about a year ago and they were not the same either.  They seem watered down, my son says the bottle spray smells like insect repellent.  I want to return them.  Where can I get the real thing?</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed in this product!!!  This was just a bottle of oil. At first when I rolled it on, I could smell it, but after the initial use, the smell COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED. Wish I had read the reviews prior to purchase. Would never had ordered.  I can see why this is non-returnable.  They&#x27;d be reimbursing more than they&#x27;d be selling...</li>
            <li> I love it.  It is soft and subtle.  I wear I with the Love Oil</li>
            <li> This company&#x27;s version of Egyptian Goddess is skanky at best and a total ripoff at worst.  It smells like cooking oil and has no fragrance in it at all.  I bought two bottles and totally wasted my dough.  Does anyone know of a perfumer I can contact to make me some?</li>
            <li> This is supposed to attract the opposite sex but I think it is super silly. And it stinks! Yuck. i did not like it at all. Very strong, musky, but not pleasant, scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is barely noticeable less fragrant than the oils I bought directly from manufacturer. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was realy excited about it at first until I opened it...It smells weird,I didn&#x27;t like it much,a bit too strong for my taste,It&#x27;s like no,....ew.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long LONG way with this product. A little dab on my wrists is all it takes and I can smell it all day. I love it and I will be orderering more soon!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the perfume or not but I put some of this on my neck the other day and this one guy was giving me an innocent massage. Before I knew it he was all over me, sniffing and sucking my neck. I did have to get use to the smell at first because I usually wear fruity smells and this is more of a musky exotic smell. But overall, great stuff!</li>
            <li> This smells bad in the bottle,thought maybe body heat would improve the smell. Suprise, cant smell it at all. Total waste of money . choose another fragrance if you want to have a soft scent, this has none.</li>
            <li> This item came super fast and it smells HEAVENLY!  Thank you so much.  Has a richer scent than previous Egyptian musks I&#x27;ve used.  Couldnt be happier :))</li>
            <li> Quality control may want a heads up here. No scent whatsoever, none. I just bought a bottle with a carrier oil that I can roll onto my skin so I can be oily. Awesome. Will never ever ever buy from this seller! Ever.</li>
            <li> I have had this oil before and had to have it again! Shipped quickly and a lovely sweet scent. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> My friend got this for me for Christmas. I love it so much. Last a long time and isn&#x27;t too strong. Thank you so much Shaunna for an awesome gift!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really smell much of anything at all. I would not recommend this product as you can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re wearing anything.</li>
            <li> I noticed the fragrance on a co-worker and asked what she was wearing.  I ordered right away.  I like the idea of roller ball bottle - no spilling, no waste.  I would like the fragrance to last longer through the day.  Feminine, light.</li>
            <li> Fragrance was nice at first and then seemed to disappear. It pretty much just smells like oil now. I wonder if there wasn&#x27;t enough fragrance added to the oil.</li>
            <li> I love this smell and it smells so good on me but I am finding that it is losing its potency after only a couple of weeks. It isn&#x27;t as strong as it was when I opened it and I&#x27;m having a really hard time getting it to stay on me.  I would love this if it was stronger.</li>
            <li> -a light scent of mixed fresh flowers yet a hint of sweetness&lt;br /&gt;-gives off a sense of sophistication&lt;br /&gt;-easy to carry around&lt;br /&gt;-first time purchasing oils online&lt;br /&gt;-recommend using it after a bath&lt;br /&gt;-would NOT recommend for teenagers</li>
            <li> WOW. I rarely review things because I never have time but I had to for this. This smells like heaven in a bottle and better than so many perfumes and scents I&#x27;ve tried before. I opened it, dabbed a little on, and fell completely in love with myself. It smells understated and powerful. It has a gentle scent with a really commanding presence, as if to say &amp;#34;I&#x27;m here but I don&#x27;t need to be sickly sweet or rolled-eyes-back-into-the-head potent to affect you.&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t find it overpowering at all. Can be worn to the office, a night out, and definitely a date night. And can we talk about the price for a minute? I want to buy multiple ones just to have them on hand everywhere. Also, the scent stays with you and doesn&#x27;t disappear and a little goes a long way. This will last me for a while but I will most definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this blend at my local whole foods store for years but when they stopped caring this product I was really disappointed. I was super excited when I found it on Amazon imagine my disappointment when I got this product and it smelled like ........ Vegetable oil !!! This product has no fragrance I question if the retailer is even selling the real product.  Save your money moreover save yourself from being truly disappointed !</li>
            <li> The perfect scent. Other products are diluted or do not have the correct blend. This Egyptian Musk is just how I like it.</li>
            <li> wow excelent, smell very good, the people like the arom, and is very pleasure is taste and relax, i recomend it smell good</li>
