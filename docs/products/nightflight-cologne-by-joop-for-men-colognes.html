            <li>My brother liked it very much!</li>
            <li>Love this men&#x27;s cologne - quick service and easy payment process!</li>
            <li>enjoy using it more than once a day....</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and a bit strong the first 10 minutes,</li>
            <li>what more can i say i am happy with my purchase and will come back</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s way better than the Cool Water I was using.</li>
            <li>Smell is amazing, the complements I get from workmates are always positive.</li>
            <li>As for the length of smell, I have experienced this cologne to last quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this bottle of EDT at a bargain price and the shipping and handling  was free.</li>
            <li>Very masculine yet very refreshing</li>
            <li>Really excited to gift this to my DH for Christmas.</li>
            <li>When I was first introduced to this follow-up fragrance from the original Joop!</li>
            <li>This product is hard to find in stores, so it was great to find it here!</li>
            <li>but, again, the smell is a bit too strong for the first 10 minutes or so, probably in the rare occasion this will not bother me.</li>
            <li>but with a twist of a fresh shower.  </li>
            <li>and I must say that its well worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>It was really popular when I had just got out of HS and sooo many men thought the first JOOP was too heavy or they couldn&#x27;t identify with it&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li>it just smell like a dream, i like it, and hope that other woman think on it when have to make a good gift</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>its not the full strength...tried amazon to see if they had the real stuff</li>
            <li>shipping was super fast...</li>
            <li>Great fresh long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>first Joop</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was my first time using this Joop</li>
            <li>, Do not blind buy either.</li>
            <li>and I now will never purchase without testing it first.</li>
            <li>item was exactly as described.....</li>
            <li>I love the smell..and wish it had the staying power of the regular Joop....</li>
            <li>I hope its not a fake</li>
            <li>First timer with this flavor.</li>
            <li>A nice, manly, yet fresh scent - not too much of one or the other.</li>
            <li>It has a vibrant, fresh, out-of-the-shower sort of appeal reminiscent of your favorite bath soap.</li>
            <li>smells great, clean,strong,but not like red joop!,not chokingly strong,more light long lasting would be much better description,collector of sorts,would buy again,jasminey,a touch of geranium,of course vanilla,great price for a long lasting &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; clean and fresh yet manly scent,chicks or guys,what ever if your thing ,will both like,many compliments.</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne to wear for everyday and special occasions.</li>
            <li>I had it at my door step within less than 60 HOURS of the time I ordered.. amazing deal.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Pure Instinct</li>
            <li>Night flight is brother of the classic cologne Joop!  </li>
            <li>It sort of smells like the classic Joop!,</li>
            <li>Best for cold days or night time.</li>
            <li>the real thing you put three squirts on</li>
            <li>Brought this cologne for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Fast service&lt;br /&gt;Perfecf product</li>
            <li>In other words, Night Flight has a very clean smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact it smells very similar to Cool Water Night Dive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s masculine yet smooth, and bold enough to use only a hint.</li>
            <li>I had a friend who wore this in high school</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells like summer in fresh gear late afternoon Seductive date high class and 100% getting lucky. 90s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great smell 2 thumbs up</li>
            <li>The fragrance does not last for any real length of time, so I have decided not to purchase ever again.</li>
            <li>not the same strength i normally get.</li>
            <li>The real thing last for a day and this doesn&#x27;t even last an hour.</li>
            <li>I reordered another spray bottle of Classic JOOP and would expect the Nightflight to sit on my shelf a long time , unused.</li>
            <li>A little strong for my taste, at least at first.</li>
            <li>The top notes are pineapple, lavender, green notes, juniper, bergamot and lemon; middle notes are almond, jasmine, lily-of-the-valley, rose, brazilian rosewood and geranium; base notes are sandalwood, tonka bean, amber and musk.</li>

            <li> Joop! Night flight is brother of the classic cologne Joop!  I have to say this cologne is also very nice.  It sort of smells like the classic Joop!, but with a twist of a fresh shower.  In other words, Night Flight has a very clean smelling fragrance. As for the length of smell, I have experienced this cologne to last quite a bit.  I am not sure if this cologne is only suppose to be used for the nightlife, hence Night Flight, but it can be used at night or day.  Like original Joop!, Night Flight is a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> Love this men&#x27;s cologne - quick service and easy payment process!</li>
            <li> Joop Nightflight smells greeny. Like pine. As a matter of fact it smells very similar to Cool Water Night Dive. Based on smelling it at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> great smell...enjoy using it more than once a day.... first Joop I use from my selection because of the ounces</li>
            <li> Great gift. My husband really liked it.</li>
            <li> This is an very good scent. The Product is not that overwhelming and has a very good smell. It lasts long and is mellow it very good for the nightflight seems like something good for going out doing night like stuff.</li>
            <li> After years of searching for Joop Nightflight I finally found it and it smells just as awesome as I remember it. Very refreshing and a bit strong the first 10 minutes, but after it settles on the skin its even more amazing. I remember getting this as a Christmas gift in 1992 and it was, and still is my favorite cologne. The top notes are pineapple, lavender, green notes, juniper, bergamot and lemon; middle notes are almond, jasmine, lily-of-the-valley, rose, brazilian rosewood and geranium; base notes are sandalwood, tonka bean, amber and musk. Very masculine yet very refreshing and this is sure to have someone ask what are you wearing or comments that it smells so good.</li>

            <li> My husband wore this scent YEARS ago and we have been unable to find it locally or online for a long time.  It&#x27;s been a while since I searched online but thought I would try again.  Should have know Amazon would come through!  Really excited to gift this to my DH for Christmas.</li>
            <li> di do from above it seems to be a weak version. not the same strength i normally get. thank you</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne to wear for everyday and special occasions. I wish it was still made to be sold in stores.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in stores, so it was great to find it here!</li>
            <li> very nice and quick shipping</li>
            <li> Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like summer in fresh gear late afternoon Seductive date high class and 100% getting lucky. 90s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great smell 2 thumbs up</li>
            <li> Great product ,excellent customer service</li>
            <li> I purchased this bottle of EDT at a bargain price and the shipping and handling  was free. What a great deal for a quality scent.</li>
            <li> Joop took consumer advice and made this scent last all day.  I had a friend who wore this in high school &amp; I always liked it.  I got some recently and can confirm if sprayed in the morning, you will still smell it at night.  Nice soft/fresh scent.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne.  I use it with the Pure Instinct Pheremone infused oil.  I get compliments.  Glad I bought this, it&#x27;s way better than the Cool Water I was using.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Smell is amazing, the complements I get from workmates are always positive. Great longevity and sillage. Best for cold days or night time.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal. The price was right. Glad to see this.</li>
            <li> its not the full strength...tried amazon to see if they had the real stuff but no.  the real thing you put three squirts on and it last till tomorrow.  this bottle i have to put 10 squirts on and it lasts 2 or three hrs</li>
            <li> Favorite cologne ever. Hard to find, but not on Amazon. Great price, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of complements because of this cologne and I am thinking about buying another one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was my first time using this Joop and I must say that its well worth purchasing. It smells great too! RJ</li>
            <li> Amaaaazing. It is one of my favorite eau de toilette. And for that price, it&#x27;s a steal.. shipping was super fast... I am talking crazy fast.. I had it at my door step within less than 60 HOURS of the time I ordered.. amazing deal. Go for it..</li>
            <li> Please dont buy this, Do not blind buy either. IT is very generic alcohol smell. Yes you get quite a bit for the price and that is why I gave it a 2 star and not a one.</li>
            <li> A little strong for my taste, at least at first. A nice, manly, yet fresh scent - not too much of one or the other. I will probably use every once in a while but, again, the smell is a bit too strong for the first 10 minutes or so, probably in the rare occasion this will not bother me.</li>
            <li> Another great fragrance by Joop!  Long-lasting.  Perfect for cool weather.</li>
            <li> I have used JOOP for years and when I ran low, decided to make a change to JOOP night flight? MISTAKE!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not at all like regular JOOP and I now will never purchase without testing it first. I reordered another spray bottle of Classic JOOP and would expect the Nightflight to sit on my shelf a long time , unused.</li>
            <li> I love this smell. I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he loved it. This product smells like a nice cute cologne without the musk.</li>
            <li> The fragrance does not last for any real length of time, so I have decided not to purchase ever again.</li>
            <li> Very nice my girl friend do not like for me to put it on when i go to work</li>
            <li> item was exactly as described..... i love it...authentic item..what more can i say i am happy with my purchase and will come back</li>
            <li> All I have to say is that when a woman says, &amp;#34;I smell Froot Loops&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s probably not a scent that you want to choose as your signature.</li>
            <li> I love the smell..and wish it had the staying power of the regular Joop....but it&#x27;s still an awesome scent...you just might need to reapply at a later time!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.. and that is the only thing that matters (is it not?)</li>
            <li> Brought this cologne for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. He has been getting comments from other ladies as well (not happy with that ). However this is a great scent</li>
            <li> My brother liked it very much!</li>
            <li> it just smell like a dream, i like it, and hope that other woman think on it when have to make a good gift</li>
            <li> It is one of the best fragrances from Joop for men but the pack was not sealed when arrived though the bottle seemed full. I hope its not a fake</li>
            <li> Nightflight is probably the fragrance that I&#x27;m complimented on most. When I was first introduced to this follow-up fragrance from the original Joop! I was quite amazed at how different the tone of it was. It has a vibrant, fresh, out-of-the-shower sort of appeal reminiscent of your favorite bath soap. It&#x27;s masculine yet smooth, and bold enough to use only a hint. I find it suitable for use morning, afternoon or evening.</li>
            <li> Great fresh long lasting scent. If I work out it increases it aromatic capabilities. It was really popular when I had just got out of HS and sooo many men thought the first JOOP was too heavy or they couldn&#x27;t identify with it&#x27;s smell. But all I do is put very little on an go to WalMart and watch the ladies come to me...seriously....you should try.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product . The real thing last for a day and this doesn&#x27;t even last an hour. I&#x27;m surprised amazon is selling this fake item . I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> yes this is realy good product im happy  thanks</li>
            <li> Fast service&lt;br /&gt;Perfecf product</li>
            <li> First timer with this flavor. I usually use regular Joop. Figured I would give it a try. Works for me ! Wife likes it also, only con is that it does not last as long as regular JOOP.</li>
