            <li>smells really nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice soap.  </li>
            <li>I saw all the good reviews and was thinking hmm this sounds too good to be true...</li>
            <li>This smells like fir trees or a pine forest to me, very fresh &amp; pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>This is the best natural soap that I have used.</li>
            <li>She loves the soap, and I am happy to have found a product I can feel good about her using that contains no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>This soap was great at first.</li>
            <li>My skin is beautiful and vibrant.</li>
            <li>so glad someone told us about this soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>and my skin has been so much better since using this soap.</li>
            <li>it sure does look like dudu, but doesn&#x27;t smell like dudu.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I simply LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the soap and the way that it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>love it will continue to buy more</li>
            <li>Sure, the bubbles that drop turn to brown spots, but I wipe them away.  </li>
            <li>I used the soap for a week, and the results were astonishing.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I need to buy a lot more of it.</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the unrefined shea butter so that I could use it with the soap since many people said that it dries out your skin, but then it&#x27;s also not in my orders anymore.</li>
            <li>and I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;d say go ahead and try it. :)</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty good soap.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of removing oil, sweat and odors naturally!</li>
            <li>felt so refreshed and squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>I worked at a fulfillment center when I walked by a bin and had to find what was that wonderful smell.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best bar soap ever!</li>
            <li>So I just use it on my body and everything works fine.</li>
            <li>I keep one in my bathroom cabinet and get a great scent every time I open the cabinet.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really expensive--it didn&#x27;t do anything amazing to my skin</li>
            <li>My skin felt so smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months and my face is acne free.</li>
            <li>But as of right now I&#x27;m enjoying it.</li>
            <li>very rare</li>
            <li>just rinse it clean.  </li>
            <li>The soap lathers well and makes my skin squeaky clean without immediate dryness.</li>
            <li>It does make me feel squeaky clean (literally.)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this product to work simply because of the way it&#x27;s been hyped in skincare circles but because of the low cost I was happy to give it a try anyway, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does give your face a dry and tightening feeling after washing, but just use some toner and good moisturizer you will be fine</li>
            <li>It washes off well and leaves my skin smelling nice and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I also rinsed off the soap with cool water IMMEDIATELY after application.</li>
            <li>It lighten all my acne marks so quick compare to using my PMD.</li>
            <li>A lot of people have had success with it though, so if you&#x27;re still looking for that one true acne cure</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and smelling fresh and clean more so than with anything I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have since started just wiping the shower down with a magic eraser before getting out though and that seems to do just fine without adding more than a minute to toal shower time so still totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The almost-black bar started a few conversations when seen in my shower, LOL.  </li>
            <li>My parents own a african market store</li>
            <li>However, it strips off all your skins natural oils/protective barriers, and therefore makes your skin produce more oil.</li>
            <li>The scent can be a bit overpowering, but fresh.</li>
            <li>This soap is very cleansing, and leaves your skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I usually use a great soap off Etsy</li>
            <li>great product , gives you results fast , foams with just a little soap.</li>
            <li>But it feels good on skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling tight.  </li>
            <li>this soap to clean your face, don&#x27;t use too much skin care product, too much chemical will irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>great!!&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face for the first time with this tonight.</li>
            <li>AT FIRST, MY HUSBAND WAS HESITANT TO USE IT</li>
            <li>My only issue is it seems that I am cleaning my shower much more often.</li>
            <li>and my skin started clearing literally after the first day i used it.</li>
            <li>It really worked for me and my family!</li>
            <li>tried this for the first time a couple weeks ago</li>
            <li>my face first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK enough that I&#x27;ll use up the bar</li>
            <li>This is a very good brand of African black soap.</li>
            <li>I really need this soap right now.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to have to special order it and also wanted to try a natural product first.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but my skin did not get better or worse.</li>
            <li>With this my skin is just simply clean and soft.</li>
            <li>So far the reviews I&#x27;ve read are true.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s less moisturizing than dove and caress, but more moisturizing than most of the other cheap</li>
            <li>Nice soap but the black suds get everywhere.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone looking for a natural alternative to keeping my face clean.</li>
            <li>soap consistency was a little surprising because it gets soft, now I just pinch off a pea sized amount and use that for my face.</li>
            <li>.. very tropical scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wash my whole body with it--</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, it is gentle and indeed smells as if it came from a rain forest.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well; no allergic reaction...</li>
            <li>Has really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li>it cleans my face very well.</li>
            <li>Burns to high heavens!</li>
            <li>I felt that this soap really kept my face clean.bit literally left my face squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, it gave more acne to deal with.</li>
            <li>Since I have dry sensitive skin, I made sure to take every precaution.</li>
            <li>Today is my 3rd time using this soap both morning and night (btw i have super oily skin)</li>
            <li>The tropical smell of mine was so mild it was barely detectable, but maybe mine was from an old batch.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>not real black soap, too many other ingredients, want real stuff from Hawaii</li>
            <li>Maybe because my face is sensitive to certain soaps.</li>
            <li>My skin was very velvety without the lotion, but again, I cannot take any chances with my sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s a unique soap and fun to try it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel different than other soaps.</li>
            <li>I only use natural soaps, so I am thrilled to learn about this black soap.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have oily to normal skin and use it once or twice a day, my skin does feel tight after use, and i do use a light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as other black soaps!</li>
            <li>, she can nly use it every few days or she gets a full face chap!  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using this soap long enough to give an accurate review .</li>
            <li>But, as soon as I dried my face, my skin was soo soft and it looked soo light</li>
            <li>my 14 year old daughter says it drys her out and her face itches after every use</li>
            <li>leaves the skin soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>far as cleaning goes, it does the job.</li>
            <li>My daughter breaks out near her hair line.</li>
            <li>I use this soap, because it&#x27;s natural and I have stopped itching since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li>So far still no sign</li>
            <li>surprised me</li>
            <li>Recently, I was using alataa saminaa for my non Ghanaian speakers that literally translates to mean &amp;#34; Nigerian Soap.&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t seen no changes cause I already have nice skin no problems but</li>
            <li>also feels clean without feeling tight after washing</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear, it&#x27;s the only thing I use 2x a day!</li>
            <li>this soap smells like candy but smells natural at the same time.</li>
            <li>The hyperpigmentation on my chest, shoulders, and back lightened considerably.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like it leaves a weird kind of residue in the basin of my shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very drying, which is not really a problem for me but steer clear if you have dry skin!</li>
            <li>the only negative is that it&#x27;s very drying which I can easily combat with a thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The fragance was a little much.</li>
            <li>Before being told about this by a very good friend I had very bad acne.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> great product , gives you results fast , foams with just a little soap.</li>
            <li> But it feels good on skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling tight.  </li>
            <li> this soap to clean your face, don&#x27;t use too much skin care product, too much chemical will irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> great!!&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face for the first time with this tonight.</li>
            <li> AT FIRST, MY HUSBAND WAS HESITANT TO USE IT</li>
            <li> My only issue is it seems that I am cleaning my shower much more often.</li>
            <li> and my skin started clearing literally after the first day i used it.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me and my family!</li>
            <li> tried this for the first time a couple weeks ago</li>
            <li> my face first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK enough that I&#x27;ll use up the bar</li>
            <li> This is a very good brand of African black soap.</li>
            <li> I really need this soap right now.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to have to special order it and also wanted to try a natural product first.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but my skin did not get better or worse.</li>
            <li> With this my skin is just simply clean and soft.</li>
            <li> So far the reviews I&#x27;ve read are true.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less moisturizing than dove and caress, but more moisturizing than most of the other cheap</li>
            <li> Nice soap but the black suds get everywhere.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone looking for a natural alternative to keeping my face clean.</li>
            <li> soap consistency was a little surprising because it gets soft, now I just pinch off a pea sized amount and use that for my face.</li>
            <li> .. very tropical scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wash my whole body with it--</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, it is gentle and indeed smells as if it came from a rain forest.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well; no allergic reaction...</li>
            <li> Has really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> it cleans my face very well.</li>
            <li> Burns to high heavens!</li>
            <li> I felt that this soap really kept my face clean.bit literally left my face squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, it gave more acne to deal with.</li>
            <li> Since I have dry sensitive skin, I made sure to take every precaution.</li>
            <li> Today is my 3rd time using this soap both morning and night (btw i have super oily skin)</li>
            <li> The tropical smell of mine was so mild it was barely detectable, but maybe mine was from an old batch.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> not real black soap, too many other ingredients, want real stuff from Hawaii</li>
            <li> Maybe because my face is sensitive to certain soaps.</li>
            <li> My skin was very velvety without the lotion, but again, I cannot take any chances with my sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s a unique soap and fun to try it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel different than other soaps.</li>
            <li> I only use natural soaps, so I am thrilled to learn about this black soap.  </li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have oily to normal skin and use it once or twice a day, my skin does feel tight after use, and i do use a light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as other black soaps!</li>
            <li> , she can nly use it every few days or she gets a full face chap!  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using this soap long enough to give an accurate review .</li>
            <li> But, as soon as I dried my face, my skin was soo soft and it looked soo light</li>
            <li> my 14 year old daughter says it drys her out and her face itches after every use</li>
            <li> leaves the skin soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> far as cleaning goes, it does the job.</li>
            <li> My daughter breaks out near her hair line.</li>
            <li> I use this soap, because it&#x27;s natural and I have stopped itching since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> So far still no sign</li>
            <li> surprised me</li>
            <li> Recently, I was using alataa saminaa for my non Ghanaian speakers that literally translates to mean &amp;#34; Nigerian Soap.&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t seen no changes cause I already have nice skin no problems but</li>
            <li> also feels clean without feeling tight after washing</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear, it&#x27;s the only thing I use 2x a day!</li>
            <li> this soap smells like candy but smells natural at the same time.</li>
            <li> The hyperpigmentation on my chest, shoulders, and back lightened considerably.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it leaves a weird kind of residue in the basin of my shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very drying, which is not really a problem for me but steer clear if you have dry skin!</li>
            <li> the only negative is that it&#x27;s very drying which I can easily combat with a thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The fragance was a little much.</li>
            <li> Before being told about this by a very good friend I had very bad acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap a few days before New Year&#x27;s Day (Jan. 1) and it last me up until Wed.</li>
            <li> the 3 weeks i&#x27;ve been using it, i&#x27;ve had only 2 minor bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally thrown away all other facial wash products.</li>
            <li> I could do without the chunky bits that I imagine are for exfoliation - they can be a little scratchy if you rub the bar directly on skin.  </li>
            <li> Please let me know , I don&#x27;t want to reorder and wait for a long time m.</li>
            <li> Be extremely careful not to get it in your private areas!!!!</li>
            <li> Also, this soap is half the price of other natural soaps!</li>
            <li> It lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Too drying for my skin, had to stop using, was getting dry patches.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and was hoping this would help dry my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> i also had some dry, scaly areas around the bumps.</li>
            <li> As for me it made my skin itchy and dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried it with my dry skin and it has worked for me as well - getting rid of some dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li> Need to use a moisturizer because your skin will dry out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using this soap on my neck to see if it&#x27;ll lighten the dark part of it.</li>
            <li> You must moisturize after cleaning face because it will leave it very dry.</li>
            <li> (little bumps all over my arms) and a tendency towards facial acne.  </li>
            <li> It burns if you get it into any open cuts, which is a little unnerving.</li>
            <li> The only time I break out is the ovulation cycle and that is 1 or 2 pimples that disappear within a few days.</li>
            <li> I use now every other day and water in between.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers mentioned staining and expiration dates.  </li>
            <li> And it did leave my face feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> It also has a slight rough, exfoliating texture to it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll notice the soap will make the water washing off dark as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im a very picky person and very skeptical especially when it comes to my skin.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had some large, painful, red, acne like bumps errupting along my jawline for about 18 months.</li>
            <li> i think i notice less shine</li>
            <li> but this black soap does wonders to my face.</li>
            <li> Black soap doesn&#x27;t work for everybody, so do your research.</li>
            <li> The way i use it is by cutting a little half inch off first</li>
            <li> I had little bumps there, which I realized was</li>
            <li> The soap does burn/sting a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably too sensitive for it--it made my lips dry out like crazy and get that windburned feeling.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes , just a lil messy</li>
            <li> It dried out my skin a ton, so it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> dried out my skin and made it darker.</li>
            <li> Well, when I received it and showed it to my Aunt of course the first reaction is how ugly it is</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use bar soap for my face at all since bar soap can be a bit harsh for my face</li>
            <li> I recommend it, don&#x27;t waste money on expensive facial washes....</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll repurchase it.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face a couple of times and it made my face get small break outs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have serious acne issues anymore</li>
            <li> I finally found this ugly bar of soap that smelled like spring into summer.  </li>
            <li> This will avoid unnecessary burns on your skin.</li>
            <li> contact dermatitis:(.This is frustrating, because on the one hand, the soap resolved my existing hyperpgimentation.</li>
            <li> I know, that sounds weird.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews I was like &amp;#34;YO LET ME ORDER THIS&amp;#34; unfortunately it&#x27;s been about a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pasty white girl with awful keratosis pilaris</li>
            <li> Is there something wrong with amazon ?</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t find it unpleasant at all, just fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my face break out really bad</li>
            <li> and I was shocked at how well it works!  </li>
            <li> I took a shower  with Dudu Osun 15 minutes ago, and nothing terrible has happened!</li>

            <li> This cleared up my skins complexion within only a couple of days, without drying it up. I used coconut oil with grape seed oil for a after moisturizer. I use now every other day and water in between.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my acne. Not too impressed. The fragance was a little much. It smelt great but for my purpose I think it did not work</li>
            <li> This product is ONE word.....AWESOME!! so glad someone told us about this soap. must try it to believe it!! Has worked wonders for my teen-age son</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product! Only took 3 days with standard shipping!! Thank you so much!&lt;br /&gt;As soon as you open the package, a flood of tropical smells will overwhelm you. It smells great!!&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face for the first time with this tonight. During the washing process, my skin was starting to feel like rubber. I know, that sounds weird. But, as soon as I dried my face, my skin was soo soft and it looked soo light and new!&lt;br /&gt;I will update tomorrow to let everyone know about my acne results upon using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you &lt;3</li>
            <li> I bought this soap a few days before New Year&#x27;s Day (Jan. 1) and it last me up until Wed. March 4. So it lasted for quite a bit. I felt that this soap really kept my face clean.bit literally left my face squeaky clean.  And removed my makeup. Being that I do have problematic skin it did irritate some of the blemishes that I had. And it did leave my face feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  The only one I use noe</li>
            <li> I went through a period of time last year when I was having skin problems and this soap helped a lot.  The almost-black bar started a few conversations when seen in my shower, LOL.  But it feels good on skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling tight.  I could do without the chunky bits that I imagine are for exfoliation - they can be a little scratchy if you rub the bar directly on skin.  I avoided that by lathering a cloth and using it that way.</li>
            <li> Too drying for my skin, had to stop using, was getting dry patches.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything spectacular for my skin. Smells nice, but my skin did not get better or worse. I have oily skin and was hoping this would help dry my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> my 14 year old daughter says it drys her out and her face itches after every use, she can nly use it every few days or she gets a full face chap!  But it does do as it claims.</li>
            <li> this soap smells like candy but smells natural at the same time. i think its working. .. i think i notice less shine but it&#x27;s only been about a week. also feels clean without feeling tight after washing so im sticking with it for now</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP! IT CLEANS REALLY WELL AND SMELLS AWESOME. AT FIRST, MY HUSBAND WAS HESITANT TO USE IT BUT AFTER HE DID, HE LOVES IT TOO!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I have skin issues with body acne and the like and I use this soap with a combination of essential oils and witch hazel. I always use the soap but can get forgetful or just run out of time for the rest of my skin care routine (a four year old and a newborn will do that to ya) and my skin has been so much better since using this soap. I like the smell of it. It&#x27;s almost fruity, not chemical smelling at all. I also like the way it leaves my skin feeling. I don&#x27;t like the soaps that make me feel literally &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;. With this my skin is just simply clean and soft. My only issue is it seems that I am cleaning my shower much more often. It&#x27;s like it leaves a weird kind of residue in the basin of my shower. I have since started just wiping the shower down with a magic eraser before getting out though and that seems to do just fine without adding more than a minute to toal shower time so still totally worth it.</li>
            <li> great soap, great smell. leaves the skin soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This soap was great at first. Eventually it started drying my face out and I had to stop using it. My moisturizer did not help sometimes</li>
            <li> Just know that the water that runs from it bleeds an grayish-brown.  Smells very nice.  I keep one in my bathroom cabinet and get a great scent every time I open the cabinet.  Does a great job of removing oil, sweat and odors naturally!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this soap. It lasts for a very long time. I went ahead and purchased the 6 pack recently because I kept giving pieces away to friends and family.  I do recommend making a lather with your hands and washing your face as opposed to washing with a cloth. This will avoid unnecessary burns on your skin. I use shea butter to moisturize my face at night.  I highly recommend to anyone looking for a natural alternative to keeping my face clean.</li>
            <li> had read about this product online. i&#x27;ve had some large, painful, red, acne like bumps errupting along my jawline for about 18 months. i also had some dry, scaly areas around the bumps. i have taken 3 rounds of antibiotics, tried numerous otc remedies and nothing has worked - til i tried this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the 3 weeks i&#x27;ve been using it, i&#x27;ve had only 2 minor bumps. and my skin started clearing literally after the first day i used it. i am VERY impressed that this product is taking care of what nothing else has. the scaly areas cleared overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have oily to normal skin and use it once or twice a day, my skin does feel tight after use, and i do use a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as to the smell, i&#x27;d descibe it as grassy, not unlike some colognes. i don&#x27;t find it unpleasant at all, just fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i plan to get a bar for my son to try on his acne.</li>
            <li> it sure does look like dudu, but doesn&#x27;t smell like dudu. smells really nice.. very tropical scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as far as cleaning goes, it does the job. you&#x27;ll notice the soap will make the water washing off dark as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a unique soap and fun to try it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel different than other soaps. it&#x27;s less moisturizing than dove and caress, but more moisturizing than most of the other cheap brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably buy more in the future when I am bored with my soap again.</li>
            <li> Made with the best stuff on earth and good for your skin. It really worked for me and my family!</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! Keeps my skin clear, it&#x27;s the only thing I use 2x a day! I definitely recommend it to others. And it&#x27;s affordable .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have been using it for over 6 years now and it works great for my oily/dry skin!</li>
            <li> Very nice soap.  I make handcrafted soaps myself and this has that hand crafted quality.  Lot&#x27;s of soothing glycerin in this soap.</li>
            <li> I have breakouts all over my upper arm for years. Reading the reviews I was like &amp;#34;YO LET ME ORDER THIS&amp;#34; unfortunately it&#x27;s been about a month now I have been using this &amp; i see NO results. 2 stars because it smells good âœŒ</li>
            <li> My daughter likes , just a lil messy</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  My skin is beautiful and vibrant. I simply LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I recently ran across this soap and it&#x27;s changed my life!  I&#x27;m a pasty white girl with awful keratosis pilaris (little bumps all over my arms) and a tendency towards facial acne.  I usually use a great soap off Etsy but it&#x27;s really expensive--it didn&#x27;t do anything amazing to my skin but this stuff smoothed my skin out like nothing else has!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for the first time a couple weeks ago and I was shocked at how well it works!  I wash my whole body with it--my face first so I can leave it set and work for a while.  But it STINGS.  I&#x27;m assuming this will go away at some point but ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only soap I&#x27;ll use now!</li>
            <li> My parents own a african market store so I know what works and what doesn&#x27;t.. Recently, I was using alataa saminaa for my non Ghanaian speakers that literally translates to mean &amp;#34; Nigerian Soap.&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t seen no changes cause I already have nice skin no problems but it smells good..</li>
            <li> Works for severe acne, my son is 15, and it  cleared his and up.  As for me it made my skin itchy and dry.  Doesn&#x27;t work for everyone! !</li>
            <li> This is the best natural soap that I have used. I love the smell of the soap and the way that it feels on my skin. It washes off well and leaves my skin smelling nice and feeling soft. It even makes my bathroom smell good.</li>
            <li> My daughter breaks out near her hair line. She was begging me to get some Proactive. I didn&#x27;t want to have to special order it and also wanted to try a natural product first. I stumbled upon this soap while searching for acne soap on Amazon. It&#x27;s amazing! Within 2 days her acne has disappeared! She loves the soap, and I am happy to have found a product I can feel good about her using that contains no harsh chemicals. I tried it with my dry skin and it has worked for me as well - getting rid of some dry patches on my face. We will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> love it will continue to buy more</li>
            <li> I use this soap, because it&#x27;s natural and I have stopped itching since I&#x27;ve started using it. It is now the only soap I use for me and my daughter. My skin is smoother and clearer than it has been in a while.</li>
            <li> I only use natural soaps, so I am thrilled to learn about this black soap.  Some other reviewers mentioned staining and expiration dates.  I have a white sink counter and there has been no staining.  Sure, the bubbles that drop turn to brown spots, but I wipe them away.  I&#x27;ve also used this with a white washcloth and there was no staining - just rinse it clean.  I ordered mine from Amazon with no way to know the exp. date.  Ordered 5/2013 and received a batch exp. 2/2014.  This smells like fir trees or a pine forest to me, very fresh &amp; pleasant scent.  Also, this soap is half the price of other natural soaps!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as other black soaps!</li>
            <li> Works wonders, my skin isn&#x27;t AS oily anymore</li>
            <li> I took a shower  with Dudu Osun 15 minutes ago, and nothing terrible has happened! The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, it is gentle and indeed smells as if it came from a rain forest.So far the reviews I&#x27;ve read are true. The soap lathers well and makes my skin squeaky clean without immediate dryness. It could have been a combination of  these things:    Since I have dry sensitive skin, I made sure to take every precaution. I rubbed the soap into my hands, and applied it to my skin with my hands, I did not use a loofah or a washcloth. I also rinsed off the soap with cool water IMMEDIATELY after application. After a couple seconds, this soap stripped my skin of its oil simultaneously. Finally, after I stepped out of the shower, I slathered myself with Aveeno, even though I did not have to. My skin was very velvety without the lotion, but again, I cannot take any chances with my sensitive skin.    As for my goal for this soap, I hope that this soap combats my body acne and hyperpigmentation.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Update:    I used the soap for a week, and the results were astonishing. The hyperpigmentation on my chest, shoulders, and back lightened considerably. Within a WEEK. I was so happy. But I started to get a rash around my collarbone. I had little bumps there, which I realized was contact dermatitis:(.This is frustrating, because on the one hand, the soap resolved my existing hyperpgimentation. On the other hand, it gave more acne to deal with. I can&#x27;t use Dudu Osun all over my body anymore. Currently, I am using Shea Moisture&#x27;s Coconut Hibiscus bar soap to fade the remaining marks. Hopefully it evens out my skin tone without giving me contact dermatitis. If this soap does not gives me the same results as Dudu Osun, I will use Dudu Osun as a spot treatment. Wish me luck.</li>
            <li> Osun! It&#x27;s that DUDU! I love this soap. Leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> not real black soap, too many other ingredients, want real stuff from Hawaii</li>
            <li> I loved it... Cleans very well; no allergic reaction... Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I worked at a fulfillment center when I walked by a bin and had to find what was that wonderful smell.  I finally found this ugly bar of soap that smelled like spring into summer.  I read about this soap and how it was so good for your skin. Well, when I received it and showed it to my Aunt of course the first reaction is how ugly it is but OMG does that smell good.  When I took a shower I now honestly have to say that it is the best soap I have ever used.  It leaves your skin soft and smelling fresh and clean more so than with anything I have ever used.  I need to buy a lot more of it.</li>
            <li> This soap is very cleansing, and leaves your skin squeaky clean. However, it strips off all your skins natural oils/protective barriers, and therefore makes your skin produce more oil. It dried out my skin a ton, so it&#x27;s not for me. Instead, I wash my face with organic or manuka honey now, and it cleans my face without stripping it. Much better.</li>
            <li> Great soap! Has really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> dried out my skin and made it darker.</li>
            <li> It made my face break out really bad but it worked great for my mom. Shipping and everything went great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice soap.  I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my acne.  I bought it for that because of all the glowing reviews.  The manufacturer didn&#x27;t claim that it would do anything, so I&#x27;m not knocking any points off for that.</li>
            <li> Good result, took three weeks to see an improvement. Need to use a moisturizer because your skin will dry out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very drying, which is not really a problem for me but steer clear if you have dry skin! It also has a slight rough, exfoliating texture to it. The tropical smell of mine was so mild it was barely detectable, but maybe mine was from an old batch. It burns if you get it into any open cuts, which is a little unnerving. It&#x27;s OK enough that I&#x27;ll use up the bar but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll repurchase it.</li>
            <li> For those who suffer from acne as myself this is the perfect cleanser. It makes my skin feel great. You must moisturize after cleaning face because it will leave it very dry. My suggestion is to follow up with the Shea Moisturizer Organic</li>
            <li> I ordered mine for about a week now. It says it&#x27;s supposed to be shipped on June 26, but then last night I checked it says it hasn&#x27;t been shipped yet. Today I checked , but the it&#x27;s not in my orders anymore! No I did not cancel it. Does anyone know why? How do I know if it&#x27;s still gonna be shipped? I also ordered the unrefined shea butter so that I could use it with the soap since many people said that it dries out your skin, but then it&#x27;s also not in my orders anymore. Is there something wrong with amazon ? If it was canceled , how do I check ? Please let me know , I don&#x27;t want to reorder and wait for a long time m. I really need this soap right now.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best bar soap ever! I usually don&#x27;t use bar soap for my face at all since bar soap can be a bit harsh for my face but this black soap does wonders to my face. Today is my 3rd time using this soap both morning and night (btw i have super oily skin) so this soap is not drying for me. It lighten all my acne marks so quick compare to using my PMD. All i do is wash my face with soap and then i use jojoba oil as my moisturizer and my skin feels wonderful and hydrated. The way i use it is by cutting a little half inch off first so i dont waste the whole bar of soap. Plus it last longer this way. I totally recommend this soap if you have oily acne prone skin and scars. I&#x27;m currently using this soap on my neck to see if it&#x27;ll lighten the dark part of it. So far still no sign yet but I&#x27;ll be patient and update. :D</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to work simply because of the way it&#x27;s been hyped in skincare circles but because of the low cost I was happy to give it a try anyway, and I&#x27;m glad I did! I don&#x27;t have serious acne issues anymore but it works wonders for the milia breakouts I get after having my face threaded and the only negative is that it&#x27;s very drying which I can easily combat with a thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using this soap long enough to give an accurate review . But as of right now I&#x27;m enjoying it. I haven&#x27;t experience any break outs and I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> great product , gives you results fast , foams with just a little soap. my face feels cleaner then ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably too sensitive for it--it made my lips dry out like crazy and get that windburned feeling. Didn&#x27;t break me out but didn&#x27;t help with breakouts either. A lot of people have had success with it though, so if you&#x27;re still looking for that one true acne cure then I&#x27;d say go ahead and try it. :)</li>
            <li> Im a very picky person and very skeptical especially when it comes to my skin. I saw all the good reviews and was thinking hmm this sounds too good to be true...I finally said let me try this, its a good price so hey...Been using this soap for a week and day 1 felt so refreshed and squeaky clean! My skin felt so smooth i even tried it on my face and wow! very rare I take the time to write a product review but this definitely gets 2 thumbs UP!! will order again!!!</li>
            <li> This soap it great! it cleans my face very well. Sometimes i use on my body too.&lt;br /&gt;It does give your face a dry and tightening feeling after washing, but just use some toner and good moisturizer you will be fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some people mentioned that this soap is really good for acne. Here is my advice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne, which i had before i started using this soap, don&#x27;t expect miracle.&lt;br /&gt;Acne doesn&#x27;t come to you in one day, it will not disappear in one day.&lt;br /&gt;Use this soap to clean your face, don&#x27;t use too much skin care product, too much chemical will irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day, it makes feel great!</li>
            <li> This is a very good brand of African black soap. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months and my face is acne free. Before being told about this by a very good friend I had very bad acne. Nothing worked, not even proactive. It&#x27;s not a miracle product, you have to give it time to work! If you&#x27;re considering purchasing for acne treatment, the acne didn&#x27;t sprout over night and the soap won&#x27;t get rid of it over night. The only time I break out is the ovulation cycle and that is 1 or 2 pimples that disappear within a few days. I&#x27;ve finally thrown away all other facial wash products. I know what each ingredient is in the soap,  couldn&#x27;t say that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap consistency was a little surprising because it gets soft, now I just pinch off a pea sized amount and use that for my face. The soap does burn/sting a little but that&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s working.  I recommend it, don&#x27;t waste money on expensive facial washes....try it!</li>
            <li> I used it for about two weeks and my skin did start clearing up but for some reason I stopped using it to try another product. Black soap doesn&#x27;t work for everybody, so do your research.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty good soap. It doesn&#x27;t stink like I thought it would. It does make me feel squeaky clean (literally.) I used it on my face a couple of times and it made my face get small break outs. Maybe because my face is sensitive to certain soaps. So I just use it on my body and everything works fine.</li>
            <li> Nice soap but the black suds get everywhere. The scent can be a bit overpowering, but fresh. Be extremely careful not to get it in your private areas!!!! Burns to high heavens! surprised me</li>
