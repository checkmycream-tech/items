            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>But after a week of using it, I haven&#x27;t really experienced it&#x27;s moisturizing benefits as others have described.</li>
            <li>Great company who truly cares about their product and their customers.</li>
            <li>It has a nice delightful chocolate smell, one that lingers on your skin after you use the lotion.</li>
            <li>No, but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just great.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not an over powering scent, hint of chocolate which makes me happy</li>
            <li>I fear after words get out how great this cream is</li>
            <li>Before I say anything about the product itself, I must take a minute to appreciate how GREAT their customer service is.</li>
            <li>But since I didn&#x27;t I am extremely happy with the results anyways.</li>
            <li>Smells great and goes on well.</li>
            <li>I gained 35lbs and my belly was huge!!!</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I have been using and are pleased, husband never wears ANY lotion, so that tells you something!!</li>

            <li>I put some of this Cocoa butter cream on my heels and bottom of my feet, and noticed it is so much better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife says this cream is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for nails, too, as it keeps cuticles nice and soft.  </li>

            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything to my stretch marks but its great for hydrating and not greasy at all</li>

            <li>Love it love it and</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I have used cocoa butter before &amp; this is totally different, love, love it !!!</li>
            <li>I was glad to find that one application of this rich cream at bedtime solved my problem by morning!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m enjoying the lip balm so much this product have to be good</li>
            <li>Both the natural cocoa butter cream and the coconut lip balm smell great.</li>
            <li>Great product ... Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Do I really need to tell you how good this stuff smells?  </li>
            <li>It could be a bit strong at the beginning</li>
            <li>Thanks Arnies, I tried several brands of Coca Butter and this is the best I&#x27;ve experienced by far.</li>
            <li>The product seems to work fine, but it&#x27;s nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>So creamy and soft, smells great and keeps my pregnant belly moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>The scent is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s to smooth skin</li>
            <li>The cream was delivered on time and makes your skin incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>Ordered this luxurious cream and got a free lip balm as a bonus.</li>
            <li>The creams made my hands and feet smooth with it being winter here in the northeast.</li>
            <li>it is chemical free with no Parabens.</li>
            <li>It has kept my skin moisturized and smooth through this hell of a winter we are having.</li>
            <li>oh and company sent a free lip balm, which was a surprise to me.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin on my face and use it daily on my face and body with great results.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this nice cocoa butter cream.</li>
            <li>It got here very quickly, so I was pleased by the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t take the time out to write reviews of product I purchase but this amazing organic cocoa butter  </li>
            <li>First time ordered for Achilles surgery scar and was so pleased ordered another jar for bilateral knee replacement scars.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I just got this lotion and used it for the first time, I love the texture and smell, it was delivered on time</li>
            <li>First of all, it goes on very easily and is readily absorbed which has helped during massage and reduced my scar tissue and the scar&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion for dry skin, which I have.</li>
            <li>I have many stretch marks from my two pregnancies and so far i love this product.  </li>
            <li>finally found the Holy effective and appropriate</li>
            <li>;-)&lt;br /&gt;The coconut lip balm smells so good too and makes your lips very soft.</li>
            <li>This seller was responsive and go the order right out to me!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, nice and thick, just what a body butter should be. :)</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and leaves skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>Also, love the lip balm which glides on with ease and is very soothing on the lips.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of the product, but it&#x27;s very greasy and leaves grease stains on my clothes.</li>
            <li>it means you applied too much :)</li>
            <li>seriously probably the best chap stick</li>
            <li>I am 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li>I got it to prevent stretch marks since I&#x27;m almost 40 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>absorbs rather quickly, but I found out if you feel greasy</li>
            <li>I tell it is really amazing no other ways to describe it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>My preference is to use all natural products for the best results, because other products burn my skin and leave it drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Thanks again!!</li>
            <li>Also the free lip balm that came with it was really</li>
            <li>I recommend on a freshly washed face, to coat the face (every night).</li>
            <li>I used to make my own beauty products from ingredients such as this, but never came up with anything that goes on as well as this one.</li>
            <li>I maybe able to completely vanish them.</li>
            <li>but hopefully it will be worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li>If your pregnant with your first child or you just had your last, you really should invest in this because it&#x27;s just a good product all around.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m waiting from a cream is that it absorbs quickly and this is exactly what happens with Arnies.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I put some on my chins too and it softened the skin right up, as well as my elbows</li>
            <li>Light scent and leaves super soft skin.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my extremely dry skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Mild smell, very creamy.</li>
            <li>It is thick &amp; rich and very creamy, works very nicely.  </li>
            <li>Is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>Really was hopeful about this product!</li>
            <li>If I could give this cream more stars I definitely would!!!</li>
            <li>will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good cocoa butter cream, and this is certainly worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I always end up going back to some medicated kind that is def not organic and all natural.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, you can actually spell the cocoa in the cream which indicate to me that it&#x27;s real cocoa in the cream.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, easy to rub in, extremely moisturizing &amp; is not greasy!  </li>
            <li>I have seen changes in my skin looking smooth , soft and make me look more younger am 54 years old</li>
            <li>and I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s working because the cream is made out of pure cocoa butter plus Shea butter and moisturizing oils.</li>
            <li>product&#x27;s scent is a little strong for some people but personally, it is a pleasant, chocolate smell typical of cocoa butter products.</li>
            <li>The product arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Real soon.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very emollient.</li>
            <li>But the smooth feeling that I feel on my skin, isn&#x27;t actually my skin.</li>
            <li>haha..</li>
            <li>Used the whole thing every day for almost 3 months.</li>
            <li>Several Retailers act as though follow up is not neccessary once they provide a tracking number (Required by Amazon) and receive confirmed payment.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I do like the product just can&#x27;t see myself paying that much for it again.</li>
            <li>and this cream is very soothing.</li>
            <li>The product is very concentrated, and smells like chocolate ice cream.</li>
            <li>Very luxurious and super-moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;You need just a dab or it will feel greesy, so the jar lasts for a while.</li>
            <li>It is especially great for extra-dry skin or cold season.</li>
            <li>Not too much fragence.</li>
            <li>The free cocoa butter lip balm, this seriously smells good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>I only wish I had this when I had my first child and continued to use it throughout my pregnancies because I could very well see that this just might have kept me completely stretch mark free.</li>
            <li>I used last night because I was so excited about the cream.  </li>
            <li>so my skin is certainly lacking moisture, as I do live in New England!</li>
            <li>and I thought this was both very professional along with smart marketing/promotion of product.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter immediately made my hands feel smooth and soft, definitely not too oily at all.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more once I finish my second jar.</li>
            <li>hope this helped, I would purchase this again without hesitation and recommend it highly and give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>From the feel of the cream to the scent, you can tell that this is a high quality product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m pretty realistic when it comes to expectations, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting this to get rid of or actually even lighten my stretch marks from giving birth to five children.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it is not oily.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling non greasy formula that doesn&#x27;t feel icky.</li>
            <li>The cream is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>I received the products in record time, took advantage of &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; and will buy more especially during the winter months when my hands and feet get so dry!</li>
            <li>Am not here to write a review, i am here to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>but I think the raw skin and itching was just needing something more emollient.</li>
            <li>They are only noticeable at certain angles!  </li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin and there have been no problems using this cream.</li>
            <li>The organic cocoa butter does wonders with toning the skin and making the skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>After a month my stretch marks have faded considerably!  </li>
            <li>She is saying her skin feels so soft after using this product!</li>
            <li>The lip balm does exactly the same to the lips.</li>
            <li>I use so much of it that I am not sure it will last a month :-)</li>
            <li>and I had no trouble w the scent.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s only because they want to charge so much for it...</li>
            <li>All natural product.</li>
            <li>Its all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>and I can see some childbirth old scars erasing.</li>
            <li>Paired with crusty elbows that I can&#x27;t keep soft no matter what.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product but too expensive and jar too small.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a more expensive than other products, even double or more, but if you are looking for an organic, cocoa butter cream, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t completely disappear but without surgery I don&#x27;t really see that happening anyways, but they are way lighter than I ever expected them to get with just a cream.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy some more when I&#x27;m done with this jar, which will be a while because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>So far this is the only thing that has kept me from digging at my alligator-skin arms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this probably about a month now and barely</li>
            <li>jar is smaller than I thought, but given how rich this cream is you only need a very small amount to cover your whole body.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I am very particular about moisture products and was very curious about how this one would be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  a generous jar full and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick, put some on my hands, which were raw from doing dishes and being this time of year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 27 year old woman with occasional dry skin.</li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> But after a week of using it, I haven&#x27;t really experienced it&#x27;s moisturizing benefits as others have described.</li>
            <li> Great company who truly cares about their product and their customers.</li>
            <li> It has a nice delightful chocolate smell, one that lingers on your skin after you use the lotion.</li>
            <li> No, but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just great.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not an over powering scent, hint of chocolate which makes me happy</li>
            <li> I fear after words get out how great this cream is</li>
            <li> Before I say anything about the product itself, I must take a minute to appreciate how GREAT their customer service is.</li>
            <li> But since I didn&#x27;t I am extremely happy with the results anyways.</li>
            <li> Smells great and goes on well.</li>
            <li> I gained 35lbs and my belly was huge!!!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have been using and are pleased, husband never wears ANY lotion, so that tells you something!!</li>

            <li> Worth every penny!!!</li>

            <li> but this is by far the best one of them all.</li>

            <li> I love the way this product smells.</li>
            <li> I immediately opened it up to smell it, lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I put some of this Cocoa butter cream on my heels and bottom of my feet, and noticed it is so much better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife says this cream is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for nails, too, as it keeps cuticles nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> And I love the smell, almost like chocolate.</li>
            <li> My wife really love this and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>

            <li> The follow up customer service from Arnies was outstanding.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin smooth and moisturized!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of this product from seller.</li>
            <li> Does it cute stretch marks?</li>
            <li> love the fact</li>
            <li> And the free lip balm is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Look out summer time! :)</li>
            <li> I even used it on my feet overnight, with socks over them, and didn&#x27;t have snagworthy feet any more.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything to my stretch marks but its great for hydrating and not greasy at all</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Love it love it and</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I have used cocoa butter before &amp; this is totally different, love, love it !!!</li>
            <li> I was glad to find that one application of this rich cream at bedtime solved my problem by morning!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m enjoying the lip balm so much this product have to be good</li>
            <li> Both the natural cocoa butter cream and the coconut lip balm smell great.</li>
            <li> Great product ... Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Do I really need to tell you how good this stuff smells?  </li>
            <li> It could be a bit strong at the beginning</li>
            <li> Thanks Arnies, I tried several brands of Coca Butter and this is the best I&#x27;ve experienced by far.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work fine, but it&#x27;s nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> So creamy and soft, smells great and keeps my pregnant belly moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> The scent is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s to smooth skin</li>
            <li> The cream was delivered on time and makes your skin incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> Ordered this luxurious cream and got a free lip balm as a bonus.</li>
            <li> The creams made my hands and feet smooth with it being winter here in the northeast.</li>
            <li> it is chemical free with no Parabens.</li>
            <li> It has kept my skin moisturized and smooth through this hell of a winter we are having.</li>
            <li> oh and company sent a free lip balm, which was a surprise to me.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin on my face and use it daily on my face and body with great results.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this nice cocoa butter cream.</li>
            <li> It got here very quickly, so I was pleased by the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time out to write reviews of product I purchase but this amazing organic cocoa butter  </li>
            <li> First time ordered for Achilles surgery scar and was so pleased ordered another jar for bilateral knee replacement scars.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I just got this lotion and used it for the first time, I love the texture and smell, it was delivered on time</li>
            <li> First of all, it goes on very easily and is readily absorbed which has helped during massage and reduced my scar tissue and the scar&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for dry skin, which I have.</li>
            <li> I have many stretch marks from my two pregnancies and so far i love this product.  </li>
            <li> finally found the Holy effective and appropriate</li>
            <li> ;-)&lt;br /&gt;The coconut lip balm smells so good too and makes your lips very soft.</li>
            <li> This seller was responsive and go the order right out to me!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, nice and thick, just what a body butter should be. :)</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> Also, love the lip balm which glides on with ease and is very soothing on the lips.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of the product, but it&#x27;s very greasy and leaves grease stains on my clothes.</li>
            <li> it means you applied too much :)</li>
            <li> seriously probably the best chap stick</li>
            <li> I am 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li> I got it to prevent stretch marks since I&#x27;m almost 40 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> absorbs rather quickly, but I found out if you feel greasy</li>
            <li> I tell it is really amazing no other ways to describe it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> My preference is to use all natural products for the best results, because other products burn my skin and leave it drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> Also the free lip balm that came with it was really</li>
            <li> I recommend on a freshly washed face, to coat the face (every night).</li>
            <li> I used to make my own beauty products from ingredients such as this, but never came up with anything that goes on as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I maybe able to completely vanish them.</li>
            <li> but hopefully it will be worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li> If your pregnant with your first child or you just had your last, you really should invest in this because it&#x27;s just a good product all around.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m waiting from a cream is that it absorbs quickly and this is exactly what happens with Arnies.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put some on my chins too and it softened the skin right up, as well as my elbows</li>
            <li> Light scent and leaves super soft skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my extremely dry skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Mild smell, very creamy.</li>
            <li> It is thick &amp; rich and very creamy, works very nicely.  </li>
            <li> Is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> Really was hopeful about this product!</li>
            <li> If I could give this cream more stars I definitely would!!!</li>
            <li> will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good cocoa butter cream, and this is certainly worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I always end up going back to some medicated kind that is def not organic and all natural.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, you can actually spell the cocoa in the cream which indicate to me that it&#x27;s real cocoa in the cream.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, easy to rub in, extremely moisturizing &amp; is not greasy!  </li>
            <li> I have seen changes in my skin looking smooth , soft and make me look more younger am 54 years old</li>
            <li> and I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s working because the cream is made out of pure cocoa butter plus Shea butter and moisturizing oils.</li>
            <li> product&#x27;s scent is a little strong for some people but personally, it is a pleasant, chocolate smell typical of cocoa butter products.</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Real soon.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very emollient.</li>
            <li> But the smooth feeling that I feel on my skin, isn&#x27;t actually my skin.</li>
            <li> haha..</li>
            <li> Used the whole thing every day for almost 3 months.</li>
            <li> Several Retailers act as though follow up is not neccessary once they provide a tracking number (Required by Amazon) and receive confirmed payment.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I do like the product just can&#x27;t see myself paying that much for it again.</li>
            <li> and this cream is very soothing.</li>
            <li> The product is very concentrated, and smells like chocolate ice cream.</li>
            <li> Very luxurious and super-moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;You need just a dab or it will feel greesy, so the jar lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> It is especially great for extra-dry skin or cold season.</li>
            <li> Not too much fragence.</li>
            <li> The free cocoa butter lip balm, this seriously smells good enough to eat.</li>
            <li> I only wish I had this when I had my first child and continued to use it throughout my pregnancies because I could very well see that this just might have kept me completely stretch mark free.</li>
            <li> I used last night because I was so excited about the cream.  </li>
            <li> so my skin is certainly lacking moisture, as I do live in New England!</li>
            <li> and I thought this was both very professional along with smart marketing/promotion of product.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter immediately made my hands feel smooth and soft, definitely not too oily at all.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more once I finish my second jar.</li>
            <li> hope this helped, I would purchase this again without hesitation and recommend it highly and give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> From the feel of the cream to the scent, you can tell that this is a high quality product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m pretty realistic when it comes to expectations, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting this to get rid of or actually even lighten my stretch marks from giving birth to five children.</li>
            <li> Most importantly it is not oily.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling non greasy formula that doesn&#x27;t feel icky.</li>
            <li> The cream is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> I received the products in record time, took advantage of &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; and will buy more especially during the winter months when my hands and feet get so dry!</li>
            <li> Am not here to write a review, i am here to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> but I think the raw skin and itching was just needing something more emollient.</li>
            <li> They are only noticeable at certain angles!  </li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin and there have been no problems using this cream.</li>
            <li> The organic cocoa butter does wonders with toning the skin and making the skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> After a month my stretch marks have faded considerably!  </li>
            <li> She is saying her skin feels so soft after using this product!</li>
            <li> The lip balm does exactly the same to the lips.</li>
            <li> I use so much of it that I am not sure it will last a month :-)</li>
            <li> and I had no trouble w the scent.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only because they want to charge so much for it...</li>
            <li> All natural product.</li>
            <li> Its all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> and I can see some childbirth old scars erasing.</li>
            <li> Paired with crusty elbows that I can&#x27;t keep soft no matter what.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product but too expensive and jar too small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a more expensive than other products, even double or more, but if you are looking for an organic, cocoa butter cream, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t completely disappear but without surgery I don&#x27;t really see that happening anyways, but they are way lighter than I ever expected them to get with just a cream.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy some more when I&#x27;m done with this jar, which will be a while because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So far this is the only thing that has kept me from digging at my alligator-skin arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this probably about a month now and barely</li>
            <li> jar is smaller than I thought, but given how rich this cream is you only need a very small amount to cover your whole body.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I am very particular about moisture products and was very curious about how this one would be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  a generous jar full and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick, put some on my hands, which were raw from doing dishes and being this time of year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old woman with occasional dry skin.</li>
            <li> Its rich and thick, yet creamy!  </li>
            <li> first night I just used it on my hands and when I woke up the next morning I was shocked by how smooth and silky my hands were.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have used other all natural lip treatments for chapped/dry lips and none of them work</li>
            <li> will update this post in a few months to state the effects of this cream after long term use and inform you all if with some commitment, this product really can make your stretch marks disappear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and doesn&#x27;t make me hot like the regular coco butter.</li>
            <li> I know I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a drastic change</li>
            <li> The cream is certainly creamy and thick, but it is NOT actually organic, and that bothers me that they advertise it that way....</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin not only in the winter, but all year long</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use anything harsh or I get pimples and so far this lotion has done nothing but remove blemishes</li>
            <li> , those are my dry areas on my body.</li>
            <li> I also have my boyfriend using it on his elbows as they get dry</li>
            <li> you have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> After trying countless cocoa butter cream products, I found they were either overpowering and lingering in scent and were not easily absorbed which defeats of the purpose of massaging and breaking up scar tissue.  </li>
            <li> forgot to mention I also have very dry feet.</li>
            <li> I did not get 1 single stretch mark on my belly!</li>
            <li> What made this little container of cocoa butter different from anything else I could get in a store?</li>
            <li> I read other reviews where some people said this smells bad, off, or is too strong!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been having extremely dry and itchy skin on my arms due to severe winter weather.</li>
            <li> I took a picture of my 6 year old stretch marks (obtained from growth spurt) before using this product in order to see the results, and I can see that it is slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have extremely dry skin due to an auto immune disease of the skin and it really did not keep me hydrated.</li>
            <li> Just look at all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will work for other people but not me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t testify as to whether this has improved my stretch marks, but I can say this is an extremely moisturizing body</li>
            <li> When this product first arrived I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> I bought the cocoa butter to help with stretch marks during pregnancy but for the price and the size of the container you get its so not worth it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it will help my stretch marks, but I haven&#x27;t been using it very long yet.  </li>
            <li> at half the jar gone, and it&#x27;s given me relief</li>
            <li> so I feel a little hosed...</li>
            <li> However, it has broke my skin out a little</li>
            <li> This product certainly is a little pricey</li>
            <li> Has a little greasy after effect.</li>
            <li> so I use it religiously everyday.</li>
            <li> The cream is not greasy, which I&#x27;m so thankful because I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I even skipped a few days</li>
            <li> not sure I would buy it again because of that....</li>
            <li> but I can slowly see the results already.</li>
            <li> I do use the lotion but for me it wasnt as thick....</li>
            <li> And the smell is enough to almost make you sick.</li>
            <li> works well, but smells icky!</li>
            <li> It is very hard for me to find a cream that I don&#x27;t have a reaction to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and goes on well.</li>
            <li> The product is very expensive in my opinion too.</li>
            <li> It was frozen when I pulled it out of my mailbox (bad weather!)</li>
            <li> is the scent (cocoa butter /nutty), but it isn&#x27;t so awful that it would stop me from purchasing this again.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells amazing, nice and thick, just what a body butter should be. :)</li>
            <li> I love it .it is the best i have ever got.</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast. Both the natural cocoa butter cream and the coconut lip balm smell great. This is an all around good product which I will purchase again. The cocoa butter cream is moisturizing and the lip balm is soothing. The lip balm is a great bonus! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am in love with this cream! Smells amazing and feels amazing! I am 7 months pregnant so I use it religiously everyday. I also really love the lip balm that came with it too, seriously probably the best chap stick I&#x27;ve ever used. I have used other all natural lip treatments for chapped/dry lips and none of them work I always end up going back to some medicated kind that is def not organic and all natural. Would for sure without a doubt recommend both products to my friends!</li>
            <li> Great product ... Makes my skin soft. I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> Just used it for a couple days, it smells really good and seems to be a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! The smell is amazing. Most importantly it is not oily. This is very important to me so I am very happy to have found this product! I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work fine, but it&#x27;s nothing to write home about. And the smell is enough to almost make you sick.</li>
            <li> Luxuriant!  I have been using this wonderful cream for about two weeks. The scent is fabulous. The cream is nice and thick. It is not greasy, which is a bonus. I feel like I am pampering myself when I apply this stuff. The best part is...it is organic, so no parabens or mineral oil. Will definitely order again and recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells. I am not sure if it is really working on my stretch marks though!</li>
            <li> Product is very strong smelling and even after washing your hands there is still an odor.</li>
            <li> Yeah! My cocoa butter arrived today at my door. It got here very quickly, so I was pleased by the fast delivery. It is winter time now so my skin is certainly lacking moisture, as I do live in New England! I am very particular about moisture products and was very curious about how this one would be. I immediately opened it up to smell it, lovely scent. It&#x27;s nice and thick, put some on my hands, which were raw from doing dishes and being this time of year. The cocoa butter immediately made my hands feel smooth and soft, definitely not too oily at all. I put some on my chins too and it softened the skin right up, as well as my elbows, those are my dry areas on my body. I would highly recommend this nice cocoa butter cream. It&#x27;s going to last me awhile too, as I didn&#x27;t need to put a lot on to have it sink into my skin and soften it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to mention I also have very dry feet. I put some of this Cocoa butter cream on my heels and bottom of my feet, and noticed it is so much better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped, I would purchase this again without hesitation and recommend it highly and give it 5 stars. This seller was responsive and go the order right out to me! Here&#x27;s to smooth skin ladies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JP</li>
            <li> This cream was delivered very quickly and packaged nicely. Is exactly what it says it is. Lip balm that comes with it is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave the body cream to my mom and she loves it!</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m waiting from a cream is that it absorbs quickly and this is exactly what happens with Arnies.&lt;br /&gt;I like the texture and it smells very good. It could be a bit strong at the beginning but you get really used after a few days. You could eat it ! ;-)&lt;br /&gt;The coconut lip balm smells so good too and makes your lips very soft.</li>
            <li> First time ordered for Achilles surgery scar and was so pleased ordered another jar for bilateral knee replacement scars. After trying countless cocoa butter cream products, I found they were either overpowering and lingering in scent and were not easily absorbed which defeats of the purpose of massaging and breaking up scar tissue.  This product is excellent.  First of all, it goes on very easily and is readily absorbed which has helped during massage and reduced my scar tissue and the scar&#x27;s appearance. An added plus is the scent is very pleasant and not overpowering like most cocoa butter products. Also, love the lip balm which glides on with ease and is very soothing on the lips. Will definitely be ordering more once I finish my second jar. Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I love lotions!  I grew up on Palmer&#x27;s!  However. .. Arnies has knocked them out the box!  After a month my stretch marks have faded considerably!  They are only noticeable at certain angles!  I will definetely continue to use! The teture is superb!  Its rich and thick, yet creamy!  It goes on smooth, easy to rub in, extremely moisturizing &amp; is not greasy!  Do I really need to tell you how good this stuff smells?  I read other reviews where some people said this smells bad, off, or is too strong!  Those reviewers need to have their noses checked!  The smell is MAGICAL! Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, skin feels amazing and I had no trouble w the scent. Light scent and leaves super soft skin.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! I slather it all over my growing (and itchy) baby bump and it is so moisturizing. Smells amazing too!!!!</li>
            <li> Cocoa Butter plush Shea Butter all in one cream?  I love it!  This stuff is natural and so awesome!  I don&#x27;t like using chemicals on my body and this is the perfect solution for me!</li>
            <li> The cream is certainly creamy and thick, but it is NOT actually organic, and that bothers me that they advertise it that way....and it&#x27;s only because they want to charge so much for it...so I feel a little hosed...not sure I would buy it again because of that....</li>
            <li> My wife says this cream is fantastic!  She is nearing the 2nd trimester of our second child. She&#x27;s always looking for creams and things to help with stretch marks. She is saying her skin feels so soft after using this product! Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It&#x27;s hard to find a good cocoa butter cream, and this is certainly worth the price.  It&#x27;s great for nails, too, as it keeps cuticles nice and soft.  And I love the smell, almost like chocolate.</li>
            <li> Organic Cocoa Butter Cream is just the item My wife had been shopping for,.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells good too,.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again Amazon team for Making this item available thru your Network,.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best coco butter I have ever bought. Yes, I buy a lot of coco butter but this is by far the best one of them all. I will definitely buying this again. Real soon. Also it smells great try try not to eat it. :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Non greasy and very easy to apply. My wife really love this and won&#x27;t use anything else. She has very sensitive skin and there have been no problems using this cream. Also the free lip balm that came with it was really great.&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s scent is a little strong for some people but personally, it is a pleasant, chocolate smell typical of cocoa butter products. From the feel of the cream to the scent, you can tell that this is a high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;It is a more expensive than other products, even double or more, but if you are looking for an organic, cocoa butter cream, this is the way to go. Just look at all the other reviews. Also the customer service from the retailer is amazing!</li>
            <li> I waited 8 months to write this since I wanted to give it a fair review. I bought this to keep my belly hydrated during my pregnancy. I hoped that it would prevent stretch marks but I had my doubts since stretch marks are supposedly genetic and my mom has a lot of them. I gained 35lbs and my belly was huge!!! I used this cream 2-3 times per day and went through 3 jars of this stuff and it paid off! I did not get 1 single stretch mark on my belly! This cream is pure gold and one of the best investments for my self esteem.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very emollient. It&#x27;s  a generous jar full and a little goes a long way. The aroma is soothing, not&lt;br /&gt;over powering. You can see and hear  someone else reviewing it on  You Tube.</li>
            <li> As others have said, it smells amazing. But after a week of using it, I haven&#x27;t really experienced it&#x27;s moisturizing benefits as others have described. I&#x27;m a 27 year old woman with occasional dry skin. It works well on my legs and body at keeping it moisturized. But the smooth feeling that I feel on my skin, isn&#x27;t actually my skin. It&#x27;s the oils from the cream. I guess it doesnt rub/absorb into my skin well. That&#x27;s probably why it doesnt work as well on my hands.</li>
            <li> great lotion, planning on using it for awhile, love the nice smell but i wish it could be cheaper or in  bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> The cream was delivered on time and makes your skin incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and it is amazing!  It smells like chocolate and makes your skin feel like silk. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Ordered this luxurious cream and got a free lip balm as a bonus. The creams made my hands and feet smooth with it being winter here in the northeast. The lip balm had interesting ingredients I&#x27;d never seen in a balm and it goes on smooth as silk! My friend said she didn&#x27;t know what the smell of the cream was but that she wanted to eat it! haha.. I received the products in record time, took advantage of &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; and will buy more especially during the winter months when my hands and feet get so dry!</li>
            <li> Just used for a few days and my skin feels much softer.</li>
            <li> Works amazing and smell soooo goood. I just wish the jar was bigger. I use so much of it that I am not sure it will last a month :-) I did not care for the lip balm.</li>
            <li> I love this product. So creamy and it smells wonderful.  I use it everywhere, but it was perfect to keep my face moisturized after a chemical peel.</li>
            <li> So creamy and soft, smells great and keeps my pregnant belly moisturized all day. Love it!</li>
            <li> The Cocoa butter was received as promised.  I guess I just Start using it  couple of days  But I love it  is wonderful  I have seen changes in my skin looking smooth , soft and make me look more younger am 54 years old</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of the product, but it&#x27;s very greasy and leaves grease stains on my clothes.</li>
            <li> This product helps my eczema better than prescription steroid&lt;br /&gt;cream.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Has a wonderful smell and glides on smooth. Absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling very soft. Both my husband and I have been using and are pleased, husband never wears ANY lotion, so that tells you something!! The lip balm feels amazing too! All natural product. Great company who truly cares about their product and their customers.</li>
            <li> It been a month and I still haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and smells wonderful. This is a great lotion for dry skin, which I have. I will definitely buy some more when I&#x27;m done with this jar, which will be a while because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this cream!!  Omg, everyone is correct that it smells wonderful, like chocolate cocoa!  This cocoa butter is an excellent moisturizer!  It is thick &amp; rich and very creamy, works very nicely.  I am not sure if it will help my stretch marks, but I haven&#x27;t been using it very long yet.  I would order this again because it is an excellent body-butter and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff! Smells great and makes my extremely dry skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!! It&#x27;s not too thick and doesn&#x27;t make me hot like the regular coco butter.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and really smells great! However, it has broke my skin out a little and I believe it is because I have been using the cocoa butter with petroleum for years. Also, the lip balm is amazing! The organic cocoa butter does wonders with toning the skin and making the skin very soft. The lip balm does exactly the same to the lips. This product is definitely worth a try! Even though my skin got a tad irritated by it, I still use the product in hopes that my skin will adapt to it,.</li>
            <li> I recommend on a freshly washed face, to coat the face (every night). Good hydration, does what it says. Packaged adorable as well that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Really was hopeful about this product! I read all the reviews. But like every stretch mark cream it was too good to be true! Used the whole thing every day for almost 3 months. Haven&#x27;t seen any results! The product is very expensive in my opinion too. Almost 30 dollars and saw no results! Maybe it will work for other people but not me.</li>
            <li> Great lotion,  very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Purchased Cocoa Butter and could feel the improvement in smoothness to my skin after using for 1 week.  The follow up customer service from Arnies was outstanding.  I was informed of tracking information for shipment immediately.  I also received a follow up customer satisfaction inquiry email as well.  Several Retailers act as though follow up is not neccessary once they provide a tracking number (Required by Amazon) and receive confirmed payment.  Arnies took the extra step to show customer appreciation by following up and I thought this was both very professional along with smart marketing/promotion of product. I purchased the Cocoa Butter again immediately after feeling the improvement in my skin texture.  I will keep this Cocoa Butter stocked in my skin care collection.  Thanks Arnies, I tried several brands of Coca Butter and this is the best I&#x27;ve experienced by far.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome, &amp; yes I used it on my face.  I have used cocoa butter before &amp; this is totally different, love, love it !!!</li>
            <li> I have many stretch marks from my two pregnancies and so far i love this product.  Its all natural and organic. Nice smelling non greasy formula that doesn&#x27;t feel icky. I am hoping this will help diminish and fade al the stretch marks that I have.</li>
            <li> Love the cream, smells so wonderful! And the lip balm has a great coconut taste to it, yummy!</li>
            <li> This smells so good, I want to lick it! It has a nice delightful chocolate smell, one that lingers on your skin after you use the lotion. It makes your skin smooth and moisturized! The lip balm is excellent also, smells great, and I love it on my lips. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I just got this lotion and used it for the first time, I love the texture and smell, it was delivered on time and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results. I got it to prevent stretch marks since I&#x27;m almost 40 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> I liked it  fantastic good strong light and moisturizing and thank you for Amazon on shipping speed and reach in excellent condition and there is a gift moist lips all you beautiful Wishlist</li>
            <li> If I could give this cream more stars I definitely would!!! This is the best cream I have ever used! This is a total body cream. I even use it on my face and eyes. I fully recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works really well. I will be ordering more of this product from seller.</li>
            <li> I bought the cocoa butter to help with stretch marks during pregnancy but for the price and the size of the container you get its so not worth it. I do like the product just can&#x27;t see myself paying that much for it again.</li>
            <li> It smells like chocolate! It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and goes on well. Does it cute stretch marks? No, but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> works well, but smells icky!</li>
            <li> When this product first arrived I was a little skeptical. What made this little container of cocoa butter different from anything else I could get in a store? I was proved wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cocoa butter body cream has a pleasant scent and feels luxurious on the skin. I suffer from dry skin not only in the winter, but all year long and this cream is very soothing. It is very hard for me to find a cream that I don&#x27;t have a reaction to. I am using it on my face and body. I also have my boyfriend using it on his elbows as they get dry too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact it is chemical free with no Parabens. My preference is to use all natural products for the best results, because other products burn my skin and leave it drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again. Great brand! And the free lip balm is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Cocoa butter + Shea butter cream for over a month and it&#x27;s just great. It has kept my skin moisturized and smooth through this hell of a winter we are having. The cream is not greasy, which I&#x27;m so thankful because I use it everyday and I have super sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t use anything harsh or I get pimples and so far this lotion has done nothing but remove blemishes and I can see some childbirth old scars erasing. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s working because the cream is made out of pure cocoa butter plus Shea butter and moisturizing oils. Look out summer time! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a cocoa smell but it&#x27;s not an over powering scent, hint of chocolate which makes me happy all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is absolutely amazing, hey the brand says it all, Arnies Amazing, oh and company sent a free lip balm, which was a surprise to me. Also made of cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon I&#x27;m going to order another one. I fear after words get out how great this cream is company might run out of stock.</li>
            <li> Nice and creamy with a yummy smell</li>
            <li> I used to make my own beauty products from ingredients such as this, but never came up with anything that goes on as well as this one. The product is very concentrated, and smells like chocolate ice cream. It was frozen when I pulled it out of my mailbox (bad weather!) but wasn&#x27;t affected when it thawed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been having extremely dry and itchy skin on my arms due to severe winter weather. Paired with crusty elbows that I can&#x27;t keep soft no matter what. I was glad to find that one application of this rich cream at bedtime solved my problem by morning! I even skipped a few days once I thought I was &#x27;cured&#x27; but had to go back to using it eventually. So far this is the only thing that has kept me from digging at my alligator-skin arms. I even used it on my feet overnight, with socks over them, and didn&#x27;t have snagworthy feet any more. I&#x27;ve had this probably about a month now and barely at half the jar gone, and it&#x27;s given me relief that I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get. I&#x27;m sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried argan oil and coconut oil on my arms but I think the raw skin and itching was just needing something more emollient. This cream did it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything to my stretch marks but its great for hydrating and not greasy at all</li>
            <li> Before I say anything about the product itself, I must take a minute to appreciate how GREAT their customer service is. I received an email as soon as I placed my order, informing me of the status of my order and additional facts about the product. The product practically shipped instantaneously and I received it well before the estimated delivery date. My experience buying with this seller surpassed my expectations by a landslide. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I have only been using it for about a week, once or twice a day but I can slowly see the results already. I took a picture of my 6 year old stretch marks (obtained from growth spurt) before using this product in order to see the results, and I can see that it is slowly fading away. I know I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a drastic change but I believe with continuous use I maybe able to completely vanish them. This product certainly is a little pricey but hopefully it will be worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this post in a few months to state the effects of this cream after long term use and inform you all if with some commitment, this product really can make your stretch marks disappear.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The cocoa smell is yummy. Very luxurious and super-moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;You need just a dab or it will feel greesy, so the jar lasts for a while. It is especially great for extra-dry skin or cold season.</li>
            <li> Mild smell, very creamy. Has a little greasy after effect. Loved the lip balm that came with it too!</li>
            <li> To be fair, I really liked the texture and the creamy it was. In fact my doctor recommended that I try cocoa butter cream. ( not necessarily this brand) Unfortunately, I have extremely dry skin due to an auto immune disease of the skin and it really did not keep me hydrated. However, I would recommend the product to people who need a product to hydrate, but not for skin conditions like chronic eczema.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t testify as to whether this has improved my stretch marks, but I can say this is an extremely moisturizing body cream!&lt;br /&gt;The jar is smaller than I thought, but given how rich this cream is you only need a very small amount to cover your whole body.&lt;br /&gt;The first night I just used it on my hands and when I woke up the next morning I was shocked by how smooth and silky my hands were.&lt;br /&gt;This absorbs rather quickly, but I found out if you feel greasy it means you applied too much :)&lt;br /&gt;The only thing about this I&#x27;m not crazy about is the scent (cocoa butter /nutty), but it isn&#x27;t so awful that it would stop me from purchasing this again.&lt;br /&gt;If you have extremely dry skin this cream is a must!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m pretty realistic when it comes to expectations, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting this to get rid of or actually even lighten my stretch marks from giving birth to five children. So you can imagine my surprise when after several uses of this cream, my stretch marks actually did lighten up quite a bit. They didn&#x27;t completely disappear but without surgery I don&#x27;t really see that happening anyways, but they are way lighter than I ever expected them to get with just a cream. I only wish I had this when I had my first child and continued to use it throughout my pregnancies because I could very well see that this just might have kept me completely stretch mark free. But since I didn&#x27;t I am extremely happy with the results anyways. My skin is extremely soft and its excellent as a moisturizer when you get out of the shower or bath. The free cocoa butter lip balm, this seriously smells good enough to eat. If your pregnant with your first child or you just had your last, you really should invest in this because it&#x27;s just a good product all around.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time out to write reviews of product I purchase but this amazing organic cocoa butter  I used last night because I was so excited about the cream.  I tell it is really amazing no other ways to describe it. I love the smell, you can actually spell the cocoa in the cream which indicate to me that it&#x27;s real cocoa in the cream.  Love it love it and will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> This creme is amazing. It keeps my skin moisturized all day and it has the most amazing scent. I have oily skin on my face and use it daily on my face and body with great results.</li>

            <li> Used a lot of products for the treatment of skin injury in the foot of my son I did not find any resul&lt;br /&gt;And finally found the Holy effective and appropriate bought two cans and almost implemented and will buy more&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not only for the treatment of skin diseases, but it is a beauty and well-being of the skin, everyone in my family uses, all of us dies&lt;br /&gt;I recommend everyone buy and do not hesitate to experiment ....</li>
