            <li> I love Triple Lanolin w/Aloe Vera Lotion. Nothing else comes near.</li>
            <li> Love it, keeps hands soft</li>
            <li> Triple Lanolin Aloe Vera Lotion is the BEST hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used...just a small amount totally moisturizes your skin. It helps heal rough, chapped and cracked WINTER hands quickly without leaving a greasy residue. I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser and haven&#x27;t used anything else for years.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the pool as much as I am, you need to moisturize after every swim.  The ONLY lotion that really protects my skin and makes it look healthy and smooth is Triple Lanolin Aloe Vera.  Plus is has a pleasant subtle scent and people ask me, \\&quot;What IS that you&#x27;re wearing?\\&quot;  It&#x27;s so light and feminine.  I just love it.  The best way to use this stuff is to leave your skin wet after your shower/bath, put about four squirts in your hand and gently rub into the w-h-o-l-e body.  Every inch.  You&#x27;ll notice a marked improvement in the quality and texture of your skin in about a week. Other moisturizer don&#x27;t even come close to Triple Lanolin, and that 20 oz. bottle will last you months and months.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks, literally.  I like the softening nature of it but I really can&#x27;t use it because of the overpowering smell. I do not understand manufacturers insistence on dosing a product like this with so much perfume that it makes your eyes burn.  It also has alcohol in it so my skin dries out faster after I use it.  I bought three bottles thinking it would just have a mild odor but I have to keep it in the garage or it stinks up the place. I will never purchase a product from this company again. hope I can find someone to give this crap to.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry or sunburned skin, etc!!</li>
            <li> Great lotion.  Really puts an end to my dry skin on my hands from frequent washing.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> We have used this lotion for years and it is excellent.  Good for dry and damaged skin.  Is just what the doctor ordered.  And it has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it is not thin like most other lotions so it lasts along time!!!  It works great on sun burns, I use it all over but especially on my feet!! it keeps them soft a lot longer compared too to other lotions!!!!!.&lt;br /&gt; The price was great !&lt;br /&gt; It was a pleasure doing business with this company, fast and and easy delivery!!!! (! Always nice )</li>
            <li> Not greasy, feels nice on on skin.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it smells so good and moisturizes pretty well!</li>
            <li> I am always trying new lotions. I used this faithfully after each shower throughout the cold winter. Having tried many lotions I feel this did the trick. I did not have any dry, itchy skin. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs well. I used it well into the following summer and still have a tiny bit left.</li>
            <li> The only lotion I would use!!  Plus at this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I have been using this lotion for the past 10 years, and I have yet to find another one that even compares,  It is the perfect non greasy feel that lasts all day. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and it is difficult for me to find a lotion that soothes my skin without leaving me feeling sticky. This is it. Absorbs right in and helps restore your skin immediately. Does not stain. Mild fragrance. I use it everywhere, even on my face, and it works everytime, even with very dry winter skin or sunburn.</li>
            <li> Switched to this product after years of loyalty to another one! I have very dry skin and need all the help I can get and this lotion really did the job for me.</li>
            <li> Very very good lotion it helps very good for any dry skin especially in the winter its very importent to use better then any other like Dr. Fisher hand cream</li>
            <li> Every time I used this product my skin became more dry and uncomfortable than before. It felt as if there were a lot of alcohol in it and when I read the ingredients that does appear to be the case. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Perfect size &amp; on time. I&#x27;m a happy camper. (:</li>
            <li> I too have dry skin and it&#x27;s hard to find the right lotion for my skin. this lotion works on contact and helps keep my skin smooth all day</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a decade and I love it.  It is smooth and creamy but not oily.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> absorbs into skin well,,  lovely, light scent, I used it daily and loved it. A little goes a long way, and a great price!</li>
