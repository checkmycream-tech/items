    <ol>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li>Awesome scent.</li>
            <li>Great to have.</li>
            <li>not all perfumes suit all people, there are plenty of good perfumes, to each their own, and so on ...</li>
            <li>I received my Hot Courure on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Received the purchase very quicky, perfect transaction!!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for ladies when a normal fragrance won&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>I also ordered Ambush and was equally pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this, I don&#x27;t understand why you can&#x27;t get it in the stores.</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>I was glad to get it online.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love it, my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for more than 10 years</li>
            <li>I love the perfume, so my husband broke the top off the glass bottle</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li>I am happy with the scent it was better than expected.</li>
            <li>This is the original scent-</li>
            <li>I ordered this and it does not smell like the original.</li>
            <li>While I describe it as sweet and hot I nonetheless don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overly sensual or sexy</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say that it comes off as kind of eccentric in a glamorous, intelligent way... and isn&#x27;t that the spirit of wearing haute couture?</li>
            <li>I seem to remember the original formula having more warmth, more heat, and think it&#x27;s been tweaked slightly to</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li>I bought it for the first time in Paris and ever since I have been hooked.  </li>
            <li>It is the real deal!</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite of mine since I discovered the scent over ten years ago.</li>
            <li>- I think it&#x27;s complexity drives it into a middle ground between a sophisticated day scent and a sensual evening scent.</li>
            <li>Ive purchased this perfume from a department store many many times, and this is clearly not the same.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>To me, the raspberries and pepper stand out the most, but it is a complex carefully crafted scent that is sweet and hot in a way that is sophisticated yet fun.</li>
            <li>I had way too much on.</li>
            <li>This is classic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nearly transcendent.</li>
            <li>the pink one is cheap &amp; doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I will add it to my considerable collection of Givenchy scents.</li>
            <li>I like to think of it as my personal signature, but I also think a few more people could stand to try this perfume and see if it is for them...</li>
            <li>Does not smell like Hot Couture, and whatever fragrance it is, does not wear very long at all.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, after not having it for a while, I sprayed like I do with the other brands.</li>
            <li>I try other perfumes here and there, but I always come back to Hot Couture.</li>

            <li> I received my Hot Courure on time and in perfect condition. I am happy with the scent it was better than expected. I will add it to my considerable collection of Givenchy scents. I also ordered Ambush and was equally pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this, I don&#x27;t understand why you can&#x27;t get it in the stores. Everyone says they don&#x27;t make it anymore, but you can buy it lots of places. The first time I used it, after not having it for a while, I sprayed like I do with the other brands. OMG....I had way too much on. I forgot you can only spray one or two times. My other brand I had to spray and spray. This stays and other brands don&#x27;t. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> My fav perfume in the world.</li>
            <li> love this and i couldn&#x27;t find no where else in Florida. I was glad to get it online. Dont know why its so hard to find this prefume&lt;br /&gt;the scent last all day with 2 to 3 sprays</li>
            <li> This is the original scent- the pink one is cheap &amp; doesn&#x27;t last. It&#x27;s been my fave for 10 years</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  I bought it for the first time in Paris and ever since I have been hooked.  It is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Awesome scent. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like. However, I  do get a lot of compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this scent but has been unable to find it.  When I looked on the Amazon site there it was so  I ordered it for her as a surprise!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it does not smell like the original. I didn&#x27;t return it because I was too lazy to send it back.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this product. Does not smell like Hot Couture, and whatever fragrance it is, does not wear very long at all. Ive purchased this perfume from a department store many many times, and this is clearly not the same.</li>
            <li> Just what I hoped for</li>
            <li> Received the purchase very quicky, perfect transaction!!  I will buy from you again since I can&#x27;t find this perfume in stores.</li>
            <li> I love it, my favorite. Arrived fast, and was exactly what I wanted. Great to have. Perfect for ladies when a normal fragrance won&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s scent. This is classic.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite fragrance. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for more than 10 years so I guess that says it all</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because the spray bottle broke after 2 days of use.  I wish I had kept my packing information because I would have returned it.  I love the perfume, so my husband broke the top off the glass bottle so I could pour the perfume into another container.</li>
            <li> it is a little different then the pink one  but it&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li> I seem to remember the original formula having more warmth, more heat, and think it&#x27;s been tweaked slightly to it&#x27;s detriment at some point about ten years ago---- yet nonetheless, I am so glad the this perfume, which came frighteningly close to being discontinued, has remained in production and become easier to find. This has been a favorite of mine since I discovered the scent over ten years ago. If you are curious about the head, middle, and base notes of the perfume the information is pretty easy to find online, though a definitive formula is and should be elusive. To me, the raspberries and pepper stand out the most, but it is a complex carefully crafted scent that is sweet and hot in a way that is sophisticated yet fun. While I describe it as sweet and hot I nonetheless don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overly sensual or sexy - I think it&#x27;s complexity drives it into a middle ground between a sophisticated day scent and a sensual evening scent. It&#x27;s fun but it&#x27;s not tawdry. It&#x27;s very nearly transcendent. Overall, I&#x27;d say that it comes off as kind of eccentric in a glamorous, intelligent way... and isn&#x27;t that the spirit of wearing haute couture? I try other perfumes here and there, but I always come back to Hot Couture. I like to think of it as my personal signature, but I also think a few more people could stand to try this perfume and see if it is for them... not all perfumes suit all people, there are plenty of good perfumes, to each their own, and so on ... but I know that I want to keep wearing this for a long time.</li>
