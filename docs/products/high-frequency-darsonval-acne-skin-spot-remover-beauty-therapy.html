            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>We are dissapointed but very glad we didn&#x27;t spend any more money than we did.</li>
            <li>Recommended this to another family member. :)</li>
            <li>I am an esthetician and I love the convenience of this product.</li>
            <li>I love the ionized smell too.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you watch some videos on youtube before using.  </li>
            <li>No idea how it does either of those things, but I&#x27;m glad it</li>
            <li>I really love this gadget.</li>
            <li>Really love the hair comb.</li>
            <li>but I use the mushroom shaped one and the hair comb the most.</li>
            <li>After a month, my skin does look much better.</li>
            <li>SO worth every penny and more!</li>
            <li>and when I have a pimple and run this over it, it clears up very quickly.</li>
            <li>My face felt amazing after the first use.  </li>
            <li>but I definitely think its great and not just for the price.</li>
            <li>Great product for teen skin, too.</li>
            <li>Tried it for 2 mos now more frequently but  ws stl gtn breakouts but it was effective for smelly feet.</li>
            <li>Turning this device full blast isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d like...</li>
            <li>Very well packaged - keeps the wands safe.</li>
            <li>I also prefer a more aggressive high frequency.</li>
            <li>Unit works well enough yet not specific item I ordered like my friends unit that works fantastic for a great price.</li>
            <li>Still a great tool both personally and professionally.</li>
            <li>great product...have only used a few times thus far, but seems very effective in tightening pores.  </li>
            <li>We even watched all the videos for many different brands of machines just like this one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to replace or fix a large machine should it break.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice equipment for its price, works as the most expensive ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair is not breaking as much after using it on my hair.  </li>
            <li>The directions that came with the product were very sparse and covered, I believe, &#x27;age spot/mole/tattoo removal&#x27; by &#x27;holding the device on the spot until you see pigmentation/melanin coming out&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The box is very sturdy so you can  travel with it.</li>
            <li>First, make sure the electrode is firmly in all the day.</li>
            <li>After two months, the current became very light, as if it was on the low setting, even though I have it on the high</li>
            <li>It comes with the most essential attachments and some extras that are not very likely to be used often.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality is decent, but not salon quality.  </li>
            <li>The high frequency device I received produces an orange/red ray which is an indicator of neon gas.</li>
            <li>Also it takes a little more effort than normal to remove the attachments from the main unit but</li>
            <li>Interesting little device.  </li>
            <li>Helps eliminate acne and stops new ones coming in.</li>
            <li>The description is clearly written that the electrodes are Argon violet gas and even shows a picture of the color</li>
            <li>I used it on my 11 yr old.</li>
            <li>WOW WE</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever had a facial where they use the &amp;#34;zappy wand&amp;#34; to clear up blemishes, you know just what this can do for you.</li>
            <li>and sometimes this is the only thing that will clear it up.</li>
            <li>Barely sparks when I touch the electrode</li>
            <li>It smells a little odd like something is burning (they claim it is a clean air smell</li>

            <li> After two months, the current became very light, as if it was on the low setting, even though I have it on the high setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This literally happend in the middle of using it--It wasn&#x27;t dropped or mishandled....it just stopped working like it did.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had a facial where they use the &amp;#34;zappy wand&amp;#34; to clear up blemishes, you know just what this can do for you. I should have bought this a decade ago. SO worth every penny and more! I have really bad adult acne and sometimes this is the only thing that will clear it up. Buy this. Use this. And save your salon $$$ for something else!</li>
            <li> when i got it the box, the mushroom tube was broken and after one usage tongue tube metal part fell off. do not get it guys.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works great! Helps eliminate acne and stops new ones coming in. Recommended this to another family member. :)</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and I love the convenience of this product. I don&#x27;t have to replace or fix a large machine should it break. No issues out of the box. Just opened it up, tested it and it works fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain that it electrocuted them. First, make sure the electrode is firmly in all the day. Second, before turning it on, put your finger on the electrode, turn on, apply to face, remove finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Worked 2 times then broke.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product but was mislead by false advertisement. The description is clearly written that the electrodes are Argon violet gas and even shows a picture of the color but instead it&#x27;s neon. Word of Advice DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT IT IS NOT AUTHENTIC</li>
            <li> great product...have only used a few times thus far, but seems very effective in tightening pores.  great for diminishing breakouts.</li>
            <li> The high frequency device I received produces an orange/red ray which is an indicator of neon gas. It has different effects than argon, which produces a violet ray. The product described is an argon device. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is advertised as ARGON violet electrodes. Only to receive NEON electrodes instead. (Which I did NOT want) I also prefer a more aggressive high frequency. Turning this device full blast isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d like... Barely sparks when I touch the electrode</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, I&#x27;m an esthetician and use this to travel to clients house, work great!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> My face felt amazing after the first use.  Acne cleared up.  I used it on my 11 yr old. She had some acne, within a few hrs. the redness went away, and the next day it cleared up.  I used it along with Hyaluronic Acid, which helped moisturize the skin.  I noticed my hair is not breaking as much after using it on my hair.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  I love the ionized smell too.  Make sure you watch some videos on youtube before using.  It says to only use on one area for no more then 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> No argon gas nor violet ray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days but I definitely think its great and not just for the price. It comes with the most essential attachments and some extras that are not very likely to be used often. The only thing I dislike is that it did not come with a protective case for the various attachments. Also it takes a little more effort than normal to remove the attachments from the main unit but nothing that is too big a concern. Still a great tool both personally and professionally.</li>
            <li> excellent!!! love it!!!</li>
            <li> THIS WAND {IN THE DARK}GLOWS PURPLE IT ALSO DISCHARGES AN ARCH OF ELECTRICITY WITH A VIBERATION N FREQUANCY  WOW WE</li>
            <li> Pretty nice equipment for its price, works as the most expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Tried it for 2 mos now more frequently but  ws stl gtn breakouts but it was effective for smelly feet.</li>
            <li> Like to use for my client,  it&#x27;s give them good result</li>
            <li> Did not receive Argon, Violet electrodes. All electrodes in kit were neon. The directions that came with the product were very sparse and covered, I believe, &#x27;age spot/mole/tattoo removal&#x27; by &#x27;holding the device on the spot until you see pigmentation/melanin coming out&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Interesting little device.  Bought it for my wife&#x27;s nerve pain in her head.  She says it definitely provides some relief.  She noticed the effect when she went to the salon and they used one on her scalp for whatever they use them for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has also used it to lessen some brown spots on her face caused by sun damage.  No idea how it does either of those things, but I&#x27;m glad it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is decent, but not salon quality.  I don&#x27;t regret buying it, and would buy another if this one stopped working.</li>
            <li> I can give 5 stars when seller replaces unit with advertised one. Must have been a mix up. Unit works well enough yet not specific item I ordered like my friends unit that works fantastic for a great price.</li>
            <li> Is not a violet argon. Im disaponited.</li>
            <li> Great price for the value of the product. Good quality. A good selection of adaptable pieces to choice from. Nice</li>
            <li> I really love this gadget. I use it every other day. Really love the hair comb. It does seem to be helping my hair grow faster and it has never felt softer. It smells a little odd like something is burning (they claim it is a clean air smell but it is not) and when I have a pimple and run this over it, it clears up very quickly.There are several wand attachments but I use the mushroom shaped one and the hair comb the most. After a month, my skin does look much better. The bags and puffiness under my eyes are much less visible. I also have blackheads in my nose area that are now much less visible. Saw items just like it that were much more expensive but this is an amazing product at a great price. The box is very sturdy so you can  travel with it. Very well packaged - keeps the wands safe. Great product for teen skin, too.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  The kit had all the electrodes I needed! Great price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom who has been using it faithfully for 2 months.  She does not see on bit of difference in her skin.  We even watched all the videos for many different brands of machines just like this one.  She used the methods and followed the directions from these videos. ..but no difference!  We are dissapointed but very glad we didn&#x27;t spend any more money than we did.</li>
