            <li>so I am very familiar with the potency of this oil.</li>
            <li>I make a lot of bug spray in the long summer months so this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I got this to make my own natural bug spray,and I am no expert in citronella smells but for some reason the smell I was anticipating was strong orange or citrus, but it had a more nauseating grass smell that I didn&#x27;t use it in my bug spray since the smell would be all over the house.</li>

            <li>Something I&#x27;ve read from a very well-known aromatherapist and author.</li>
            <li>I do think this really helps keep the bugs away.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My fiance and I are really into using all natural ingredients on our new born daughter.</li>
            <li>My favorite uses and a few mere drops will do the following&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-Homemade laundry soap it gives it a nice scent and more&lt;</li>
            <li>This citronella is way less potent than any citonella oil I have bought in the past.</li>

            <li> This citronella is way less potent than any citonella oil I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> I used it to make a great bug repellent.</li>
            <li> You can tell the potency of the oil by placing two drops on a tissue [but not on the same drop], and when it dries if there is any stain, it is not pure.</li>
            <li> Seems likely it is diluted with some other oil.</li>
            <li> A few drops on a damp cloth used to wipe down furniture couches chairs etc not only cleans but deodorizes at the same time and leaves the room smelling great&lt;</li>
            <li> This is one of the natural ingredients that we use to make baby safe bug repellent.</li>
            <li> Will we use it to make our own bug repellent we also use it to help aid in out child&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> I use this with a little bit of water to spray the dogs beds.</li>
            <li> For this reason I seriously doubt it is 100 % as advertised.</li>
            <li> repellent, it can be added to skin cream, body oil and lotion to keep pesky bugs away especially those little winged vampires</li>
            <li> I use as part of a natural insect repellent that I blend together during the summer.  </li>
            <li> Ill buy again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing as I bought two bottles.</li>
            <li> GNATS AND MOSQUITOS HATE IT.</li>

            <li> Good product ,prompt shipping</li>
            <li> I really love this oil.  I use as part of a natural insect repellent that I blend together during the summer.  It helps stave off the mosquitos and gnats.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a dropper or different spout.</li>
            <li> A must have staple during the summertime. Can use it for a variety of things.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil. You can tell the potency of the oil by placing two drops on a tissue [but not on the same drop], and when it dries if there is any stain, it is not pure. Something I&#x27;ve read from a very well-known aromatherapist and author. And have bought from them ever since .  . . over 8 years ago.</li>
            <li> What you would expect from citronella essential oil.</li>
            <li> EFFECTIVE AND IT SMELL GREAT.  GNATS AND MOSQUITOS HATE IT.</li>

            <li> Citronella is a great product for my needs.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My fiance and I are really into using all natural ingredients on our new born daughter. This is one of the natural ingredients that we use to make baby safe bug repellent. This one is 100% Pure Citronella Oil. Will we use it to make our own bug repellent we also use it to help aid in out child&#x27;s sleep. I also use it for stress reduction and help with the migraines I get from time to time. I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this all natural oil is. It comes with a screw on lid and a screw on dropper. So no matter what you use it for you have the correct sealer. I would recommend this oil to everyone.</li>
            <li> I got this to make my own natural bug spray,and I am no expert in citronella smells but for some reason the smell I was anticipating was strong orange or citrus, but it had a more nauseating grass smell that I didn&#x27;t use it in my bug spray since the smell would be all over the house.</li>
            <li> Like all the NOW products.  Great line</li>
            <li> just what i needed and in a larger size. great for making mosquito repellant especially since i can only tolerate natural substances.</li>
            <li> I have been buying citronella oil for decades so I am very familiar with the potency of this oil. A few drops mixed in a pint of vinegar make a powerful fly deterrent for my horse. This citronella is way less potent than any citonella oil I have bought in the past. For this reason I seriously doubt it is 100 % as advertised. Seems likely it is diluted with some other oil. Very disappointing as I bought two bottles.</li>
            <li> Great product. I do think this really helps keep the bugs away.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent. I used it to make a great bug repellent. Ill buy again.</li>
            <li> Use it in horse spray to make it more effective :)</li>
            <li> Added to my candles for outside.. seem to work.</li>
            <li> It keeps the Mosquitos away</li>
            <li> Has a wonderful smell. I make a lot of bug spray in the long summer months so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Did not like it, smelled rancid.</li>
