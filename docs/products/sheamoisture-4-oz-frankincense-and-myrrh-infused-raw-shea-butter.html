            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Frankincense and Myrrh are also very good for many skin ailments, as well as being antiviral, antifungal, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would give it 4 stars for that fact but the product is so good that it makes up for it.</li>
            <li>When it is in good shape, it smells wonderful and melts in a very comforting way as I apply it to my feet.</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I have already told all my friends about it and will be an advocate for this AMAZING cream forever.</li>
            <li>and I warm the piece in my palm and rub it until it melts</li>
            <li>The natural fragrance of frankincense and myrrh is very pleasant and has its own beneficial properties.  </li>
            <li>and it already has wonderful essential oils in it.</li>
            <li>This magic in a bottle makes my skin all glowy, while minimizing my acne scarring.</li>
            <li>More like butter that has been in the fridge.  </li>
            <li>This is the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried many many moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>The product is outstanding..</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for any dry spots, heels, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural 4b/c and this product works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It clears any dry skin in seconds, smells light and wonderful and doesn&#x27;t make skin greasy.</li>
            <li>I own the whole line.  </li>
            <li>I would rather not have a different texture if it means having ingredients in it that aren&#x27;t good for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Tried the butter with hesitation because most moisturizers clog my pores, but not this product it cleanse out my pores and gave me  a soft glow.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pure gold!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s become part of my daily hair routine.</li>
            <li>Normally I love this product, but I purchased it from Create Trend this time and they did not store it properly!!!  </li>
            <li>Now that we&#x27;re heading into summer, it&#x27;s just too hot to deal with the hair dryer, so I&#x27;ll use this as a styling product and my hair actually has curl definition and becomes shiny and really healthy looking.</li>
            <li>This balm like cream has a simple four ingredients and sinks into my skin and makes it feel so soft and wonderful.</li>
            <li>The expiration date isn&#x27;t until a year from now, so it should be fine, but the scent is gone, it is gritty and smells like the oil may be rancid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about ingredients on my skin - the skin absorbs everything.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get great results.</li>
            <li>I love the scent which is partly why I bought it but would prefer a less wax like product.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product as a versatile skin, hair, and scalp treatment.</li>
            <li>My first Shea butter I got as present from my daughter in law was smooth and easy to apply, this one was somewhat hard to put on, felt like there was sandy texture,</li>
            <li>This stuff is rock hard, and you have to literally scrape it out with your finger and then warm it in your palms to get it to melt, then rub on your body.  </li>
            <li>I bought some at my local Target because I&#x27;ve heard such good things about raw shea butter, and</li>
            <li>Raw shea butter absorbs quickly, and moisturizes so well and is very healing to the skin.  </li>
            <li>This heavy duty cream melts when you put it on, leaving your hands soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does wonders to keep my hair moisturizered and soft.</li>
            <li>You have to scrape it out of the container and then rub it between your hands to melt the natural oils before rubbing it into your skin.</li>
            <li>This makes skin very supple and remains on the skin for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I will use compounds found naturally in nature.  </li>
            <li>I love a heavy cream, I live in vegas and its very very dry here.</li>
            <li>It had the consistency of a hard paste...but melt easily.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soft enough to rub between your palms and it turns into an oil.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a natural 4b/c and this product works great on my hair. I don&#x27;t need it for my skin. Perfect size and container. This is a butter not a lotion so I don&#x27;t know why people thought it was going to be creamy. You have to scoop it out of the container but it&#x27;s soft enough to rub between your palms and it turns into an oil. I like the smell and it already has wonderful essential oils in it. It does wonders to keep my hair moisturizered and soft. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s become part of my daily hair routine.</li>
            <li> Normally I love this product, but I purchased it from Create Trend this time and they did not store it properly!!!  The expiration date isn&#x27;t until a year from now, so it should be fine, but the scent is gone, it is gritty and smells like the oil may be rancid.  Unfortunately I purchased four containers.  I am diabetic and I use it for my feet.  Big disappointment.  Will be careful who I purchase it from in the future and it won&#x27;t be Create Trend!  When it is in good shape, it smells wonderful and melts in a very comforting way as I apply it to my feet. Not gritty, but creamy and buttery.</li>
            <li> This is a bit hard to work with. You have to scrape it out of the container and then rub it between your hands to melt the natural oils before rubbing it into your skin. I would give it 4 stars for that fact but the product is so good that it makes up for it. Once it is rubbed in though it helps conceal lines from dry or sundamaged skin. This makes skin very supple and remains on the skin for the entire day. The shea moisture brand of skin care and soaps have rescued my skin after the silly use of tanning beds in the past. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The product was extremely dry. I was disappointed!</li>
            <li> This line of products...Shea Moisture...is wonderful.  I own the whole line.  This heavy duty cream melts when you put it on, leaving your hands soft and smooth.  It is wonderful for any dry spots, heels, etc.  It is NOT a lotion.  It had the consistency of a hard paste...but melt easily.  And the scent is very subtle and pleasing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure gold! You can use it on your face, body, or hair. I bought some at my local Target because I&#x27;ve heard such good things about raw shea butter, and I &amp;#60;3 Shea Moisture products (minus their use of GMOs- read your labels! soy and corn are bad, mmk)&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients check out here though! This magic in a bottle makes my skin all glowy, while minimizing my acne scarring. A little goes a long way, I use a pea size amount for my whole face and neck. Frankincense and Myrrh are also very good for many skin ailments, as well as being antiviral, antifungal, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product as a versatile skin, hair, and scalp treatment. OR if you just want to glow!</li>
            <li> Butter?  More like butter that has been in the fridge.  This stuff is rock hard, and you have to literally scrape it out with your finger and then warm it in your palms to get it to melt, then rub on your body.  Not impressed.  I love the scent which is partly why I bought it but would prefer a less wax like product.  Also when you rub it in your body, or try to, it&#x27;s still a little gritty and it doesn&#x27;t totally melt into your skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried many many moisturizers.  I&#x27;m very picky about ingredients on my skin - the skin absorbs everything.  I no longer use manufactured chemical compounds in my skin and body care products.  I will use compounds found naturally in nature.  Raw shea butter absorbs quickly, and moisturizes so well and is very healing to the skin.  The natural fragrance of frankincense and myrrh is very pleasant and has its own beneficial properties.  This cream has a very stiff (almost hard) texture at room temperature or below, but I don&#x27;t mind.  I consider it a sign of the purity of the ingredients.  I would rather not have a different texture if it means having ingredients in it that aren&#x27;t good for my skin.  I dig out a little piece the size of a pumpkin seed with a butter knife - and I warm the piece in my palm and rub it until it melts - then I apply it to my skin.  A little goes a LONG way.  A jar of this cream used every day on my face and often for my body too has lasted for 6 months.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My first Shea butter I got as present from my daughter in law was smooth and easy to apply, this one was somewhat hard to put on, felt like there was sandy texture,</li>
            <li> gift to friend ----greesey</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I like the smell with the essential oils that it contains.  Would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> i ordered this thinking it was lotions and not only is it not a lotion it was not sealed like it was supposed to be. i am definitely disappointed. i am not sure what exactly i did receive it appears to be some sort of scrub or something and it was not sealed and had no instructions or explanations and the ingredient list was not very descriptive and it made it seem like lotion</li>
            <li> Just found this brand last year and I love this stuff! It clears any dry skin in seconds, smells light and wonderful and doesn&#x27;t make skin greasy. Now that we&#x27;re heading into summer, it&#x27;s just too hot to deal with the hair dryer, so I&#x27;ll use this as a styling product and my hair actually has curl definition and becomes shiny and really healthy looking. Best stuff for keeping split ends at bay, too! A little goes a long way, so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get great results.</li>
            <li> Like the product but hard to spread the lotion on skin, it&#x27;s too thick so I purchased this in a lotion.</li>
            <li> Tried the butter with hesitation because most moisturizers clog my pores, but not this product it cleanse out my pores and gave me  a soft glow. Thank you shea moisture I will  never be without it.</li>
            <li> The product is outstanding..</li>
            <li> I recently was looking for a product like Darphine&#x27;s Purifying Balm and stumbled accross this product. I love a heavy cream, I live in vegas and its very very dry here. This balm like cream has a simple four ingredients and sinks into my skin and makes it feel so soft and wonderful. I have already told all my friends about it and will be an advocate for this AMAZING cream forever. I hope they never discontinue it</li>
            <li> I love the smell and goes on smooth. I only wish the jar was larger</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the consistency of the shea butter.  Seller was a bit rude when he gave his explanation.  Would not buy again</li>
