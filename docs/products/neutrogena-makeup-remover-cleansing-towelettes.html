            <li>The wipes are soothing and do a nice job of removing make up, oil, and dirt.</li>
            <li>These do a nice job of taking off makeup - including waterproof mascara.</li>

            <li>This is really sooo great!</li>
            <li>So nice to buy this in an economy pack and</li>
            <li>This is my second order of this box, since this is the best bargain for a great cleansing cloth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to wipe off makeup (powder foundation, eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara, etc).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying these face wipes for years, and this is by far the best deal I&#x27;ve ever gotten on them.  </li>
            <li>They are also nice because you dont have to stain your towels/washcloths at home because they have the ability to remove waterproof mascara. :)</li>
            <li>either way, it&#x27;s more effective and faster than scrubbing your face with soap and water every night.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, light scent as well, that doesn&#x27;t bother me like many added fragrances do.</li>
            <li>She has great skin, so they must work, right?</li>

            <li>It removes makeup easily and effectively for me.  </li>
            <li>Such a great bulk buy!</li>
            <li>These are my favorite make-up remover wipes.</li>
            <li>i have tried many waterproof makeup removers and I ended up having to use creams then face soup AND still ended up having mascara residue.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

            <li>I love that they remove makeup and waterproof mascara without drying your skin.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love these wipes and buying them in a bulk package makes it so much better.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>okay, there is no way they work that well.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Its refreshing for her</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of makeup removing towelettes.  </li>
            <li>Really glad I switched to these from cotton balls and liquid remover.</li>
            <li>I love these wipes!They don&#x27;t break my face out like a lot of others</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I like many Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>Love it, but you can now buy this at Costco for a 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li>Love these wipes.</li>
            <li>Love the simplicity and the cleanliness.  </li>
            <li>I get extra points for being thoughtful too!!!!</li>
            <li>Waterproof mascara comes off easily too - much better than the liquid eye makeup removers I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and effective.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and I think this one does the best job for me.</li>
            <li>I had hoped more for a cotton or gauze, but it feels like light fleece.</li>
            <li>Very convenient for me, as I do travel a fair amount.  </li>
            <li>Sweet deal!</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great product that cleans better than any facial wipes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of these wipes to clean my face before bed each night.  </li>
            <li>Use it all the time and every time I use it, it takes off the make up easily.</li>
            <li>I would agree with another reviewer and say that the wipes are strong and one gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Large size, made it a good purchase, takes off regular make up great, did not try it with water proof makeup.</li>
            <li>They smell fine, it&#x27;s chemical-like.</li>
            <li>Super satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, quick way to get your makeup off without spending a fortune on makeup remover at Sephora!</li>
            <li>I like them, they work fine, however I have made the switch to cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>I was happy when I discovered they are sold in a larger quanity.</li>
            <li>The mix of regular packs and travel packs are great.</li>
            <li>Plus, they have a light scent and are not over powering.  </li>
            <li>I found these as cheap as $11 at costco...</li>
            <li>I loved this cleansing towelette already, and I just loved that fact that I can buy so many at once, since this are pretty much for daily use in my case.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these towelettes to anyone that likes removing makeup quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Is very easy to use and cleans very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I love these so much!</li>
            <li>It removes make-up, but doesn&#x27;t CLEAN the face.</li>
            <li>Face is clean without feeling stripped and gets all the makeup off.  </li>
            <li>These are great, and don&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li>These wipes do NOT irritate my skin, and they leave my face clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle for sensitive skin and a good size to thoroughly cleanse the makeup off before washing.</li>
            <li>Love how gentle the wipes are and how affective they are.</li>
            <li>I really like these wipes and used to be able to get this configuration in costco</li>
            <li>I love this makeup remover and this multipack really saves me money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also like the Simple line and hear good things about the Kirkland (Costco) brand but haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love how gentle these are.</li>
            <li>These Neutrogena towelettes are my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>The TV Ad is true - one wipe</li>
            <li>One towelette is more than enough to clean my face most of the time.</li>
            <li>No breakouts, just a clean fresh face.  </li>
            <li>They remove make up super well and without tugging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this facial wipe for 15 years and they always work really well, never burn and do a great job at removing all make up.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea.  </li>
            <li>Super soft, easy to use, easily disposable and compact.</li>
            <li>These wipes take off makeup so easily and smoothly, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>They do the job without clogging pores (non-comedogenic), retain their moisture well when a package has been unsealed, and have a subtle, yet very pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I found Neutrogena in a hotel complimentary set of bathroom products, and I&#x27;ve never used anything else.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m more concerned with the quality of my skin, which is extremely sensitive, prone to breakouts, dryness and oiliness.</li>
            <li>They get all of the make up off of my face and leave my skin feeling so fresh.</li>
            <li>Remember to do this before bed, and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li>so it leaves you face clean, make up free and soft!</li>
            <li>The towelettes are moist, not soaked, and smell great, but not strong.  </li>
            <li>I probably use the wipes 3-4 times a week, and give my face a good scrub the other nights.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
            <li>They clean really well</li>
            <li>I love these wipes because they easily remove stubborn eye make up with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>The small packages are great for traveling or for going to the gym to wipe makeup off before working out.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for getting any makeup off that might have been missed and they leave my face feeling clean and not dry.</li>
            <li>It has a very gentle, non-abrasive texture.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, I use these every day.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and my brother use them after sports to feel fresh until they get a chance to get home and shower and despite the fact that they are meant for the face, I found that they work really well in cleaning stains off of clothing and dirt off of shoes.</li>
            <li>They make my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This multi-pack is a terrific buy, and i love the travel packs.</li>
            <li>After using the wipes and swiping them (with some elbow grease) across my eyes multiple times, I still have to wash my eyes again with more face soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product multiple times - I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>and I can deal with using cotton balls ;)</li>
            <li>The travel packages were on top of this big package</li>
            <li>An absolute must for every make up wearer!</li>
            <li>Better price than I can get locally.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these facial wipes.</li>
            <li>Great for camping and late nights.</li>
            <li>They do make my face feel soft and clean despite that point.</li>
            <li>They are gentle, yet highly effective with a few quick wipes.</li>
            <li>My skin feels both clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Bought these specifically because I recently started wearing more eye makeup hoping they&#x27;d be an easy solution for the end of the day, but these don&#x27;t do the whole job for basic eyeliner and waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>So happy that this item is offered on Amazon because this is my hg of facial cleaning products due to my rosacea.  </li>
            <li>Still needed to use other makeup remover for any intense eye make-up or lip wear, but really nice for day-to-day wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the other brands (Olay, L&#x27;Oreal, etc) but bought this bulk pack at Costco and it is far superior.  </li>
            <li>A good alternative for when you are feeling lazy and don&#x27;t want to wash your face, but still don&#x27;t want to fall asleep with your make up on.</li>
            <li>I have had to throw out many because they dry out...</li>
            <li>So many bargain brands dry out before the package is gone.  </li>
            <li>, I usually rinse the cloth thoroughly then use it to clean my face off one more time to get rid of that makeup remover.</li>
            <li>The towelettes are soft, the light smell tolerable, the top layer of make up comes off with a little effort.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena  wipes do the job effectively at a much, much lower cost.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, the cloths were much drier than the ones I had purchased in stores before.  </li>
            <li>These REALLY remove all traces of makeup on your face.  </li>
            <li>Towels are very durable.  </li>
            <li>These are great for those nights when you&#x27;re too tired to take off your make up, since all you have to do is grab a towel and just wipe all the make up off.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It removes make up very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I think the box is a value and that this product really removes make-up and cleans your face.</li>
            <li>and I really like that I don&#x27;t need water after using, although it does feel fresher.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin and surrounding the eyes, no burn.</li>
            <li>and they work very well, no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li>A real pain in the &amp;d):-&amp;@!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely a beauty must-have.</li>
            <li>They are so gentle and do NOT have alcohol.</li>
            <li>Takes off makeup, including water-proof eyeliner, very well.  </li>
            <li>Love the bulk purchase and would like to continue to purchase this items in the near future.</li>
            <li>The first one you draw out of the package will be as efficient as a cheap, dry, used paper towel.</li>
            <li>I go through them pretty quickly so that is why i buy this big pack&lt;</li>
            <li>They remove all my makeup, even water proof and long wear, easily.</li>
            <li>Also, they smell better and are softer than the other brands.</li>
            <li>Originally, I thought it was oily or something, like it left residue on my face, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of it.</li>
            <li>However, I have been able to find them cheaper at other places.</li>
            <li>After she used another product to clean off her eye makeup, her eyelids became red and sore from the solution.</li>
            <li>I use these after I wash my face to ensure that I get every part of my face clean such as around my nostrils, hairline, ears, and around my lips.</li>
            <li>They come in a re closable package, they don&#x27;t dry out easily.</li>
            <li>I keep these wipes by my bed and it only takes minute to clean my face.</li>
            <li>they have a nice fragrance that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>They work a lot better than what I was previously using.</li>
            <li>I just tried Giovanni facial wipes, and I actually like them way better.</li>
            <li>As part of my nightly facial cleansing routine, I use these wipes followed by a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil for a fresh face before bed.</li>
            <li>does a decent job at removing makeup.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I pair these with a high end face regimen in the morning.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Gentle on even sensitive skin - highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Great substitute for expensive Eye Wipes.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin/eczema and this stuff really gets all the makeup off without having to scrub hard!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It removes even the most heavy make up, however it doesn&#x27;t remove all of my mascara.</li>
            <li>we must NEVER go to bed with makeup on...and these are perfect for lazy or late nights...to keep up 100% faithfulness...</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, so I have tried a ton of different lotions, wipes, etc to wash my face and take off my makeup.  </li>
            <li>They just work so much better and are only less than a dollar more than other brands.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many brands, even expensive ones, but these are really moistened and clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li>After rinsing with cool water to sooth the burning/stinging, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with my Clinique eye make-up remover (it doesn&#x27;t sting even when I have dry skin).</li>
            <li>I cannot live w/out these wipes.  </li>
            <li>Though u may want to do a quick wipe after with a dry tissue for mascara</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use and eliminate the water/sink mess I always used to make in the evening.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m old enough that my face doesn&#x27;t break out anymore, I use these to wipe away what little makeup I wear at night (mineral powder and mascara) and followup with a warm wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I still gave it a 5-star because it gets the job done better than all other products (especially the liquid ones)</li>
            <li>and my face feels so soft after using them!</li>
            <li>I love usually use natural products but these work</li>
            <li>The box brings several packages inside in different sizes (normal and travel) and it&#x27;s so useful.</li>
            <li>The wipes have just the right amount of moisture on them, and don&#x27;t drip or feel to dry.</li>
            <li>These wipes really do remove eye makeup, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with other wipes and my face feels oil free without feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>Packages do not always seal completely but no biggie.</li>
            <li>I am 66 yrs old</li>
            <li>They are really pricy at the local pharmacy</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered them because I am too busy to go to store to buy them.</li>
            <li>I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have tried using these wipes.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, then this is the product for you as it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>They leave your skin soft, not greasy and they don&#x27;t have a scent to them if that is something that might bother you.  </li>
            <li>Hydrating and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the only cloth that really removes all my makeup (waterproof or otherwise), although I do follow up with cleanser and my Clarisonic in any case.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>The towels are soft and the cleanser does not cause any irritation or dryness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like these refill packs as they come in different sizes</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t remove all of my makeup completely but they do their job.</li>
            <li>I looked up the price of one pack and it was more expensive then this whole order!</li>
            <li>But the package is so thin, the closure inefficient and they dry out in a few days , even under the best of circumstances.  </li>
            <li>Better than any other wipes I have tried, and shoe cleaning wipes are often very expensive, but these work amazingly.</li>
            <li>other then missing a few packs product is great</li>
            <li>I found Neutrogena a few years ago and have been a loyal buyer ever since.  </li>
            <li>This removes make up like no other.</li>
            <li>And a major bonus</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple different makeup wipes from both high end and drugstore brands</li>
            <li>I use them personally and in my professional makeup kit.  </li>
            <li>I suppose you can wet them with water to reconstitute the solution but doesn&#x27;t this defeat the whole purpose of buying individual small packages that will be relatively free of contamination for a while, and can be used occasionally, or when traveling ?</li>
            <li>I have tried at least 10 other name brand or generic products claiming similar results and none of them are as effective.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, if you&#x27;re really tired on your way home at night, you can go ahead and clean your face!  </li>
            <li>I like the scent of the wipes as well - fresh but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>When i&#x27;m tired at night and don&#x27;t want to wash my face, I use these and they leave my skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>They make easy work of any eye makeup without leaving behind a lot of oil that may clog/block pours.  </li>
            <li>They workj well, but the package doesn&#x27;t stay closed very well, so they dry out.</li>

            <li> These wipes take off makeup so easily and smoothly, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> They do the job without clogging pores (non-comedogenic), retain their moisture well when a package has been unsealed, and have a subtle, yet very pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I found Neutrogena in a hotel complimentary set of bathroom products, and I&#x27;ve never used anything else.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m more concerned with the quality of my skin, which is extremely sensitive, prone to breakouts, dryness and oiliness.</li>
            <li> They get all of the make up off of my face and leave my skin feeling so fresh.</li>
            <li> Remember to do this before bed, and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li> so it leaves you face clean, make up free and soft!</li>
            <li> The towelettes are moist, not soaked, and smell great, but not strong.  </li>
            <li> I probably use the wipes 3-4 times a week, and give my face a good scrub the other nights.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
            <li> They clean really well</li>
            <li> I love these wipes because they easily remove stubborn eye make up with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> The small packages are great for traveling or for going to the gym to wipe makeup off before working out.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for getting any makeup off that might have been missed and they leave my face feeling clean and not dry.</li>
            <li> It has a very gentle, non-abrasive texture.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, I use these every day.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and my brother use them after sports to feel fresh until they get a chance to get home and shower and despite the fact that they are meant for the face, I found that they work really well in cleaning stains off of clothing and dirt off of shoes.</li>
            <li> They make my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This multi-pack is a terrific buy, and i love the travel packs.</li>
            <li> After using the wipes and swiping them (with some elbow grease) across my eyes multiple times, I still have to wash my eyes again with more face soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product multiple times - I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> and I can deal with using cotton balls ;)</li>
            <li> The travel packages were on top of this big package</li>
            <li> An absolute must for every make up wearer!</li>
            <li> Better price than I can get locally.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these facial wipes.</li>
            <li> Great for camping and late nights.</li>
            <li> They do make my face feel soft and clean despite that point.</li>
            <li> They are gentle, yet highly effective with a few quick wipes.</li>
            <li> My skin feels both clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Bought these specifically because I recently started wearing more eye makeup hoping they&#x27;d be an easy solution for the end of the day, but these don&#x27;t do the whole job for basic eyeliner and waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> So happy that this item is offered on Amazon because this is my hg of facial cleaning products due to my rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Still needed to use other makeup remover for any intense eye make-up or lip wear, but really nice for day-to-day wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other brands (Olay, L&#x27;Oreal, etc) but bought this bulk pack at Costco and it is far superior.  </li>
            <li> A good alternative for when you are feeling lazy and don&#x27;t want to wash your face, but still don&#x27;t want to fall asleep with your make up on.</li>
            <li> I have had to throw out many because they dry out...</li>
            <li> So many bargain brands dry out before the package is gone.  </li>
            <li> , I usually rinse the cloth thoroughly then use it to clean my face off one more time to get rid of that makeup remover.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are soft, the light smell tolerable, the top layer of make up comes off with a little effort.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena  wipes do the job effectively at a much, much lower cost.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, the cloths were much drier than the ones I had purchased in stores before.  </li>
            <li> These REALLY remove all traces of makeup on your face.  </li>
            <li> Towels are very durable.  </li>
            <li> These are great for those nights when you&#x27;re too tired to take off your make up, since all you have to do is grab a towel and just wipe all the make up off.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It removes make up very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I think the box is a value and that this product really removes make-up and cleans your face.</li>
            <li> and I really like that I don&#x27;t need water after using, although it does feel fresher.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin and surrounding the eyes, no burn.</li>
            <li> and they work very well, no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> A real pain in the &amp;d):-&amp;@!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely a beauty must-have.</li>
            <li> They are so gentle and do NOT have alcohol.</li>
            <li> Takes off makeup, including water-proof eyeliner, very well.  </li>
            <li> Love the bulk purchase and would like to continue to purchase this items in the near future.</li>
            <li> The first one you draw out of the package will be as efficient as a cheap, dry, used paper towel.</li>
            <li> I go through them pretty quickly so that is why i buy this big pack&lt;</li>
            <li> They remove all my makeup, even water proof and long wear, easily.</li>
            <li> Also, they smell better and are softer than the other brands.</li>
            <li> Originally, I thought it was oily or something, like it left residue on my face, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of it.</li>
            <li> However, I have been able to find them cheaper at other places.</li>
            <li> After she used another product to clean off her eye makeup, her eyelids became red and sore from the solution.</li>
            <li> I use these after I wash my face to ensure that I get every part of my face clean such as around my nostrils, hairline, ears, and around my lips.</li>
            <li> They come in a re closable package, they don&#x27;t dry out easily.</li>
            <li> I keep these wipes by my bed and it only takes minute to clean my face.</li>
            <li> they have a nice fragrance that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> They work a lot better than what I was previously using.</li>
            <li> I just tried Giovanni facial wipes, and I actually like them way better.</li>
            <li> As part of my nightly facial cleansing routine, I use these wipes followed by a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil for a fresh face before bed.</li>
            <li> does a decent job at removing makeup.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I pair these with a high end face regimen in the morning.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Gentle on even sensitive skin - highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Great substitute for expensive Eye Wipes.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin/eczema and this stuff really gets all the makeup off without having to scrub hard!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It removes even the most heavy make up, however it doesn&#x27;t remove all of my mascara.</li>
            <li> we must NEVER go to bed with makeup on...and these are perfect for lazy or late nights...to keep up 100% faithfulness...</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, so I have tried a ton of different lotions, wipes, etc to wash my face and take off my makeup.  </li>
            <li> They just work so much better and are only less than a dollar more than other brands.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many brands, even expensive ones, but these are really moistened and clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li> After rinsing with cool water to sooth the burning/stinging, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with my Clinique eye make-up remover (it doesn&#x27;t sting even when I have dry skin).</li>
            <li> I cannot live w/out these wipes.  </li>
            <li> Though u may want to do a quick wipe after with a dry tissue for mascara</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use and eliminate the water/sink mess I always used to make in the evening.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m old enough that my face doesn&#x27;t break out anymore, I use these to wipe away what little makeup I wear at night (mineral powder and mascara) and followup with a warm wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I still gave it a 5-star because it gets the job done better than all other products (especially the liquid ones)</li>
            <li> and my face feels so soft after using them!</li>
            <li> I love usually use natural products but these work</li>
            <li> The box brings several packages inside in different sizes (normal and travel) and it&#x27;s so useful.</li>
            <li> The wipes have just the right amount of moisture on them, and don&#x27;t drip or feel to dry.</li>
            <li> These wipes really do remove eye makeup, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with other wipes and my face feels oil free without feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> Packages do not always seal completely but no biggie.</li>
            <li> I am 66 yrs old</li>
            <li> They are really pricy at the local pharmacy</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered them because I am too busy to go to store to buy them.</li>
            <li> I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have tried using these wipes.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, then this is the product for you as it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> They leave your skin soft, not greasy and they don&#x27;t have a scent to them if that is something that might bother you.  </li>
            <li> Hydrating and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the only cloth that really removes all my makeup (waterproof or otherwise), although I do follow up with cleanser and my Clarisonic in any case.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> The towels are soft and the cleanser does not cause any irritation or dryness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like these refill packs as they come in different sizes</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t remove all of my makeup completely but they do their job.</li>
            <li> I looked up the price of one pack and it was more expensive then this whole order!</li>
            <li> But the package is so thin, the closure inefficient and they dry out in a few days , even under the best of circumstances.  </li>
            <li> Better than any other wipes I have tried, and shoe cleaning wipes are often very expensive, but these work amazingly.</li>
            <li> other then missing a few packs product is great</li>
            <li> I found Neutrogena a few years ago and have been a loyal buyer ever since.  </li>
            <li> This removes make up like no other.</li>
            <li> And a major bonus</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple different makeup wipes from both high end and drugstore brands</li>
            <li> I use them personally and in my professional makeup kit.  </li>
            <li> I suppose you can wet them with water to reconstitute the solution but doesn&#x27;t this defeat the whole purpose of buying individual small packages that will be relatively free of contamination for a while, and can be used occasionally, or when traveling ?</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 10 other name brand or generic products claiming similar results and none of them are as effective.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, if you&#x27;re really tired on your way home at night, you can go ahead and clean your face!  </li>
            <li> I like the scent of the wipes as well - fresh but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> When i&#x27;m tired at night and don&#x27;t want to wash my face, I use these and they leave my skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> They make easy work of any eye makeup without leaving behind a lot of oil that may clog/block pours.  </li>
            <li> They workj well, but the package doesn&#x27;t stay closed very well, so they dry out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never waste my money on any other product again.</li>
            <li> I tried a small pack of the product before making up my mind to go for this large pack.</li>
            <li> a bit dry, not soggy enough, esp not after the package has been open for a while.</li>
            <li> Saves so much time when you are lazy at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands over the years and keep coming back to these.  </li>
            <li> Yes, unfortunately I have all the skin problems at once, but fortunately these work well on all of these.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> &quot; things you stumble across and treasure.</li>
            <li> strange.</li>
            <li> If you travel with an open package they will leak all over your other belongings..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other cleansing wipes, like Pond&#x27;s, and am definitely happier with Neutrogena&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and always come back to Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> I will continue buying the 114 pack as long as they offer it because I do not want to run out of these babies!</li>
            <li> they were so dry.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they get dry</li>
            <li> I did have some dry skin around my eyes at the time as well.</li>
            <li> Plus even the kindest soaps has a tendency to really dry out my face.  </li>
            <li> but I usually need 2 to completely remove make-up.  </li>
            <li> Only down side is Eye wipes</li>
            <li> Like when my mascara starts to travel for no particular reason.  </li>
            <li> only downside is that it does leave your skin feeling a little oily so you will need to either towel the residue off or wash your face after using it.</li>
            <li> so your wet lashes don&#x27;t get any on pillowcase.  </li>
            <li> They get pesky waterproof makeup off with minimal scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different makeup remover cloths and these are my favorites.</li>
            <li> I found this brand and it was a MIRACLE how it removed waterproof makeup including mascara that only thick layers of facial cream could bearly remove.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> and we both got our hands dirty, but thankfully I had these in my purse, and we had these to clean up with.  </li>
            <li> They come packaged in small package of 20 or so and are resealable similar to wet ones.</li>
            <li> It may be due to</li>
            <li> I have tried about 5 other brands and none do the job that neurtrogena does.  </li>
            <li> I would not use any other make up remover.  </li>
            <li> I usually put on eye makeup only.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other brand now.</li>
            <li> I usually rinse my face afterwards, even though the package states multiple times that there is no need.</li>
            <li> They do what they say and unlike a lot of other make up removers out there, they don&#x27;t make my eyes water and burn when I use them.</li>
            <li> The wipes seemed a little dry.</li>
            <li> but I still have dark makeup under my eyes in the morning or after class.  </li>
            <li> They are soft without irritating scent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why they haven&#x27;t sized them down to make sister eye makeup remover pads.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the package doesn&#x27;t quite stick closed which causes a little waste...</li>
            <li> Just rub it around my eyes for a bit, which takes up about half of the wipe, and the rest for my face.</li>
            <li> Does leave skin, slightly oily feeling</li>
            <li> Less irritating than the other brands - I&#x27;ve tried several.</li>
            <li> every time I did this after I would blink the mascara or eyeshadow would mess up.</li>
            <li> My face does feel a bit dry and on fire if I wipe too hard.</li>
            <li> But it stings my skin a little bit.</li>
            <li> If they do, they still work if you put a little bit of water on it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the film left behind by wipes</li>
            <li> I wear foundation, heavy eyeliner, eye shadow, and lipstick</li>
            <li> but this time it arrived in a separate box and was missing the 2 travel size packs.</li>
            <li> It takes just a few minutes every night to take of my makeup (eyeliner, mascara, concealer, foundation).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much makeup- just one swipe of eyelid base, one basic line of eyeliner and maybelline waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> I generally use them to wipe off makeup when I am too tired to wash my face late at night.</li>
            <li> I find this irritating to my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using cheaper brands in the past but always end up coming to these.  </li>
            <li> They remove the eye makeup without excessive elbow grease and don&#x27;t burn her eyes.</li>
            <li> have done to me in the past.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other [cheaper] brands trying to save a little money and have been disappointed every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for at least 4 yrs now.  </li>
            <li> It does work well at removing eye makeup without any tugging and pulling at delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> but they haven&#x27;t had them lately.</li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t notice a scent.</li>
            <li> They do leave my skin a little oily, but it isn&#x27;t a dirty, heavy type of oil.</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars, but this product is significantly less expensive at Costco.</li>
            <li> I know, I know this is not good.  </li>
            <li> I hate make up removers that have lotions (like Pond&#x27;s), and I don&#x27;t like wipes that are not solid sheets (again, Pond&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> They are thin but depending on the amount of makeup you are trying to remove one to two of these should do.</li>
            <li> They remove all my make up without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> No matter how tired I am I always remove my makeup before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Eye wipes are very expensive, On Amazon Eye wipes can be purchased for one half the price that you would pay if purchased in a Pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin around my eyes, and when I used this it stung my eyelids like crazy!!!</li>
            <li> Still expensive when you evaluate the cost over a yearly period or even a period of one month.</li>
            <li> I am also guilty of not always washing my face every night.  </li>
            <li> If you were wondering if there is a plastic tub inside of the box for keeping the packets in, unfortunately there isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Anything to save me the grief of scrubbing my makeup off my face until its raw...</li>
            <li> Removes makeup well and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I don;t have much bad to say about the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a ton of makeup, but I hate to dirty a wash cloth to wash my face.  </li>
            <li> but I hate the packaging...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have Blepharitis and I buy Eye wipes like there is no tomorrow. Eye wipes are very expensive, On Amazon Eye wipes can be purchased for one half the price that you would pay if purchased in a Pharmacy. Still expensive when you evaluate the cost over a yearly period or even a period of one month. Neutrogena  wipes do the job effectively at a much, much lower cost. Only down side is Eye wipes are  individually wrapped Neutrogena wipes come 25 to a pack and they throw in 2 travel packs of 7 each. . Packages do not always seal completely but no biggie. Great substitute for expensive Eye Wipes.</li>
            <li> these are just the best make up remover wipes on the market!!! I have tried several other [cheaper] brands trying to save a little money and have been disappointed every time. I will only buy these from now on...worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am 66 yrs old but I still have oily skin.  I am also guilty of not always washing my face every night.  I know, I know this is not good.  I hate make up removers that have lotions (like Pond&#x27;s), and I don&#x27;t like wipes that are not solid sheets (again, Pond&#x27;s).  I found Neutrogena in a hotel complimentary set of bathroom products, and I&#x27;ve never used anything else.  These wipes really do remove eye makeup, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with other wipes and my face feels oil free without feeling dry.  I&#x27;ll never waste my money on any other product again.</li>
            <li> Such a great bulk buy! These are my favorite make-up remover wipes. They remove make up super well and without tugging. The wipes are well saturated in solution so even waterproof make-up comes off with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As great as these wipes are at removing make-up, make sure to wash your face with a cleanser afterwards! It removes make-up, but doesn&#x27;t CLEAN the face. Don&#x27;t forget the crucial cleansing step!</li>
            <li> I love these makeup wipes! I have tried multiple different makeup wipes from both high end and drugstore brands and I always come back to these. They do an amazing job! Also, getting them in this pack is both cost-effective! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these face wipes for years, and this is by far the best deal I&#x27;ve ever gotten on them.  Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> i have tried many waterproof makeup removers and I ended up having to use creams then face soup AND still ended up having mascara residue.&lt;br /&gt;But not anymore!! I found this brand and it was a MIRACLE how it removed waterproof makeup including mascara that only thick layers of facial cream could bearly remove.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you neutrogenia for making this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor was rapid deliver</li>
            <li> I love these so much! I love that it came in bulk. I looked up the price of one pack and it was more expensive then this whole order! Love how gentle the wipes are and how affective they are. Super satisfied customer. Thank you seller!</li>
            <li> Fantastic, quick way to get your makeup off without spending a fortune on makeup remover at Sephora!</li>
            <li> these a wonderful cleansing tissues, gentle and thorough.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these cleaners. They are really pricy at the local pharmacy so I looked on Amazon. Great price and the package comes with travel cleaners which my wife loves. Sweet deal!</li>
            <li> I love these wipes! I generally use them to wipe off makeup when I am too tired to wash my face late at night. My boyfriend and my brother use them after sports to feel fresh until they get a chance to get home and shower and despite the fact that they are meant for the face, I found that they work really well in cleaning stains off of clothing and dirt off of shoes. Better than any other wipes I have tried, and shoe cleaning wipes are often very expensive, but these work amazingly.</li>
            <li> Love these wipes but I hate the packaging... The resealable packs DO NOT reseal after the second or third time... I have had to throw out many because they dry out... I wish they offered a reusable dispenser but I cant find one.. If you travel with an open package they will leak all over your other belongings..</li>
            <li> I love this product and decided to order it on Amazon.  When it arrived, the cloths were much drier than the ones I had purchased in stores before.  The travel size ones were unusable they were so dry.</li>
            <li> I liked these because cleaning with just soap and water doesnt always get all the makeup off my face. They are also nice because you dont have to stain your towels/washcloths at home because they have the ability to remove waterproof mascara. :)</li>
            <li> These REALLY remove all traces of makeup on your face.  Waterproof mascara comes off easily too - much better than the liquid eye makeup removers I have tried.  I like the scent of the wipes as well - fresh but not overwhelming.  I would agree with another reviewer and say that the wipes are strong and one gets the job done.  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I love these.  I&#x27;ve used them for at least 4 yrs now.  When i&#x27;m tired at night and don&#x27;t want to wash my face, I use these and they leave my skin soft and clean.  I always use them to remove my makeup rather than get it all over a washcloth.  Though u may want to do a quick wipe after with a dry tissue for mascara so your wet lashes don&#x27;t get any on pillowcase.  It does work well at removing eye makeup without any tugging and pulling at delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  As advertised, I got a bulk set.  Loved that I got 2 travel size wipes.</li>
            <li> This makeup remover works great- removes all mascara and and color product.  Towels are very durable.  I will definelty buy this again.</li>
            <li> The best - do the job and are easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product; fast shipping and great price!</li>
            <li> I like them, they work fine, however I have made the switch to cruelty free products. I just tried Giovanni facial wipes, and I actually like them way better. They make my skin feel soft and smooth. So, I won&#x27;t be getting these again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using cheaper brands in the past but always end up coming to these.  They just work so much better and are only less than a dollar more than other brands.  They get pesky waterproof makeup off with minimal scrubbing.</li>
            <li> The perfect wipes to get my makeup off! My face doesn&#x27;t get irritated at all and one does the trick.</li>
            <li> I really like these wipes and used to be able to get this configuration in costco but they haven&#x27;t had them lately. I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries this and I hope they continue too. These are the best cleansing wipes on the market in my opinion. They don&#x27;t sting my eyes and they don&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> gave it as a gift to my wife.  She like it;therefor, i like it.</li>
            <li> Love how these remove ALL my makeup and are alcohol free!</li>
            <li> So easy to use. They are thin but depending on the amount of makeup you are trying to remove one to two of these should do. I even use it to remove my mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other brands (Olay, L&#x27;Oreal, etc) but bought this bulk pack at Costco and it is far superior.  Finally something that gets all of the mascara off.  Also, they smell better and are softer than the other brands.</li>
            <li> These are a must have for me. These are great for those nights when you&#x27;re too tired to take off your make up, since all you have to do is grab a towel and just wipe all the make up off. It&#x27;s quick and effective.</li>
            <li> These wipes take off makeup so easily and smoothly, I was pleasantly surprised. There&#x27;s no stringent feel, and no chemical odor (which is why I threw away the generic ones I had). And this package deal is great; sharing with my grown granddaughter keeps her out of my stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It works great and is so gentle.  I love the price of buying them bulk.  Fast service. Thanks</li>
            <li> These work great! I was purchasing another brand for awhile but decided to try these. They work a lot better than what I was previously using. I will continue to use these.</li>
            <li> These towelettes do an excellent job of removing make-up - whether it&#x27;s liquid foundation, eyeshadow, or concealer. It has a very gentle, non-abrasive texture. Skin feels soft afterwards. The towelettes have a nice fragrance as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other cleansing wipes, like Pond&#x27;s, and am definitely happier with Neutrogena&#x27;s. Love it!</li>
            <li> This removes make up like no other. Would have given 5 stars, but this product is significantly less expensive at Costco.</li>
            <li> These wipes are the gold standard for make-up removal and this bulk package is an awesome way to procure them.  Have been doing so for almost two years now.  They do the job without clogging pores (non-comedogenic), retain their moisture well when a package has been unsealed, and have a subtle, yet very pleasant fragrance.  They have become a staple in our household are quite a deal on Amazon compared to getting them anywhere else!</li>
            <li> Wish these were packaged smaller. I want it fir traveling.</li>
            <li> It removes make up very well. But it stings my skin a little bit. It may be due to I have sensitive skin. I only use it for nights when I have a lot of make up on, I mainly only use baby wipes. Also be warned. Do not use while apply makeup (like fixing mascara mistakes) every time I did this after I would blink the mascara or eyeshadow would mess up. The oil stay on your skin. So I recomend baby wipes for that job.</li>
            <li> My wife uses and loves this item. Says it is the best and definitely will reorder. Is very easy to use and cleans very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I have used these for a couple years. I love that they remove makeup and waterproof mascara without drying your skin. Not greasy either.</li>
            <li> awesome makeup remover without being too oily.  Face is clean without feeling stripped and gets all the makeup off.  Great!</li>
            <li> My favorite make-up remover wipes! No odor or residue.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I use it instead of washing my face with my acne meds at the end of every day, even when I haven&#x27;t worn make up, and I&#x27;ve actually found that it&#x27;s helped my breakouts. The wipes are soothing and do a nice job of removing make up, oil, and dirt.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are soft, the light smell tolerable, the top layer of make up comes off with a little effort. But the package is so thin, the closure inefficient and they dry out in a few days , even under the best of circumstances.  I suppose you can wet them with water to reconstitute the solution but doesn&#x27;t this defeat the whole purpose of buying individual small packages that will be relatively free of contamination for a while, and can be used occasionally, or when traveling ? And don&#x27;t even think of throwing these in your purse. The first one you draw out of the package will be as efficient as a cheap, dry, used paper towel.</li>
            <li> I use these to remove eye makeup - even waterproof mascara.  They work great and are easy to pack for a trip.</li>
            <li> Essy to use. Godo for me</li>
            <li> I love usually use natural products but these work so well that i will continue to buy them. I go through them pretty quickly so that is why i buy this big pack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also comes with mini packs which i like</li>
            <li> These do a nice job of taking off makeup - including waterproof mascara. It has a pleasant, light scent as well, that doesn&#x27;t bother me like many added fragrances do. I probably use the wipes 3-4 times a week, and give my face a good scrub the other nights.</li>
            <li> These are the best makeup removers around.  I have tried about 5 other brands and none do the job that neurtrogena does.  This package worked great, because it came with two travel packs.  Very convenient for me, as I do travel a fair amount.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Very gentle for sensitive skin and a good size to thoroughly cleanse the makeup off before washing. In a pinch, they will suffice without rinsing.</li>
            <li> Great product that cleans better than any facial wipes I&#x27;ve used.  Great bonus:  a couple of mini packs that I can tuck into my makeup bag in my purse.  Sometimes, if you&#x27;re really tired on your way home at night, you can go ahead and clean your face!  Last night, my friend had to change a tire on the side of the road and we both got our hands dirty, but thankfully I had these in my purse, and we had these to clean up with.  Great convenience and performance.</li>
            <li> These are great, and don&#x27;t dry out my face. Sometimes the package doesn&#x27;t quite stick closed which causes a little waste... Bc the top one dries out... But otherwise, a good product.</li>
            <li> Like the wipes but sometimes does not remove stubborn eye makeup</li>
            <li> Less irritating than the other brands - I&#x27;ve tried several. Way easier than trying to scrub off mascara and getting soap in your eyes!</li>
            <li> Good pricing, liked the packaging. I bought these to minimize mascara on the towels in our rental home. They are soft without irritating scent.</li>
            <li> I have bought this sized boxed make-up remover for myself and my two girls (college age). I think the box is a value and that this product really removes make-up and cleans your face. We always remove our make-up before we wash our faces now. I think that we all have beautiful skin because of the way we care for it!</li>
            <li> I cannot live w/out these wipes.  they remove my waterproof mascara and liner easily.  Sometimes they get dry but I add water and they are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial wipe for 15 years and they always work really well, never burn and do a great job at removing all make up.  I would not use any other make up remover.  You can get a better price at Costco for this 114ct box.</li>
            <li> Who sends makeup wipes with signature only mail? I ordered them because I am too busy to go to store to buy them. How can I sit home all day to wait to sign for them? Please refund me or deliver them properly.</li>
            <li> The wipes seemed a little dry. They do work but you need two or three to remove the makeup. I don&#x27;t think I would get them again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove waterproof mascara as stated.  I use Lancome eye makeup liquid on Neutrogena wipes to remove</li>
            <li> I use these nightly and they work better than washing my face. My skin always feels wonderful the next morning, even without using a moisturizer afterwards. Saves so much time when you are lazy at night. It removes even the most heavy make up, however it doesn&#x27;t remove all of my mascara. However, I&#x27;m more concerned with the quality of my skin, which is extremely sensitive, prone to breakouts, dryness and oiliness. Yes, unfortunately I have all the skin problems at once, but fortunately these work well on all of these. I pair these with a high end face regimen in the morning. They also smell wonderful, a very light and not perfummey but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I tried a small pack of the product before making up my mind to go for this large pack. It&#x27;s very easy to wipe off makeup (powder foundation, eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara, etc). I usually put on eye makeup only. One towelette is more than enough to clean my face most of the time. My face does feel a bit dry and on fire if I wipe too hard. I always wash my face and put on face moisturizer after I use the towelettes. That being said, I still gave it a 5-star because it gets the job done better than all other products (especially the liquid ones) I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like Neutrogena products?  The towelettes are moist, not soaked, and smell great, but not strong.  They do a good job getting makeup off, including mascara.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it every day for her make up remover. She buys it a lot and don&#x27;t lives without it.</li>
            <li> They come packaged in small package of 20 or so and are resealable similar to wet ones. They are great at removing all traces of makeup including eye makeup.  They do not sting or burn your eyes and I really like that I don&#x27;t need water after using, although it does feel fresher.</li>
            <li> These remove makeup, even stubborn mascara, like nobody&#x27;s business.  Gentle on even sensitive skin - highly recommended.  This multi-pack is a terrific buy, and i love the travel packs.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have tried using these wipes. Although it is effective in removing makeup, it irritates and creates a burning effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, then this is the product for you as it gets the job done. However, if you&#x27;re like me, then I would recommend trying Kirkland Signature&#x27;s Daily Facial Towelettes.</li>
            <li> So happy that this item is offered on Amazon because this is my hg of facial cleaning products due to my rosacea.  They do not irritate my skin and they remove eye makeup. If you were wondering if there is a plastic tub inside of the box for keeping the packets in, unfortunately there isn&#x27;t.  You have to purchase that separately. I have tried a few different makeup remover cloths and these are my favorites. They leave your skin soft, not greasy and they don&#x27;t have a scent to them if that is something that might bother you.  At least I didn&#x27;t notice a scent.</li>
            <li> See earlier review.  Love these wipes.  I will keep purchasing them when I run out.</li>
            <li> these are tested on animals!  that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
            <li> Great Item. Love the bulk purchase and would like to continue to purchase this items in the near future. Works Great Everytime.</li>
            <li> They workj well, but the package doesn&#x27;t stay closed very well, so they dry out.</li>
            <li> great value for this product!</li>
            <li> I like these make-up removers but I usually need 2 to completely remove make-up.  They do make my face feel soft and clean despite that point.</li>
            <li> the girlfriend loves themmmmmmm. IT IS what it says it is. Came on time and 114 wipes in the box. :D</li>
            <li> This is really sooo great! The box brings several packages inside in different sizes (normal and travel) and it&#x27;s so useful. I loved this cleansing towelette already, and I just loved that fact that I can buy so many at once, since this are pretty much for daily use in my case.</li>
            <li> Great product at a fraction of the cost you would pay at the drugstore. So nice to buy this in an economy pack and have it delivered. Works wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye area.</li>
            <li> I love these. They remove all my makeup, even water proof and long wear, easily. One wipe does wonderfully.</li>
            <li> a bit dry, not soggy enough, esp not after the package has been open for a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this but my girlfriend does. After she used another product to clean off her eye makeup, her eyelids became red and sore from the solution. I purchased these for her a couple of times in the last year and they work perfectly. They remove the eye makeup without excessive elbow grease and don&#x27;t burn her eyes. I get extra points for being thoughtful too!!!!</li>
            <li> these are my darling wife&#x27;s must haves, she uses them morning and night, and the work great, even on water proof mascara. She has great skin, so they must work, right?</li>
            <li> This is one of my favourite products. It works excellent in removing makeup off of your face. Even works for waterproof mascara. I love that I was able to buy them in bulk and for this price you cannot complain.</li>
            <li> These wipes are so amazing! Take off my waterproof makeup like it was nothing! Hydrating and keeps my skin soft. I love them!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time.  It removes makeup easily and effectively for me.  I have tried many other products and I think this one does the best job for me.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin and surrounding the eyes, no burn.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this box, since this is the best bargain for a great cleansing cloth. I&#x27;ve tried several other brands over the years and keep coming back to these.  They&#x27;re the only cloth that really removes all my makeup (waterproof or otherwise), although I do follow up with cleanser and my Clarisonic in any case.  But in addition to that, these are a good size, don&#x27;t tear when removing from the package, and they don&#x27;t irritate or cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> The best towelettes ever! I have tried many brands, even expensive ones, but these are really moistened and clean thoroughly. I have sensitive eyes and they work very well, no irritation at all.  I will always use them for sure.</li>
            <li> Removes makeup well and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. I recommend these.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup remover and this multipack really saves me money.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin/eczema and this stuff really gets all the makeup off without having to scrub hard!&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it does leave your skin feeling a little oily so you will need to either towel the residue off or wash your face after using it. I don&#x27;t mind, though. Anything to save me the grief of scrubbing my makeup off my face until its raw...</li>
            <li> I love these. They remove makeup well, and the price is great. I will definitely order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> i love these whips!  I use them personally and in my professional makeup kit.  I was happy when I discovered they are sold in a larger quanity.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell of the product, nor the quality of the towelette used.  I had hoped more for a cotton or gauze, but it feels like light fleece.</li>
            <li> Bought these specifically because I recently started wearing more eye makeup hoping they&#x27;d be an easy solution for the end of the day, but these don&#x27;t do the whole job for basic eyeliner and waterproof mascara.  I don&#x27;t use much makeup- just one swipe of eyelid base, one basic line of eyeliner and maybelline waterproof mascara.  After using the wipes and swiping them (with some elbow grease) across my eyes multiple times, I still have to wash my eyes again with more face soap.  I wash my face anyway, but what&#x27;s the point of the wipes if they don&#x27;t even get all of the makeup?  Some mornings or after yoga I&#x27;ve thought I got it all off but I still have dark makeup under my eyes in the morning or after class.  I don&#x27;t see the point and won&#x27;t order these again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is a better deal out there then this for the price. I use these for everything in additional to removing make up. I use them in my car and the amount you get for the price is great..</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the best value but good quality..</li>
            <li> I like the ease of using these remover towelettes.  They clean really well and my face feels so soft after using them!</li>
            <li> These are the best makeup remover cloths out there. Better than Mac. I also like the Simple line and hear good things about the Kirkland (Costco) brand but haven&#x27;t tried. There are spot-on, one of those \\&quot;how can this be so good?\\&quot; things you stumble across and treasure. They take every trace off, even mascara and all eye makeup using 1 cloth for the entire face. I can&#x27;t understand why they haven&#x27;t sized them down to make sister eye makeup remover pads.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase. They not only did great at removing makeup and waterproof mascara, they feel great and are refreshing.</li>
            <li> I bought the same from Costco for only $15!!!!! Do yourself a favor and save your money and buy from Costco! Best wipes ever but rip off on here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product multiple times - I LOVE it. It removes my waterproof mascara and eyeliner with ease and smells great. Originally, I thought it was oily or something, like it left residue on my face, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of it. It&#x27;s not oily at all, it&#x27;s just the moistness from the towelette that I felt. I won&#x27;t use any other brand now.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the commercials. I thought a towelette would be easier than using several cotton balls. I have sensitive skin around my eyes, and when I used this it stung my eyelids like crazy!!! I did have some dry skin around my eyes at the time as well. After rinsing with cool water to sooth the burning/stinging, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with my Clinique eye make-up remover (it doesn&#x27;t sting even when I have dry skin). It works great and I can deal with using cotton balls ;)</li>
            <li> Great product but better bulk price at Costco..</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, so I have tried a ton of different lotions, wipes, etc to wash my face and take off my makeup.  I don&#x27;t wear a ton of makeup, but I hate to dirty a wash cloth to wash my face.  Plus even the kindest soaps has a tendency to really dry out my face.  I found Neutrogena a few years ago and have been a loyal buyer ever since.  No breakouts, just a clean fresh face.  Buying online, in bulk saves me time and money.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> The only makeup remover I will use.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena a made a wonderful cleansing towelette in my option.  The towels are soft and the cleanser does not cause any irritation or dryness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Best make up remover!!!</li>
            <li> Great Price. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> They should have said theses are \\&quot;TRAVEL\\&quot; makeup wipes. Each packet has 7 wipes and you have to unwrap each one constantly. A real pain in the &amp;d):-&amp;@!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- I made a mistake when I reviewed these. The travel packages were on top of this big package and I thought they ALL were travel packages. They are not. You&#x27;re get the regular sized ones. Oops!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; I love how gentle these are. They remove all my make up without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes and buying them in a bulk package makes it so much better. I use these after I wash my face to ensure that I get every part of my face clean such as around my nostrils, hairline, ears, and around my lips. These are fantastic for getting any makeup off that might have been missed and they leave my face feeling clean and not dry. They also take off waterproof makeup great! I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying these.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m old enough that my face doesn&#x27;t break out anymore, I use these to wipe away what little makeup I wear at night (mineral powder and mascara) and followup with a warm wash cloth.  I don&#x27;t like the film left behind by wipes so I always rinse afterwards with the wash cloth and then follow with my moisturizer.  These are so easy to use and eliminate the water/sink mess I always used to make in the evening.</li>
            <li> Love these. Best price you will find around for this many wipes. They get off EVERYTHING. Very gentle, I use these every day. Absolutely a beauty must-have. The mix of regular packs and travel packs are great.</li>
            <li> I was watching TV and saw the commercial and thought, \\&quot;yeah okay, there is no way they work that well.\\&quot; So I put them to the test. I wear foundation, heavy eyeliner, eye shadow, and lipstick and it takes it all off! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! And a major bonus, it has moisturizers in them so it leaves you face clean, make up free and soft! An absolute must for every make up wearer!</li>
            <li> The best I have used.</li>
            <li> I bought this before and it was perfect but this time it arrived in a separate box and was missing the 2 travel size packs. strange. other then missing a few packs product is great</li>
            <li> Love these! They are so gentle and do NOT have alcohol.</li>
            <li> I don;t have much bad to say about the product. They come in a re closable package, they don&#x27;t dry out easily. If they do, they still work if you put a little bit of water on it. It takes just a few minutes every night to take of my makeup (eyeliner, mascara, concealer, foundation). Just rub it around my eyes for a bit, which takes up about half of the wipe, and the rest for my face. They smell fine, it&#x27;s chemical-like. They do leave my skin a little oily, but it isn&#x27;t a dirty, heavy type of oil. I usually rinse my face afterwards, even though the package states multiple times that there is no need. either way, it&#x27;s more effective and faster than scrubbing your face with soap and water every night.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my Mom and she loves these wipes. Its refreshing for her and it smells great. The pricing was good on the product as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of makeup removing towelettes.  The drugstore economy brand all the way to Dior.  These Neutrogena towelettes are my absolute favorite.  They make easy work of any eye makeup without leaving behind a lot of oil that may clog/block pours.  Plus, they have a light scent and are not over powering.  Additionally the packaging allows towels to remain moist while you&#x27;re using the package.  So many bargain brands dry out before the package is gone.  I would recommend these towelettes to anyone that likes removing makeup quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> The item arrived in great condition and on the  estimated date.  I love these wipes because they easily remove stubborn eye make up with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> Large size, made it a good purchase, takes off regular make up great, did not try it with water proof makeup. Does leave skin, slightly oily feeling, I usually rinse the cloth thoroughly then use it to clean my face off one more time to get rid of that makeup remover.</li>
            <li> These are a great makeup wipe! I really like these refill packs as they come in different sizes and I can put them in my travel stuff and take with me! They take all my makeup off and leave my face feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t remove all of my makeup completely but they do their job.</li>
            <li> Super soft, easy to use, easily disposable and compact. Really glad I switched to these from cotton balls and liquid remover. It gets all my makeup off and I&#x27;ve had clearer skin!</li>
            <li> I like these, I have bought them before and will again.</li>
            <li> Takes off makeup, including water-proof eyeliner, very well.  Even after washing with soap and washcloth, these sheets still take off residual makeup that otherwise would have been left on my face.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. No residue.</li>
            <li> Better price than I can get locally.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes!They don&#x27;t break my face out like a lot of others have done to me in the past. A good alternative for when you are feeling lazy and don&#x27;t want to wash your face, but still don&#x27;t want to fall asleep with your make up on.</li>
            <li> my good to make up remover</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of these wipes to clean my face before bed each night.  They are gentle, yet highly effective with a few quick wipes.</li>
            <li> Love these.  I have tried other brands and always come back to Neutrogena.  I like many Neutrogena products.  I buy in bulk when I can.</li>
            <li> These wipes do an exceptional job at removing face and eye makeup. As part of my nightly facial cleansing routine, I use these wipes followed by a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil for a fresh face before bed. This box contains both larger and smaller packs of wipes. The small packages are great for traveling or for going to the gym to wipe makeup off before working out. the patent pending resealable package stays sealed and works well. The wipes have just the right amount of moisture on them, and don&#x27;t drip or feel to dry.</li>
            <li> Love it, but you can now buy this at Costco for a 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> Love these wipes. They do what they say and unlike a lot of other make up removers out there, they don&#x27;t make my eyes water and burn when I use them. However, I have been able to find them cheaper at other places.</li>
            <li> Still needed to use other makeup remover for any intense eye make-up or lip wear, but really nice for day-to-day wear.</li>
            <li> Love the simplicity and the cleanliness.  My skin feels both clean and soft.</li>
            <li> these towelettes work great. they remove waterproof mascara without any issues. they have a nice fragrance that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I use these wipes every night to remove mascara and the day&#x27;s grime.  I have mild rosacea.  These wipes do NOT irritate my skin, and they leave my face clean and refreshed.  They are a staple in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> does a decent job at removing makeup.  I like the packs I can carry in my purse for the boo-boos that can happen during the day.  Like when my mascara starts to travel for no particular reason.  Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these facial wipes. I won&#x27;t use anything else ever again. I also tell all of my friends about these. They get all of the make up off of my face and leave my skin feeling so fresh. Thr larger box is the way to go... Don&#x27;t buy the packets individually. I found these as cheap as $11 at costco... But this is the best price I could find online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. Great at removing eye makeup!</li>
            <li> Great cleaner. Use it all the time and every time I use it, it takes off the make up easily.</li>
            <li> I love these makeup wipes! I have tried at least 10 other name brand or generic products claiming similar results and none of them are as effective. These wipes actually remove all my makeup(including waterproof mascara and liner) with a simple swipe. I will continue buying the 114 pack as long as they offer it because I do not want to run out of these babies!</li>
            <li> I find this irritating to my dry winter skin. Next time I&#x27;ll try the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; version.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena face wipes are a necessity for skin care regime. No matter how tired I am I always remove my makeup before going to bed. I keep these wipes by my bed and it only takes minute to clean my face. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE! The TV Ad is true - one wipe will take off even the most stubborn eye makeup - Yay!</li>
            <li> I just love it! Remember to do this before bed, and you&#x27;re golden. Great for camping and late nights. I keep a pack by my bed.</li>
            <li> we must NEVER go to bed with makeup on...and these are perfect for lazy or late nights...to keep up 100% faithfulness...</li>
