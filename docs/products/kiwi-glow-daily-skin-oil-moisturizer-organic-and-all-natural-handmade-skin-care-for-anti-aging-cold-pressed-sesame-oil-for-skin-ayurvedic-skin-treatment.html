            <li>I have not used this oil very much since I received it, as the smell was extremely strong and gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and my skin absorbs it in minutes, leaving it soft and glowing :)..</li>
            <li>Kiwiglow makes my skin very soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I didn’t think anything that was all natural could be as good as what I had been using, but now I laugh at my own naïvet&amp;eacute; because I have come to realize that this product is not just a little bit better than what I had previously used, it is significantly better!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I noticed a massive difference to my skin texture within three days of applying Kiwiglow.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and is absorbed fast.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is made from all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and she ships super fast too!</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle and absorbs into the skin so quickly.</li>
            <li>When I first started using Kiwiglow</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have more room for jewelry on your dresser and have the money to buy it as well because you&#x27;re saving big on body care products.</li>
            <li>then you know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li>Give it a try and am sure that you will find the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just love Kiwiglow, my friend gave it to me as a present to try it out.</li>
            <li>this stuff really rocks!</li>
            <li>I will certainly recommend the product to everyone I know and will keep on using it for the rest of my years</li>
            <li>My heels are so much smoother,</li>
            <li>My very-white skin, without any suntan protection, now tolerates the sun without burning for much longer time spans.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>As someone who is very fussy about what I put on my skin, Kiwiglow blew me away.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by what appears to be too much oil on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Kiwiglow has a lovely fragrance, but it is mild and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The subtle fragrance is mesmerising and people often comment on how good I smell even without putting any scent on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>His skin is doing better and is much less flakey.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>It is no trouble each day to apply as the skin quickly absorbs it and leaves a lovely subtle perfume.</li>
            <li>I use kiwi glow everyday and love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>After I posted my first review, Ana with Kiwiglow contacted me and offered to send me a complimentary bottle of the other scent, amaya.  </li>
            <li>It even faded the large freckles on my hands and face, my “liver spots,” to the point where they are barely visible.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Give it a go and watch your skin become soft and glow like a new born.</li>
            <li>You get a lot for your money, but since I can&#x27;t seem to use it because of the strong scent, it was a waste for me.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that you only need a little</li>
            <li>and my skin has never been so soft and truly glowing.  </li>
            <li>I received a bottle as a gift over a year ago and was told that it nourishes and detoxifies naturally.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes you skin with all natural oils and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>(hopefully a few more yet!)I wish I could order it from NZ online ( maybe a thought for the future!)</li>
            <li>It is more subtle and did not give me a headache.  </li>
            <li>I have not used any other product for over two years and would recommend this product to babies right through to the elderly.</li>
            <li>It is affordable and simple, which is a change in this busy world we live in.</li>
            <li>It is lightly scented with the rich oils of cold pressed sesame seeds and vitamin E.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50+ years old (let&#x27;s just leave it at that for now) and had signs of sun damage from my younger years.</li>
            <li>had problems with my skin being red around my nose and chin for years and within a week its completely cleared up</li>
            <li>Normally my skin gets a bit dry and itchy when the temperatures drop.  </li>
            <li>The smell was very \\&quot;old lady perfume\\&quot; like to me, and  there&#x27;s no way I could have worn it all day long.  </li>
            <li>A drop of the oil goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need much, it will last you for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it all over my body right after I shower and find that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have recently Travelled from the Tropics to the Arctic and my skin copped a hammering , this Moisturizer handles extreme Hot &amp; Cold temperatures and since I have been using the Earth version my skin looks and feels better than it ever has after similar trips.&lt;br /&gt;Coming from a Bloke</li>

            <li> She has grey hair, which is very dry, but since she&#x27;s been using it, her hair has become soft and shiny, and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I used to use coconut oil, shea butter, and other natural stuff</li>
            <li> Kiwiglow goes on light and non-greasy and it has a very subtle and pleasing scent.  </li>
            <li> have recently had a baby and have found that Kiwiglow is gentle enough to apply on his delicate skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> However I have noticed that my skin is staying soft and moist even in the harsh weather conditions.  </li>
            <li> so one bottle will go a long, long, very long way!  </li>
            <li> I adore KiwiGlow and have been using it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> when they state it goes a long way, one bottle will last you a long time because you need so little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> I applied it every morning and night as my skin was very dry</li>
            <li> Within a few days I noticed that the raised dry patches on my body (from sun damage) started to get smaller.</li>

            <li> I use kiwi glow everyday and love how it feels on my skin. It is easy to apply and my skin absorbs it in minutes, leaving it soft and glowing :)..</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels like it was make with 100% pure love.  It&#x27;s organic and my skin glows after each application.  My favorite fragrance is Verde. It is lightly scented with the rich oils of cold pressed sesame seeds and vitamin E.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kiwiglow for almost a year now and my skin has never been so soft and truly glowing.  The scents are absolutely splendid and believe me, I&#x27;ve used them all.  I&#x27;m 50+ years old (let&#x27;s just leave it at that for now) and had signs of sun damage from my younger years. Growing up the only sunscreen on the market that my mother could buy was Coppertone, which didn&#x27;t prevent sunburns, just meant I would burn a little slower. When I first started using Kiwiglow I applied it every morning and night as my skin was very dry (thank you menopause).  Within a few days I noticed that the raised dry patches on my body (from sun damage) started to get smaller. Within two weeks, those spots disappeared completely and now it&#x27;s just soft and beautiful.  I love the idea that it&#x27;s organic too and you only need a few drops so one bottle will go a long, long, very long way!  In the end, I&#x27;m saving money too because I no longer keep buying bottles of different brands of &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; lotion in the store trying to find one that truly works.  Trust me on this, Kiwiglow will be the last brand you ever buy and your dresser will no longer look like a store shelf.  You&#x27;ll have more room for jewelry on your dresser and have the money to buy it as well because you&#x27;re saving big on body care products. The owner of this shop is a delight too and she ships super fast too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I noticed a change in my skin after only a week of use. It is so gentle and absorbs into the skin so quickly.Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I adore KiwiGlow and have been using it for a very long time. I love the fact that it is 100% natural and beautifully scented! Hands down the best moisturizer! :o)</li>
            <li> What an amazing product! I am in my seventies and have used many different moisturisers on my skin but have been unable to get rid of the dryness especially on my feet. I have been using this product for only two weeks and the difference is amazing already! My heels are so much smoother, my nails (both hands and feet) are looking so much better and are not so brittle.It is no trouble each day to apply as the skin quickly absorbs it and leaves a lovely subtle perfume.I only wish I had found Kiwiglow years ago. It would have solved all my skin problems earlier. I will certainly recommend the product to everyone I know and will keep on using it for the rest of my years (hopefully a few more yet!)I wish I could order it from NZ online ( maybe a thought for the future!)</li>
            <li> My sister gave me Kiwiglow last Christmas and I think that this product is just amazing, I noticed a difference to my skin texture both on my face and body.  I would highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Kiwiglow Earth product for about a month.  The northeastern U.S. weather has been very cold this December/January.  Normally my skin gets a bit dry and itchy when the temperatures drop.  However I have noticed that my skin is staying soft and moist even in the harsh weather conditions.  Kiwiglow goes on light and non-greasy and it has a very subtle and pleasing scent.  If you are looking for a natural skin care moisturizer this is a very nice one to try.</li>
            <li> KiwiGlow is fabulous!  I received a bottle as a gift over a year ago and was told that it nourishes and detoxifies naturally. I didn’t think anything that was all natural could be as good as what I had been using, but now I laugh at my own naïvet&amp;eacute; because I have come to realize that this product is not just a little bit better than what I had previously used, it is significantly better!  It even faded the large freckles on my hands and face, my “liver spots,” to the point where they are barely visible.  I hadn’t known it was possible for them to ever disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KiwiGlow has made my skin softer, and somehow enables me to be out in the sun for longer durations.  My very-white skin, without any suntan protection, now tolerates the sun without burning for much longer time spans.  Oh, I love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!  It moisturizes you skin with all natural oils and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.  The smell and packaging are fantastic! My boyfriend tried it and I had to order a second bottle cause he wouldn&#x27;t give it back! So glad I found Kiwiglow :)</li>
            <li> Great value for the money, this product lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, my skin now happily glows from the inside out!!!</li>
            <li> The product is so light even for an oil and it absorbs so well into the skin. I&#x27;ve used all name brands and they dwindle in comparison. My husband has Psoriasis and I make him use KiwiGlow too. His skin is doing better and is much less flakey. If you or a loved one of yours has Psoriasis then you know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about. I&#x27;d recommend this product any day. I know lthat I look foreward to how i feel after using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very sensitive skin and it feels great. I would definitely  recommend this product for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Kiwiglow makes my skin very soft and healthy looking. It&#x27;s an excellent natural moisturizer. I made my family trying it and they absolutely love it. Everybody should use this product instead of the body lotions full with chemicals. A drop of the oil goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need much, it will last you for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> 1st Review:  I have not used this oil very much since I received it, as the smell was extremely strong and gave me a headache.  You get a lot for your money, but since I can&#x27;t seem to use it because of the strong scent, it was a waste for me.  The smell was very \\&quot;old lady perfume\\&quot; like to me, and  there&#x27;s no way I could have worn it all day long.  Maybe they should consider selling a smaller bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review:  After I posted my first review, Ana with Kiwiglow contacted me and offered to send me a complimentary bottle of the other scent, amaya.  If you have tried verde and did not like the smell, I would recommend you try amaya.  It is more subtle and did not give me a headache.  I was blown away by Ana&#x27;s offer and believe that Kiwiglow&#x27;s customer service is great!  I would recommend the brand.  Thank you, Ana!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I noticed a massive difference to my skin texture within three days of applying Kiwiglow. I have not used any other product for over two years and would recommend this product to babies right through to the elderly.This has been life changing for me, it even soothes sun burnt skin! (As I experienced recently). Once you have tried Kiwiglow you will never use another artificial product on the market again and its&#x27; true it has been made with &#x27;love&#x27; you can feel that once you have applied this nourishing skin food. I would give this product 100 stars if I could. It is affordable and simple, which is a change in this busy world we live in. Give it a go and watch your skin become soft and glow like a new born. LOVE LOVE LOVE KIWIGLOW!</li>
            <li> As someone who is very fussy about what I put on my skin, Kiwiglow blew me away. It goes on so smooth and is absorbed fast. I use it all over my body right after I shower and find that a little bit goes a long way. The fact that it is organic gives me confidence in its safety and longevity :)  My skin has never felt softer or younger. The subtle fragrance is mesmerising and people often comment on how good I smell even without putting any scent on.&lt;br /&gt;I have recently had a baby and have found that Kiwiglow is gentle enough to apply on his delicate skin without irritation. This oil is suitable for the whole family to use and is worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;Will never use anything else on my skin except this wonderful oil - Kiwiglow. Give it a try and am sure that you will find the same results.&lt;br /&gt;- Beatrice Maloney, Australia.</li>
            <li> Love this product because its great but also because it is ALL NATURAL. Can be used on any part of your body great for the face because of its purity but then you get addicted and want to use it all over, from your face to callouses on your feet and your elbows and knees and everything else in between.&lt;br /&gt;It is very true when they state it goes a long way, one bottle will last you a long time because you need so little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Use it after your shower or anytime, it can even tame and condition frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I just love Kiwiglow, my friend gave it to me as a present to try it out. I don&#x27;t use anything else on my skin, I used to use coconut oil, shea butter, and other natural stuff but this is so much better. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily, it&#x27;s very light and it is absorbed very quickly. My favourite scent is &amp;#34;Earth&amp;#34;, I love that one. It is very unique and there is nothing like it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother liked the &amp;#34;Amaya&amp;#34;, which has a flowery scent, and she even uses it for her hair. She has grey hair, which is very dry, but since she&#x27;s been using it, her hair has become soft and shiny, and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you, Hajnalka Konyher</li>
            <li> alot of todays products are full of chemicals and who knows what else .this stuff makes my skin feel like silk and you can tell its made from quality ingredients.i had problems with my skin being red around my nose and chin for years and within a week its completely cleared up</li>
            <li> I have recently Travelled from the Tropics to the Arctic and my skin copped a hammering , this Moisturizer handles extreme Hot &amp; Cold temperatures and since I have been using the Earth version my skin looks and feels better than it ever has after similar trips.&lt;br /&gt;Coming from a Bloke this is a Great product - Thanks</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer also great for dry skin. Bought as a gift and ended up using it for myself and love it.</li>
            <li> I am Kiwiglow&#x27;s biggest fan!  I have been using Verde for over a year.  It&#x27;s the only thing that I will put on my skin.  As an overall body moisturizer, it truly moisturizes my skin.  Two drops on my hand is all it takes as a face and neck moisturizer.  Any excess left on my hands gets put on the ends of my hair.  It has replaced all my other organic skin moisturizers.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by what appears to be too much oil on your skin.  Within seconds it penetrates the skin and leaves a healthy glow.  I would not be without Kiwiglow!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you only need a little and I loved the way my skin feels afterwards. this stuff really rocks!</li>
            <li> Kiwiglow has a lovely fragrance, but it is mild and not overwhelming. It is very gentle and easily absorbed into my skin. I love the fact that it is made from all natural ingredients. My skin has never been smoother or healthier looking.</li>
            <li> Kiwi glow is just Fabulous!! I absolutely love the scent and the feel on my skin.  It&#x27;s rich yet not greasy and the glow it gives you is radiant.  I love it.</li>
