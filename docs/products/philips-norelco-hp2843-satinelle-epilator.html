            <li>A great buy!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still performing perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than waxing!!!  </li>
            <li>This product has met our needs and is very good.  </li>
            <li>and I feel really good about not having to discard the metal cans they come in!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely happy with the results.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I think that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great accessory to have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am really happy that I decided to give the epilator a try.  </li>
            <li>and i am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The results have been better than I could have imagined!!   </li>
            <li>I have to say I am very happy with this kind of epilator, it works as good as the one I had before</li>
            <li>and I am already seeing amazing results!   </li>
            <li>This is a good product and I am happy with the service from Amazon, though it got delayed to reach me, but was informed by Amazon.</li>
            <li>:o)  </li>
            <li>:o) &lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, the epilator is a good product, once you get the hang of using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good item when compared with its price.</li>
            <li>Because of this, it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week.  </li>
            <li>Before I bought it, I did a lot of research and saw a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will be a good choice to have two toys at the price of one!  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very glad I did it.</li>
            <li>The first use hurts INCREDIBLY!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see there&#x27;s some competition in this marketplace!</li>
            <li>and I love that!</li>
            <li>and it feels like your legs would feel two days afer shaving kind of thing.</li>
            <li>It is nice to not have to shave every day anymore.  </li>
            <li>Also, that it does a superior job on those \\&quot;more sensitive\\&quot; areas with coarser hair than on the legs.</li>
            <li>It does hurt, but not the kind of pain a woman can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li>Cost and time effective.</li>
            <li>I bought the an older model and was very happy with it and by mistake ordered a panasonic one.  </li>
            <li>From the experience of more than 10 years, this is the best method to keep smooth legs if you cannot afford laser hair removal all over your body.&lt;br /&gt;However, Using this machine is NOT painless procedure for first couple of rounds.</li>
            <li>You have to experiment to determine what is most effective maximizing uprooting more hairs and minizing the pain.    </li>
            <li>I have an exceptionally quick growth of hair (or, so I feel!!).</li>
            <li>In the products defense, I don&#x27;t think there is a way to make this device easy to use and leg friendly (God forbid you try it anywhere else, ladies!!).  </li>
            <li>However, after an underarm waxing, I have been able to use this epilator on my underarms</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did ^_^</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>For many years I was shaving my legs to get rid of hairs.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t have irritated skin for more than a minute after you stop using the epilator.</li>
            <li>Generally I am satisfied with its performance</li>
            <li>&quot; it pulled more hairs then the Satinelle Epilator.  </li>
            <li>okay, I don&#x27;t have to shave every three days anymore.</li>
            <li>Just use some lotion after you epilate and your skin stays so smooth!    </li>
            <li>I have never been one to shave my arms, but I used this on them, and am so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s cheaper than \\&quot;tend skin\\&quot; and works better than \\&quot;bikini zone\\&quot; .</li>
            <li>I simply love it...</li>
            <li>it does take most of your hairs out but not all.</li>
            <li>(Eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them, but it will take some time.)  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s winter, I just let it all grow out so that the Epilator can get more hairs.  </li>
            <li>I also know that I&#x27;ll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter.  </li>
            <li>Now I just make sure that I don&#x27;t leave it in one place for more than a couple of seconds.  </li>
            <li>I sit on a towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs.   </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was able to remove the hair from about 2 inches of my leg</li>
            <li>I love relaxing with a glass of wine and using my Satinelle.  </li>
            <li>I recommended because I am a satisfied owner.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Not as good as wax in pulling hair, but does its work pretty well</li>
            <li>The epilator is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love the feeling of your skin after you use it, very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great!    </li>
            <li>At this price, I&#x27;ll be buying another as a back-up, and Amazon.com got it to me very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, easy to operate, and travels well.  </li>
            <li>I know some people who can go for weeks without epilating again, but I feel most comfortable touching up quickly every three days or so.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>It has two settings, but I only use it on the first one and it works marvelously.  </li>
            <li>The epilator works fine and the price says it all.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t do fine hairs and does not pull out all hairs at the root, some hairs may clip off and not be unrooted, and when you try to go over the area again it won&#x27;t get those hairs.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Still, you have to admit that is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is fabulous for removing unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li>Smooth for days.  </li>
            <li>to stay smooth</li>
            <li>Its hassel free.</li>
            <li>But the price of the Philips was so cheap that I decided to give it a shot</li>
            <li>The epilator is easy to use and extremely cool.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;D (no more embarrassing blotches or chemical</li>
            <li>First it was ok</li>
            <li>I went from the \\&quot;whirling coil of death\\&quot; aka Epilady original that felt like sticking your leg in a wasp nest to a then-Norelco Satinelle fixed-head epilator, which I affectionally dubbed \\&quot;spinning disks of doom\\&quot; because it hurt a *lot</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I would like to say I have retired my razor all together, but I still use it probably once a week or so for a clean up.  </li>
            <li>But since this is much cheaper, why would you pay more?</li>
            <li>thankfully I had an overall good experience with this one.</li>
            <li>This model is good enough.</li>
            <li>My first epilator was Epilady, which was fine.</li>
            <li>Its very efficient and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The epilator is much more financially and environmentally better than having to wax for me.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty nice work, I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li>The more you use it, the less it hurts, so don&#x27;t give up, it gets better!</li>
            <li>However, I got the majority of the hairs and after the first time, I realized that I&#x27;m never going to have to shave again!  </li>
            <li>So far, I feel it was a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>it is sooo worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price and pain.  </li>
            <li>After many years of use, my old Satinelle died.  </li>
            <li>Worth its price.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled in a good way, not only about the very good price but also the quality, soft skin in the most delicate areas for weeks, is worth the pain (which decreases everytime, and you will get less hair everytime as well).</li>
            <li>At first it was able to get all the hair and leave my leg silky smooth, however, (3 months later)</li>
            <li>(One reviewer commented that hers broke right away.</li>
            <li>I bought this item specifically because the voltage is listed as 120-240 on the norelco website indicating that if you had the right adapter you could use it in Ireland.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the shaver option, since you don&#x27;t need to shave anymore after using the epilator(Your hair gets more and more finer and you will use it less often).  </li>
            <li>I found the results of epilating to be very comparable to those of waxing - the most marked difference is the cost!</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for nearly 7 years now, never an issue and easy to operate.</li>
            <li>The first time on the legs might take a little time but after that 5-10 minutes every two weeks and my legs remain nice and smooth with no stubble.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it occasionally (1-3 times per month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did end up liking it once I got through my first session with it.  </li>
            <li>For first time epilators it does hurt and this is coming from someone who has been manually plucking her underarm hairs since she was 17.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank You So Much!</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li>This is my first introduction to an epilator</li>
            <li>I have used Epilady products for 18 years, but have always winced at the expense of the products (in all fairness, my first Epilady, which cost over $100, lasted 10 years).  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for people with not a lot of hair, because it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair the first time so you need to repeat again...</li>
            <li>My first epilator was a Norelco Satinelle, and I adored it.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I ever tried</li>
            <li>Now that I have an epilator, I really don&#x27;t have to worry about my legs anymore!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, (I let the hair grow for 5 days or so)</li>
            <li>;-)    </li>
            <li>should these fail and Philips epilators go out of production.  :D</li>
            <li>The combination has worked very well for me and freed me from the razor forever!</li>
            <li>I thought I should replace it with a more recent product.</li>
            <li>Does not need any more fancy technology, this is just enough for the purpose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user</li>
            <li>This is my first &lt;br /&gt;epilator</li>
            <li>used it for the first time on my legs.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much to pull those out!  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with razors anymore, and it only took 20 min out of my Saturday.  </li>
            <li>My wife is satisfied with the epilator overall.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>pretty much stopped working.  </li>
            <li>but I must say the Philips epilator is as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent and has so far proven quite effective at getting those coarse dark hairs that have an unfortunate tendency to crop up with more frequency</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and not messy at all, plus I don&#x27;t cut myself the way I do while shaving.</li>
            <li>I was really pleased after using my new epilator, it definitely exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li>The amount of money I&#x27;ve saved not buying new cartridges for my razors has more than made up for the initial expense, which really isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>It is so painless, I used to do only below knees but ventured to do thighs and arms, and it worked fine.    </li>
            <li>the older we get!  </li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair is very stubborn and will not disappear over night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using an epilady for years, so I didn&#x27;t have much hair to pull.  </li>
            <li>Re-growth came in much finer and scarcer, and that trend continued over time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very distressed when my trusty Norelco disappeared during a household move.</li>
            <li>But if you stick it out, it&#x27;s so much easier after that.    </li>
            <li>But when I used Satinelle the results lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>If you do legs you should get into the habit of using the exfoliating pad because it does seem to cause much ingrowing of hairs.</li>
            <li>The result really lasts about 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Left my legs smooth for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>really hurts...</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>and I really like it now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The top (dark purple section) pops off and you run it under hot water.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first use may be a bit of a shock but repeated use proves to be easy with little irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s worth a try, especially if it&#x27;s your first time.</li>
            <li>I was trying for something different and finally I found out a good product which is completely worth of the amount that I spent.</li>
            <li>love this little guy &amp; highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The razor head is not very good, but as an epilator is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had (I had two before, which didn&#x27;t last too long).</li>
            <li>Braun Silkepil series are better than the regular one in terms of red spots.</li>
            <li>Overall it is worthy to buy.</li>
            <li>It hurts but it&#x27;s quick and with longer lasting results than shaving.</li>
            <li>: Our skin is more sensitive in some areas, so if you choose to epilate around the bikini line, be careful.  </li>
            <li>I want to get at least 2 more for girlfriends as gifts!</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I used it nearly everywhere - legs, arms, underarms, bikini, and there are some places that it does still smart to use.  </li>
            <li>I love this little machine.</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave it 4 stars is that it has more trouble gripping the hair after you&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li>It takes a few uses to get used to many hairs being plucked simultaneously-roughly 4 times.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The time I&#x27;ve saved is worth it, I only have to go over my problem areas once a week up to once</li>
            <li>This little machine is one my favorite new appliances.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this compares to other epilators, but I think it does a pretty good job for the price.</li>
            <li>This is the third epilator product that I&#x27;ve used and it works even better than some other units that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s one of my more useful purchases in the recent past.</li>
            <li>Eventually, I was able to get most of the thick, dark hairs off of my legs.   </li>
            <li>I cannot live without this item and it was sorely missed until I got my new one.</li>
            <li>It is about as quick as shaving (though I just dry shave).    </li>
            <li>This is much better than I expected, especially at this price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this on my legs since that last time only because most of the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back</li>
            <li>I was so discouraged and didn&#x27;t want to waste any more money, so fixed my old Epilady myself and used it for another 10 years or so.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I have such fair skin that I need to remove the hair either by epilating or waxing since you can still see the folicle after shaving!</li>
            <li>No more dropping the razor because my hands were slippery with hair conditioner (works much better than shaving cream, for those of you still stuck with shaving).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This epilator costs less than one trip to the salon, provides equally fine results.</li>
            <li>And, as others here have said, the second time is easier than the first.</li>
            <li>Plus, I keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax, I only need to pull 5-10 each time.     </li>
            <li>I bought my first Satinelle back in the &#x27;90&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t shaved my legs since.</li>
            <li>I thought it hurt like hell when I used it the first time, but I&#x27;ve since learned that if you do it right after you get out of the shower, it hurts a LOT less.</li>
            <li>I saw the price on this unit and figured I&#x27;d give it a try, and lo and behold my trusty SS epilator head fit this base unit as well and works like new at less than half the original Satinelle Sensitive price (if it *were* available, which it isn&#x27;t), so I&#x27;m a happy camper.  </li>
            <li>The only thing, which is very minor, is that the motor seems to be a bit too loud, and the head comes off too easily.  </li>
            <li>had a Braun epilady before and this is better because I have less red spots on my legs after using this.</li>
            <li>It plucks nearly every hair out.  </li>
            <li>I say nearly because I&#x27;ll have</li>
            <li>It really takes very short hair.</li>
            <li>It has really thinned out my hair, and some of it hasn&#x27;t even grown back at all in over a week.</li>
            <li>(unless you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but I have no trouble whatsovever with this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend it over the Epilady, especially since it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I was elated to discover that Amazon sold these as my old one came from Canada.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Braun silk epil since I was 15, an old one that after 10 years was still working.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember what I did to make the head come off when I didn&#x27;t mean it to, but it didn&#x27;t come off while removing hair, so I think it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product I had not heard much about.  </li>
            <li>skin is far too sensitive and the results from those methods are nightmarish o_O</li>
            <li>If you are prone to ingrown hairs I highly recommend making use of the loofah and \\&quot;bump patrol after shave intensive treatment\\&quot;, a gentleman&#x27;s shaving product designed to treat and prevent facial razor bumps and ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>makes me wonder if it might be worth just going to have it all waxed off instead), the thing broke down...</li>
            <li>It is a little time consuming until you&#x27;ve completely transitioned, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I used to use the \\&quot;silk epil\\&quot; braun epilator (similar item) for years, and I was looking for somthing new alike, when I found this satinelle epilator</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to epilate again for at least a month easily.</li>
            <li>I think with any epilator, it&#x27;s gonna hurt, but since the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast, and comes back finer</li>
            <li>I just made sure to go slowly, pausing every few inches, and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as I could get it.  </li>
            <li>Cons: Does not effectively remove fine hair.    </li>
            <li>Just as expected, this product works well and was shipped to me fast</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that even with occasional use (about 6 times a year), about 25% of my hair has stopped growing back, and what has come back is much finer.</li>
            <li>It barely pulled hairs on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I personally would not get it anywhere near my pubic area without novocain.    </li>
            <li>Even when the hairs start to grow back, the are soft.  </li>
            <li>Its not painful as some expressed, but the usual pinch when you start off.</li>
            <li>the few minutes of pain worth it???  </li>
            <li>It hurts much less than my old Epilady and cleaning is much easier.</li>
            <li>Waxing, even with at-home kits, quickly becomes a pricey (and messy) venture and in salons, forgetaboutit!</li>
            <li>Hair grows in stages, so as soon as you get rid of some hairs, several more grow in behind them.  </li>
            <li>Right after epilating, sometimes I do experience a little irritation but, unlike razor burn, it goes away after just a short time.     </li>
            <li>a little the first time, but after that the pain goes away.</li>
            <li>With the exception of the few reviews I read online, I was pretty much in the dark.  </li>
            <li>If the pain gets to much just stop for a moment, wait for the irritation to die down, then go at it again.</li>
            <li>so I hope it last me as much as the other one last.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m not doing it right</li>
            <li>Sure, the first time was really, really, really painful  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s less expensive than the \\&quot;other brand\\&quot;), and now I&#x27;m back to silky-soft, smooth skin in the most low-maintenance way possible.</li>
            <li>I could still feel little hairs, but I have found that if I shave the little leftovers, my legs stay smooth for a week or so.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the same epilator (older model) since 1999, and it  fell down and broke</li>

            <li> This product has met our needs and is very good.  </li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I think that this is a great product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m am really happy that I decided to give the epilator a try.  </li>
            <li> and i am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The results have been better than I could have imagined!!   </li>
            <li> I have to say I am very happy with this kind of epilator, it works as good as the one I had before</li>
            <li> and I am already seeing amazing results!   </li>
            <li> This is a good product and I am happy with the service from Amazon, though it got delayed to reach me, but was informed by Amazon.</li>
            <li> :o)  </li>
            <li> :o) &lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, the epilator is a good product, once you get the hang of using it.  </li>
            <li> This is a good item when compared with its price.</li>
            <li> Because of this, it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week.  </li>
            <li> Before I bought it, I did a lot of research and saw a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will be a good choice to have two toys at the price of one!  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very glad I did it.</li>
            <li> The first use hurts INCREDIBLY!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see there&#x27;s some competition in this marketplace!</li>
            <li> and I love that!</li>
            <li> and it feels like your legs would feel two days afer shaving kind of thing.</li>
            <li> It is nice to not have to shave every day anymore.  </li>
            <li> Also, that it does a superior job on those \\&quot;more sensitive\\&quot; areas with coarser hair than on the legs.</li>
            <li> It does hurt, but not the kind of pain a woman can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> Cost and time effective.</li>
            <li> I bought the an older model and was very happy with it and by mistake ordered a panasonic one.  </li>
            <li> From the experience of more than 10 years, this is the best method to keep smooth legs if you cannot afford laser hair removal all over your body.&lt;br /&gt;However, Using this machine is NOT painless procedure for first couple of rounds.</li>
            <li> You have to experiment to determine what is most effective maximizing uprooting more hairs and minizing the pain.    </li>
            <li> I have an exceptionally quick growth of hair (or, so I feel!!).</li>
            <li> In the products defense, I don&#x27;t think there is a way to make this device easy to use and leg friendly (God forbid you try it anywhere else, ladies!!).  </li>
            <li> However, after an underarm waxing, I have been able to use this epilator on my underarms</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did ^_^</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> For many years I was shaving my legs to get rid of hairs.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> love this product</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t have irritated skin for more than a minute after you stop using the epilator.</li>
            <li> Generally I am satisfied with its performance</li>
            <li> &quot; it pulled more hairs then the Satinelle Epilator.  </li>
            <li> okay, I don&#x27;t have to shave every three days anymore.</li>
            <li> Just use some lotion after you epilate and your skin stays so smooth!    </li>
            <li> I have never been one to shave my arms, but I used this on them, and am so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s cheaper than \\&quot;tend skin\\&quot; and works better than \\&quot;bikini zone\\&quot; .</li>
            <li> I simply love it...</li>
            <li> it does take most of your hairs out but not all.</li>
            <li> (Eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them, but it will take some time.)  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s winter, I just let it all grow out so that the Epilator can get more hairs.  </li>
            <li> I also know that I&#x27;ll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter.  </li>
            <li> Now I just make sure that I don&#x27;t leave it in one place for more than a couple of seconds.  </li>
            <li> I sit on a towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs.   </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was able to remove the hair from about 2 inches of my leg</li>
            <li> I love relaxing with a glass of wine and using my Satinelle.  </li>
            <li> I recommended because I am a satisfied owner.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Not as good as wax in pulling hair, but does its work pretty well</li>
            <li> The epilator is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love the feeling of your skin after you use it, very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s great!    </li>
            <li> At this price, I&#x27;ll be buying another as a back-up, and Amazon.com got it to me very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight, easy to operate, and travels well.  </li>
            <li> I know some people who can go for weeks without epilating again, but I feel most comfortable touching up quickly every three days or so.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> It has two settings, but I only use it on the first one and it works marvelously.  </li>
            <li> The epilator works fine and the price says it all.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t do fine hairs and does not pull out all hairs at the root, some hairs may clip off and not be unrooted, and when you try to go over the area again it won&#x27;t get those hairs.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Still, you have to admit that is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This is fabulous for removing unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li> Smooth for days.  </li>
            <li> to stay smooth</li>
            <li> Its hassel free.</li>
            <li> But the price of the Philips was so cheap that I decided to give it a shot</li>
            <li> The epilator is easy to use and extremely cool.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;D (no more embarrassing blotches or chemical</li>
            <li> First it was ok</li>
            <li> I went from the \\&quot;whirling coil of death\\&quot; aka Epilady original that felt like sticking your leg in a wasp nest to a then-Norelco Satinelle fixed-head epilator, which I affectionally dubbed \\&quot;spinning disks of doom\\&quot; because it hurt a *lot</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I would like to say I have retired my razor all together, but I still use it probably once a week or so for a clean up.  </li>
            <li> But since this is much cheaper, why would you pay more?</li>
            <li> thankfully I had an overall good experience with this one.</li>
            <li> This model is good enough.</li>
            <li> My first epilator was Epilady, which was fine.</li>
            <li> Its very efficient and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The epilator is much more financially and environmentally better than having to wax for me.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty nice work, I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li> The more you use it, the less it hurts, so don&#x27;t give up, it gets better!</li>
            <li> However, I got the majority of the hairs and after the first time, I realized that I&#x27;m never going to have to shave again!  </li>
            <li> So far, I feel it was a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> it is sooo worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price and pain.  </li>
            <li> After many years of use, my old Satinelle died.  </li>
            <li> Worth its price.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled in a good way, not only about the very good price but also the quality, soft skin in the most delicate areas for weeks, is worth the pain (which decreases everytime, and you will get less hair everytime as well).</li>
            <li> At first it was able to get all the hair and leave my leg silky smooth, however, (3 months later)</li>
            <li> (One reviewer commented that hers broke right away.</li>
            <li> I bought this item specifically because the voltage is listed as 120-240 on the norelco website indicating that if you had the right adapter you could use it in Ireland.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the shaver option, since you don&#x27;t need to shave anymore after using the epilator(Your hair gets more and more finer and you will use it less often).  </li>
            <li> I found the results of epilating to be very comparable to those of waxing - the most marked difference is the cost!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for nearly 7 years now, never an issue and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> The first time on the legs might take a little time but after that 5-10 minutes every two weeks and my legs remain nice and smooth with no stubble.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it occasionally (1-3 times per month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did end up liking it once I got through my first session with it.  </li>
            <li> For first time epilators it does hurt and this is coming from someone who has been manually plucking her underarm hairs since she was 17.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank You So Much!</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li> This is my first introduction to an epilator</li>
            <li> I have used Epilady products for 18 years, but have always winced at the expense of the products (in all fairness, my first Epilady, which cost over $100, lasted 10 years).  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for people with not a lot of hair, because it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair the first time so you need to repeat again...</li>
            <li> My first epilator was a Norelco Satinelle, and I adored it.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I ever tried</li>
            <li> Now that I have an epilator, I really don&#x27;t have to worry about my legs anymore!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, (I let the hair grow for 5 days or so)</li>
            <li> ;-)    </li>
            <li> should these fail and Philips epilators go out of production.  :D</li>
            <li> The combination has worked very well for me and freed me from the razor forever!</li>
            <li> I thought I should replace it with a more recent product.</li>
            <li> Does not need any more fancy technology, this is just enough for the purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user</li>
            <li> This is my first &lt;br /&gt;epilator</li>
            <li> used it for the first time on my legs.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much to pull those out!  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with razors anymore, and it only took 20 min out of my Saturday.  </li>
            <li> My wife is satisfied with the epilator overall.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> pretty much stopped working.  </li>
            <li> but I must say the Philips epilator is as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and has so far proven quite effective at getting those coarse dark hairs that have an unfortunate tendency to crop up with more frequency</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and not messy at all, plus I don&#x27;t cut myself the way I do while shaving.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased after using my new epilator, it definitely exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> The amount of money I&#x27;ve saved not buying new cartridges for my razors has more than made up for the initial expense, which really isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> It is so painless, I used to do only below knees but ventured to do thighs and arms, and it worked fine.    </li>
            <li> the older we get!  </li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair is very stubborn and will not disappear over night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using an epilady for years, so I didn&#x27;t have much hair to pull.  </li>
            <li> Re-growth came in much finer and scarcer, and that trend continued over time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very distressed when my trusty Norelco disappeared during a household move.</li>
            <li> But if you stick it out, it&#x27;s so much easier after that.    </li>
            <li> But when I used Satinelle the results lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> If you do legs you should get into the habit of using the exfoliating pad because it does seem to cause much ingrowing of hairs.</li>
            <li> The result really lasts about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Left my legs smooth for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> really hurts...</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> and I really like it now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The top (dark purple section) pops off and you run it under hot water.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first use may be a bit of a shock but repeated use proves to be easy with little irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s worth a try, especially if it&#x27;s your first time.</li>
            <li> I was trying for something different and finally I found out a good product which is completely worth of the amount that I spent.</li>
            <li> love this little guy &amp; highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The razor head is not very good, but as an epilator is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had (I had two before, which didn&#x27;t last too long).</li>
            <li> Braun Silkepil series are better than the regular one in terms of red spots.</li>
            <li> Overall it is worthy to buy.</li>
            <li> It hurts but it&#x27;s quick and with longer lasting results than shaving.</li>
            <li> : Our skin is more sensitive in some areas, so if you choose to epilate around the bikini line, be careful.  </li>
            <li> I want to get at least 2 more for girlfriends as gifts!</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I used it nearly everywhere - legs, arms, underarms, bikini, and there are some places that it does still smart to use.  </li>
            <li> I love this little machine.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it 4 stars is that it has more trouble gripping the hair after you&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> It takes a few uses to get used to many hairs being plucked simultaneously-roughly 4 times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The time I&#x27;ve saved is worth it, I only have to go over my problem areas once a week up to once</li>
            <li> This little machine is one my favorite new appliances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this compares to other epilators, but I think it does a pretty good job for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the third epilator product that I&#x27;ve used and it works even better than some other units that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of my more useful purchases in the recent past.</li>
            <li> Eventually, I was able to get most of the thick, dark hairs off of my legs.   </li>
            <li> I cannot live without this item and it was sorely missed until I got my new one.</li>
            <li> It is about as quick as shaving (though I just dry shave).    </li>
            <li> This is much better than I expected, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this on my legs since that last time only because most of the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back</li>
            <li> I was so discouraged and didn&#x27;t want to waste any more money, so fixed my old Epilady myself and used it for another 10 years or so.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have such fair skin that I need to remove the hair either by epilating or waxing since you can still see the folicle after shaving!</li>
            <li> No more dropping the razor because my hands were slippery with hair conditioner (works much better than shaving cream, for those of you still stuck with shaving).&lt;br</li>
            <li> This epilator costs less than one trip to the salon, provides equally fine results.</li>
            <li> And, as others here have said, the second time is easier than the first.</li>
            <li> Plus, I keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax, I only need to pull 5-10 each time.     </li>
            <li> I bought my first Satinelle back in the &#x27;90&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t shaved my legs since.</li>
            <li> I thought it hurt like hell when I used it the first time, but I&#x27;ve since learned that if you do it right after you get out of the shower, it hurts a LOT less.</li>
            <li> I saw the price on this unit and figured I&#x27;d give it a try, and lo and behold my trusty SS epilator head fit this base unit as well and works like new at less than half the original Satinelle Sensitive price (if it *were* available, which it isn&#x27;t), so I&#x27;m a happy camper.  </li>
            <li> The only thing, which is very minor, is that the motor seems to be a bit too loud, and the head comes off too easily.  </li>
            <li> had a Braun epilady before and this is better because I have less red spots on my legs after using this.</li>
            <li> It plucks nearly every hair out.  </li>
            <li> I say nearly because I&#x27;ll have</li>
            <li> It really takes very short hair.</li>
            <li> It has really thinned out my hair, and some of it hasn&#x27;t even grown back at all in over a week.</li>
            <li> (unless you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but I have no trouble whatsovever with this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend it over the Epilady, especially since it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was elated to discover that Amazon sold these as my old one came from Canada.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Braun silk epil since I was 15, an old one that after 10 years was still working.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember what I did to make the head come off when I didn&#x27;t mean it to, but it didn&#x27;t come off while removing hair, so I think it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product I had not heard much about.  </li>
            <li> skin is far too sensitive and the results from those methods are nightmarish o_O</li>
            <li> If you are prone to ingrown hairs I highly recommend making use of the loofah and \\&quot;bump patrol after shave intensive treatment\\&quot;, a gentleman&#x27;s shaving product designed to treat and prevent facial razor bumps and ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> makes me wonder if it might be worth just going to have it all waxed off instead), the thing broke down...</li>
            <li> It is a little time consuming until you&#x27;ve completely transitioned, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I used to use the \\&quot;silk epil\\&quot; braun epilator (similar item) for years, and I was looking for somthing new alike, when I found this satinelle epilator</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to epilate again for at least a month easily.</li>
            <li> I think with any epilator, it&#x27;s gonna hurt, but since the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast, and comes back finer</li>
            <li> I just made sure to go slowly, pausing every few inches, and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as I could get it.  </li>
            <li> Cons: Does not effectively remove fine hair.    </li>
            <li> Just as expected, this product works well and was shipped to me fast</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that even with occasional use (about 6 times a year), about 25% of my hair has stopped growing back, and what has come back is much finer.</li>
            <li> It barely pulled hairs on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I personally would not get it anywhere near my pubic area without novocain.    </li>
            <li> Even when the hairs start to grow back, the are soft.  </li>
            <li> Its not painful as some expressed, but the usual pinch when you start off.</li>
            <li> the few minutes of pain worth it???  </li>
            <li> It hurts much less than my old Epilady and cleaning is much easier.</li>
            <li> Waxing, even with at-home kits, quickly becomes a pricey (and messy) venture and in salons, forgetaboutit!</li>
            <li> Hair grows in stages, so as soon as you get rid of some hairs, several more grow in behind them.  </li>
            <li> Right after epilating, sometimes I do experience a little irritation but, unlike razor burn, it goes away after just a short time.     </li>
            <li> a little the first time, but after that the pain goes away.</li>
            <li> With the exception of the few reviews I read online, I was pretty much in the dark.  </li>
            <li> If the pain gets to much just stop for a moment, wait for the irritation to die down, then go at it again.</li>
            <li> so I hope it last me as much as the other one last.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m not doing it right</li>
            <li> Sure, the first time was really, really, really painful  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less expensive than the \\&quot;other brand\\&quot;), and now I&#x27;m back to silky-soft, smooth skin in the most low-maintenance way possible.</li>
            <li> I could still feel little hairs, but I have found that if I shave the little leftovers, my legs stay smooth for a week or so.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the same epilator (older model) since 1999, and it  fell down and broke</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my legs and it didn&#x27;t hurt that much at all--much less than waxing, and a lot easier and cheaper too!  </li>
            <li> However, when new hair grows in, I am finding that they are thinner and blonde instead of dark brown.  </li>
            <li> There must be slower growing hairs that don&#x27;t quite get long enough for the epilator to \\&quot;grab,\\&quot; but still stay away for awhile after shaving.</li>
            <li> I used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to grow long enough to be waxed.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely more painful than shaving at first, however, after a week of using this product, I can go several days without epilating, and I used to have to shave my legs everyday to keep the stubble at bay.</li>
            <li> I dropped the Satinelle Sensitive once too often and a plastic cog inside broke in half, so the discs wouldn&#x27;t spin.  </li>
            <li> To minimize pain from hair removal, get a wax, then use the dry loufa that comes with the epilator afterwards, and a week to 10 days later when you start to get sparse growth use the epilator.</li>
            <li> When the motor on that one tanked, I bought a Satinelle Sensitive with interchangeable head and little rubber nubbly things that were supposed to make epilating not hurt...</li>
            <li> It removed hair, and is painless (I am a long time epilator user, though).</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;d been using it for just a few weeks, my legs, underarms, and binkini area became baby soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> but I found after several uses the pain is minimal, if at all.  </li>
            <li> You do need to allow extra time, but I feel you gain that time back with less shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, especially on very small hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure what i can do to make that go away, i&#x27;ve tried scrubbing myself down, and lotioning, didn&#x27;t really seem to help.  </li>
            <li> Not to be gross, but I have thick, dark black underarm hair, and this epilator really helps!</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who has at least a little pain tolerance and really wants to get rid of hair</li>
            <li> Worked okay, but too painful</li>
            <li> Start with the lower legs, which are the least sensitive, and afterwards use  baby oil or an unscented moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Well... I expected miracles from the product, which I guess is unreasonable.   </li>
            <li> There is no much pain.</li>
            <li> Epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a few days</li>
            <li> about a five minute job if you&#x27;re being careful, two if you&#x27;re in a hurry)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even discovered that I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting every little hair on my legs, the hair that&#x27;s grown back is less noticable.</li>
            <li> The first time using this is PAINFUL, but the results last a long time.  </li>
            <li> (No running water, shaving cream, razors, warming wax, or any of those other time consuming bothers)</li>
            <li> Other than that it works</li>
            <li> I bought this item after testing other methods (home waxing, depilatory cremes, razor shaving and electric shaving) for over a year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that problem in other areas though.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using it for the first time (and it hurts....</li>
            <li> I read from other people they didn&#x27;t have to shave for weeks</li>
            <li> so I read the instructions very carefully.  </li>
            <li> epilator comes with a little loufa pad to help reduce ingrown hairs (I&#x27;ve only had a few and the pad fixes them) and a little cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li> It finally got to the point that it is not effective in removing hair, so I bought this one.  </li>
            <li> Cleanup&#x27;s a breeze, it comes with an electric razor head, a round loofah sponge for facial use, and two small brushes for help in cleaning up.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt and it cut down my shaving (under arms, legs, and bikini) for every three days that i used to do it before to twice a month.</li>
            <li> I bought another famous brand of epilator but was very unhappy with its performance: It didn&#x27;t find all the \\&quot;little</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s LESS.</li>
            <li> But still, the shock is a lot less than waxing)     </li>
            <li> The Norelco product works just as well and was less than half the cost of the equivalent Epilady.  </li>
            <li> * less</li>
            <li> I went from shaving twice a week to once every week and a half.  </li>
            <li> and there is a lot less hair to deal with.</li>
            <li> Basically, it works about as well as waxing,but without the mess.</li>
            <li> As long as you take it slow</li>
            <li> it still leaves little bumps on my legs.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I got little sores everywhere</li>
            <li> In fact, sometimes it tickles a little.  </li>
            <li> That being said, subsequent uses are far less painful.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all my hair out, but it gets 95% of it after a few passes.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re a waste of money for anyone who can tolerate epilating already.  </li>
            <li> All-in-all, if you hate shaving like me and are willing to take a little pain (not nearly as much pain as razor burn), get this product.</li>
            <li> Yes, some little blonde hairs grow back, but they are ALL thinner and much less painful.  </li>
            <li> The pain during epilating is really very less.</li>
            <li> It does not clean small ones.</li>
            <li> No more shaving</li>
            <li> every day, I just epilate every few days and it looks like I&#x27;m born without hair!    </li>
            <li> No more trips to the salon, no more razors, no more shaving cream, no more wax, no more hassle!</li>
            <li> It is not very good for underarms though.</li>
            <li> Even the tough ones came off after a few passes.</li>
            <li> With my German \\&quot;hairitage\\&quot;, blade shaving just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  </li>
            <li> I managed to give myself a burn from going too slowly with the rotating \\&quot;blade\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> No more razor nicks!</li>
            <li> No more balancing on one leg in the shower!</li>
            <li> No more hairy arms for me!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I don&#x27;t know how anyone can use this thing.  </li>
            <li> so I used my old SS head on her base and it worked.  </li>
            <li> Also, this skin irritation isn&#x27;t so bad as long as you keep up with the exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> Although it hurts like crazy on my face, I still like that I don&#x27;t have to mess with wax or strips.</li>
            <li> (I have very thick hairs).  </li>
            <li> I bought this epilator three years ago because I was tired of plucking my underarm hairs with a pair of tweezers.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I couldn&#x27;t find another Norelco.</li>
            <li> How frustrating is that?!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think is less painful than using wax.</li>
            <li> Subsiquent uses are less painful.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s less painful than waxing.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little painful --</li>
            <li> I bought an epilator because I was tired of shaving my legs and waxing was just too expensive for me.  </li>
            <li> delivery from Amazon came 3 days in advance and I was not surprised but Shocked!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no more painful then waxing.</li>
            <li> Sadly Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry it at the moment.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this item for the price!</li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs once, and yes it was painful.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit it is painful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts a bit painful</li>
            <li> Epilators are not for everyone, they can get painful.</li>
            <li> It was painful.  </li>
            <li> For anyone sick of shaving and who want&#x27;s to save some money on waxing I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5, since it took Amazon 1 month to send it to me:(</li>
            <li> very disappointing.</li>
            <li> or if the product is worthless.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving my legs  </li>
            <li> That was a bad move!.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> This was a terrible product.  </li>
            <li> Just awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product and use it occasionally (1-3 times per month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well on facial hair and leg hair.  I tried it on my underarms once, that was a NO GO.  However, after an underarm waxing, I have been able to use this epilator on my underarms very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product has met our needs and is very good.  &lt;br /&gt;I like it and would recommend it too others too.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My delivery from Amazon came 3 days in advance and I was not surprised but Shocked!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Keep it up! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Well... I expected miracles from the product, which I guess is unreasonable.   I did end up liking it once I got through my first session with it.  I will give some advice though.  The first use hurts INCREDIBLY!!!  That being said, subsequent uses are far less painful.  I was prepared from the reviews of others that the Epilator does not remove every hair the way shaving does.  I cannot stress this enough.  You need to go over the surface multiple times.  Also, this skin irritation isn&#x27;t so bad as long as you keep up with the exfoliating.  I would like to say I have retired my razor all together, but I still use it probably once a week or so for a clean up.  All in all, the epilator is a good product, once you get the hang of using it.  You do need to allow extra time, but I feel you gain that time back with less shaving in the shower.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month or so.  So far, I feel it was a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 4 years now  still perfect   I definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for nearly 7 years now, never an issue and easy to operate. the parts can be removed and i&#x27;ve even washed them in water, no corrosion whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator three years ago because I was tired of plucking my underarm hairs with a pair of tweezers.  I prefer plucking over shaving because the results last longer and I did not get ingrown hairs like I did when shaving.  I still have this epilator and it still works fantastically.  For first time epilators it does hurt and this is coming from someone who has been manually plucking her underarm hairs since she was 17.  It takes a few uses to get used to many hairs being plucked simultaneously-roughly 4 times.  It has two settings, but I only use it on the first one and it works marvelously.  It plucks nearly every hair out.  I say nearly because I&#x27;ll have one or two the tweezer heads don&#x27;t catch.  Still, you have to admit that is fantastic.  I only epilate once a week and over time the hairs have gotten thinner and reduced in number.  I tried it on my legs once, and yes it was painful.  I haven&#x27;t used this on my legs since that last time only because most of the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to buy an epilator, I would get this one.  Sadly Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry it at the moment.  If you find it elsewhere though, do get it.  I love this little machine.</li>
            <li> I personally have problems with chemicals and waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is far too sensitive and the results from those methods are nightmarish o_O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a last ditch effort and I&#x27;m so glad I did ^_^ it&#x27;s the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first use may be a bit of a shock but repeated use proves to be easy with little irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used it on my neck and face area with excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not however think this is a cure all ... hair is very stubborn and will not disappear over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time I&#x27;ve saved is worth it, I only have to go over my problem areas once a week up to once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now only the hair is gone and my skin is saved &#x3D;D (no more embarrassing blotches or chemical burns)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You So Much!</li>
            <li> The epilator did what I bought it for. It removed hair, and is painless (I am a long time epilator user, though). It is so painless, I used to do only below knees but ventured to do thighs and arms, and it worked fine.    Even the tough ones came off after a few passes. My first epilator was Epilady, which was fine. It died after 3-4 years, and I bought Emjoi&#x27;s ForeverFree spending over $100, but it didn&#x27;t work at all. I was so discouraged and didn&#x27;t want to waste any more money, so fixed my old Epilady myself and used it for another 10 years or so. It finally got to the point that it is not effective in removing hair, so I bought this one.  This is worth the money spent.  The only thing, which is very minor, is that the motor seems to be a bit too loud, and the head comes off too easily.  I can&#x27;t remember what I did to make the head come off when I didn&#x27;t mean it to, but it didn&#x27;t come off while removing hair, so I think it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, this product works well and was shipped to me fast</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It is definitely more painful than shaving at first, however, after a week of using this product, I can go several days without epilating, and I used to have to shave my legs everyday to keep the stubble at bay. It is a little time consuming until you&#x27;ve completely transitioned, but it&#x27;s worth it. And I&#x27;m going to save a ton of $$ on shaving cream and I feel really good about not having to discard the metal cans they come in!</li>
            <li> I have used epilators for years. Its not painful as some expressed, but the usual pinch when you start off. Its very efficient and easy to clean. I hope it lasts me a long time. The last one I got was also a phillips one from UK.     I am not giving it 5 stars as I dont know its longevity and havent tried the shaver part of it.</li>
            <li> This little machine is one my favorite new appliances. I haven&#x27;t bothered with a razor in months and I&#x27;m completely happy with the results. I&#x27;ve used it on my legs, arms, underarms, bikini area, and my face. Although it hurts like crazy on my face, I still like that I don&#x27;t have to mess with wax or strips. I&#x27;ve even discovered that I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting every little hair on my legs, the hair that&#x27;s grown back is less noticable. The amount of money I&#x27;ve saved not buying new cartridges for my razors has more than made up for the initial expense, which really isn&#x27;t much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love this little guy &amp; highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It really takes very short hair. It is not very good for underarms though. &lt;br /&gt;I had a Braun epilady before and this is better because I have less red spots on my legs after using this. Braun Silkepil series are better than the regular one in terms of red spots. But since this is much cheaper, why would you pay more?</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.I love this product.For many years I was shaving my legs to get rid of hairs.First it was ok but eventually I started getting razor burns and I lost the smoothness of my legs.I was totally upset.I was trying for something different and finally I found out a good product which is completely worth of the amount that I spent.It is not so costly .It is simply awesome.I love it.There is no much pain.The pain during epilating is really very less.Anybody can bear it.I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I am happy with the service from Amazon, though it got delayed to reach me, but was informed by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not to be gross, but I have thick, dark black underarm hair, and this epilator really helps! I thought it hurt like hell when I used it the first time, but I&#x27;ve since learned that if you do it right after you get out of the shower, it hurts a LOT less. It has really thinned out my hair, and some of it hasn&#x27;t even grown back at all in over a week. It&#x27;s pretty amazing. I haven&#x27;t used it on my legs yet, but that&#x27;s next! Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this compares to other epilators, but I think it does a pretty good job for the price. It doesn&#x27;t get all my hair out, but it gets 95% of it after a few passes. I think with any epilator, it&#x27;s gonna hurt, but since the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast, and comes back finer it is sooo worth it. The more you use it, the less it hurts, so don&#x27;t give up, it gets better! Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that even with occasional use (about 6 times a year), about 25% of my hair has stopped growing back, and what has come back is much finer. Unfortunately, I have such fair skin that I need to remove the hair either by epilating or waxing since you can still see the folicle after shaving! The epilator is much more financially and environmentally better than having to wax for me.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I love this product it&#x27;s awsome. I have to admit it is painful a little the first time, but after that the pain goes away. you&#x27;ll love the feeling of your skin after you use it, very smooth and clean. I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS!    The only prep you need is to plug it in and brush the hair out from under the wheel occasionally. (No running water, shaving cream, razors, warming wax, or any of those other time consuming bothers) Yes, it stings. It&#x27;s no more painful then waxing. In fact, it&#x27;s LESS. If the pain gets to much just stop for a moment, wait for the irritation to die down, then go at it again. As long as you take it slow you won&#x27;t have irritated skin for more than a minute after you stop using the epilator. (unless you have really sensitive skin. But still, the shock is a lot less than waxing)     It doesn&#x27;t pinch, just takes the hair. Missed some? No problem! Run over the area again and catch what was missed! Can&#x27;t do that with waxing.     Not only that, but for the price of one upper lip wax you can buy an epilator that will pay for itself after one use! No more trips to the salon, no more razors, no more shaving cream, no more wax, no more hassle!</li>
            <li> This is my first introduction to an epilator and I have mixed feelings about this one. It seems like some of the hairs just get cut off and it feels like your legs would feel two days afer shaving kind of thing. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m not doing it right or if the product is worthless. It&#x27;s pretty cheap so I think it&#x27;s worth a try, especially if it&#x27;s your first time.</li>
            <li> This is a good item when compared with its price. Generally I am satisfied with its performance but I want to mention a con. It does not clean small ones. Overall it is worthy to buy.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous for removing unwanted hair.  This makes Nad&#x27;s hair remover strips and waxing absolete.  It works so well and is easier than shaving.  The first time on the legs might take a little time but after that 5-10 minutes every two weeks and my legs remain nice and smooth with no stubble. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  It barely pulled hairs on my legs.  I have been using an epilady for years, so I didn&#x27;t have much hair to pull.  Even when it was \\&quot;on its last leg\\&quot; it pulled more hairs then the Satinelle Epilator.  I sent this product back.</li>
            <li> I have used Epilady products for 18 years, but have always winced at the expense of the products (in all fairness, my first Epilady, which cost over $100, lasted 10 years).  The Norelco product works just as well and was less than half the cost of the equivalent Epilady.  I&#x27;m glad to see there&#x27;s some competition in this marketplace!</li>
            <li> The epilator works fine and the price says it all. I recommend it for people with not a lot of hair, because it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair the first time so you need to repeat again...That&#x27;s why I gave it four stars not five...Other than that it works okay, I don&#x27;t have to shave every three days anymore.</li>
            <li> My first epilator was a Norelco Satinelle, and I adored it. After I&#x27;d been using it for just a few weeks, my legs, underarms, and binkini area became baby soft and touchable. Re-growth came in much finer and scarcer, and that trend continued over time. No more razor nicks! No more balancing on one leg in the shower! No more dropping the razor because my hands were slippery with hair conditioner (works much better than shaving cream, for those of you still stuck with shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very distressed when my trusty Norelco disappeared during a household move. To make matters worse, I couldn&#x27;t find another Norelco. I bought another famous brand of epilator but was very unhappy with its performance: It didn&#x27;t find all the \\&quot;little hairs\\&quot; that the Norelco did, and it often broke hairs instead of extracting them -- so I had stubble even though I was epilating. How frustrating is that?!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally bought another Norelco Satinelle (bonus: it&#x27;s less expensive than the \\&quot;other brand\\&quot;), and now I&#x27;m back to silky-soft, smooth skin in the most low-maintenance way possible. (One reviewer commented that hers broke right away. I would suggest that if that happens, just exchange it for another. Even Mercedes-Benz gets a lemon off the factory floor now and then!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never be without a Norelco epilator again.</li>
            <li> I used to use the \\&quot;silk epil\\&quot; braun epilator (similar item) for years, and I was looking for somthing new alike, when I found this satinelle epilator I was thrilled in a good way, not only about the very good price but also the quality, soft skin in the most delicate areas for weeks, is worth the pain (which decreases everytime, and you will get less hair everytime as well). GREAT DEAL, FORGET SHAVING!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I ever tried and it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ts a bit painful but I think is less painful than using wax. I think that this is a great product. It does a pretty nice work, I have a very sensitive skin but I have no trouble whatsovever with this product.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving my legs  My hair turns to stubble an hour after I shave and it&#x27;s so uncomfortable.  Now that I have an epilator, I really don&#x27;t have to worry about my legs anymore!  No more shaving every day, I just epilate every few days and it looks like I&#x27;m born without hair!    Sure, the first time was really, really, really painful  But if you stick it out, it&#x27;s so much easier after that.    I personally would not get it anywhere near my pubic area without novocain.    Although, I use it on my underarms and I don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving under there either! Just use some lotion after you epilate and your skin stays so smooth!    I know some people who can go for weeks without epilating again, but I feel most comfortable touching up quickly every three days or so.    The reason why I gave it 4 stars is that it has more trouble gripping the hair after you&#x27;ve been using it for a few months. Other than that, it&#x27;s great!    All-in-all, if you hate shaving like me and are willing to take a little pain (not nearly as much pain as razor burn), get this product.</li>
            <li> The first time using this is PAINFUL, but the results last a long time.  It is nice to not have to shave every day anymore.  The first time I used it, (I let the hair grow for 5 days or so) I could still feel little hairs, but I have found that if I shave the little leftovers, my legs stay smooth for a week or so.  There must be slower growing hairs that don&#x27;t quite get long enough for the epilator to \\&quot;grab,\\&quot; but still stay away for awhile after shaving. Subsiquent uses are less painful.  Watch TV or something to keep you mind occupied. I have never been one to shave my arms, but I used this on them, and am so pleased with the results.  Smooth for days.  Even when the hairs start to grow back, the are soft.  No more hairy arms for me!</li>
            <li> With my German \\&quot;hairitage\\&quot;, blade shaving just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  ;-)    Epilating was the answer for me back in the 90s.  I went from the \\&quot;whirling coil of death\\&quot; aka Epilady original that felt like sticking your leg in a wasp nest to a then-Norelco Satinelle fixed-head epilator, which I affectionally dubbed \\&quot;spinning disks of doom\\&quot; because it hurt a *lot* less but I used it nearly everywhere - legs, arms, underarms, bikini, and there are some places that it does still smart to use.  When the motor on that one tanked, I bought a Satinelle Sensitive with interchangeable head and little rubber nubbly things that were supposed to make epilating not hurt... I think by then for me it didn&#x27;t matter, and eventually one by one the rubber nubblies fell off anyway so they&#x27;re a waste of money for anyone who can tolerate epilating already.  I dropped the Satinelle Sensitive once too often and a plastic cog inside broke in half, so the discs wouldn&#x27;t spin.  I tried my daughter&#x27;s Philips epilator but for some reason it didn&#x27;t catch the shorter finer hairs as well as mine had - the discs on mine seemed to be tighter or something.  However, the heads were interchangeable (!!! YAY !!!) so I used my old SS head on her base and it worked.  I saw the price on this unit and figured I&#x27;d give it a try, and lo and behold my trusty SS epilator head fit this base unit as well and works like new at less than half the original Satinelle Sensitive price (if it *were* available, which it isn&#x27;t), so I&#x27;m a happy camper.  :D  At this price, I&#x27;ll be buying another as a back-up, and Amazon.com got it to me very quickly.  I also figure I have enough parts to put together another one should these fail and Philips epilators go out of production.  :D</li>
            <li> Epilators are not for everyone, they can get painful. thankfully I had an overall good experience with this one. At first it was able to get all the hair and leave my leg silky smooth, however, (3 months later) it still leaves little bumps on my legs. i&#x27;m not sure what i can do to make that go away, i&#x27;ve tried scrubbing myself down, and lotioning, didn&#x27;t really seem to help.  so now all it can do is to epilate the hair, but does not leave silky legs. kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after testing other methods (home waxing, depilatory cremes, razor shaving and electric shaving) for over a year. I found the results of epilating to be very comparable to those of waxing - the most marked difference is the cost! Waxing, even with at-home kits, quickly becomes a pricey (and messy) venture and in salons, forgetaboutit! This epilator costs less than one trip to the salon, provides equally fine results. Also, that it does a superior job on those \\&quot;more sensitive\\&quot; areas with coarser hair than on the legs. If you are prone to ingrown hairs I highly recommend making use of the loofah and \\&quot;bump patrol after shave intensive treatment\\&quot;, a gentleman&#x27;s shaving product designed to treat and prevent facial razor bumps and ingrown hairs (it&#x27;s cheaper than \\&quot;tend skin\\&quot; and works better than \\&quot;bikini zone\\&quot; . The combination has worked very well for me and freed me from the razor forever! Yay! All hail the epilator!</li>
            <li> Vine desde Chile a USA... deje mi depiladora en Chile.. y encontre esta en Amazon! Es realmente excelente.. pequena.. la puedo llevar a todos lados!! y lo mejor de todo a buen precio!!.. No me arrepiento!!!! Llego en menos de 5 dias!!!!... Todo bien!! Gracias! Amazon!</li>
            <li> I owned an Epilady before, which worked well for 10 years. I thought I should replace it with a more recent product. After a lot of research, I bought this one. It works very well, especially on very small hair. It hurts much less than my old Epilady and cleaning is much easier. I recommend it over the Epilady, especially since it is much cheaper. I haven&#x27;t used the shaver option, since you don&#x27;t need to shave anymore after using the epilator(Your hair gets more and more finer and you will use it less often).  I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5, since it took Amazon 1 month to send it to me:(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great accessory to have. It&#x27;s quick and not messy at all, plus I don&#x27;t cut myself the way I do while shaving. I have an exceptionally quick growth of hair (or, so I feel!!). But when I used Satinelle the results lasted much longer. I simply love it...it&#x27;s one of my more useful purchases in the recent past.</li>
            <li> This is the third epilator product that I&#x27;ve used and it works even better than some other units that cost twice as much. It is lightweight, easy to operate, and travels well.  The shaver head is an added bonus. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this item for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this item specifically because the voltage is listed as 120-240 on the norelco website indicating that if you had the right adapter you could use it in Ireland.  I travel alot and wanted it for that purpose however, the transformer to plug it in is only 120.  I assume I would likely ruin it if I tried to use it in Europe even though i have the proper adapters.</li>
            <li> Duele un monton! Hay que pasarlo varias veces, varias veces a la semana, porque si no no funciona. Pero el precio esta bien, y es mejor que estarse rasurando. Vellos salen mas debiles y mas claros</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t do fine hairs and does not pull out all hairs at the root, some hairs may clip off and not be unrooted, and when you try to go over the area again it won&#x27;t get those hairs. Basically, it works about as well as waxing,but without the mess. It is about as quick as shaving (though I just dry shave).    Now, let&#x27;s talk a bit about the pain. It does hurt, but not the kind of pain a woman can&#x27;t handle. I use it for armpits and bikini area. It hurts but it&#x27;s quick and with longer lasting results than shaving. If you do legs you should get into the habit of using the exfoliating pad because it does seem to cause much ingrowing of hairs. I don&#x27;t have that problem in other areas though.    There is a learning curve in determining how close to the skin you go, if varies the type of hair and skin. You have to experiment to determine what is most effective maximizing uprooting more hairs and minizing the pain.    Definitely worth the price and pain.  When is this thing going to be stocked again? I want to get at least 2 more for girlfriends as gifts!</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips epilator which I bought in Europe for 10 years. It just died then I was looking for replacement. I did not know Norelco is a part of Philips, so it took time to find this one.&lt;br /&gt;This is almost same with the one I had. Does not need any more fancy technology, this is just enough for the purpose. From the experience of more than 10 years, this is the best method to keep smooth legs if you cannot afford laser hair removal all over your body.&lt;br /&gt;However, Using this machine is NOT painless procedure for first couple of rounds. If you have just kept shaving your legs, the more expensive models have some feature to reduce pain. If you do waxing, you must have used to pain. This model is good enough.</li>
            <li> Worked okay, but too painful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am really happy that I decided to give the epilator a try.  I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews.  I went from shaving twice a week to once every week and a half.  Each time you use the epilator the time between usage will increase.  I recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever tried.The result really lasts about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> This is much better than I expected, especially at this price. Left my legs smooth for a couple of weeks. (although it missed some areas so I had to follow up with a razor). Yes, it is a little painful -- but I think it&#x27;s less painful than waxing.  Start with the lower legs, which are the least sensitive, and afterwards use  baby oil or an unscented moisturizer. And, as others here have said, the second time is easier than the first.</li>
            <li> this products works wonders. There is some pain in the beginning but once you get use to it, you won&#x27;t feel a thing. it does take most of your hairs out but not all. i use it for my underarms and i am happy with the results. i would buy it again!!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the reviews I had read and decided to give it a try.  Note: I&#x27;m a first time user so I read the instructions very carefully.  Unfortunately, after using it for the first time (and it hurts....really hurts...makes me wonder if it might be worth just going to have it all waxed off instead), the thing broke down...pretty much stopped working.  very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This was a terrible product.  I got little sores everywhere I used it.  believe me, I will only use it once.  Wish I had my money back.</li>
            <li> I read from other people they didn&#x27;t have to shave for weeks but I &lt;br /&gt;find to stay smooth I need it once a week. This is my first &lt;br /&gt;epilator so maybe with time it will be different.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Got out all hairs from legs, underarms, and even the bikini area at the same time, because the pain was tolerable.</li>
            <li> Not as good as wax in pulling hair, but does its work pretty well and it&#x27;s always there when I need it.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I bought an epilator because I was tired of shaving my legs and waxing was just too expensive for me.  I&#x27;ve had my epilator for several weeks now and I am already seeing amazing results!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time on my legs.  I&#x27;m not going to lie...It was painful.  I just made sure to go slowly, pausing every few inches, and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as I could get it.  Eventually, I was able to get most of the thick, dark hairs off of my legs.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Please know that the Epilator is not an immediate \\&quot;cure-all\\&quot;.  Hair grows in stages, so as soon as you get rid of some hairs, several more grow in behind them.  (Eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them, but it will take some time.)  Because of this, it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week.  Since it&#x27;s winter, I just let it all grow out so that the Epilator can get more hairs.  However, when new hair grows in, I am finding that they are thinner and blonde instead of dark brown.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much to pull those out!  I also know that I&#x27;ll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter.  My legs are smoother and I don&#x27;t get razor burn!  Right after epilating, sometimes I do experience a little irritation but, unlike razor burn, it goes away after just a short time.     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another neat thing is that, unlike waxing, the Epilator can grab the teeny tiny almost invisible hairs.  This gives your skin a smoother feel and it gets hairs at the beginning stages of growth!  I used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to grow long enough to be waxed.  Now, I get smoother skin just about whenever I want to!     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product I had not heard much about.  With the exception of the few reviews I read online, I was pretty much in the dark.  I went ahead and went for it, then realized that this thing paid for itself in about two weeks!  Not onlyhave I epilated my legs, I have also used it under my arms, on my upper lip, and on my bikini line.  The results have been better than I could have imagined!!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Again, I&#x27;m not going to lie...OUCH!!!!!  Epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a few days (I have very thick hairs).  However, I got the majority of the hairs and after the first time, I realized that I&#x27;m never going to have to shave again!  Yes, some little blonde hairs grow back, but they are ALL thinner and much less painful.  In fact, sometimes it tickles a little.  :o)  I epilate there once to twice a week (about a five minute job if you&#x27;re being careful, two if you&#x27;re in a hurry) and I have smoother underarms!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used to get my upper lip waxed about once a month.  Now I just epilate.  It hurts, but just for a second.  Plus, I keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax, I only need to pull 5-10 each time.     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**A word of caution: Our skin is more sensitive in some areas, so if you choose to epilate around the bikini line, be careful.  I managed to give myself a burn from going too slowly with the rotating \\&quot;blade\\&quot;.  Now I just make sure that I don&#x27;t leave it in one place for more than a couple of seconds.  If I miss some hairs, I come back another time to get them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This epilator comes with a little loufa pad to help reduce ingrown hairs (I&#x27;ve only had a few and the pad fixes them) and a little cleaning brush.  The epilator is very easy to clean.  The top (dark purple section) pops off and you run it under hot water.  When it dries, you put it back on.  **Note, the epilator does not store hairs inside of it.  When they are pulled out, they tend to either gather on the front of the epilator (I stop periodically to wipe them off) or they go flying.  I sit on a towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope this review was helpful to you with your decision about buying an epilator.  I am very satisfied with this product and I recommend it to anyone who has at least a little pain tolerance and really wants to get rid of hair stop having to shave all the time.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Are the few minutes of pain worth it???  ABSOLUTELY!  :o) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The epilator is easy to use and extremely cool.Its hassel free.I love it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I don&#x27;t know how anyone can use this thing.  I have had tatoos, waxing, and dental fillings, and I would rather have any and all of those before I ever try this product again.  It feels like an electric shock and continuous pulling of duct tape on your skin.  Just awful.  In the products defense, I don&#x27;t think there is a way to make this device easy to use and leg friendly (God forbid you try it anywhere else, ladies!!).  I was able to remove the hair from about 2 inches of my leg and I gave into the pain and went back to shaving.  Yikes.</li>
            <li> After many years of use, my old Satinelle died.  I was elated to discover that Amazon sold these as my old one came from Canada.  This is so much better than waxing!!!  I read about the pain complaints but I found after several uses the pain is minimal, if at all.  I love relaxing with a glass of wine and using my Satinelle.  I cannot live without this item and it was sorely missed until I got my new one.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same epilator (older model) since 1999, and it  fell down and broke so I decide to replace it for this one. I have to say I am very happy with this kind of epilator, it works as good as the one I had before so I hope it last me as much as the other one last. It doesn&#x27;t hurt and it cut down my shaving (under arms, legs, and bikini) for every three days that i used to do it before to twice a month. I recommended because I am a satisfied owner.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased after using my new epilator, it definitely exceeded my expectations and I don&#x27;t need to epilate again for at least a month easily. I had a Braun epilator earlier I had used for years which was much more expensive but I must say the Philips epilator is as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun silk epil since I was 15, an old one that after 10 years was still working. Last march I moved to the States leaving my epilator in Italy so I was looking for another Braun. But the price of the Philips was so cheap that I decided to give it a shot and I&#x27;m very glad I did it. The epilator is perfectly functional and if you don&#x27;t mind not having a bag or a cap for it it&#x27;s fine. I dind&#x27;t use the razor attachment yet but I&#x27;m sure it will be a good choice to have two toys at the price of one!  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> For anyone sick of shaving and who want&#x27;s to save some money on waxing I recommend this product. I bought my first Satinelle back in the &#x27;90&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t shaved my legs since. The cord wore out so I just got this replacement. To minimize pain from hair removal, get a wax, then use the dry loufa that comes with the epilator afterwards, and a week to 10 days later when you start to get sparse growth use the epilator. Stay on it after that. I used to wait 30 days to epilate now I do it about every 10 days - that way it just \\&quot;tingles\\&quot; vs. hurting and there is a lot less hair to deal with.</li>
            <li> After reading some of these reviews, I was expected it to hurt a lot, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;ve used it on my legs and it didn&#x27;t hurt that much at all--much less than waxing, and a lot easier and cheaper too!  I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with razors anymore, and it only took 20 min out of my Saturday.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> Pros: Cost and time effective. Worth its price.  Cons: Does not effectively remove fine hair.    My wife is satisfied with the epilator overall.</li>
            <li> Before I bought it, I did a lot of research and saw a lot of good reviews. I bought it and I really like it now. I don&#x27;t shave anymore and I love that!</li>
            <li> I bought the an older model and was very happy with it and by mistake ordered a panasonic one.  That was a bad move!.  I recently decided to purchase this one and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and has so far proven quite effective at getting those coarse dark hairs that have an unfortunate tendency to crop up with more frequency the older we get!  Cleanup&#x27;s a breeze, it comes with an electric razor head, a round loofah sponge for facial use, and two small brushes for help in cleaning up.  Since the time I have had it I have not had to resort to weekly shaving.  I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this epilator for years and it&#x27;s still performing perfectly. The razor head is not very good, but as an epilator is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had (I had two before, which didn&#x27;t last too long).</li>
