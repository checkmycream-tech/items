            <li> It is just as expected. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> My razor was having some troubles w/ the heads. They kept popping up out of place. I bought this and a new internal pivot piece and its like a new razor (I&#x27;d replaced the blades about 7 months prior). Cheaper than buying a whole new razor though I was tempted because the newest razors looks really cool! Great Buy! Works Like Almost New!</li>
            <li> Works a-ok,husband says shaver like new again</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Wrong Shaver Holder!  But it was returned without a bit of trouble!</li>
            <li> Razor Head Holder works perfect. Just like the original. Very pleased. I highly recommend this product. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> it worked for my model</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i need.</li>
            <li> Arrived on Dec 4, 2014, ahead of promised day (Dec 23,2014 - Jan 12, 2015) . Perfect fit, just like the original.&lt;br /&gt;It did not came with cleaning brush as shown on website.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement!  Very speedy delivery also.  Total satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Part is exact Phillips Norelco cutter carriage for my Speed XL 8260XLrazor(3 blades per head).  Has hinge and spring so just pop off old one and put in noew one and drop in blades and use you urrent blade retainer.&lt;br /&gt;The head carriage is plastic and after 9 years the pins that hold the blade retainer holes wore down and they un hinge and come out of the carriage.  For $15 it was worth a new one that is nice and tight.  These razors sell from over $250 on Amazon.  I get them after Xmas at Target for $66.  Have many new spares since the Speed XL series is much more rugged than the crayy architech series.&lt;br /&gt;Unit doe snOT come with cleaning brush shown.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said for $15, if you keep your batteries excercized, it will last another 10 years.  I have some that still work from the 1970&#x27;s with all stainless parts like the Santa sled inthe old commercials.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco makes the best Razors. Treat your self to new blades when replacing the head carriage. You use this everyday on your face fo a few bucks to treat yourself is worth it.  Your wife probably spends twice as much just shaving her legs!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>

            <li> A new head allowed me to continue hold the new cutters securely.  The packaging was more than adequate for the overseas shipping.</li>
            <li> a necessary pricey frail piece of equipment. third one i&#x27;ve had to purchase as they dont seem to hole up as well as i would expect</li>
            <li> perfect fit.works great.</li>
            <li> This is a hard part to find. It was exactly what I ordered. It fit perfectly when I relaxed the old shaver head.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> My new replacement shaver head for my Norelco 8240XL works like new again.&lt;br /&gt;It flexes with the contour of your face and doesn&#x27;t get stuck like the old on.&lt;br /&gt;So now I Have a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Excellent. OEM and fits well, saved me the cost of a new razor.</li>
