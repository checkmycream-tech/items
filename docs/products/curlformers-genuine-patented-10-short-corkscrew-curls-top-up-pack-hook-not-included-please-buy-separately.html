            <li> Easy to use.  Well made.  It takes while for hair to dry.  Must buy curlformer hook separately which makes these curls pretty expensive.  Not comfortable to sleep on.</li>
            <li> Love love these, tried one other kind cheaper, but these are the best even if they are more,</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and needed something to give body without all the damage and frizz. I have found it. I love love love this product!!! Thanks curlformers!!!</li>
            <li> first time using item</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure they are great, but my tween used them once and now i find them all over the house and never in her hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised. It works. It&#x27;s a lot of work. But it works.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My nieces hair is beautiful. Curls just like it says.  I love it! Came very quickly. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Much easier to use with more consistent curl than the knock off version I bought on Amazon.  Spiral curls turn out nice and shiny on blow dried natural hair with a spritz of setting lotion.  I&#x27;ve used them only twice and had no problems at all.</li>
            <li> The Curlformers short &amp; narrow are great for short hair. They do not slip when you sleep on them.</li>
            <li> Very handy! Love it. I just thought it was longer, but the pink and orange ones are longer. Even so, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I saw this on youtube being used by another person.  I was curious so I decided to try it.  I have only tried to use once and it seemed to do more pulling of my hair than anything.  I am African American and at the time I had just washed my hair.  I am sure if that was what caused the pulling or not.  I will try it again though.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I cant use them it didn&#x27;t come with everything that is needed.. I really don&#x27;t want to pay for a kit but I guess I will have too.</li>
            <li> Wow! Curls curls curls! I cannot believe how curly my hair was. The best part about these curlers is that they are so so easy to put in. I am a complete mess with curlers. I&#x27;ve never been good at them. These were easy to do, even without much for mirrors!  I sat on my bed with a small folding mirror and put them in. Remarkable!  I put myself under a soft hood dryer for 20 minutes or so and my curls were divine!  Everyone commented how beautiful they were!</li>
            <li> I use daily conditioner and then I apply the curlformers in wet hair to stretch my natural hair and give it a blowout look the next day.  I don&#x27;t have to use heat to get that effect so I am very happy.  I have recommended to my sisters and niece.</li>
            <li> I got two packages of the short &amp; narrow Curlformers. This is the second time I&#x27;ve used them. They are a nice product. Easier to sleep on than regular curlers. So far I&#x27;ve done the all over the head procedure, but think I&#x27;m going to try just a couple for a more subtle look istead of he whole head. They are nice for a different look.</li>
            <li> The curlformers work as described. It takes practice putting tem in but there are videos on youtube that show how it is done.</li>
            <li> These work well be patient and use little sections and dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> they r simple to use and the curls last for 4-5 days! convent for any type of hair type. so easy!</li>
            <li> Love curlformers!  Once I got the hang of it, I get great results every time I use them.</li>
