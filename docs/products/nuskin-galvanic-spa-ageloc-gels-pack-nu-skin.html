            <li>I need to order more.  </li>
            <li>This product is designed for use with the Galvanic Spa home unit, which I love.</li>
            <li>I know I am always suspect of products that claim to make you look more youthful  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Now, I have a wonderful sponsor distributor and he helps me to grow this business properly.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it is what I had expect it had to be .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the ageloc  gels</li>
            <li>I love my Nuskin machine.</li>
            <li>I believe there are some safe gels used in galvanic treatments in Europe.  </li>
            <li>She said it did not work for her because she had many clients.  </li>
            <li>She said it would work best for personal use.  </li>
            <li>I would like to buy more of this product</li>
            <li>The additional products make it even better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My face looked so much better, and I got compliments to prove it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the results, I&#x27;ve heard about and after trying it the first time, I was impressed with the results, I bought an additional pack, I use it pretty much before a special occasion, as it noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes well over reasonable good</li>
            <li>Great product, wife lv it and keeps coming back for more</li>
            <li>I would love NuSkin to clean up the ingredients in these products.</li>
            <li>My skin looked clean and after using the Spa for about two weeks I looked so much better.  </li>
            <li>Moved and losty machine so bought another and am just as happy as I was the last time!!</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>Please note that a Distributor Sponsor ID# is not a promo code and it should not be posted and used freely, it&#x27;s against Nu Skin&#x27;s policy for a reason.  </li>
            <li>These gels give youth back to my face and the price was a great deal for me.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li>What if you like using Nu Skin products so much that you want to get more involved in the business?  </li>
            <li>I love them very muchm</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, shipment was quick.</li>
            <li>My skin looks younger and more healthy.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the product since it worked for me and am enjoying the result.</li>
            <li>Every time I think I can go without my Galvanic Spa, I look in the mirror a couple of weeks later and notice a difference...not for the better!  </li>
            <li>It really does help in diminishing fine lines and pores and tightening your skin.</li>
            <li>This little gel did a great job to moisturize my skin and reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Per recommendation of a nutrition counselor, I have found success; AND it arrives in a couple days.  </li>
            <li>It take alittle time and it is worth it.</li>
            <li>REALLY !  </li>
            <li>order more Gel, and get back to work!  </li>
            <li>From my first treatment  with the Galvanic Spa I could see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Of course this is the beginning of the clean and clear skin.</li>
            <li>This Product combined with the Galvanic Tool REALLY works.</li>
            <li>but it seems to give my skin much needed moisture.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m ready to use them.</li>
            <li>the results are really there!&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>While I really like the concept I do not like the chemical makeup of the gels.  </li>
            <li>NuSkin really works.  </li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>In an effort to locate a more natural alternative, I found a compatible conductive facial gel made by a company called Jellen that is also organic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it and results are instant.</li>
            <li>love it so much, although only use twice a month, but still come out as expected!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m right now ordering my next supply of the Galvanic Spa ageloc Gels</li>
            <li>The day after doing a treatment, my face is BEYOND soft.</li>
            <li>The only setback is you have to do it religiously and result take a while but worth it.</li>
            <li>My family and friends tells me that I look younger and also notice that my sagging face has a little lift specially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46 years old female.</li>

            <li> Please don&#x27;t throw it away lightly by signing up with a wrong distributor who we already know is unethical.</li>
            <li> I use the Face ageloc Spa for years and it&#x27;s the basic of my few times a week regimen.</li>
            <li> In less than ten minutes You can look at least 5 years younger.</li>
            <li> but they are really expensive , thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how small and expensive these are, but holy crap they work great!</li>
            <li> Slight but noticeable improvement</li>
            <li> I ve been using this galvanic gel for half year.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> No more wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> And ,of course, ordering from Amazon is less expensive!</li>
            <li> My little secret!!!</li>
            <li> I found the shipment fees way to expensive for this item, as this coul be send in protective envelope, like this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but I just can&#x27;t stop to using it.</li>
            <li> but they are expensive.  </li>
            <li> but they are so very expensive!</li>

            <li> This Product combined with the Galvanic Tool REALLY works. In less than ten minutes You can look at least 5 years younger. REALLY !  And with continued use it is permanent. No Kidding !</li>
            <li> Per recommendation of a nutrition counselor, I have found success; AND it arrives in a couple days.  I&#x27;m right now ordering my next supply of the Galvanic Spa ageloc Gels pack Nu Skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 months now. I haven&#x27;t seen big change in my skin but it seems to give my skin much needed moisture.</li>
            <li> Have used the galvanic spa before and totally loved what it did for my lines and texture ofy face. Moved and losty machine so bought another and am just as happy as I was the last time!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for quite a few years.  With consistency, it truly works.  But can&#x27;t do a hit or miss, or the difference will not be noticed.  It will make your skin absorb whatever products you use, deeper and with more intensity. The day after doing a treatment, my face is BEYOND soft.</li>
            <li> Great product, wife lv it and keeps coming back for more</li>
            <li> Fabulous. It really works.  I need to order more.  You have to use it with the Galvanic Spa II Instrument to see results.  When used with the ampules it lifts and rejuvenates the face and neck.</li>
            <li> A gift for my wife - she has been using this for about a year and loves it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived before it was scheduled to arrive.  It was also in perfect shape and I saved about 40% of what I would have paid retail.</li>
            <li> This product is designed for use with the Galvanic Spa home unit, which I love. I tend to use it more sparingly than the directions call for with good coverage and good use.</li>
            <li> I know I am always suspect of products that claim to make you look more youthful  But this system works.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results, I&#x27;ve heard about and after trying it the first time, I was impressed with the results, I bought an additional pack, I use it pretty much before a special occasion, as it noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product!</li>
            <li> So happy with how fast this came!!!..I ordered the Nuskin galvanic Spa ageLoc Gels pack..now I&#x27;m ready to use them.</li>
            <li> Every time I think I can go without my Galvanic Spa, I look in the mirror a couple of weeks later and notice a difference...not for the better!  So I get on Amazon.com, order more Gel, and get back to work!  Shortly thereafter, people start asking me if I&#x27;m having \\&quot;work\\&quot; done.  Teehee!  My little secret!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product</li>
            <li> Please note that a Distributor Sponsor ID# is not a promo code and it should not be posted and used freely, it&#x27;s against Nu Skin&#x27;s policy for a reason.  Would you want someone unethical to be your business partner?  What if you like using Nu Skin products so much that you want to get more involved in the business?  If you use a Sponsor ID# from someone you don&#x27;t know, unbeknownst to you, you would get stuck with that business partner.  I had bought and used this product about 5 years ago from a beauty salon and I love it. Now, I have a wonderful sponsor distributor and he helps me to grow this business properly.  This might be the business opportunity that you&#x27;ve been looking for and it may become your future and retirement income one day.  Please don&#x27;t throw it away lightly by signing up with a wrong distributor who we already know is unethical.</li>
            <li> great product! great supplier! great price! Annnnnddd the results are really there!&lt;br /&gt;Try it for a month and see the difference!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting so many boxes at once , happy to used them again .</li>
            <li> It was a gift, and my niece loves this product, how can I argue with that! she is happy! !</li>
            <li> Slight but noticeable improvement if used 2-3 times a week. I use 1/2 of each ampule each time. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I love it because it is what I had expect it had to be .&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful gel. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been a nuskin user since 2009. It really does help in diminishing fine lines and pores and tightening your skin.</li>
            <li> No more wrinkles!  It works...but you have to put the time and effort into it.  It&#x27;s worth it and results are instant.</li>
            <li> Service provided as stated.</li>
            <li> Good Product. but just OK!</li>
            <li> Received product timely manner. Product and expiration date very good.</li>

            <li> I been using this product with Galvanic Spa II for a year and been very pleased with the results.  My family and friends tells me that I look younger and also notice that my sagging face has a little lift specially around my eyes. I would highly recommend the product since it worked for me and am enjoying the result. The only setback is you have to do it religiously and result take a while but worth it. Save a lot of money on surgery too.</li>
            <li> Love the ageloc  gels</li>
            <li> I love my Nuskin machine. These gels give youth back to my face and the price was a great deal for me.</li>
            <li> love nuskin and the way it keeps my face youthful!</li>
            <li> I found the shipment fees way to expensive for this item, as this coul be send in protective envelope, like this the fees could be low.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, shipment was quick.</li>
            <li> I ve been using this galvanic gel for half year. It&#x27;s expensive but I just can&#x27;t stop to using it. This little gel did a great job to moisturize my skin and reduce wrinkles. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> While I really like the concept I do not like the chemical makeup of the gels.  I used the GS for sometime before I looked into the ingredients.  I will not put parabens or propylene glycol on my skin.  I now use the GS with aloe vera gel and hyaluronic acid.  I believe there are some safe gels used in galvanic treatments in Europe.  I would love NuSkin to clean up the ingredients in these products.</li>
            <li> I bought the orginal kit from someone who had bought it for thier business to give clients a facial treatment.  She said it did not work for her because she had many clients.  She said it would work best for personal use.  She sold me her kit, without instructions.  Can I get instruction on how to use this product correctly?  I don&#x27;t know if I am using properly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Works great!!!  For my skin.</li>
            <li> I love them very muchm but they are expensive.  I would like to buy more of this product but they are really expensive , thank you very much.</li>
            <li> NuSkin really works.  The additional products make it even better.  You do have to commit to a skin regimen and stick to it.  And ,of course, ordering from Amazon is less expensive!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a while. I love it. My skin looks younger and more healthy. It take alittle time and it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Been recommended as a good product!  works very well. love it so much, although only use twice a month, but still come out as expected!</li>
            <li> good product, it&#x27;s very useful, I like it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how small and expensive these are, but holy crap they work great!</li>
            <li> Of course this is the beginning of the clean and clear skin. I use the Face ageloc Spa for years and it&#x27;s the basic of my few times a week regimen. I would not know what to do anymore without it.Take care of yourselves ladies and gentlemen,</li>
            <li> delivered as promised</li>
            <li> From my first treatment  with the Galvanic Spa I could see a difference in my skin.  My skin looked clean and after using the Spa for about two weeks I looked so much better.  The lines in my skin seemed to soften and my eye brows were raised.  The skin around my neck was tighter.  My face looked so much better, and I got compliments to prove it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I&#x27;m 46 years old female. I&#x27;m using mary kay repair set daily and  I do NuSkin Galvanic Spa weekly. Also I do mary kay microdermabrasion twice a week. I&#x27;m happy with my results. Thank you for  excellent service.</li>
            <li> Well received by purchase. Makes well over reasonable good</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for years. My wife has been very happy with the product and the price</li>
