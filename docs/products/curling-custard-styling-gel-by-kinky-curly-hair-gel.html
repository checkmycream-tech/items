            <li>This product is a great product for Wash N. Go&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>now i use my home made flax seed gel for it, but it was very effective.</li>
            <li>great stuff good buy.</li>
            <li>Impressive, but I need more of it for my hair</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have FINE curly hair though I can see this being a great product!</li>
            <li>This product is good for keeping the frizz off the curls.</li>
            <li>and it is a good combination.  </li>
            <li>The product smells good but doesn&#x27;t overpower my perfume.</li>
            <li>To be fair to the product, I adjusted my rating accordingly.</li>
            <li>and it smells good</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading that it was a good product for my curl type, 3a.</li>
            <li>The best gel (of many many I have used with my curly hair$</li>
            <li>But, if KCCCG will continue to deliver perfect curls, then I&#x27;m willing to overlook it!</li>
            <li>I make my own gel now and get just as good results.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and works great, I suggest giving it a shot if you are looking for a good hold without the crunch &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Oh, how I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love this!  </li>
            <li>I freaking love this stuff!</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>By the way this is a very good product; nothing is worth the target!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It feels so light on my hair and smells really great.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>and this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and could not wait to use it because i heard so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>I have nice ringlets all around.</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the product relies exclusively on the humectants for moisture and softness (there are no oils in it), the amount of water in the atmosphere will determine whether or not this product moisturizes effectively.  </li>
            <li>It had a nice shine</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product...works great for hair like mine!</li>
            <li>However, once I gently scrunched the gel film on my hair, I had the most wonderful results!</li>
            <li>It works great with my twist outs and if used over the right products and not used in excess gives me a nice defined wash and</li>
            <li>I ended up making my own flaxseed gel that had MUCH better results</li>
            <li>With that said; this is the best product I have found that is ALL natural and holds MY hair.  </li>
            <li>The best gel I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and dont have to use a lot to get the results you want!</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it!</li>
            <li>&quot;  and my curls look awesome and they are soft and look shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Very good product for natural hair!!</li>
            <li>I decided to try this after reading all of the great reviews, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not working for me.</li>
            <li>and it works just fine for me!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair with spiral curls, I have to say every time I use Kinky curls my hair looks amazing</li>
            <li>I LOVE Kinky-Curly&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I seen so many review on this product on you tube, so I went and tried this curling custard.  </li>
            <li>but I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that compares to it.  </li>
            <li>Love the product - do not like using a tub - wish there was a pump version.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>when you take it out of your cap you can&#x27;t be sure what your curls will look like-</li>
            <li>Wish I could have given this a better review.</li>
            <li>it takes away all my volume at the top.</li>
            <li>since then it&#x27;s more evenly spread out.</li>
            <li>The better.</li>
            <li>It does stay a bit crunchy even after releasing the gel cast, which I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>But the ingredients are top notch.</li>
            <li>They all lay claim to be able to stretch out the hair and hold the curl for a day.....</li>
            <li>I just dont see how thats healthy for anyones hair.  </li>
            <li>When you get to the top of the hair you may have to redampen with a spritz of water from a spray bottle before continuing the gel and grease</li>
            <li>and they range from 3a to 4a in hair texture and all love it.</li>
            <li>The product is sticky and it did not hold the shape of my curls for more than a day.</li>
            <li>Great smell (like sugar cookies!), kinda gross consistency, but it does the job!</li>
            <li>OMG, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>worked better that any primer</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way that it makes my hair look after styling with it.</li>
            <li>curl), but someone else might need more product depending on their hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many curling products for my permed hair and by far&lt;</li>
            <li>Love this product for wash and go.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST product I&#x27;ve found for my moderately curly hair.</li>
            <li>I used it for a wash and go recently and got wonderful results.</li>
            <li>but once you figure out how much works for your hair, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>but my friend recommended this gel &amp; I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>More, about a quarter size, and I&#x27;ve got bounce with the definition.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t keep combing and touching your hair all day, you&#x27;ll lose curl/definition/waves with any product the more you touch your hair</li>
            <li>and I find it works better on my wavy curvy hair than any &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; type productI have tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One day a friend recommended Kinky Curly, and it did just what I wanted it to do and have received many compliments on my hair since.</li>
            <li>My curls are more defined, frizz-free and shiny and it delivered on its promise to elongate them.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way my curls are defined and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have taken a modified version that is much shorter, but I am having great results.  </li>
            <li>Have never been so satisfied in my life.</li>
            <li>However, she defers to the eco styler from which she says she gets better definition of curls on her 4a/4b type hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this product is that I no longer *have* to do braid out or twist outs.</li>
            <li>I mostly wash and go so</li>
            <li>i love this stuff</li>
            <li>ok..</li>
            <li>I find I have to wash my hair more often to avoid flakiness.  </li>
            <li>I can not tell you how many products I have bought for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>This would probably work better for someone who had drier hair than I do.</li>
            <li>It helps transform my waves into better clumps and adds more of a spiral shape.  </li>
            <li>Kinky Curly more than met my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>The curl pattern was okay...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t any better than the dozens of products I&#x27;ve bought over the years.  </li>
            <li>It went into a drawer with the rest of the just ok hair products</li>
            <li>But God is good, found the Camille Rose Naturals Line and my curls are really elongated &amp; my curls pop.</li>
            <li>Love the way it leave my hair looking very curly!!!!</li>
            <li>The results are amazing, my hair looks great and smooth, it&#x27;s not hard and scrunching looking like GEL and Spay.</li>
            <li>This styling gel is amazing, specially when you use the blow dyer refuser.</li>
            <li>it is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>the outcome of cute, healthy and curly hair is worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my hair for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li>then that I love it to smooth my edges</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product and am glad it was recommended to me.</li>
            <li>It works best when my  hair is still wet.</li>
            <li>I walked in to my hairdresser with this product and she started laughing and told me I would have been better off with a tub of cheap eco styler gel and by Jove she was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My twists look fresh for upto five days and twist-outs hold up nicely as well.  </li>
            <li>that I am less focused on having perfectly defined curls and more focused on the health of my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really strong and very sweet.</li>
            <li>There was no flaking like many other gels (Eco Styler) and was light and produced beautiful results!</li>
            <li>so make sure you have clean hair using this.</li>
            <li>Since year ago, I have fall in love with this line, specially this product.</li>
            <li>my hair is considered coarse but it is beautiful with this product.</li>
            <li>but i woke up the next morning with a beautiful curly</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>My hair loves moisture but it also fine so it doesn&#x27;t like to be coated.</li>
            <li>, I think I want to try this!&amp;#34; Shipping was fine.</li>
            <li>Great product, but Shea Moisture&#x27;s gel souffle is a little better and cheaper!</li>
            <li>Okay, first let me say this stuff does WORK!</li>
            <li>For people that are born with nice curls, this product may works in defining those curls more but for those who are trying to go natural after years of perm, stay away from this products unless you like wasting money.</li>
            <li>Happy with all the above purchases.&lt;br /&gt;DCS</li>
            <li>A $3.00 jar of Curl Activator gel along with a light application of hair grease!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I prep with a sulfate free shampoo, conditioner and protein treatment (every 4 weeks).</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li>Apply in sections and dont go light on this product.</li>
            <li>This product works great ONLY if you have reached a level of hydration;  </li>
            <li>so anything that lets me co wash my hair and apply to it without further styling is GREAT.</li>
            <li>Great gel for kinky curly coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Love, that it&#x27;s a natural product and smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>When I first put this \\&quot;custard\\&quot; in my hair, I was pleased to see my hair curl up</li>
            <li>Also to update my original review</li>
            <li>After the first use, I feel like this should be better for the cost.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair with the KC Come Clean, then used the KC Knot Today, and then applied the KC Curling Custard</li>
            <li>Today gave me great curls and definition, BUT my hair already has a natural curl pattern and doesn&#x27;t take much to make it curl.</li>
            <li>great gel, great ingredients, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li>and I found myself not wanting to style it more and more frequently.</li>
            <li>The vanilla scent is light, and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>1.)KC Come Clean</li>
            <li>it certainly does not look appealing.</li>
            <li>I use a $5 container of gel that is twice as large as this and provides better hold.</li>
            <li>Also only apply while hair is SOAKING wet for best results:)</li>
            <li>Every one asks me what I am using in my hair it looks so good, as for my friend she did not get the same results I did, I guess it has to do with the texture of your hair.  </li>
            <li>so glad that I bought it at whole foods so that I can return it.</li>
            <li>(In full disclosure, I also used Oidad frizz product).</li>
            <li>The result should be a nice hold yet still soft to the touch with lots of moisture.</li>
            <li>like the sweet smell of it</li>
            <li>Kinky Curly maintains the curls all over, and I can finally get up in the morning, give my hair a good shake, and go.  </li>
            <li>Nice curls and soft hold.</li>
            <li>It really has contributed to the growth in my hair as the more moisture affects it, the healthier it is for growth.</li>
            <li>I am not one of those lucky ladies that has good looking second day hair.</li>
            <li>I like the way my hair looks better on my trips back East where it is more humid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It washes out quickly and does not leave a residue or buildup.  </li>
            <li>Quickly, I start with a Cherry Lola Caramel Treatment, let that sit for 1.5 to 2 hours</li>
            <li>I did a quick wash and go before work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of the rare curly headed girls who LIKES &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; gel best because it is the only thing that actually keeps my hair from frizzing...until I found this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product &amp; am a convert that will live by this product FOREVER.</li>
            <li>It never looks good when I blow dry with this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t achieve the curl definition like the first day, but I still have to play around with it, I&#x27;ll will make it work!</li>
            <li>My first jar lasted for about 3 months!</li>
            <li>I get clean, crisp, shiny curls.  </li>
            <li>Light, and it really works for over processed hair without drying it.</li>
            <li>To prevent those 2 from happening, I added in the O and smoothed it in from root to tip before doing the same with the KC Curling Custard and got amazing results.  </li>
            <li>4c hair texture and when used as described it really leaves my hair feeling smooth and moisturizeed for dayssssss.</li>
            <li>It is well worth every cent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that it was better to just wash and condition my hair with Pantene for people of color, and when still wet apply coconut hair grease and Pantene leave in condition, and get more curls</li>
            <li>Thus far my all-time favorite</li>
            <li>I believe using heat during the styling of my hair produced some kind of chemical reaction turning my hair yellow when I tried this product for about two weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase--especially for 4a hair...</li>
            <li>My favorite natural hair product</li>
            <li>so i get my money worth.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>So its worth the buy if you know how to use it correctly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love so far.</li>
            <li>does not do much for my natural hair but the smell is nice and its silky.</li>
            <li>i love this poroduct i would recommend any one going natural</li>
            <li>i had to say i did get my money worth.</li>
            <li>My sis just puts it on right out the shower without any leave-in and that works for her.</li>
            <li>It holds the curls you get right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>The trick to making this product work on your hair is by finding the right amount of product that your hair requires.</li>
            <li>and I may not be doing something right.</li>
            <li>You have to find the right amount of product for your hair type, style, and texture.</li>
            <li>this is right up my alley.</li>
            <li>but my niece did get some decent result using this product (free bottle for her).</li>
            <li>try this will be buying it more and far as for the price i thought at first</li>
            <li>This is the most important step for my 2B hair; I DO NOT touch it until it is completely dry.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very fine, big, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get it right the first time.</li>
            <li>heard about this product for quite a while but was hesitant to try it because of the price; i chose cheaper products and DIY regimen with natural oils etc.- which worked but was very time consuming with short-acting results.&lt;br /&gt;Finally decided to buy this as i already use the leave-in conditioner in this line and love the results.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I comb my hair in the shower and then I scrunch my hair a ton so that I don&#x27;t need to dry with any kind of towel.</li>
            <li>This product came highly recommended and I was so happy to try it on my short natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have 3a/3b shoulder length hair that&#x27;s easily weighed down by most products.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product because I actually love the look of my hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>I find that I get really good hold, my hair is extremely hydrated because of the intense humectant properties, and I get lots of volume.</li>
            <li>When using it,a little goes a long way,and it works best when used with the kinky curly knot today conditioner.</li>
            <li>First I put this on my edges</li>
            <li>Upon tryng for the first time, do not use alot.  </li>
            <li>most leave ins that are white will not work under this product.</li>
            <li>and it was pretty.  </li>
            <li>I heard so many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>tried it twice and over-applied the first time...</li>
            <li>This was also the first gel i ever used as a primer.</li>
            <li>You can use a big tooth comb and then spritz and shake if you want some more length.  </li>
            <li>Since I generally don&#x27;t have that much time in the morning to fix my unruly hair, I experimented with KCCCG on a day that I knew, for sure, that I didn&#x27;t have to step out of my apartment.</li>
            <li>It defined my curls but also had more shrinkage and the curls only lasted for 1 day.</li>
            <li>It also lost the crunchy texture that it had on the first day.</li>
            <li>so I use more than someone with short hair).</li>
            <li>Really like this product!  </li>
            <li>I was nervous at first, but not anymore.</li>
            <li>My hair came out so pretty.</li>
            <li>When I look back now, I wished I would have known better.</li>
            <li>The results I get are pretty consistent.</li>
            <li>then i put the product in my hair and immediately i knew that i found exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loooovee this product!</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the curl pattern/</li>
            <li>I could have done better with conditoner only.  </li>
            <li>I only wash my hair once a week, and I feel like the product worked better on &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; hair than &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you have thick course kinky hair.</li>
            <li>I did NOT like this method at first bc</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian and I have long, super fine, low porosity (healthy) wavy 2b/2c combination hair.</li>
            <li>in comfortably moist weather, It might not work for everyone for a variety of other reasons, largely because everyone&#x27;s idea of a good hair day is different.  </li>
            <li>however it is a very small amount... would be great for gym bag</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about trying this product at first, but I had seen so many good reviews</li>
            <li>I would say that if the $20+ price tag doesn&#x27;t bother you, you don&#x27;t have any exalted expectations and you live in a mild climate, then give it a try.</li>
            <li>review!&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as eco styler gel and more expensive</li>
            <li>They gave me ZERO FRIZZ, super soft, defined, shiny, bouncy curls!</li>
            <li>I will admit the first time I used it I used WAY too much product on both our hair</li>
            <li>I love Kinky Curly and can&#x27;t believe it took this long to discover it.</li>
            <li>The crunchiness and dryness a lot of people experienced were due to the O being left out after applying the KC Leave-In/Detangler.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described &amp; fast delivery</li>
            <li>I wish I could give it a ten, if you&#x27;re looking for a good natural hair gel for kinky hair(that tames the hair and leaves it soft)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, while I consider this product EXTREMELY expensive, it is something I would use again, just because it works very nicely for me and has helped me retain significant length</li>
            <li>I also found my curls look better if I air dry.</li>
            <li>and I love that my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out like when I used Gel.</li>
            <li>alternatives are products such as coconut oil or shea butter which leave minimal white residue (just make sure to warm them in your hands first).</li>
            <li>The Camille Rose Curl maker gel has a much stickier and little bit thicker consistency..and somehow that consistency and formula just works for my hair.</li>
            <li>: I use it a little bit more differently than most people I know do.</li>
            <li>Great for adding texture or for using as a light gel with hair curlers for crazy bounce.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it controls the curl and smells great.</li>
            <li>It seems my hair has gotten drier and tends to frizz more easily as I have gotten older, and also I miss the tighter, ringlett-like curls my hair used to make as it dried naturally.  </li>
            <li>Im happy with the product, but only gave it 4 stars because it will take a few practices to produce 5 star results .  </li>
            <li>On my boys I just put it in their damp hair and it  leaves it really shiny with no shrinkage and no flakes</li>
            <li>Works very well with the Leave In Conditioner.</li>
            <li>but I much much prefer crunchy to tacky</li>
            <li>It works really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>either straight or curly.</li>
            <li>though it shrinks my hair a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Gives you hold without the flake or build up (that is, if you don&#x27;t use too much).</li>
            <li>none of those products give my hair much curl definition.</li>
            <li>It keeps your curly but its very \\&quot;tackey\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The two products work very well together.</li>
            <li>I have a whole unused jar that I have now had for over a year.</li>
            <li>One thing i liked is if i left a bit of the gel out in a separate open container, it would shrink and become very tacky and sticky.</li>
            <li>very efficient for slicking edges.</li>
            <li>It will leave your hair shiny and with very defined curls.</li>
            <li>I purchased this from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really like this product for me.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see much change in my hair.</li>
            <li>Also, It is very sticky.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the smell, but I tolerated it.</li>
            <li>I actually really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted an option for &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>It really gives me the look I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>Everyone tells me how much &amp;#34;more curly&amp;#34; my hair looks with this.</li>
            <li>It has a gel-like texture that I also do not like and a flakey residue that makes it far from worth the price.</li>
            <li>An absolute staple.</li>
            <li>Also, having too much water in your hair at all times could weaken the strands and cause them to break.</li>
            <li>but I think that depends on if I use too much or not.  </li>
            <li>I expected  more because I like Kinky Curly Knot</li>
            <li>it made it oily, but realized I applied way too much.</li>
            <li>So it is really up to you if you want to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much either.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My whole head has curly curls, not just some parts.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, but more so in the back</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products since going natural two years ago.</li>
            <li>much much prefer ecostyler gel, no it doesn&#x27;t smell as good and is not all organic but at least it dries in an hour or so</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of conditioning and hold to keep curls soft and controlled without a bunch of weight or crunchiness.</li>
            <li>it does not shrink, I get very lose waves on the top of my head while other parts of my hair have no waves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obvious by feeling it you don&#x27;t need much so using your own judgement will go a long way.</li>
            <li>I also tried many other &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; products and none of them worked).  </li>
            <li>The Come Clean Shampoo, The Knot Today Conditioner, and finally the Kinky</li>
            <li>I have wavy fine grey hair which I can wear  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Only con about the product is that it provides a strong hold, so if you don&#x27;t like a strong hold you may want to use less of the product.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, and probably better than more expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li>Nicely defines curls my hair is usually frizzy.</li>
            <li>In order for you to get the full effect of this product you have to  use only the shampoo  and  the conditioner that goes with it.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sensitive to fragrance, and this didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>It works better to eliminate frizz, not weigh down, not build up, and avoid crunch.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to wash it out of my hair and it also did not define my 3c/4a curly hair, it just sat on top of it and weighed it down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to overdo it and get crunchy curls though so be careful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for that.</li>
            <li>if I want my daughters hair to be curly and moist, then why not try regular old Curl activator gel and a light application of hair grease.  </li>
            <li>this helps my front curls look more similar to the back.  </li>
            <li>Please understand, with THIS particular product,</li>
            <li>It works even better with a small amount of leave in conditioner applied first.</li>
            <li>The directions for this product are VERY SPECIFIC, and be sure to follow, or else your hair will look greasy and gross.</li>
            <li>I use a dryer set on low for days when I need to leave quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried soooo many of these products that only claim to do what this one actually does.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen any reviews that factor climate into the effectiveness of this product, but trust me - if you have highly porous hair (like I do)</li>
            <li>it was to high</li>
            <li>so its good that a little goes a long way with this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been since Friday afternoon on the 15th, and nows it&#x27;s Tuesday the 19th, and her hair is still really curly, soft and moist to the touch.  </li>
            <li>My wife bought this product and she found that it worked very well to enhance her natural curl.  </li>
            <li>I have natural 4b/4c hair and this product didnt work very well for me.</li>
            <li>The pros to this product really do surpass everything that I have done to my hair naturally so far.</li>
            <li>It works great, but I give it 4 stars because it is so expensive, and I don&#x27;t see anything on the label that would explain the price tag.  </li>
            <li>They are not sticky, and you hair is not thick.  </li>
            <li>so it is worth the upfront extra $$$ because you will have it for a while</li>
            <li>My hair shrinks about 75% of its normal length.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to purchase because I am fairly new to being natural.</li>
            <li>Your hair will not turn out hard and will be nice and soft TRUST ME!</li>
            <li>Product is great, but packaging was very poor when i recieved it</li>
            <li>She gets great definition, and the hold can last a few days with minor touch-ups.</li>
            <li>(I keep a hair journal when I try out new products.)</li>
            <li>I live it.</li>
            <li>KCC is the new creamy crack.</li>
            <li>The thing I have noticed about most users of the KCCC is that they are actually still in their transition phase, mix heritage or their hair is not very \\&quot;kinky\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It does not even lay down the fine baby hairs on the side of my face.</li>
            <li>But now, it makes it so UNBELIEVABLY soft, and my curls are tight, SOFT, and NOT frizzy, and the curls are way more defined.</li>
            <li>and they are very soft.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair very soft and holds my curls in place.</li>
            <li>The label should read that \\&quot;Everyone has different hair texture so this product will only work on those with fine hair and soft natual hair.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get past the fact the consistency was like snot if it would work, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that most curling products have just about the same ingredients thatn any other.  </li>
            <li>The Curling Custard was the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>I would definitely use it again, but it isn&#x27;t my first choice.</li>
            <li>Consistently produces well defined curls that last for days.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last weekend</li>
            <li>Big Luscious curly hair that looked almost exactly like Taren916 on youtube.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the long lasting shine for days.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly/kinky hair (mostly kinky) and was looking for something that could define the few curls I had when I do I wash and go, and I found it!</li>
            <li>and i can cleanout both of my cabinets full of those other products i have been testing.</li>
            <li>I myself have several different hair textures; I also must mention that I received a tremendous amount of compliments on my hair whenever I use the product.</li>
            <li>It actually made my 3b curls which are already tight, shrink even more.</li>
            <li>It is much much cheaper at $3.00 per giant bottle and it defines my curls in more or less the same way.</li>
            <li>I have VERY curly, thick but fine hair and have tried a multitude of products over the years.</li>
            <li>If you use too little then it definitely does not work and if you use more to try and get any type of curl definition</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about everyone else, but I don&#x27;t want to put so called light product in my hair everyday because light product everyday turns into a heavy mess magnent by the time for a good washing.  </li>
            <li>The gel does create a whiteish residue which is heightened by a non clear product used under it.</li>
            <li>It is clear so</li>
            <li>I have used garnier fructise, eco styler, pro style, clear ice and</li>
            <li>am kink-curly natural for 1 year with 5 inches of natural hair when my hair is stretched.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Im natural</li>
            <li>and I wanted a natural product.  </li>
            <li>though is still Miss Jessie&#x27;s pillow soft hair.</li>
            <li>I just hope they never discontinue or change the formula this line is just wow.</li>
            <li>I have 3c/4a natural hair.</li>
            <li>The result is manageable, soft and defined curls.</li>
            <li>Removes the frizz and leaves me with soft wavy curls.  </li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t get curly curls your hair will still be soft as ever.</li>
            <li>and it came out sticky with flakes and never really dried fully.</li>
            <li>She was surprised at how shiny it kept her hair, even after two days.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>Makes it look soft and cared for.</li>
            <li>my hair type is a combination of soft to kinky and it is worn naturally.</li>
            <li>and with it they don&#x27;t look as natural as I wanted them to.</li>
            <li>MY HAIR WAS SILKY AND SOFT AFTER USING THE PRODUCT,BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR MY HAIR TEXTURE</li>
            <li>I have naturally FRIZZY hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just cut my hair to grow in it&#x27;s natural state</li>
            <li>Gives me soft shiny defined curls.</li>
            <li>It is my #1 natural hair product.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4b hair.</li>
            <li>I have been fully transitioned natural for 6 months.</li>
            <li>I have type 4a natural hair.  </li>
            <li>She woke up with shiny, soft curls and her hair wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>It leave your hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Once my hair completely dries the KCCCG is no longer visible as my hair has soaked it up.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4 something hair</li>
            <li>This is including ecostyler which lots of people compare frequently because of their prices.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair moisturized &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li>Somewhere between a 3A and a 3B.&lt;br /&gt;Products used before (OLD REGIMINE):</li>
            <li>the Knot Today conditioner and used my old no name brand)2.)</li>
            <li>Gives well defined curls which feel soft and natural to touch.</li>
            <li>I would not go so far as to say that doesn&#x27;t work for any 4a/4b hair, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>One of the few products that gives true 4c Hair coily definition and also useful for when just twirling the hair around the index finger to get curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Section wet or very damp hair apply your leave-in conditioner - use a clear leave-in to avoid white residue - then apply a fingertip of KKCC per section.</li>
            <li>I guess I haven&#x27;t found the right amout so my hair doesn&#x27;t look wet all day.</li>
            <li>The product is more expensive compared to some other products but it is also superior to other products.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it if you have 25% shrinkage with your natural hair, but it you have major natural hair shrinkage, I would NOT recommend it.     </li>
            <li>I have 3A moderately curly/wavy red/Scottish hair with a high frizz factor</li>
            <li>I used only a little and while the results were better it still left a sticky flaky residue in her hair.</li>
            <li>While it is wet and greasy when you first put it in your hair</li>
            <li>My first thought was that it was too expensive, but after using it the first week, I realize that I got my monies worth.  </li>
            <li>Still pretty wet, but not &amp;</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t flake, are not hard, and they hold until the net day.  </li>
            <li>After it is completely dry, get your blow dryer again and use the concentrated attachment and gently pull at your hair but DON&#x27;T comb your fingers through it.</li>
            <li>To refresh the next day simply spray hair with water and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, boticelli type curls, and have tried several products that don&#x27;t come close to this as far as definition.</li>
            <li>a few times before you give up I find a lot of people give up on it to quickly.</li>
            <li>It says right on the bottle that if you have a kinky hair type (I have type 4 coily/ziggly hair), you should only apply this while your hair is still dripping wet, AFTER you have applied your oils and conditioner of choice, finger detangled and splash-rinsed your hair after.</li>
            <li>i make darn sure I&#x27;ve got a back-up tub before I&#x27;m half empty on the open one.</li>
            <li>You might as well use Eco Styler Olive Oil Styling Gel for a better result and over less than half the price of this.</li>
            <li>Yes it is a little sticky but once fully dry its fine.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this for her super tight curly (almost kinky) Irish hair.  </li>
            <li>It did NOT work for me as my short afro would not curl or do anything while when I used the eco styler and could clearly see curls forming.</li>
            <li>I even tried this product after I cut my perm out and only had natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for several years now.</li>
            <li>i went natural and short......</li>
            <li>Just starting to go natural</li>
            <li>Only towel blot AFTER your hair has completely set and already has the custard in.</li>
            <li>leaves chunky residue in your hair and barely gave me a curl.</li>
            <li>Really defines curls when hair is wet.  </li>
            <li>Regular use of this custard and my hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a wet type look either</li>
            <li>Some people want their curls to be completely and totally defined at all times (I don&#x27;t - I like some frizz).  </li>
            <li>Kinky Curly Custard Gel on my soaking wet hair(didnt use nearly as much as I do the Ecostyler Gel) 4.</li>
            <li>This product has been instrumental in bringing back my natural curl.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on a daily base since my curls are still perfect the next day.</li>
            <li>I live in Southern California, so the weather isn&#x27;t that big a factor for</li>
            <li>I would wet my face well, apply the gel, and while it was wet spread my foundation over it quickly and blend.</li>
            <li>When I first tried using the curling custard, I also had some of the complaints of others such as flaking, hard hair, shrinkage and thought it cost too much.</li>
            <li>I was using wayyyy too much of it and using it over other products that it was not intended to be used over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does dry kind of hard but for my boys they like the shiny wet look.  </li>
            <li>im african american with natural hair 4/c</li>
            <li>It is small for the price but still worth it.</li>
            <li>nearly half the cost...if you cannot find it in their stores you can certainly order online at target.com.  </li>
            <li>I got it right the second time, but it was a mess!</li>
            <li>It really holds down the front of my hair all day.</li>
            <li>But caution - too much can cause a producty feel that will weigh down finer hair.</li>
            <li>I have mixed curly hair (black and asian) which curls pretty well but tends to get frizzy.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, Ecostyler gel mixed with curl activator works pretty similarly and costs less than half as much.</li>
            <li>And also what I&#x27;ve learned after a while is that with gels they all leave some residue until they dry, ecostyler and even all natural flax seed gel leaves the residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; I dry my hair in an old t-shirt</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really does work WONDERS for turning your hair into tight coils.</li>
            <li>As for the smell of the product, it reminds me of a subtle sweet pastry of some sort, but it fades away from my hair almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read that it makes hair crunchy, which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I&#x27;m guessing that too much product was used to get the crunch because the minimal crunch I received was entirely eliminated by blowing dry regularly after taking off my diffuser.</li>
            <li>little of this gel really does go along way</li>
            <li>The product itself is what really makes me a little bit wishy-washy.</li>
            <li>I like my hair big and bouncy, not flat nor crunchy.</li>
            <li>and you live in a high-altitude or an extremely humid climate, this product may present some problems for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> lol</li>

            <li> LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li> now i use my home made flax seed gel for it, but it was very effective.</li>
            <li> great stuff good buy.</li>
            <li> Impressive, but I need more of it for my hair</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have FINE curly hair though I can see this being a great product!</li>
            <li> This product is good for keeping the frizz off the curls.</li>
            <li> and it is a good combination.  </li>
            <li> The product smells good but doesn&#x27;t overpower my perfume.</li>
            <li> To be fair to the product, I adjusted my rating accordingly.</li>
            <li> and it smells good</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading that it was a good product for my curl type, 3a.</li>
            <li> The best gel (of many many I have used with my curly hair$</li>
            <li> But, if KCCCG will continue to deliver perfect curls, then I&#x27;m willing to overlook it!</li>
            <li> I make my own gel now and get just as good results.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and works great, I suggest giving it a shot if you are looking for a good hold without the crunch &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Oh, how I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love this!  </li>
            <li> I freaking love this stuff!</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE it!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> By the way this is a very good product; nothing is worth the target!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It feels so light on my hair and smells really great.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> and this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and could not wait to use it because i heard so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> I have nice ringlets all around.</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the product relies exclusively on the humectants for moisture and softness (there are no oils in it), the amount of water in the atmosphere will determine whether or not this product moisturizes effectively.  </li>
            <li> It had a nice shine</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product...works great for hair like mine!</li>
            <li> However, once I gently scrunched the gel film on my hair, I had the most wonderful results!</li>
            <li> It works great with my twist outs and if used over the right products and not used in excess gives me a nice defined wash and</li>
            <li> I ended up making my own flaxseed gel that had MUCH better results</li>
            <li> With that said; this is the best product I have found that is ALL natural and holds MY hair.  </li>
            <li> The best gel I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and dont have to use a lot to get the results you want!</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it!</li>
            <li> &quot;  and my curls look awesome and they are soft and look shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Very good product for natural hair!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after reading all of the great reviews, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not working for me.</li>
            <li> and it works just fine for me!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair with spiral curls, I have to say every time I use Kinky curls my hair looks amazing</li>
            <li> I LOVE Kinky-Curly&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I seen so many review on this product on you tube, so I went and tried this curling custard.  </li>
            <li> but I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that compares to it.  </li>
            <li> Love the product - do not like using a tub - wish there was a pump version.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> when you take it out of your cap you can&#x27;t be sure what your curls will look like-</li>
            <li> Wish I could have given this a better review.</li>
            <li> it takes away all my volume at the top.</li>
            <li> since then it&#x27;s more evenly spread out.</li>
            <li> The better.</li>
            <li> It does stay a bit crunchy even after releasing the gel cast, which I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> But the ingredients are top notch.</li>
            <li> They all lay claim to be able to stretch out the hair and hold the curl for a day.....</li>
            <li> I just dont see how thats healthy for anyones hair.  </li>
            <li> When you get to the top of the hair you may have to redampen with a spritz of water from a spray bottle before continuing the gel and grease</li>
            <li> and they range from 3a to 4a in hair texture and all love it.</li>
            <li> The product is sticky and it did not hold the shape of my curls for more than a day.</li>
            <li> Great smell (like sugar cookies!), kinda gross consistency, but it does the job!</li>
            <li> OMG, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> worked better that any primer</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way that it makes my hair look after styling with it.</li>
            <li> curl), but someone else might need more product depending on their hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many curling products for my permed hair and by far&lt;</li>
            <li> Love this product for wash and go.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I&#x27;ve found for my moderately curly hair.</li>
            <li> I used it for a wash and go recently and got wonderful results.</li>
            <li> but once you figure out how much works for your hair, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> but my friend recommended this gel &amp; I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> More, about a quarter size, and I&#x27;ve got bounce with the definition.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t keep combing and touching your hair all day, you&#x27;ll lose curl/definition/waves with any product the more you touch your hair</li>
            <li> and I find it works better on my wavy curvy hair than any &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; type productI have tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One day a friend recommended Kinky Curly, and it did just what I wanted it to do and have received many compliments on my hair since.</li>
            <li> My curls are more defined, frizz-free and shiny and it delivered on its promise to elongate them.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way my curls are defined and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have taken a modified version that is much shorter, but I am having great results.  </li>
            <li> Have never been so satisfied in my life.</li>
            <li> However, she defers to the eco styler from which she says she gets better definition of curls on her 4a/4b type hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this product is that I no longer *have* to do braid out or twist outs.</li>
            <li> I mostly wash and go so</li>
            <li> i love this stuff</li>
            <li> ok..</li>
            <li> I find I have to wash my hair more often to avoid flakiness.  </li>
            <li> I can not tell you how many products I have bought for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This would probably work better for someone who had drier hair than I do.</li>
            <li> It helps transform my waves into better clumps and adds more of a spiral shape.  </li>
            <li> Kinky Curly more than met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> The curl pattern was okay...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t any better than the dozens of products I&#x27;ve bought over the years.  </li>
            <li> It went into a drawer with the rest of the just ok hair products</li>
            <li> But God is good, found the Camille Rose Naturals Line and my curls are really elongated &amp; my curls pop.</li>
            <li> Love the way it leave my hair looking very curly!!!!</li>
            <li> The results are amazing, my hair looks great and smooth, it&#x27;s not hard and scrunching looking like GEL and Spay.</li>
            <li> This styling gel is amazing, specially when you use the blow dyer refuser.</li>
            <li> it is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> the outcome of cute, healthy and curly hair is worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my hair for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> then that I love it to smooth my edges</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product and am glad it was recommended to me.</li>
            <li> It works best when my  hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> I walked in to my hairdresser with this product and she started laughing and told me I would have been better off with a tub of cheap eco styler gel and by Jove she was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My twists look fresh for upto five days and twist-outs hold up nicely as well.  </li>
            <li> that I am less focused on having perfectly defined curls and more focused on the health of my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really strong and very sweet.</li>
            <li> There was no flaking like many other gels (Eco Styler) and was light and produced beautiful results!</li>
            <li> so make sure you have clean hair using this.</li>
            <li> Since year ago, I have fall in love with this line, specially this product.</li>
            <li> my hair is considered coarse but it is beautiful with this product.</li>
            <li> but i woke up the next morning with a beautiful curly</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> My hair loves moisture but it also fine so it doesn&#x27;t like to be coated.</li>
            <li> , I think I want to try this!&amp;#34; Shipping was fine.</li>
            <li> Great product, but Shea Moisture&#x27;s gel souffle is a little better and cheaper!</li>
            <li> Okay, first let me say this stuff does WORK!</li>
            <li> For people that are born with nice curls, this product may works in defining those curls more but for those who are trying to go natural after years of perm, stay away from this products unless you like wasting money.</li>
            <li> Happy with all the above purchases.&lt;br /&gt;DCS</li>
            <li> A $3.00 jar of Curl Activator gel along with a light application of hair grease!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I prep with a sulfate free shampoo, conditioner and protein treatment (every 4 weeks).</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li> Apply in sections and dont go light on this product.</li>
            <li> This product works great ONLY if you have reached a level of hydration;  </li>
            <li> so anything that lets me co wash my hair and apply to it without further styling is GREAT.</li>
            <li> Great gel for kinky curly coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Love, that it&#x27;s a natural product and smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> When I first put this \\&quot;custard\\&quot; in my hair, I was pleased to see my hair curl up</li>
            <li> Also to update my original review</li>
            <li> After the first use, I feel like this should be better for the cost.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with the KC Come Clean, then used the KC Knot Today, and then applied the KC Curling Custard</li>
            <li> Today gave me great curls and definition, BUT my hair already has a natural curl pattern and doesn&#x27;t take much to make it curl.</li>
            <li> great gel, great ingredients, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> and I found myself not wanting to style it more and more frequently.</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is light, and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> 1.)KC Come Clean</li>
            <li> it certainly does not look appealing.</li>
            <li> I use a $5 container of gel that is twice as large as this and provides better hold.</li>
            <li> Also only apply while hair is SOAKING wet for best results:)</li>
            <li> Every one asks me what I am using in my hair it looks so good, as for my friend she did not get the same results I did, I guess it has to do with the texture of your hair.  </li>
            <li> so glad that I bought it at whole foods so that I can return it.</li>
            <li> (In full disclosure, I also used Oidad frizz product).</li>
            <li> The result should be a nice hold yet still soft to the touch with lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> like the sweet smell of it</li>
            <li> Kinky Curly maintains the curls all over, and I can finally get up in the morning, give my hair a good shake, and go.  </li>
            <li> Nice curls and soft hold.</li>
            <li> It really has contributed to the growth in my hair as the more moisture affects it, the healthier it is for growth.</li>
            <li> I am not one of those lucky ladies that has good looking second day hair.</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair looks better on my trips back East where it is more humid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It washes out quickly and does not leave a residue or buildup.  </li>
            <li> Quickly, I start with a Cherry Lola Caramel Treatment, let that sit for 1.5 to 2 hours</li>
            <li> I did a quick wash and go before work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the rare curly headed girls who LIKES &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; gel best because it is the only thing that actually keeps my hair from frizzing...until I found this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp; am a convert that will live by this product FOREVER.</li>
            <li> It never looks good when I blow dry with this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t achieve the curl definition like the first day, but I still have to play around with it, I&#x27;ll will make it work!</li>
            <li> My first jar lasted for about 3 months!</li>
            <li> I get clean, crisp, shiny curls.  </li>
            <li> Light, and it really works for over processed hair without drying it.</li>
            <li> To prevent those 2 from happening, I added in the O and smoothed it in from root to tip before doing the same with the KC Curling Custard and got amazing results.  </li>
            <li> 4c hair texture and when used as described it really leaves my hair feeling smooth and moisturizeed for dayssssss.</li>
            <li> It is well worth every cent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that it was better to just wash and condition my hair with Pantene for people of color, and when still wet apply coconut hair grease and Pantene leave in condition, and get more curls</li>
            <li> Thus far my all-time favorite</li>
            <li> I believe using heat during the styling of my hair produced some kind of chemical reaction turning my hair yellow when I tried this product for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase--especially for 4a hair...</li>
            <li> My favorite natural hair product</li>
            <li> so i get my money worth.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> So its worth the buy if you know how to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love so far.</li>
            <li> does not do much for my natural hair but the smell is nice and its silky.</li>
            <li> i love this poroduct i would recommend any one going natural</li>
            <li> i had to say i did get my money worth.</li>
            <li> My sis just puts it on right out the shower without any leave-in and that works for her.</li>
            <li> It holds the curls you get right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> The trick to making this product work on your hair is by finding the right amount of product that your hair requires.</li>
            <li> and I may not be doing something right.</li>
            <li> You have to find the right amount of product for your hair type, style, and texture.</li>
            <li> this is right up my alley.</li>
            <li> but my niece did get some decent result using this product (free bottle for her).</li>
            <li> try this will be buying it more and far as for the price i thought at first</li>
            <li> This is the most important step for my 2B hair; I DO NOT touch it until it is completely dry.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very fine, big, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get it right the first time.</li>
            <li> heard about this product for quite a while but was hesitant to try it because of the price; i chose cheaper products and DIY regimen with natural oils etc.- which worked but was very time consuming with short-acting results.&lt;br /&gt;Finally decided to buy this as i already use the leave-in conditioner in this line and love the results.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I comb my hair in the shower and then I scrunch my hair a ton so that I don&#x27;t need to dry with any kind of towel.</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended and I was so happy to try it on my short natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have 3a/3b shoulder length hair that&#x27;s easily weighed down by most products.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product because I actually love the look of my hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I find that I get really good hold, my hair is extremely hydrated because of the intense humectant properties, and I get lots of volume.</li>
            <li> When using it,a little goes a long way,and it works best when used with the kinky curly knot today conditioner.</li>
            <li> First I put this on my edges</li>
            <li> Upon tryng for the first time, do not use alot.  </li>
            <li> most leave ins that are white will not work under this product.</li>
            <li> and it was pretty.  </li>
            <li> I heard so many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> tried it twice and over-applied the first time...</li>
            <li> This was also the first gel i ever used as a primer.</li>
            <li> You can use a big tooth comb and then spritz and shake if you want some more length.  </li>
            <li> Since I generally don&#x27;t have that much time in the morning to fix my unruly hair, I experimented with KCCCG on a day that I knew, for sure, that I didn&#x27;t have to step out of my apartment.</li>
            <li> It defined my curls but also had more shrinkage and the curls only lasted for 1 day.</li>
            <li> It also lost the crunchy texture that it had on the first day.</li>
            <li> so I use more than someone with short hair).</li>
            <li> Really like this product!  </li>
            <li> I was nervous at first, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> My hair came out so pretty.</li>
            <li> When I look back now, I wished I would have known better.</li>
            <li> The results I get are pretty consistent.</li>
            <li> then i put the product in my hair and immediately i knew that i found exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loooovee this product!</li>
            <li> Overall, I love the curl pattern/</li>
            <li> I could have done better with conditoner only.  </li>
            <li> I only wash my hair once a week, and I feel like the product worked better on &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; hair than &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have thick course kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I did NOT like this method at first bc</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and I have long, super fine, low porosity (healthy) wavy 2b/2c combination hair.</li>
            <li> in comfortably moist weather, It might not work for everyone for a variety of other reasons, largely because everyone&#x27;s idea of a good hair day is different.  </li>
            <li> however it is a very small amount... would be great for gym bag</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this product at first, but I had seen so many good reviews</li>
            <li> I would say that if the $20+ price tag doesn&#x27;t bother you, you don&#x27;t have any exalted expectations and you live in a mild climate, then give it a try.</li>
            <li> review!&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as eco styler gel and more expensive</li>
            <li> They gave me ZERO FRIZZ, super soft, defined, shiny, bouncy curls!</li>
            <li> I will admit the first time I used it I used WAY too much product on both our hair</li>
            <li> I love Kinky Curly and can&#x27;t believe it took this long to discover it.</li>
            <li> The crunchiness and dryness a lot of people experienced were due to the O being left out after applying the KC Leave-In/Detangler.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described &amp; fast delivery</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it a ten, if you&#x27;re looking for a good natural hair gel for kinky hair(that tames the hair and leaves it soft)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, while I consider this product EXTREMELY expensive, it is something I would use again, just because it works very nicely for me and has helped me retain significant length</li>
            <li> I also found my curls look better if I air dry.</li>
            <li> and I love that my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out like when I used Gel.</li>
            <li> alternatives are products such as coconut oil or shea butter which leave minimal white residue (just make sure to warm them in your hands first).</li>
            <li> The Camille Rose Curl maker gel has a much stickier and little bit thicker consistency..and somehow that consistency and formula just works for my hair.</li>
            <li> : I use it a little bit more differently than most people I know do.</li>
            <li> Great for adding texture or for using as a light gel with hair curlers for crazy bounce.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it controls the curl and smells great.</li>
            <li> It seems my hair has gotten drier and tends to frizz more easily as I have gotten older, and also I miss the tighter, ringlett-like curls my hair used to make as it dried naturally.  </li>
            <li> Im happy with the product, but only gave it 4 stars because it will take a few practices to produce 5 star results .  </li>
            <li> On my boys I just put it in their damp hair and it  leaves it really shiny with no shrinkage and no flakes</li>
            <li> Works very well with the Leave In Conditioner.</li>
            <li> but I much much prefer crunchy to tacky</li>
            <li> It works really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> either straight or curly.</li>
            <li> though it shrinks my hair a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Gives you hold without the flake or build up (that is, if you don&#x27;t use too much).</li>
            <li> none of those products give my hair much curl definition.</li>
            <li> It keeps your curly but its very \\&quot;tackey\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The two products work very well together.</li>
            <li> I have a whole unused jar that I have now had for over a year.</li>
            <li> One thing i liked is if i left a bit of the gel out in a separate open container, it would shrink and become very tacky and sticky.</li>
            <li> very efficient for slicking edges.</li>
            <li> It will leave your hair shiny and with very defined curls.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really like this product for me.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see much change in my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, It is very sticky.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell, but I tolerated it.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted an option for &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> It really gives me the look I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> Everyone tells me how much &amp;#34;more curly&amp;#34; my hair looks with this.</li>
            <li> It has a gel-like texture that I also do not like and a flakey residue that makes it far from worth the price.</li>
            <li> An absolute staple.</li>
            <li> Also, having too much water in your hair at all times could weaken the strands and cause them to break.</li>
            <li> but I think that depends on if I use too much or not.  </li>
            <li> I expected  more because I like Kinky Curly Knot</li>
            <li> it made it oily, but realized I applied way too much.</li>
            <li> So it is really up to you if you want to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much either.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My whole head has curly curls, not just some parts.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, but more so in the back</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products since going natural two years ago.</li>
            <li> much much prefer ecostyler gel, no it doesn&#x27;t smell as good and is not all organic but at least it dries in an hour or so</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of conditioning and hold to keep curls soft and controlled without a bunch of weight or crunchiness.</li>
            <li> it does not shrink, I get very lose waves on the top of my head while other parts of my hair have no waves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious by feeling it you don&#x27;t need much so using your own judgement will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I also tried many other &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; products and none of them worked).  </li>
            <li> The Come Clean Shampoo, The Knot Today Conditioner, and finally the Kinky</li>
            <li> I have wavy fine grey hair which I can wear  </li>
            <li> Pretty sure this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Only con about the product is that it provides a strong hold, so if you don&#x27;t like a strong hold you may want to use less of the product.  </li>
            <li> It works really well, and probably better than more expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> Nicely defines curls my hair is usually frizzy.</li>
            <li> In order for you to get the full effect of this product you have to  use only the shampoo  and  the conditioner that goes with it.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sensitive to fragrance, and this didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> It works better to eliminate frizz, not weigh down, not build up, and avoid crunch.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to wash it out of my hair and it also did not define my 3c/4a curly hair, it just sat on top of it and weighed it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to overdo it and get crunchy curls though so be careful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for that.</li>
            <li> if I want my daughters hair to be curly and moist, then why not try regular old Curl activator gel and a light application of hair grease.  </li>
            <li> this helps my front curls look more similar to the back.  </li>
            <li> Please understand, with THIS particular product,</li>
            <li> It works even better with a small amount of leave in conditioner applied first.</li>
            <li> The directions for this product are VERY SPECIFIC, and be sure to follow, or else your hair will look greasy and gross.</li>
            <li> I use a dryer set on low for days when I need to leave quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soooo many of these products that only claim to do what this one actually does.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen any reviews that factor climate into the effectiveness of this product, but trust me - if you have highly porous hair (like I do)</li>
            <li> it was to high</li>
            <li> so its good that a little goes a long way with this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been since Friday afternoon on the 15th, and nows it&#x27;s Tuesday the 19th, and her hair is still really curly, soft and moist to the touch.  </li>
            <li> My wife bought this product and she found that it worked very well to enhance her natural curl.  </li>
            <li> I have natural 4b/4c hair and this product didnt work very well for me.</li>
            <li> The pros to this product really do surpass everything that I have done to my hair naturally so far.</li>
            <li> It works great, but I give it 4 stars because it is so expensive, and I don&#x27;t see anything on the label that would explain the price tag.  </li>
            <li> They are not sticky, and you hair is not thick.  </li>
            <li> so it is worth the upfront extra $$$ because you will have it for a while</li>
            <li> My hair shrinks about 75% of its normal length.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to purchase because I am fairly new to being natural.</li>
            <li> Your hair will not turn out hard and will be nice and soft TRUST ME!</li>
            <li> Product is great, but packaging was very poor when i recieved it</li>
            <li> She gets great definition, and the hold can last a few days with minor touch-ups.</li>
            <li> (I keep a hair journal when I try out new products.)</li>
            <li> I live it.</li>
            <li> KCC is the new creamy crack.</li>
            <li> The thing I have noticed about most users of the KCCC is that they are actually still in their transition phase, mix heritage or their hair is not very \\&quot;kinky\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It does not even lay down the fine baby hairs on the side of my face.</li>
            <li> But now, it makes it so UNBELIEVABLY soft, and my curls are tight, SOFT, and NOT frizzy, and the curls are way more defined.</li>
            <li> and they are very soft.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair very soft and holds my curls in place.</li>
            <li> The label should read that \\&quot;Everyone has different hair texture so this product will only work on those with fine hair and soft natual hair.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get past the fact the consistency was like snot if it would work, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that most curling products have just about the same ingredients thatn any other.  </li>
            <li> The Curling Custard was the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> I would definitely use it again, but it isn&#x27;t my first choice.</li>
            <li> Consistently produces well defined curls that last for days.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last weekend</li>
            <li> Big Luscious curly hair that looked almost exactly like Taren916 on youtube.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the long lasting shine for days.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly/kinky hair (mostly kinky) and was looking for something that could define the few curls I had when I do I wash and go, and I found it!</li>
            <li> and i can cleanout both of my cabinets full of those other products i have been testing.</li>
            <li> I myself have several different hair textures; I also must mention that I received a tremendous amount of compliments on my hair whenever I use the product.</li>
            <li> It actually made my 3b curls which are already tight, shrink even more.</li>
            <li> It is much much cheaper at $3.00 per giant bottle and it defines my curls in more or less the same way.</li>
            <li> I have VERY curly, thick but fine hair and have tried a multitude of products over the years.</li>
            <li> If you use too little then it definitely does not work and if you use more to try and get any type of curl definition</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about everyone else, but I don&#x27;t want to put so called light product in my hair everyday because light product everyday turns into a heavy mess magnent by the time for a good washing.  </li>
            <li> The gel does create a whiteish residue which is heightened by a non clear product used under it.</li>
            <li> It is clear so</li>
            <li> I have used garnier fructise, eco styler, pro style, clear ice and</li>
            <li> am kink-curly natural for 1 year with 5 inches of natural hair when my hair is stretched.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Im natural</li>
            <li> and I wanted a natural product.  </li>
            <li> though is still Miss Jessie&#x27;s pillow soft hair.</li>
            <li> I just hope they never discontinue or change the formula this line is just wow.</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a natural hair.</li>
            <li> The result is manageable, soft and defined curls.</li>
            <li> Removes the frizz and leaves me with soft wavy curls.  </li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t get curly curls your hair will still be soft as ever.</li>
            <li> and it came out sticky with flakes and never really dried fully.</li>
            <li> She was surprised at how shiny it kept her hair, even after two days.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> Makes it look soft and cared for.</li>
            <li> my hair type is a combination of soft to kinky and it is worn naturally.</li>
            <li> and with it they don&#x27;t look as natural as I wanted them to.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR WAS SILKY AND SOFT AFTER USING THE PRODUCT,BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR MY HAIR TEXTURE</li>
            <li> I have naturally FRIZZY hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just cut my hair to grow in it&#x27;s natural state</li>
            <li> Gives me soft shiny defined curls.</li>
            <li> It is my #1 natural hair product.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4b hair.</li>
            <li> I have been fully transitioned natural for 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have type 4a natural hair.  </li>
            <li> She woke up with shiny, soft curls and her hair wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> It leave your hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Once my hair completely dries the KCCCG is no longer visible as my hair has soaked it up.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4 something hair</li>
            <li> This is including ecostyler which lots of people compare frequently because of their prices.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair moisturized &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li> Somewhere between a 3A and a 3B.&lt;br /&gt;Products used before (OLD REGIMINE):</li>
            <li> the Knot Today conditioner and used my old no name brand)2.)</li>
            <li> Gives well defined curls which feel soft and natural to touch.</li>
            <li> I would not go so far as to say that doesn&#x27;t work for any 4a/4b hair, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that gives true 4c Hair coily definition and also useful for when just twirling the hair around the index finger to get curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Section wet or very damp hair apply your leave-in conditioner - use a clear leave-in to avoid white residue - then apply a fingertip of KKCC per section.</li>
            <li> I guess I haven&#x27;t found the right amout so my hair doesn&#x27;t look wet all day.</li>
            <li> The product is more expensive compared to some other products but it is also superior to other products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it if you have 25% shrinkage with your natural hair, but it you have major natural hair shrinkage, I would NOT recommend it.     </li>
            <li> I have 3A moderately curly/wavy red/Scottish hair with a high frizz factor</li>
            <li> I used only a little and while the results were better it still left a sticky flaky residue in her hair.</li>
            <li> While it is wet and greasy when you first put it in your hair</li>
            <li> My first thought was that it was too expensive, but after using it the first week, I realize that I got my monies worth.  </li>
            <li> Still pretty wet, but not &amp;</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t flake, are not hard, and they hold until the net day.  </li>
            <li> After it is completely dry, get your blow dryer again and use the concentrated attachment and gently pull at your hair but DON&#x27;T comb your fingers through it.</li>
            <li> To refresh the next day simply spray hair with water and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, boticelli type curls, and have tried several products that don&#x27;t come close to this as far as definition.</li>
            <li> a few times before you give up I find a lot of people give up on it to quickly.</li>
            <li> It says right on the bottle that if you have a kinky hair type (I have type 4 coily/ziggly hair), you should only apply this while your hair is still dripping wet, AFTER you have applied your oils and conditioner of choice, finger detangled and splash-rinsed your hair after.</li>
            <li> i make darn sure I&#x27;ve got a back-up tub before I&#x27;m half empty on the open one.</li>
            <li> You might as well use Eco Styler Olive Oil Styling Gel for a better result and over less than half the price of this.</li>
            <li> Yes it is a little sticky but once fully dry its fine.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this for her super tight curly (almost kinky) Irish hair.  </li>
            <li> It did NOT work for me as my short afro would not curl or do anything while when I used the eco styler and could clearly see curls forming.</li>
            <li> I even tried this product after I cut my perm out and only had natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for several years now.</li>
            <li> i went natural and short......</li>
            <li> Just starting to go natural</li>
            <li> Only towel blot AFTER your hair has completely set and already has the custard in.</li>
            <li> leaves chunky residue in your hair and barely gave me a curl.</li>
            <li> Really defines curls when hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> Regular use of this custard and my hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a wet type look either</li>
            <li> Some people want their curls to be completely and totally defined at all times (I don&#x27;t - I like some frizz).  </li>
            <li> Kinky Curly Custard Gel on my soaking wet hair(didnt use nearly as much as I do the Ecostyler Gel) 4.</li>
            <li> This product has been instrumental in bringing back my natural curl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on a daily base since my curls are still perfect the next day.</li>
            <li> I live in Southern California, so the weather isn&#x27;t that big a factor for</li>
            <li> I would wet my face well, apply the gel, and while it was wet spread my foundation over it quickly and blend.</li>
            <li> When I first tried using the curling custard, I also had some of the complaints of others such as flaking, hard hair, shrinkage and thought it cost too much.</li>
            <li> I was using wayyyy too much of it and using it over other products that it was not intended to be used over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does dry kind of hard but for my boys they like the shiny wet look.  </li>
            <li> im african american with natural hair 4/c</li>
            <li> It is small for the price but still worth it.</li>
            <li> nearly half the cost...if you cannot find it in their stores you can certainly order online at target.com.  </li>
            <li> I got it right the second time, but it was a mess!</li>
            <li> It really holds down the front of my hair all day.</li>
            <li> But caution - too much can cause a producty feel that will weigh down finer hair.</li>
            <li> I have mixed curly hair (black and asian) which curls pretty well but tends to get frizzy.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, Ecostyler gel mixed with curl activator works pretty similarly and costs less than half as much.</li>
            <li> And also what I&#x27;ve learned after a while is that with gels they all leave some residue until they dry, ecostyler and even all natural flax seed gel leaves the residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; I dry my hair in an old t-shirt</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really does work WONDERS for turning your hair into tight coils.</li>
            <li> As for the smell of the product, it reminds me of a subtle sweet pastry of some sort, but it fades away from my hair almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that it makes hair crunchy, which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I&#x27;m guessing that too much product was used to get the crunch because the minimal crunch I received was entirely eliminated by blowing dry regularly after taking off my diffuser.</li>
            <li> little of this gel really does go along way</li>
            <li> The product itself is what really makes me a little bit wishy-washy.</li>
            <li> I like my hair big and bouncy, not flat nor crunchy.</li>
            <li> and you live in a high-altitude or an extremely humid climate, this product may present some problems for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully in natural short hairstyles, but keep in mind you must use it on very wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Regular gel tends to make my hair too hard, stringy, and stiff even after I scrunch the film out of my hair, but KCCCG defined my curls with minimum frizz (or rarely any frizz for that matter) and kept my hair very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I am one of the ones who hates it.\\&quot;  I also talked to my co-workers who are natural and they gave the Custard a big thumbs down.  </li>
            <li> If you dont mind having pretty curls but hard hair, then this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air-dry for about 2 hours (the shortest time period that I have ever had to dry my curly hair) and my hair had the same consistency as if I had used a regular gel.</li>
            <li> If I want my natural curls, I put this in when it&#x27;s dripping wet and let it dry in my t-shirt towel...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for any hair types &amp; it last long.</li>
            <li> My hair needs a product with hold, or it gets flat and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It holds your curl and leaves them looking the same all day long.</li>
            <li> i also recommend it, it leaves the hair soft and slippery but not greasy or too weighed down.</li>
            <li> I use several small dollops instead of a couple of bigger ones to make sure I&#x27;ve got even, but thin, coverage and I never brush.</li>
            <li> If you look at the owner she is mixed, her hair is very long, So how would we expect the results that she displayed?</li>
            <li> I reapplied a tiny bit of the spritz and custard and let it dry.</li>
            <li> When my hair is short I don&#x27;t even have to dry it</li>
            <li> It takes several (5+) hours to air dry</li>
            <li> My hair is typically dry enough after the 75-80 min workout and preparation for work.  </li>
            <li> My hair is multi-textured; the back center of my hair is courser than the front and sides, an issue Mixed Chicks could not address.</li>
            <li> Once dry the custard is firm but not hard and does not flake.  </li>
            <li> The only reason why this product gets 4 stars is because it takes forever to dry!</li>
            <li> And yes, you can achieve the same results with other (cheaper) gels but my wash and gos last longer (2-3 days) with KCCC.</li>
            <li> This, is my HG of curly curls for me, and I highly recommend it as someone who&#x27;s been in the trenches with the myriad of other products!!!  </li>
            <li> If its hard, I used way too much, so I may rinse a bit off.</li>
            <li> If you live in an extremely dry climate, your hair will be extremely dry because there is so little moisture in the atmosphere.</li>
            <li> My curls were very defined and it kept my hair moisturized for at least 3 days.  </li>
            <li> My hair is an inch or so past my shoulders and it takes me about 1 hour total to complete since I also wash myself in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and if I run it through my soaking wet hair it actually works quite well</li>
            <li> only downfall with this products is that your hair has to be DRIPPING wet.</li>
            <li> Then I gently brushed out the section of hair with a wide paddle brush, and then smoothed her hair out bristle brush.  </li>
            <li> My 2B hair seems to react the way it should (keeping in mind that I have long hair</li>
            <li> I only use about a nickel size to quarter size amount on fairly wet hair, that&#x27;s plenty.</li>
            <li> Oh, you don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ve tried to make this product work.</li>
            <li> But only while wet.</li>
            <li> The next day, all I do is spray water infused with leave in conditioner, and fluff my hair.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it my hair curled tightly however it was tacky after I finished putting it in my hair and when it was dry it was stiff as well.</li>
            <li> But when hair is totally dried after the application, it&#x27;s a hot mess!</li>
            <li> I did read other reviews and agree, if you use too much you will have slick hair.</li>
            <li> it did not take long to dry and it had a radiant shine.. and body.</li>
            <li> so my hair is closest to African American natural hair which is about 2 inches in length; it is thick but not very kinky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It defined my hair exceedingly well, but it was extremely brittle and I didn&#x27;t like the overall look.</li>
            <li> I only gave it one star because maybe it works for other hair types.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry.</li>
            <li> For me after my hair is dry or nearly dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It takes 2 hours to begin to dry and for the residue to turn into sort of a reflective clearish residue-</li>
            <li> Who has 2 hours or time to blow dry, it is suppose to be</li>
            <li> a wash n GO.&lt;br /&gt;-It takes at least a day to dry completely and for that entire day it is &#x27;tacky&#x27;-</li>
            <li> Forms a casing around curls, when they dry, curls have definition.  </li>
            <li> have 3b curls that curl into Shirley temple locks when dry regardless of the products I use.</li>
            <li> otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with dry and unruly curls.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t smell it once it is dry.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve gotten it all over your hair, shake it around and then go sit under your dryer for about 30min until it is completely dry, OR if you don&#x27;t have a dryer to sit under, use your blow dryer and diffuser attachment to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Just grab and dry at the roots, the goal is to stretch/elongate the curls.</li>
            <li> This product felt like glue in my hair and took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> (will dry quicker if using a hair dryer).  </li>
            <li> If you do need to towel dry, stay away from terry cloth towels as they cause frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> I diffuse after to almost dry.</li>
            <li> reserve time to let my hair air dry before leaving the house because I fear blow dryer frizz.</li>
            <li> I apply the product, braid or twist my hair and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Then I use a tshirt to blot dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Takes a whilllee to dry.</li>
            <li> When my hair get&#x27;s dry because of the heat here in the Caribbean, I just spritz and my hair is revitalized.</li>
            <li> So I tried again a few months later on my daughters hair only because her curl patter is looser then mine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any white residue, but left my hair feeling stiff and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I hace loose curls</li>
            <li> but I definitely think it weighs down my hair and makes it too crunchy.</li>
            <li> but this custard was a big thumbs way down.  </li>
            <li> On dripping wet hair it took HOURS to dry</li>
            <li> I typically do my hair prior to heading into our spare room to do my 4 am workout.  </li>
            <li> When my hair is dry, I can use a wide tooth comb to fluff the curls</li>
            <li> I think I may have used a little too much, my hair was hard.  </li>
            <li> I use just a little (this is key) to scrunch my waves into curls.  </li>
            <li> Only use a little bit of the Knot</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it takes a while to try and it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> I use low sulfate shampoo because using gel regularly causes build up and makes it hard to style.</li>
            <li> If you live in a very humid climate, then your hair might be limp or extremely puffy and difficult to style because of the moisture overload.</li>
            <li> I used this on damp, and dripping wet hair.</li>
            <li> your hair is wet</li>
            <li> So, I decided to use this product and after a week of trying to follow all directions... dripping wet hair (lots of moisturizer)..</li>
            <li> wide tooth comb...</li>
            <li> /curls up when wet.</li>
            <li> It made my hair goowy and after it dried, white flakes came off my hair.</li>
            <li> When my hair is wet</li>
            <li> If you like stringy, wet looking curls, you will like this.</li>
            <li> However, you have to be careful not to over gel, it can get sticky.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful not to over do it</li>
            <li> But didn&#x27;t elongate my curls, my curls didn&#x27;t pop, and had no real curl definition.</li>
            <li> If I do not want to reapply products the gel reactivates when wet</li>
            <li> I just wet my head in the shower once I&#x27;ve cleaned my body.</li>
            <li> i followed the directions making my hair soaking wet</li>
            <li> so i put a sleeping bonnet on my head and i have been having some rough nights because of my illness</li>
            <li> People were telling me to read the directions carefully and follow the directions to a T.  </li>
            <li> (I use about a quarter size blob on my hair - then finish with a harder hold gel).  </li>
            <li> Heavy usage will leave a white filmly residue.</li>
            <li> When I used this stuff my hair for a wash and go was wet all damn day as if I just stepped out the shower.</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair and by the time it dried, my hair was not wavy in the front with coils in the back.</li>
            <li> While it definitely cut down on frizziness, the product was very heavy overall.</li>
            <li> this is the product I turn to on D.C. summer days that will be brutally humid, because compared to the DevaCurl Light Defining Gel I normally use, this product has firmer hold.</li>
            <li> I cut up to use on my hair instead of a towel which RUINS curls, and then apply after it&#x27;s about halfway dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> A little bit of the product goes a long way so experiment with it</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> I try other products</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews and they say that it does not work for their \\&quot;kinky\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> What I found is that this product does not play well with other products.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very very long way.</li>
            <li> &quot; just apply a little oil to the hair once its dry/almost dry.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very, very, very dry, frizzy, and a mess of spirals that didn&#x27;t even look like curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I am new to the game</li>
            <li> giving my hair a few minutes to air dry</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not super wet.</li>
            <li> I understand this is for black hair, but I have long, very thick, curly and coarse and dry, tending to frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> will make your hair whie and it will dry with white balls in it which is not a good look.</li>
            <li> I have long, &amp;#34;wavy curvy (2B)&amp;#34;, thick, not oily nor too dry, hair.</li>
            <li> My wash and go hairstyle use to be frizzy, looked like I blow dried my hair, and dry!</li>
            <li> Today leave in on wet hair and use a little bit of the curling custard</li>
            <li> I use about half of what I have used of other products.</li>
            <li> It left my hair hard and flakey.</li>
            <li> Ease serum (extra strength) on soaking wet hair 2.)Ecostyler Olive Oil Styling Gel throught my entire head of thick hair in order to seperate/define/and style curls 3.)45mins of diffusing for some serious volume.</li>
            <li> I tried this product at least 7 times and still had the same reults.</li>
            <li> at the price it&#x27;s not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this product is the consistency.</li>
            <li> it not worth the money for</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that a lot of it ended up on my tub.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and nothing helps with the eventual daily frizz---- except this product!!</li>
            <li> People either love it or hate it.\\</li>
            <li> So just be careful not to let it go to waste by letting it slide out of your hands.</li>
            <li> didnt define my curls weighed my hair down, had to use my eco styler gel .</li>
            <li> and i had the window down</li>
            <li> I have black 4c type course hair.</li>
            <li> When I previously reviewed this product (see below).</li>
            <li> Also, the less kinky curly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep trying to find out if it&#x27;s just about using less product.</li>
            <li> You should also end up with less shrinkage as well.</li>
            <li> It almost seems racist to me that black hair care products are being sold way way over market.  </li>
            <li> Several times I twisted my hair before bed and it was still damp the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I use to used the black gel</li>
            <li> Less, about a nickel size amount, and my waves are defined.</li>
            <li> The problem is the eco styler gel leaves the hair slightly \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product leaves some serious white residue and takes a while to rub in.</li>
            <li> I use all my product with by Jamaican Black Castor Oil and the kinky curly does not work well with it&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish it were less money, though.</li>
            <li> I which there was a way to leave less than one star.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this gel is slightly too liquidy to scoop it out of this cup.</li>
            <li> then I ever could with this mess.</li>
            <li> I usually apply hair products in the shower while my hair is still soaking wet, which I neglected to do this time around.</li>
            <li> However when I did used it it leave some flaky mess when after drying</li>
            <li> I did like the smell and texture; however, it wasn&#x27;t a product that lasted too long on my thick curly 3b (Botticelli curls) hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely thick dry hair</li>
            <li> In addition, this product does leave a bit of a residue that eventually did leave little flakes.     </li>
            <li> Shea moisture is an organic African American company and their shampoos, conditioners, lotions are no more than $10, what is wrong with this kinky curly company?</li>
            <li> but i just use a little shine serum once my hair dries and scrunch out the crunchiness</li>
            <li> I must mention that eco styler olive oil gel did provide just a little curl definition, but not to the extent as the kinky curly custard.</li>
            <li> I just put a little in my hand</li>
            <li> A little on the pricey side&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Now that I know to use a little, I feel that the price of the product levels out</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> All you need is a little amount for the front of your hair.</li>
            <li> I just co-wash my hair, apply some Knot Today, a little oil to the scalp and then KCCC and BAM...</li>
            <li> delivery takes a little longer.</li>
            <li> And for the price I paid, I was not expecting to have so little product.</li>
            <li> It takes a few hours to dry as I have thick hair, but it doesn&#x27;t drip so</li>
            <li> The trick is to just be a little heavy handed when it comes to kinky hair.</li>
            <li> very, very thick, coarse, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; after reading several reviews about how the the result of this product left people&#x27;s hair sticky, hard, oily, etc.</li>
            <li> this was a waste of money for me .</li>
            <li> and it made my curls limp.</li>
            <li> so if I have anything heavy</li>
            <li> I will continue to use KCKT by itself, but will never use this again (what a waste of $20!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> otherwise my hair will start to get limp.</li>
            <li> However, it is a messy, product when applied.  </li>
            <li> I order it every few months to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> If anything I would probably choose to use this a few hours before bed in order to avoid needing to do my hair in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the SMELL.</li>
            <li> : You may have a few &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; patches, scrunch &#x27;em a bit and the &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; goes away.</li>
            <li> (do this every few weeks).  </li>
            <li> waste of my money for my hair type</li>
            <li> My curls held for a few hours and then would frizz out.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use this everyday, which helps you, your hair, and your purse.  </li>
            <li> It has lots of slip and does not harden or make my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy getting a gel into a travel tube.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I must say that I give this a major fail.</li>
            <li> I have very tight curls....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the kinky - curly custard product after being disappointed by several other products which did not give my hair much curls</li>
            <li> BUT, when my hair dried, it was hard as a brick.  </li>
            <li> Hard, volumous curls that Frizzup and become limp in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> washing my daughter&#x27;s pressed hair out, while her hair was still damp, I started out by sectioning a chunk of  her hair and applying the gel, and a small bit of grease.  </li>
            <li> Really messy!</li>
            <li> I did my usual Curly Girl Method on washing my hair with a sulfate-free and silicone-free conditioner.</li>
            <li> My length is about 3 inches past shoulders.</li>
            <li> Today in a small section</li>
            <li> but I usually wear it up.</li>
            <li> DO NOT TOWEL DRY OR EVEN T SHIRT DRY, YOU WILL HAVE MAD FRIZZ</li>
            <li> Made my hair hard and stringy</li>
            <li> and I was having a hard time finding something to control all this hair.</li>
            <li> Curls the hair though leaves it hard</li>
            <li> Sometimes it gets hard</li>
            <li> Doesnt give the hard crusty feel of gel.</li>
            <li> However, after a while, it will leave it feeling hard and brittle.</li>
            <li> Every store that sells this marks it up at least $2-3.....</li>
            <li> Mixing it with some oils is a no-no, at least for my hair type 4b/4c.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not course or thick</li>
            <li> Well, I have extremely thick and kinky 4b/4c hair</li>
            <li> The only problem is I hate the smell, but I put some other stuff over it</li>
            <li> and I MEAN HOURS.</li>
            <li> I mean</li>
            <li> The smell is not great, but it hold her curls so well, that we can get past it.</li>
            <li> a very small amount of the custard, rub it onto your palms and fingers and then rake it through your hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product is being sold for the ridiculous price of 27.99.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the price has gotten so expensive, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be repurchasing or trying other products that may compete.</li>
            <li> and then this-it was NOT a good look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought, this product isn&#x27;t worth a penny, my hair looked awful.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive to use everyday.</li>
            <li> Its a small, not well known company why so expensive?</li>
            <li> It leaves a thick, cheesy, bubblegum-type goo on the hair.</li>
            <li> This goo is not attractive.</li>
            <li> I live in the Appalacian Mountains and the cold, thin air an be brutal</li>
            <li> I also gave it four stars because after I tried to reproduce the look the day after I found it quite difficult.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive for what it delivers.</li>
            <li> But, since my hair is difficult to manage (I have a mix of 2c, 3a, 3b hair), I decided to take a risk and purchase the product.</li>
            <li> needless to say i am hooked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not to crazy ab</li>
            <li> Not a problem in the summer, but it may become a problem in cold weather months.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s tempting and some days impossible not to</li>
            <li> :-( .</li>
            <li> Feels weird but works!!</li>
            <li> Well slap my face and call me stupid</li>
            <li> I hate the texture of it.</li>
            <li> Some people hate crunchiness</li>
            <li> Hate it!</li>
            <li> Hate it!</li>
            <li> Hate it!</li>
            <li> Some people hated it!</li>
            <li> , my hair shrunk somewhat awful!!</li>
            <li> I like the results, but the feel of my hair is nasty.</li>
            <li> I like that this does not have any nasty ingredients including silicons.  </li>

            <li> This product is good for keeping the frizz off the curls. I&#x27;m not to crazy ab</li>
            <li> my hair was not a fan. didn&#x27;t work at all. Made my hair hard and stringy</li>
            <li> I rated this product 5 stars because it does everything it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;I am kink-curly natural for 1 year with 5 inches of natural hair when my hair is stretched.&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this product for quite a while but was hesitant to try it because of the price; i chose cheaper products and DIY regimen with natural oils etc.- which worked but was very time consuming with short-acting results.&lt;br /&gt;Finally decided to buy this as i already use the leave-in conditioner in this line and love the results.&lt;br /&gt;A little of this gel really does go along way so it is worth the upfront extra $$$ because you will have it for a while and It SAVES ME A LOT OF TIME with long-lasting results!!! It is well worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is I didn&#x27;t try it earlier!!!</li>
            <li> Humidity is not a problem anymore. I am Caucasian and I have long, super fine, low porosity (healthy) wavy 2b/2c combination hair. I use the curly girl method. I washed with Alberto VO5 moisture milk, and conditioned with Suave Naturals. I applied a quarter sized dollop of Kinky-Curly Knot Today as a leave-in conditioner to damp hair. Then, I applied Kinky-Curly Spiral Spirtz (8 pumps) and Kinky-Curly Curling Custard (a pea size) to damp hair. I let my hair dry. I reapplied a tiny bit of the spritz and custard and let it dry. (I keep a hair journal when I try out new products.) I have been trying to find something to battle the humid Texas summers. It was 102◦F, 78% humidity, and the dew point was 70◦F. I LOVE Kinky-Curly&#x27;s products. They gave me ZERO FRIZZ, super soft, defined, shiny, bouncy curls! My hair was not crunchy, wet-looking or oily! I will buy all the Kinky-Curly products again!</li>
            <li> Happy with all the above purchases.&lt;br /&gt;DCS</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and nothing helps with the eventual daily frizz---- except this product!! Take me about 3 months to go through one of these. It does have a scent to it (while i happen to like) but others may not want it.  While it is wet and greasy when you first put it in your hair it dries upn(without the crunch) and holds the curls perfectly!!&lt;br /&gt;While it is more expensive than the drug store items (it can be found in the drug store too) it is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product Im natural I seen so many review on this product on you tube, so I went and tried this curling custard.  First I put this on my edges it leaves a white film or flake after it dryes, tried to do a wash and go didnt define my curls weighed my hair down, had to use my eco styler gel . this was a waste of money for me .</li>
            <li> I just decided to try this as I&#x27;m not really a gel person but my five year old loves gel in his hair and I wanted a natural product.  My boys and I have 3a and 3b curls and this stuff is awesome.  On my boys I just put it in their damp hair and it  leaves it really shiny with no shrinkage and no flakes, their curls look great.  It does dry kind of hard but for my boys they like the shiny wet look.  For me after my hair is dry or nearly dry I just \\&quot;scrunch out the crunch\\&quot;  and my curls look awesome and they are soft and look shiny and healthy.  I never thought I could even like a gel but I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!! I have kinky 4B type hair and it loves this custard. I just rack it through my hair after I apply the Kinky-curly leave-in conditioner. If you dont have their leave-in I would advise you to use a liquid leavein before apply this product./ Using any othe leave-in that is creamy or not liquid will make your hair whie and it will dry with white balls in it which is not a good look. My sis just puts it on right out the shower without any leave-in and that works for her. My sis has 3B type hair. When we both use this product we have similar results even though we have different hair types. We love it! and I can have up to 3 day hair with it! When sleeping on it I would pineapple your hair though, if you dont the defined kinks and curls will be smooched when you awake. Also only apply while hair is SOAKING wet for best results:)</li>
            <li> Hate it! Hate it! Hate it! What was I thinking when I wanted to buy this product. The label should read that \\&quot;Everyone has different hair texture so this product will only work on those with fine hair and soft natual hair. NOT COURSE hair\\&quot;. I have black 4c type course hair. I used this on damp, and dripping wet hair. I tried this product at least 7 times and still had the same reults. I even tried this product after I cut my perm out and only had natural hair. No curls and just a bunch of goo on my head. On dripping wet hair it took HOURS to dry and I MEAN HOURS. I found that it was better to just wash and condition my hair with Pantene for people of color, and when still wet apply coconut hair grease and Pantene leave in condition, and get more curls then I ever could with this mess. For people that are born with nice curls, this product may works in defining those curls more but for those who are trying to go natural after years of perm, stay away from this products unless you like wasting money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this product at first, but I had seen so many good reviews so I had to try it out. I have natural curly/kinky hair (mostly kinky) and was looking for something that could define the few curls I had when I do I wash and go, and I found it! I felt like this product defined curls I didn&#x27;t know I had! My wash and go hairstyle use to be frizzy, looked like I blow dried my hair, and dry! When I put this on it was a miracle! It not only defined my curls, but also left them moisturized! There was no flaking like many other gels (Eco Styler) and was light and produced beautiful results! I also used the Knot Today Leave in Conditioner before applying the custard gel, which I hear helps also to help define your curls. If you have curly to kinky curly hair and looking for a hair product to use for a wash and go I would say this COULD be the best investment ever! For a wash and go I say this is great! I gave it four stars cause it does leave a white residue after you put it in, but soon as it dries its gone! I also gave it four stars because after I tried to reproduce the look the day after I found it quite difficult. I didn&#x27;t achieve the curl definition like the first day, but I still have to play around with it, I&#x27;ll will make it work!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost four year now. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that compares to it.  I give this product a five star rating! I wish I could give it a ten, if you&#x27;re looking for a good natural hair gel for kinky hair(that tames the hair and leaves it soft) this is it.</li>
            <li> ...this is the BEST. I can&#x27;t stray from it. It curls my hair beautifully, and even gives it a bit of a shine. When using it,a little goes a long way,and it works best when used with the kinky curly knot today conditioner. It does lead to a lot of shrinkage,but I don&#x27;t mind. 5stars.</li>
            <li> Love the product - do not like using a tub - wish there was a pump version.</li>
            <li> Oh, how I love this stuff!  I have blonde curly hair (I think it&#x27;s a 3b - curly but not kinky or spirally).  It&#x27;s non-drying and my husband says it smells like  birthday cake.</li>
            <li> Very good product for natural hair!! Works very well with the Leave In Conditioner. Upon tryng for the first time, do not use alot.  Love the way it leave my hair looking very curly!!!! Great product</li>
            <li> A friend of mind was purchasing this product and I asked her to buy me one just for curiosity.  My first thought was that it was too expensive, but after using it the first week, I realize that I got my monies worth.  I do not have to use it every day, just apply some water and comb, I have been using it for a month now and have no flakes as stated by others. Every one asks me what I am using in my hair it looks so good, as for my friend she did not get the same results I did, I guess it has to do with the texture of your hair.  I find this to be a great product for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! It last in my hair for about a week and that&#x27;s fine with me. I would purchase again along with knot today.</li>
            <li> I used this product along with the Kinky Curly Knot Today and It exceeded my expectations. I will be purchasing more. Please refer to the product link to see my review of the Knot today. It feels so light on my hair and smells really great. [[ASIN:B00128WK4I Kinky Curly Knot Today8 oz]]</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after reading all of the great reviews, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not working for me. I tried this two days in a row and it made my curls limp. It smells great and I was able to get past the fact the consistency was like snot if it would work, but I guess I&#x27;m not a fan of the curling custard. I wish I could return it to Target, but it&#x27;s opened and they won&#x27;t take it back.</li>
            <li> When I previously reviewed this product (see below). I was using wayyyy too much of it and using it over other products that it was not intended to be used over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note- most leave ins that are white will not work under this product. The gel does create a whiteish residue which is heightened by a non clear product used under it. In my case it was Shea moistures curl enhancing smoothie which leaves a bit of a white residue and then this-it was NOT a good look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some alternatives are products such as coconut oil or shea butter which leave minimal white residue (just make sure to warm them in your hands first). And also what I&#x27;ve learned after a while is that with gels they all leave some residue until they dry, ecostyler and even all natural flax seed gel leaves the residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am less focused on having perfectly defined curls and more focused on the health of my hair I started using this again. It works great with my twist outs and if used over the right products and not used in excess gives me a nice defined wash and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review!&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as eco styler gel and more expensive&lt;br /&gt;If you are try to decide between this and eco styler... go with the eco styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I dislike about this product:&lt;br /&gt;-When your hair is wet it has this gross white residue&lt;br /&gt;-It takes 2 hours to begin to dry and for the residue to turn into sort of a reflective clearish residue- Who has 2 hours or time to blow dry, it is suppose to be a wash n GO.&lt;br /&gt;-It takes at least a day to dry completely and for that entire day it is &#x27;tacky&#x27;- This means every time you touch your hair, your boyfriend touches your hair, your dog, the couch touches your hair that person or thing gets a tacky gelish residue on them. I know some women complain about the crunchy feeling but I much much prefer crunchy to tacky goo.&lt;br /&gt;- Because it is tacky the curls can separate into individual strands while you sleep so the next day when you take it out of your cap you can&#x27;t be sure what your curls will look like- mine came out as a still tacky fro with clearish residue everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ughhhhh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much much prefer ecostyler gel, no it doesn&#x27;t smell as good and is not all organic but at least it dries in an hour or so and I can use my leave in conditioner under it without fear of extra white residue. It is much much cheaper at $3.00 per giant bottle and it defines my curls in more or less the same way.</li>
            <li> The thing I have noticed about most users of the KCCC is that they are actually still in their transition phase, mix heritage or their hair is not very \\&quot;kinky\\&quot;. I have been natural for several years now. And had to chop off the &#x27;locs&#x27; just to change up again. So, I decided to use this product and after a week of trying to follow all directions... dripping wet hair (lots of moisturizer).. wide tooth comb...finger styling.etc.. I have not gotten even close to the results described or seen on multiple videos from YouTube. Therefore, I must say that I give this a major fail. In addition, this product does leave a bit of a residue that eventually did leave little flakes.     Wish I could have given this a better review. But I cannot.</li>
            <li> You might as well use Eco Styler Olive Oil Styling Gel for a better result and over less than half the price of this. Its a small, not well known company why so expensive? The products are not even organic? Shea moisture is an organic African American company and their shampoos, conditioners, lotions are no more than $10, what is wrong with this kinky curly company? If you look at the owner she is mixed, her hair is very long, So how would we expect the results that she displayed? Think about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this out for a while since I&#x27;ve heard great things about it but I wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed. I think it&#x27;s for curlies with thicker hair. It&#x27;s use-able but I definitely think it weighs down my hair and makes it too crunchy. I have a lot of very fine, big, curly hair. It&#x27;s not course or thick so if I have anything heavy it takes away all my volume at the top. This works well for definition and if I run it through my soaking wet hair it actually works quite well since then it&#x27;s more evenly spread out. Thus far my all-time favorite though is still Miss Jessie&#x27;s pillow soft hair. It works better to eliminate frizz, not weigh down, not build up, and avoid crunch. If you don&#x27;t have FINE curly hair though I can see this being a great product! Just not quite for me!</li>
            <li> When I first put this \\&quot;custard\\&quot; in my hair, I was pleased to see my hair curl up and it was pretty.  BUT, when my hair dried, it was hard as a brick.  No, it did not flake, but I would like my hair to feel like silk at all times.  If you dont mind having pretty curls but hard hair, then this is the product for you.  I want the best of both worlds.  I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Man...I have to say. Before I ventured out to buy this product I was a YouTube junkie! I heard so many mixed reviews. Some people hated it! Some people LOOVE it! I wanted to get it right the first time. I could not see spending all of that money one a set of hair care products that I hated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to fall in a category where I just like products. So I will say. I do like this product. I use all 3 of the Kinky Curly products in conjuction with one another. The Come Clean Shampoo, The Knot Today Conditioner, and finally the Kinky Curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does work WONDERS for turning your hair into tight coils. I don&#x27;t do the wash and go method. I do the wash, two strand twist and leave in two strand twist for one or two days and then untwist. It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall with this products is that your hair has to be DRIPPING wet. I don&#x27;t particularly care for that. Also, the less kinky curly. The better. Your hair will not turn out hard and will be nice and soft TRUST ME! I have 4B hair that coils/curls up when wet.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product. It made my hair goowy and after it dried, white flakes came off my hair.</li>
            <li> this is the product I turn to on D.C. summer days that will be brutally humid, because compared to the DevaCurl Light Defining Gel I normally use, this product has firmer hold. It does stay a bit crunchy even after releasing the gel cast, which I don&#x27;t love. But the ingredients are top notch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every curling product out on the market except for Kinky Curly, and that&#x27;s because of all the crappy reviews I&#x27;ve read on the product.  I&#x27;ve found that most curling products have just about the same ingredients thatn any other.  They all lay claim to be able to stretch out the hair and hold the curl for a day.....ONE DAY?!?!?  I don&#x27;t know about everyone else, but I don&#x27;t want to put so called light product in my hair everyday because light product everyday turns into a heavy mess magnent by the time for a good washing.  I just dont see how thats healthy for anyones hair.  So, I got to thinking....if I want my daughters hair to be curly and moist, then why not try regular old Curl activator gel and a light application of hair grease.  Well slap my face and call me stupid it WORKED!!!!!  A $3.00 jar of Curl Activator gel along with a light application of hair grease!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my daughter&#x27;s pressed hair out, while her hair was still damp, I started out by sectioning a chunk of  her hair and applying the gel, and a small bit of grease.  Then I gently brushed out the section of hair with a wide paddle brush, and then smoothed her hair out bristle brush.  You continue this process until all the hair has been done.  When you get to the top of the hair you may have to redampen with a spritz of water from a spray bottle before continuing the gel and grease combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been since Friday afternoon on the 15th, and nows it&#x27;s Tuesday the 19th, and her hair is still really curly, soft and moist to the touch.  All it requires in the morning is a finger pick out and voila!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So before you break the bank for this product sprend $3.00 for Curl Activator and $2.00 for hair grease (preferably Bergomont hair grease) and give it a try.  You may be pleasently suprised!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading:-)&lt;br /&gt;I hope this has been helpful....</li>
            <li> This has to be the best gel out there! I have 3b hair and all of the gels i have used dries out my hair. Not this one, it gives you shine, moisture and beautiful bouncy curls its like a miracle worker. I don&#x27;t use it on a daily base since my curls are still perfect the next day. Definitely is a must try product for curly gals.</li>
            <li> I HAVENT GOT MY PRODUCT YET SO I CANT REVIEW IT,BUT I AM GOING TO REVIEW THIS COMPANY SELLING THE PRODUCT,I JUST ORDERED ONE 8OZ OF KINKY CURLY AND ITS TAKING FOREVER FOR ME TO GET!!!!!!!SO IF I LIKE THE PRODUCT IM GOING TO ORDER IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE!!!!!YOU SHOULD TOO IF YOU DONT LIKE WAITING LITERALLY FOREVER!!!</li>
            <li> I have wavy fine grey hair which I can wear  either straight or curly. I thought this produce would enhance my curls, but the only thing it did for me was turn my hair yellow. My hairdresser said &amp;#34;what did you do to your hair?!&amp;#34; She asked me if I was using a different product and I said &amp;#34;yes, I am using the Kinky Curly Curl Custard gel&amp;#34;. I had to have a toner rinse put on my hair to counteract the yellow tones which worked for about a week but then the yellow was back. So, back on the shelf this goes along with the Curl Spritz by Kinky Curly. I believe using heat during the styling of my hair produced some kind of chemical reaction turning my hair yellow when I tried this product for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> This product works SO well on my daughter&#x27;s multi-ethnic hair.  The smell is not great, but it hold her curls so well, that we can get past it. Unfortunately, the price has gotten so expensive, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be repurchasing or trying other products that may compete.</li>
            <li> My hair shrinks with this and my daughter hair does too.This gel also flakes up ALOT so make sure you have clean hair using this.</li>
            <li> I like this curly custard because all I have to do to is spritz some water in the days after the initial application.  One thing though it shrinks my hair a whole lot.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel i&#x27;ve ever used. it defines my 3c curls with no frizz and gives it shine to boot. it dries crunchy but i just use a little shine serum once my hair dries and scrunch out the crunchiness and it leaves me with bouncy shiny curls and people think i have no product in my hair just perfect curls. My entire family is hooked on this and they range from 3a to 4a in hair texture and all love it. Amazing. The knot today leave in is also the best leave in i&#x27;ve ever used i also recommend it, it leaves the hair soft and slippery but not greasy or too weighed down. I just hope they never discontinue or change the formula this line is just wow.</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a natural hair. My hair shrinks about 75% of its normal length. I have 7.5-8.5inches length hair and it looks like 3.0-4.0 length.    I washed my hair with the KC Come Clean, then used the KC Knot Today, and then applied the KC Curling Custard, my hair shrunk somewhat awful!! I had to part my hair in sections and braid it to help with the shrinkage. I did notice that the KC Curling Custard did have an effect on my hair but not enough for me to spend that type of money on it!! Honesty, the Knot Today gave me great curls and definition, BUT my hair already has a natural curl pattern and doesn&#x27;t take much to make it curl. When I apply Fantasia IC gel, it gives me great curls without the shrinkage and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than KC Curling Custard.    I would recommend it if you have 25% shrinkage with your natural hair, but it you have major natural hair shrinkage, I would NOT recommend it.     Overall rating: 3.0</li>
            <li> Forms a casing around curls, when they dry, curls have definition.  I use it with Knot Today and it is a good combination.  My hair is naturally curly, but more so in the back this helps my front curls look more similar to the back.  A little goes a long way.  Pretty sure this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the online price. Every store that sells this marks it up at least $2-3.....A little goes a very very long way. Gives you hold without the flake or build up (that is, if you don&#x27;t use too much).</li>
            <li> I am from the Caribbean so my hair is closest to African American natural hair which is about 2 inches in length; it is thick but not very kinky. When my hair is wet it does not shrink, I get very lose waves on the top of my head while other parts of my hair have no waves. I was skeptical about the kinky - curly custard product after being disappointed by several other products which did not give my hair much curls e.g. eco styler olive oil gel, LA looks curl hair gel etc. none of those products give my hair much curl definition. I must mention that eco styler olive oil gel did provide just a little curl definition, but not to the extent as the kinky curly custard. The kinky curly curling custard will give you curls or waves depending on your hair texture. I myself have several different hair textures; I also must mention that I received a tremendous amount of compliments on my hair whenever I use the product. Only con about the product is that it provides a strong hold, so if you don&#x27;t like a strong hold you may want to use less of the product.  To refresh the next day simply spray hair with water and you are ready to go. The product is more expensive compared to some other products but it is also superior to other products. I have also ordered the kinky curly knot today conditioner, but not used it yet.  KINKY CURLY CURLING CUSTARD WILL GIVE YOU THE CURLS YOU NEVER KNEW YOU HAD!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had been using KCKT as a leave-in conditioner and getting wonderful results. After doing some research, reading the reviews, and going to the Kinky Curly website, I thought I had found the &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3b curls that curl into Shirley temple locks when dry regardless of the products I use. The Curling Custard was the exact opposite. It made my hair very, very, very dry, frizzy, and a mess of spirals that didn&#x27;t even look like curls. I applied it the way the kinky-curly website explained, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. I will continue to use KCKT by itself, but will never use this again (what a waste of $20!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it twice and over-applied the first time...I got it right the second time, but it was a mess!</li>
            <li> Not for my hair!  If you like stringy, wet looking curls, you will like this. I don&#x27;t like that look.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad that I bought it at whole foods so that I can return it. This is not for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It holds the curls you get right out of the shower.  However, you have to be careful not to over gel, it can get sticky.</li>
            <li> To clarify my one-sentence review, here&#x27;s why I say it works for my hair: I use it a little bit more differently than most people I know do. I used to do wash and go but the curl definition was not what I was hoping it would be. My hair loves moisture but it also fine so it doesn&#x27;t like to be coated. I prep with a sulfate free shampoo, conditioner and protein treatment (every 4 weeks). Then, I now use it as a moisturizer and curl definer by whipping it into a mixture with back castor oil, leave-in cream, leave-in conditioner, detangler and shea butter cream. If I&#x27;m doing a twit-out, I use Taliah Waajid&#x27;s curl sealer to finish off the twists. If not, I just add the sealer to my hair as moisture sealer. The result is manageable, soft and defined curls.</li>
            <li> Save your money! Too expensive for what you get.This product is expensive for what it delivers. The product is sticky and it did not hold the shape of my curls for more than a day.</li>
            <li> Okay, first let me say this stuff does WORK! It keeps your curly but its very \\&quot;tackey\\&quot; I like the results, but the feel of my hair is nasty. I don&#x27;t like to touch it after I put the product in, but it does WORK! I am still on the hunt for the purfect curly products.</li>
            <li> This product tames my kinky curly hair like no product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Try it with the shampoo and Knot Today creme rinse.  Removes the frizz and leaves me with soft wavy curls.  I&#x27;m loving my hair for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> Great smell (like sugar cookies!), kinda gross consistency, but it does the job! I use just a little (this is key) to scrunch my waves into curls.  Great for adding texture or for using as a light gel with hair curlers for crazy bounce.</li>
            <li> OMG, love this stuff. I ordered this and could not wait to use it because i heard so many good reviews. The consistency is slimy and jiggly but it is not sticky. I used this with the Knot Today by KC also. The two products work very well together. Only use a little bit of the Knot Today leave in on wet hair and use a little bit of the curling custard and you will have curls coming out of the wazoo. lol This product does not guarantee curls and everyone&#x27;s hair is different but if you don&#x27;t get curly curls your hair will still be soft as ever.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be great for mine and my daughters hair. I will admit the first time I used it I used WAY too much product on both our hair and it came out sticky with flakes and never really dried fully. So I tried again a few months later on my daughters hair only because her curl patter is looser then mine. I used only a little and while the results were better it still left a sticky flaky residue in her hair. So I tried it on a twist out in both our hair and same thing! The flaky residue makes you look like you have dandruff and was just gross. I have a whole unused jar that I have now had for over a year. I just refuse to try it again and at the price it&#x27;s not worth it at all. I ended up making my own flaxseed gel that had MUCH better results and it cost me $1 for the seeds and 15 min of my time to make it.</li>
            <li> great gel, great ingredients, but way too expensive. I make my own gel now and get just as good results. One thing i liked is if i left a bit of the gel out in a separate open container, it would shrink and become very tacky and sticky. very efficient for slicking edges. This was also the first gel i ever used as a primer. now i use my home made flax seed gel for it, but it was very effective. I would wet my face well, apply the gel, and while it was wet spread my foundation over it quickly and blend. worked better that any primer and i have oily skin and acne. it also seemed to make it so i dont break out upon wearing make up. try it out.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair curly and moisturized</li>
            <li> Light, and it really works for over processed hair without drying it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could rate this as a 3.5. I liked it but I didn&#x27;t love it. I love the way that it makes my hair look after styling with it. I hate the texture of it. It feels slimy, goopy on your hands. But whatever is in it that gives it that consistency (I suspect glycerin), its great on my hair. It will leave your hair shiny and with very defined curls. And at the end of the day, that&#x27;s what I want. I would definitely use it again, but it isn&#x27;t my first choice.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product and she found that it worked very well to enhance her natural curl.  She was surprised at how shiny it kept her hair, even after two days.</li>
            <li> Great for twist-outs or wash-and-gos. I use this several times a week, with no flaking or build-up. It has lots of slip and does not harden or make my hair stiff. Consistently produces well defined curls that last for days. A little goes a long way. My first jar lasted for about 3 months!</li>
            <li> i went natural and short...... This Custard is PERFECT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This styling product provides the definition I need without extra stiffness or flaking. The product smells good but doesn&#x27;t overpower my perfume. It&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase--especially for 4a hair...</li>
            <li> So far I like it. I like that after a bit my hair is not sticky or filmy.  Makes it look soft and cared for.</li>
            <li> The custard adds shine as promised and holds well.  I think I may have used a little too much, my hair was hard.  To be fair to the product, I adjusted my rating accordingly.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that gives true 4c Hair coily definition and also useful for when just twirling the hair around the index finger to get curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Section wet or very damp hair apply your leave-in conditioner - use a clear leave-in to avoid white residue - then apply a fingertip of KKCC per section. A little goes a long way.  Wrap head when going to bed and to restyle, spritz hair or place hair 2 seconds under the shower and shake it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The touch is slimy and your hair shrinks but that is what allows the hair to coil and stay moisturized. You can use a big tooth comb and then spritz and shake if you want some more length.  This lasts me about 3 to 5 days without reapplying any product.</li>
            <li> Product is great, but packaging was very poor when i recieved it the  cover was off and product was in the sealed bag! Really messy!</li>
            <li> My favorite natural hair product</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; after reading several reviews about how the the result of this product left people&#x27;s hair sticky, hard, oily, etc. But, since my hair is difficult to manage (I have a mix of 2c, 3a, 3b hair), I decided to take a risk and purchase the product. Since I generally don&#x27;t have that much time in the morning to fix my unruly hair, I experimented with KCCCG on a day that I knew, for sure, that I didn&#x27;t have to step out of my apartment. I did my usual Curly Girl Method on washing my hair with a sulfate-free and silicone-free conditioner. Then, I used a leave-in conditioner and sparingly applied KCCCG  immediately onto my hair. I let my hair air-dry for about 2 hours (the shortest time period that I have ever had to dry my curly hair) and my hair had the same consistency as if I had used a regular gel. However, once I gently scrunched the gel film on my hair, I had the most wonderful results! Regular gel tends to make my hair too hard, stringy, and stiff even after I scrunch the film out of my hair, but KCCCG defined my curls with minimum frizz (or rarely any frizz for that matter) and kept my hair very soft and moisturized. I finally have bouncy, uniform, and shiny curls that do not frizz when I venture  into a humidity-ridden area (or rain/snow...I&#x27;ve tested my hair under all of these weather patterns).  The only complaint I have about this product is the consistency. It has a gooey, but not sticky, feel and it certainly does not look appealing. But, if KCCCG will continue to deliver perfect curls, then I&#x27;m willing to overlook it! As for the smell of the product, it reminds me of a subtle sweet pastry of some sort, but it fades away from my hair almost immediately. The trick to making this product work on your hair is by finding the right amount of product that your hair requires. I use it sparingly (I just dip my fingers into the gel and use whatever is on my finger for each &amp;#34;clumped&amp;#34; curl), but someone else might need more product depending on their hair. Also, a leave-in conditioner is a MUST for this product otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with dry and unruly curls. I can get second day hair with this product, but after two days, I have to use a co-wash otherwise my hair will start to get limp.</li>
            <li> Also from the caribbean and using this product for years. my hair type is a combination of soft to kinky and it is worn naturally. I just put a little in my hand add some water, my hair curl up, run my fingers through and out thhe door.</li>
            <li> I guess I haven&#x27;t found the right amout so my hair doesn&#x27;t look wet all day. I hace loose curls and with it they don&#x27;t look as natural as I wanted them to. I&#x27;ll keep trying to find out if it&#x27;s just about using less product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many curling products for my permed hair and by far&lt;br /&gt;this product is one of my best!  It is clear so no white build up.&lt;br /&gt;It mosturizes with body and great curls. A little on the pricey side&lt;br /&gt;but the outcome of cute, healthy and curly hair is worth it!</li>
            <li> Just starting to go natural and I was having a hard time finding something to control all this hair. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it controls the curl and smells great. Feels weird but works!!</li>
            <li> I understand this is for black hair, but I have long, very thick, curly and coarse and dry, tending to frizzy hair.  It seems my hair has gotten drier and tends to frizz more easily as I have gotten older, and also I miss the tighter, ringlett-like curls my hair used to make as it dried naturally.  I like the way my hair looks better on my trips back East where it is more humid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hairdresser recommended this, and I felt it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try.  It works really well, and probably better than more expensive stuff.  The only problem is I hate the smell, but I put some other stuff over it and I can&#x27;t smell it once it is dry.  It also would be easier to use if it had a pump or was in a tube.  I&#x27;m thinking of trying their detangler, since sometimes I put off washing my hair because I don&#x27;t feel like the hassle of brushing out the tangles - which is a job with my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product for wash and go. Nicely defines curls my hair is usually frizzy.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR WAS SILKY AND SOFT AFTER USING THE PRODUCT,BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR MY HAIR TEXTURE AS TO FORMING  CURLS.I WOULD BUY AGAIN AN USE AS A CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li> I have naturally FRIZZY hair. This product gives me supreme curls &amp; I can&#x27;t believe just how curly it is with this product! I&#x27;d read that it makes hair crunchy, which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I&#x27;m guessing that too much product was used to get the crunch because the minimal crunch I received was entirely eliminated by blowing dry regularly after taking off my diffuser. (In full disclosure, I also used Oidad frizz product). I love this product &amp; am a convert that will live by this product FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I use a $5 container of gel that is twice as large as this and provides better hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just cut my hair to grow in it&#x27;s natural state and I used the Kinky Curly custard to define my curls and boy it did the job.  My curls were very defined and it kept my hair moisturized for at least 3 days.  I oiled my hair before using the curling custard so there was no crunching to my hair when it did try.  The only thing is that it takes a while to try and it is a little pricey so its good that a little goes a long way with this product.  I do plan to  purchase this item  again.</li>
            <li> This styling gel is amazing, specially when you use the blow dyer refuser.</li>
            <li> Great for my 3c/4a hair. Gives me soft shiny defined curls. Smells like cake too! Use this for all my wash and gos</li>
            <li> When I first tried using the curling custard, I also had some of the complaints of others such as flaking, hard hair, shrinkage and thought it cost too much. Well now that I know that if my hair is white flaking, there&#x27;s something else on my hair interfering. If its hard, I used way too much, so I may rinse a bit off. I enjoy the long lasting shine for days. Now that I know to use a little, I feel that the price of the product levels out so i get my money worth.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I&#x27;ve found for my moderately curly hair. It&#x27;s easy to overdo it and get crunchy curls though so be careful. I use several small dollops instead of a couple of bigger ones to make sure I&#x27;ve got even, but thin, coverage and I never brush. I scrunch. When my hair is short I don&#x27;t even have to dry it and this stuff still holds the curls. When my hair is longer I have to use a diffuser dryer to keep the weight from pulling out the curls.  i make darn sure I&#x27;ve got a back-up tub before I&#x27;m half empty on the open one. It&#x27;s a pain to take 4 ounces on an airplane though. It&#x27;s not easy getting a gel into a travel tube. I wish they made a travel size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It is my #1 natural hair product. I wish it was a little cheaper but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I used it for a wash and go recently and got wonderful results. Please understand, with THIS particular product, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. Believe me. It says right on the bottle that if you have a kinky hair type (I have type 4 coily/ziggly hair), you should only apply this while your hair is still dripping wet, AFTER you have applied your oils and conditioner of choice, finger detangled and splash-rinsed your hair after. DO NOT TOWEL DRY OR EVEN T SHIRT DRY, YOU WILL HAVE MAD FRIZZ IF YOU DO. Only towel blot AFTER your hair has completely set and already has the custard in. This way you won&#x27;t have frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a very small amount of the custard, rub it onto your palms and fingers and then rake it through your hair. Once you&#x27;ve gotten it all over your hair, shake it around and then go sit under your dryer for about 30min until it is completely dry, OR if you don&#x27;t have a dryer to sit under, use your blow dryer and diffuser attachment to dry your hair. After it is completely dry, get your blow dryer again and use the concentrated attachment and gently pull at your hair but DON&#x27;T comb your fingers through it. Just grab and dry at the roots, the goal is to stretch/elongate the curls. Style how you like after that. The result should be a nice hold yet still soft to the touch with lots of moisture. You should also end up with less shrinkage as well.</li>
            <li> The best gel (of many many I have used with my curly hair$</li>
            <li> Curls the hair though leaves it hard</li>
            <li> I think this curling gel for the quality of it. It defined my curls but also had more shrinkage and the curls only lasted for 1 day. I have natural 4b hair.</li>
            <li> leaves chunky residue in your hair and barely gave me a curl. It may be my type of hair but I found another solution to my curling needs.</li>
            <li> I brought this product to use with my natural curly girl look,the only thing is dont over use,and be careful what you use it with so you dont get a whit build up..other then that I love it to smooth my edges and it smells good</li>
            <li> This product felt like glue in my hair and took forever to dry. I ended up having to wash it out of my hair and it also did not define my 3c/4a curly hair, it just sat on top of it and weighed it down.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Whole Foods. I have been fully transitioned natural for 6 months. I have 4a/4b hair.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really like this product for me. I have tried it about 3 different times and I don&#x27;t see much change in my hair. I have a former co-worker that uses it and she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It it not worth the money for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am new to the game and I may not be doing something right.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product is being sold for the ridiculous price of 27.99.  It almost seems racist to me that black hair care products are being sold way way over market.  Buyers....research your options...this product can be purchased at Target Stores....nearly half the cost...if you cannot find it in their stores you can certainly order online at target.com.  By the way this is a very good product; nothing is worth the target!![[ASIN:B00449Q6I8 Kinky-Curly Curl Custard Gel - 8 oz]]</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks now.  I have type 4a natural hair.  I use it when I twist, coil, or just wear a wash-n-go.  The Curling Custard will hold my hair styles.  However, it is a messy, product when applied.  It takes several (5+) hours to air dry (will dry quicker if using a hair dryer).  Several times I twisted my hair before bed and it was still damp the next morning.  With that said; this is the best product I have found that is ALL natural and holds MY hair.  Once dry the custard is firm but not hard and does not flake.  My twists look fresh for upto five days and twist-outs hold up nicely as well.  It washes out quickly and does not leave a residue or buildup.  Also blends well with the hair oils I use (coconut, almond, jojoba...).  I enjoy using this product and am glad it was recommended to me. I hope you enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li> Really defines curls when hair is wet.  But when hair is totally dried after the application, it&#x27;s a hot mess! Also, It is very sticky.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my daughter&#x27;s curls.</li>
            <li> Great product, but Shea Moisture&#x27;s gel souffle is a little better and cheaper! But that&#x27;s just for my curls, this could be your product!</li>
            <li> For perfect twist outs, this is the gel of choice.</li>
            <li> I have 3A moderately curly/wavy red/Scottish hair with a high frizz factor and this stuff is amazing.  I try other products but I always go back to this. You do have to be careful not to over do it but once you figure out how much works for your hair, it&#x27;s great.  I like that this does not have any nasty ingredients including silicons.  When my hair is dry, I can use a wide tooth comb to fluff the curls and they are very soft.  I still can&#x27;t use a brush but I think for me that&#x27;s just wishful thinking.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I order it every few months to style my hair.  It keeps my hair very soft and holds my curls in place.</li>
            <li> I have mixed curly hair (black and asian) which curls pretty well but tends to get frizzy. I usually apply hair products in the shower while my hair is still soaking wet, which I neglected to do this time around. Instead, I applied it to damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It defined my hair exceedingly well, but it was extremely brittle and I didn&#x27;t like the overall look. However, my hair stayed well defined the morning after I slept on it (without covering or preparing my hair in any way) and was without dents or flattened spots. It also lost the crunchy texture that it had on the first day. If anything I would probably choose to use this a few hours before bed in order to avoid needing to do my hair in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the SMELL. I really didn&#x27;t like the smell, but I tolerated it. It&#x27;s really strong and very sweet. It&#x27;s definitely hit or miss.</li>
            <li> The best gel I&#x27;ve used thus far. I use to used the black gel but my friend recommended this gel &amp; I&#x27;m glad I tried it. It&#x27;s for any hair types &amp; it last long. All you need is a little amount for the front of your hair. It really holds down the front of my hair all day.</li>
            <li> I Love it!!! The results are amazing, my hair looks great and smooth, it&#x27;s not hard and scrunching looking like GEL and Spay. It doesn look oily either. Just scrucnh it up after it drys and you will get the best results. Curls/Waves are beautiful. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I actually really like this product. I have read other reviews and they say that it does not work for their \\&quot;kinky\\&quot; hair. Well, I have extremely thick and kinky 4b/4c hair and it works just fine for me! What I found is that this product does not play well with other products. I just co-wash my hair, apply some Knot Today, a little oil to the scalp and then KCCC and BAM...I have nice ringlets all around. The trick is to just be a little heavy handed when it comes to kinky hair. Apply in sections and dont go light on this product. Yes it is a little sticky but once fully dry its fine. And yes, you can achieve the same results with other (cheaper) gels but my wash and gos last longer (2-3 days) with KCCC. So its worth the buy if you know how to use it correctly. Oh, and to avoid the \\&quot;crunch\\&quot; just apply a little oil to the hair once its dry/almost dry. The only reason why this product gets 4 stars is because it takes forever to dry!</li>
            <li> After trying a variety of curly hair products, I found that ACTUALLY works with my type of hair. I noticed my hair is not crunchy, yet still holds the curl throughout the day-even in humid weather! It is easy to apply and works great, I suggest giving it a shot if you are looking for a good hold without the crunch &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> After my big chop, I needed to define my curl pattern for my 4c hair. This product defined my curls and allowed me to rock my twa with ease.  I always have a jar open and one on the shelf... Use this with the Knot Today product in the same line of Kinky Curly family.</li>
            <li> I have long, &amp;#34;wavy curvy (2B)&amp;#34;, thick, not oily nor too dry, hair. I have been using this for over a year now. I love it! As I approached my thirties, my hair was so drab and lifeless and I found myself not wanting to style it more and more frequently. I really wanted an option for &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; hair. Regular use of this custard and my hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I use it (in case it helps someone with similar hair):&lt;br /&gt;1) I comb my hair in the shower and then I scrunch my hair a ton so that I don&#x27;t need to dry with any kind of towel. If you do need to towel dry, stay away from terry cloth towels as they cause frizz.&lt;br /&gt;2) Then I use the Kinky-Curly &amp;#34;Knot Today&amp;#34; as a leave-in (scrunch it in).&lt;br /&gt;3) I do my face products (toner, BHA, serum... etc) giving my hair a few minutes to air dry so it&#x27;s not super wet. Still pretty wet, but not &amp;#34;just got out of the shower&amp;#34; wet.&lt;br /&gt;4) I scoop up custard product and scrunch it in. I have experimented a lot with the amount. My 2B hair seems to react the way it should (keeping in mind that I have long hair so I use more than someone with short hair). Less, about a nickel size amount, and my waves are defined. More, about a quarter size, and I&#x27;ve got bounce with the definition. Depends on what I&#x27;m going for that day.&lt;br /&gt;5) This is the most important step for my 2B hair; I DO NOT touch it until it is completely dry. I do not run my fingers through it or toss it from side to side. I know it&#x27;s tempting and some days impossible not to, my hair takes a couple of hours to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once dry: You may have a few &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; patches, scrunch &#x27;em a bit and the &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; goes away. Don&#x27;t keep combing and touching your hair all day, you&#x27;ll lose curl/definition/waves with any product the more you touch your hair (2B hair I mean specifically).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the sweet smell of it and I find it works better on my wavy curvy hair than any &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; type productI have tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair loves it.</li>
            <li> Really like this product!  The claims on what it does for the hair are&lt;br /&gt;true and I am receiving wonderful comments about how my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I decided to go natural a few months ago, so I tried Mixed Chicks hoping to preserve the natural curls I have after washing my hair. Well, to no avail, it did not work. One day a friend recommended Kinky Curly, and it did just what I wanted it to do and have received many compliments on my hair since. My hair is multi-textured; the back center of my hair is courser than the front and sides, an issue Mixed Chicks could not address. Kinky Curly maintains the curls all over, and I can finally get up in the morning, give my hair a good shake, and go.  My hair now retaines the curls it has immediately following a wash. I love Kinky Curly and can&#x27;t believe it took this long to discover it.</li>
            <li> great stuff good buy.</li>
            <li> As always great great great product!  If you have frizzy curly and coarse hair, this does wonders. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to buy from here on end.😁😁💖💖</li>
            <li> I just got this product this weekend. I used it on my daughters hair last night with the Hicks edge control and I&#x27;m in love so far. She woke up with shiny, soft curls and her hair wasn&#x27;t greasy. My daughter has extremely thick dry hair and I&#x27;ve tried everything. I pray this continues to work. I was told to use it with Knot Today Kinky custard.</li>
            <li> After reading tones of reviews, I realized that this product was the C of the LOC method.  The crunchiness and dryness a lot of people experienced were due to the O being left out after applying the KC Leave-In/Detangler.  To prevent those 2 from happening, I added in the O and smoothed it in from root to tip before doing the same with the KC Curling Custard and got amazing results.  It gave just enough hold without the crunch.  My curls are more defined, frizz-free and shiny and it delivered on its promise to elongate them.</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c hair type and I love this!  I used it for the first time last weekend and I love it. I was nervous at first, but not anymore. In order for you to get the full effect of this product you have to  use only the shampoo  and  the conditioner that goes with it. I live it. My hair came out so pretty. Curly all over.</li>
            <li> I have to give this a five.  It really gives me the look I am looking for.  It leave your hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Everyone tells me how much &amp;#34;more curly&amp;#34; my hair looks with this. I have naturally curly hair, boticelli type curls, and have tried several products that don&#x27;t come close to this as far as definition. I love the way my curls are defined and not frizzy. It&#x27;s not a wet type look either which I appreciate. I only use about a nickel size to quarter size amount on fairly wet hair, that&#x27;s plenty. I diffuse after to almost dry. My length is about 3 inches past shoulders. It works even better with a small amount of leave in conditioner applied first. Seriously, best curl definition ever!! I did read other reviews and agree, if you use too much you will have slick hair. It&#x27;s obvious by feeling it you don&#x27;t need much so using your own judgement will go a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is very good for separating out my curls and holding them.  It works best when my  hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Does not leave your hair crunchy. Nice curls and soft hold. No frizz.</li>
            <li> For all you 4 b/c naturals listen up.  This product works great ONLY if you have reached a level of hydration;  so the state your hair is in prior to adding the KCCCG (Kinky Curly Curl Custard Gel)  is that state it will be in after adding the KCCCG.  I have 4b / 4c hair and I tried this product before years ago with dismal results (NOTE:  I also tried many other &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; products and none of them worked).  I thought, this product isn&#x27;t worth a penny, my hair looked awful.  Thankfully I was experimenting at home on the weekend and just washed it out and did a protective style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t heard of the Max Hydration Method look it up; using this method the KCCCG worked like a charm.  I have taken a modified version that is much shorter, but I am having great results.  Quickly, I start with a Cherry Lola Caramel Treatment, let that sit for 1.5 to 2 hours (do this every few weeks).  Just about every day (don&#x27;t combine with the Cherry Lola Treatment) I do a clarifying rinse of Apple Cider Vinegar and water 1:1 ratio.  Then I do a sodium bentonite clay mixture and let that sit for about 15 minutes.  I rinse that in the shower.  After I get out I apply Kinky Curly Knot Today in a small section then the KCCCG to that same section.  I work through my hair and my hair has LIFE!!!  Once my hair completely dries the KCCCG is no longer visible as my hair has soaked it up. My curls are define and my hair is protected.  It takes a few hours to dry as I have thick hair, but it doesn&#x27;t drip so I can go about my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick recap of my regimen.&lt;br /&gt;Daily - ACV rinse, leave on for 15 minutes; then Clay rinse, leave on for 15 minutes; Kinky Curly Knot Today then Kinky Curly Curl Custard Gel&lt;br /&gt;Every 2-3 Weeks Cherry Lola Caramel Treatment, leave on for 1.5 - 2 hours.  Then clay rinse, KCKT, KCCCG.&lt;br /&gt;I will also steam my hair about once a month with a deep conditioner.  Especially during summer months when I am swimming.</li>
            <li> Impressive, but I need more of it for my hair</li>
            <li> for my hair type this product did not work for me. However when I did used it it leave some flaky mess when after drying</li>
            <li> I have type 4 hair and this stuff does not work for MY kinky curly hair. It has a gel-like texture that I also do not like and a flakey residue that makes it far from worth the price. I only gave it one star because maybe it works for other hair types.</li>
            <li> Oh, you don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ve tried to make this product work. When I look back now, I wished I would have known better. Love, that it&#x27;s a natural product and smells pretty good too. But didn&#x27;t elongate my curls, my curls didn&#x27;t pop, and had no real curl definition. It actually made my 3b curls which are already tight, shrink even more. Gave this product time, maybe to change the texture/health of my hair..didn&#x27;t work.  But God is good, found the Camille Rose Naturals Line and my curls are really elongated &amp; my curls pop. When I use CR Curl Maker~which looks like the Kinky Curly Gel...but the consistency and ingredients is what has separated the boys from the men. The Camille Rose Curl maker gel has a much stickier and little bit thicker consistency..and somehow that consistency and formula just works for my hair. Have never been so satisfied in my life.</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended and I was so happy to try it on my short natural hair. I walked in to my hairdresser with this product and she started laughing and told me I would have been better off with a tub of cheap eco styler gel and by Jove she was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It smells great&lt;br /&gt;- It has a nice consistency&lt;br /&gt;- Did not leave my hair feeling \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It did NOT work for me as my short afro would not curl or do anything while when I used the eco styler and could clearly see curls forming. The problem is the eco styler gel leaves the hair slightly \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This product leaves some serious white residue and takes a while to rub in. If you use too little then it definitely does not work and if you use more to try and get any type of curl definition then you end up with white flakes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Mixing it with some oils is a no-no, at least for my hair type 4b/4c. I use all my product with by Jamaican Black Castor Oil and the kinky curly does not work well with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Verdict&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A waste of my money for my hair type but my niece did get some decent result using this product (free bottle for her). However, she defers to the eco styler from which she says she gets better definition of curls on her 4a/4b type hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4b/4c hair and this product didnt work very well for me. It left my hair hard and flakey.</li>
            <li> KCC is the new creamy crack. I freaking love this stuff! Easy to use and dont have to use a lot to get the results you want! My favorite part about this product is that I no longer *have* to do braid out or twist outs. I have natural 4 something hair so anything that lets me co wash my hair and apply to it without further styling is GREAT. The pros to this product really do surpass everything that I have done to my hair naturally so far. This is including ecostyler which lots of people compare frequently because of their prices. My routine is a co-wash followed by a leave in and then re-wet hair while applying product in sections (the bottle directions). My hair is an inch or so past my shoulders and it takes me about 1 hour total to complete since I also wash myself in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reserve time to let my hair air dry before leaving the house because I fear blow dryer frizz. I maintain softer curl definition on the 2nd day but I usually wear it up. An absolute staple. Also to update my original review I no longer co wash. I use low sulfate shampoo because using gel regularly causes build up and makes it hard to style.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen any reviews that factor climate into the effectiveness of this product, but trust me - if you have highly porous hair (like I do) and you live in a high-altitude or an extremely humid climate, this product may present some problems for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the product relies exclusively on the humectants for moisture and softness (there are no oils in it), the amount of water in the atmosphere will determine whether or not this product moisturizes effectively.  If you live in an extremely dry climate, your hair will be extremely dry because there is so little moisture in the atmosphere. If you live in a very humid climate, then your hair might be limp or extremely puffy and difficult to style because of the moisture overload. Also, having too much water in your hair at all times could weaken the strands and cause them to break. So, if your area has climate extremes, you might want to avoid this product. I live in Southern California, so the weather isn&#x27;t that big a factor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, while I consider this product EXTREMELY expensive, it is something I would use again, just because it works very nicely for me and has helped me retain significant length (my hair is 4b).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a hold product, rather than a curl definer. I apply the product, braid or twist my hair and let it dry. I find that I get really good hold, my hair is extremely hydrated because of the intense humectant properties, and I get lots of volume. There is some crunch, but I&#x27;m conditioned to believe that crunch &#x3D; lasting hold, so I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even in comfortably moist weather, It might not work for everyone for a variety of other reasons, largely because everyone&#x27;s idea of a good hair day is different.  Some people want their curls to be completely and totally defined at all times (I don&#x27;t - I like some frizz).  Some people hate crunchiness (I don&#x27;t mind it). Others complain about shrinkage (eh - what can you do?). No one product can satisfy everyone&#x27;s individual concept of \\&quot;dream\\&quot; hair, but for the amount of money this costs, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect greatness.  I would say that if the $20+ price tag doesn&#x27;t bother you, you don&#x27;t have any exalted expectations and you live in a mild climate, then give it a try. Otherwise, Ecostyler gel mixed with curl activator works pretty similarly and costs less than half as much.</li>
            <li> This product I constantly heard about on all the blogs and YouTube videos how great it was. I kept putting it off purchasing it until now. I wish I still kept putting it off. The first time I used it my hair curled tightly however it was tacky after I finished putting it in my hair and when it was dry it was stiff as well. It had a nice shine but i didn&#x27;t like it for me so I will try it again but I don&#x27;t see myself buying it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Just the right amount of conditioning and hold to keep curls soft and controlled without a bunch of weight or crunchiness.</li>
            <li> This is a product I use often. The results I get are pretty consistent. If I do not want to reapply products the gel reactivates when wet I just wet my head in the shower once I&#x27;ve cleaned my body. Then I use a tshirt to blot dry my hair. If your hair is crunchy just scrunch it a bit. A little bit of the product goes a long way so experiment with it a few times before you give up I find a lot of people give up on it to quickly. You have to find the right amount of product for your hair type, style, and texture. I also found my curls look better if I air dry. It never looks good when I blow dry with this product. I mostly wash and go so this is right up my alley. I am not one of those lucky ladies that has good looking second day hair.</li>
            <li> does not do much for my natural hair but the smell is nice and its silky. delivery takes a little longer.</li>
            <li> product is great...i love this stuff does wonders for my 4c hair... however it is a very small amount... would be great for gym bag</li>
            <li> Great gel for kinky curly coarse hair. Wish it were less money, though. Too expensive to use everyday.</li>
            <li> Since year ago, I have fall in love with this line, specially this product. I just like how it looks on my hair. Have been using the big one, but this time I bought this for travelling purposes.</li>
            <li> The container was sweaty. The product does not work! It does not even lay down the fine baby hairs on the side of my face. It leaves a thick, cheesy, bubblegum-type goo on the hair. This goo is not attractive. I would never, ever recommend this product to anyone. I which there was a way to leave less than one star. Beware. Buyer, beware.</li>
            <li> This product is great!! I have 3a/3b shoulder length hair that&#x27;s easily weighed down by most products. My hair needs a product with hold, or it gets flat and frizzy. After reading tons of reviews, I decided to try this product. The vanilla scent is light, and dissipates quickly. I am pretty sensitive to fragrance, and this didn&#x27;t bother me. I put the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; (it&#x27;s like snot!!) in my hair after conditioning and rinsing, and combed it thru. I dipped two fingers in the gel 3-4 times, and used what coated them (not scooped), evenly throughout my hair. I diffused my hair, and my curls became bouncy, shiny, and defined! I like my hair big and bouncy, not flat nor crunchy. I use Devacurl No-poo and One Condition, but will try the KC line when I run out. I highly recommend this product...works great for hair like mine!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products since going natural two years ago. i bought this product a week ago and tried it on my hair the day after i got it. i followed the directions making my hair soaking wet then i put the product in my hair and immediately i knew that i found exactly what i was looking for. it did not take long to dry and it had a radiant shine.. and body. i was driving with my mom in the car with me and i had the window down and i said look mom my curls are blowing in the wind! my hair is considered coarse but it is beautiful with this product. ok..so i put a sleeping bonnet on my head and i have been having some rough nights because of my illness but i woke up the next morning with a beautiful curly..shiny fro. i was amazed.  needless to say i am hooked and i can cleanout both of my cabinets full of those other products i have been testing. no flakes andno residue...i love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loooovee this product! 4c hair texture and when used as described it really leaves my hair feeling smooth and moisturizeed for dayssssss. Love it love it love it! Cons: It&#x27;s a bit pricey. Takes a whilllee to dry. Works well for me though. I do my twist outs with it and without it. When my hair get&#x27;s dry because of the heat here in the Caribbean, I just spritz and my hair is revitalized. It really has contributed to the growth in my hair as the more moisture affects it, the healthier it is for growth. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I just got this and I absolutely love it! I did a quick wash and go before work. My hair came out wonderful! No white flecks ( I used JBCO as my sealer ). My curls are popping and my hair is actually bigger AND all my frizzies are tamed. I live in the Appalacian Mountains and the cold, thin air an be brutal but this will definately come to the rescue!! My wife also uses this for her curly hair, she has 2c/3a hair !</li>
            <li> I use this product off and on.  It makes my hair look different depending on the length.  Sometimes it gets hard but I think that depends on if I use too much or not.  I find I have to wash my hair more often to avoid flakiness.  Overall, I love the curl pattern/look it gives me and can overlook all the negatives.</li>
            <li> I can not tell you how many products I have bought for my curly hair. I have fine hair with spiral curls, I have to say every time I use Kinky curls my hair looks amazing and I love that my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out like when I used Gel. Keeps frizz under control.</li>
            <li> People were telling me to read the directions carefully and follow the directions to a T.  Well, I did and I cried when it was time to go to work. I have a mixture of 3B and 3C hair.  It made my hair crunchy and it straighten my curls.  I could have done better with conditoner only.  I went to a local Beauty Supply Store and was looking for another product for my curls and the owner asked me, \\&quot;What is the deal with Kinky Curly Custard and the serum?  People either love it or hate it.\\&quot;  I told the owner \\&quot;I am one of the ones who hates it.\\&quot;  I also talked to my co-workers who are natural and they gave the Custard a big thumbs down.  I expected  more because I like Kinky Curly Knot Today but this custard was a big thumbs way down.  With the rating system here on Amazon the one star I have to give the product is</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading that it was a good product for my curl type, 3a. The directions for this product are VERY SPECIFIC, and be sure to follow, or else your hair will look greasy and gross. While it definitely cut down on frizziness, the product was very heavy overall. I only wash my hair once a week, and I feel like the product worked better on &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; hair than &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; hair. This would probably work better for someone who had drier hair than I do. I will finish the jar but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  I have anglo, wavy hair -- and let me tell you this stuff works wonders.  It helps transform my waves into better clumps and adds more of a spiral shape.  Plus it smells just like marshmellows!!  It did take some experimenting to figure out the proper amount for my hair type (I use about a quarter size blob on my hair - then finish with a harder hold gel).  It also works great with the Kinky Curly Knot Today leave in conditioner and detangler.  But caution - too much can cause a producty feel that will weigh down finer hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the jar open!!!! Once I get it opened I&#x27;ll post a product review!</li>
            <li> Kinky Curly more than met my expectations.  Keeps hair moisturized &amp; soft.  No flaking.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This gel is life. I have used garnier fructise, eco styler, pro style, clear ice and this beats them all. If you are doing the max hydration method, but thinking of using a different gel, dont switch this out if you can afford to try it. It is small for the price but still worth it. This gel does a great job of holding my hair. I no longer have a giant frizzy afro. This helped my curls to stay elongated. My hair also wasnt turning white after using it. My only complaint is that a lot of it ended up on my tub. The consistency of this gel is slightly too liquidy to scoop it out of this cup. It should be packaged in a squeeze bottle. So just be careful not to let it go to waste by letting it slide out of your hands. I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I feel like this should be better for the cost. I followed the owner&#x27;s instruction video. The curl pattern was okay... I didn&#x27;t have any white residue, but left my hair feeling stiff and crunchy. Then, if I Spritz WIth water it would soften up. But only while wet. Made me look like a have a Jerri curl. :-( . Maybe Just not for me. I may finish the jar or give it away.</li>
            <li> Hair Type: Somewhere between a 3A and a 3B.&lt;br /&gt;Products used before (OLD REGIMINE): 1.)Frizz Ease serum (extra strength) on soaking wet hair 2.)Ecostyler Olive Oil Styling Gel throught my entire head of thick hair in order to seperate/define/and style curls 3.)45mins of diffusing for some serious volume. Results....Hard, volumous curls that Frizzup and become limp in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Regimine: 1.)KC Come Clean Shampoo(Skipped the Knot Today conditioner and used my old no name brand)2.) Kinky Curly Custard Gel on my soaking wet hair(didnt use nearly as much as I do the Ecostyler Gel) 4. 30-45 mins of diffusing for some volume. Used my Nexxus Hair spray while diffusing. Results:.... Big Luscious curly hair that looked almost exactly like Taren916 on youtube. Im happy with the product, but only gave it 4 stars because it will take a few practices to produce 5 star results .  I think Ill pick up the Knot today Conditioner to see if it produces even better results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have thick course kinky hair. It holds your curl and leaves them looking the same all day long. Great product!</li>
            <li> Doesnt give the hard crusty feel of gel. Gives well defined curls which feel soft and natural to touch.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. However, it takes several different application methods to learn what actually works for you. I&#x27;m one of the rare curly headed girls who LIKES &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; gel best because it is the only thing that actually keeps my hair from frizzing...until I found this stuff! I have very tight curls....very, very thick, coarse, frizzy hair. So, when I want to try to &amp;#34;loosen it up&amp;#34; I dry my hair in an old t-shirt I cut up to use on my hair instead of a towel which RUINS curls, and then apply after it&#x27;s about halfway dry. If I want my natural curls, I put this in when it&#x27;s dripping wet and let it dry in my t-shirt towel...I did NOT like this method at first bc it made it oily, but realized I applied way too much. But now, it makes it so UNBELIEVABLY soft, and my curls are tight, SOFT, and NOT frizzy, and the curls are way more defined. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this product over the summer after I did my BC. I really didn&#x27;t know what to purchase because I am fairly new to being natural. I seen someone used this product on YouTube and I thought &amp;#34;Hey, I think I want to try this!&amp;#34; Shipping was fine. It got to me within the time quoted. The product itself is what really makes me a little bit wishy-washy. THIS PRODUCT DEFINES YOUR CURLS SO WELL! However, after a while, it will leave it feeling hard and brittle. And for the price I paid, I was not expecting to have so little product. So it is really up to you if you want to purchase this product. I never will again.</li>
            <li> I did like the smell and texture; however, it wasn&#x27;t a product that lasted too long on my thick curly 3b (Botticelli curls) hair. My curls held for a few hours and then would frizz out. This is with using a leave in conditioner prior to applying the custard.</li>
            <li> This product is a great product for Wash N. Go&#x27;s.  I use it as a stand alone product after I have applied leave in conditioner.  It is a humectant so it prevents frizz.  The trick with this product is to use in moderation.  Heavy usage will leave a white filmly residue.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this for her super tight curly (almost kinky) Irish hair.  It works great, but I give it 4 stars because it is so expensive, and I don&#x27;t see anything on the label that would explain the price tag.  We continue to buy it thought, which is a testament to how good it works!  She gets great definition, and the hold can last a few days with minor touch-ups.</li>
            <li> im african american with natural hair 4/c and it made my curls pop i love this poroduct i would recommend any one going natural try this will be buying it more and far as for the price i thought at first it was to high but once i put it in my my hair i had to say i did get my money worth.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and low porosity. When I used this stuff my hair for a wash and go was wet all damn day as if I just stepped out the shower. Nope. I prefer Ecostyler and FSG which are way cheaper. .</li>
            <li> does not do what it says it would do.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product because I actually love the look of my hair when it&#x27;s wet. My hair gets wavy in the front and coiled/curly in the back. I put this in my hair and by the time it dried, my hair was not wavy in the front with coils in the back. I literally looked like Sideshow Bob! I would share the pics but it&#x27;s too embarrassing.  I would not go so far as to say that doesn&#x27;t work for any 4a/4b hair, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This product has been instrumental in bringing back my natural curl. I love it.</li>
            <li> Holds curls for days, no frizz.</li>
            <li> This gel is great! I love it</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t any better than the dozens of products I&#x27;ve bought over the years.  It went into a drawer with the rest of the just ok hair products</li>
            <li> Exactly as described &amp; fast delivery</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully in natural short hairstyles, but keep in mind you must use it on very wet hair.  Not a problem in the summer, but it may become a problem in cold weather months.  I typically do my hair prior to heading into our spare room to do my 4 am workout.  My hair is typically dry enough after the 75-80 min workout and preparation for work.  I use a dryer set on low for days when I need to leave quickly.</li>
            <li> I have VERY curly, thick but fine hair and have tried a multitude of products over the years. This product is awesome! Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy, but defines and reduces frizz. Doesn&#x27;t take much either. I use about half of what I have used of other products.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  I get clean, crisp, shiny curls.  They don&#x27;t flake, are not hard, and they hold until the net day.  My whole head has curly curls, not just some parts.  They are not sticky, and you hair is not thick.  I&#x27;ve tried soooo many of these products that only claim to do what this one actually does.  The next day, all I do is spray water infused with leave in conditioner, and fluff my hair.  You don&#x27;t need to use this everyday, which helps you, your hair, and your purse.  This, is my HG of curly curls for me, and I highly recommend it as someone who&#x27;s been in the trenches with the myriad of other products!!!  Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Great item! Is perfect</li>
