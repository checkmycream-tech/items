            <li>love the way it smells, love the way it doesn&#x27;t run out of moisturizing steam midday........</li>
            <li>This is the best overall lotion that prolongs your tan, moisturizes your skin, and has a refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the stuff she was getting off the shelf at most discount stores.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion about a month ago, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>absolutely LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Get it, try it, enjoy it!</li>
            <li>The scent is fine, however I&#x27;m more into the vanilla/warm scents.</li>
            <li>Love the light fragrance, too.</li>

            <li>I like to get if from Lotions2go because I receive my products very quickly.</li>
            <li>The key to beautiful skin is in the moisturizer that you use and Hempz is definitly that moisturizer.</li>

            <li>It smells fabulous</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great especially for after tanning.  </li>

            <li>but it is not overpowering, just a clean, fresh scent.</li>

            <li>It is really hydrating and lasts a long while, plus it smells good.</li>
            <li>I used this lotion when i was pregnant and not only did i NOT get stretch marks, but the dr.s would always compliment the scent!!!!  :-)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great before and after tanning because with this product and your regular tanning lotion, you receive the ultimate tan.</li>
            <li>I have been using Hempz hand lotion for the last 7 years and have been extremely satisfied since day one.  </li>
            <li>No razor butn after I shave and my hands and feet are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Expensive but pretty awesome.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy for winter time for hand/elbows, and I even apply it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;Order a small bottle first and see what you think...</li>
            <li>It even smells really good and one bottle usually lasts me about 6 months with continual use.</li>
            <li>I am very particular about lotions and will not use any lotion that contains mineral oil.</li>
            <li>I am very particular about the lotions that I use - I don&#x27;t like lotions that are greasy</li>
            <li>This is definitely better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Also it smells nice (really soft, with like a hint of bubble gum) and grease really was minimal to non-existant.</li>
            <li>The smell is fabulous - not strong, but fresh!  </li>
            <li>Highly reccomended.</li>

            <li>I was lucky enough to have not thrown away my other one.</li>
            <li>I got my order very fast and with samples of other products too.</li>
            <li>He at first used a lot, but after about half bottle stopped.  </li>
            <li>It REALLY moisterizes after tanning and any other day.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about this lotion, but I decided to give it a try because I needed a new one and it had so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference between this and other lotions that I use routinely!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is by far the best lotion that i have ever used.  It is wonderful for that after-tanning skin, indoors or out.  The smell is fabulous - not strong, but fresh!  I used this lotion when i was pregnant and not only did i NOT get stretch marks, but the dr.s would always compliment the scent!!!!  :-)  Operating a salon, I have tried many moisturizers.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> My pedicure lady uses this and gave me a sample.  I used the sample on a trip and was sold on it by the time I returned home!  I have very dry skin and I can really tell a difference between this and other lotions that I use routinely!  Love the light fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years and I love it. It&#x27;s great before and after tanning because with this product and your regular tanning lotion, you receive the ultimate tan. The smell is intoxicating and I compare it to chocolate covered cherries. The key to beautiful skin is in the moisturizer that you use and Hempz is definitly that moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The pump of the lotion bottle was broken.  I was lucky enough to have not thrown away my other one.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion. It smells really good (kinda like bubble gum) and hydrates without being greasy. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion. It REALLY moisterizes after tanning and any other day. The scent is fine, however I&#x27;m more into the vanilla/warm scents. I would suggest this lotion if you were looking for moisterizing/anti aging after tanning.</li>
            <li> This is the only type of lotion my girlfriend will use.  She loves everything about it.  The smell, the feel of her skin afterwards and the price.  She has recently started putting this on my back (I have really bad dry skin on my back) and it has stopped itching and my skin feels soft and very smooth.  This is good skin care for skin types of any kind.  Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hempz hand lotion for the last 7 years and have been extremely satisfied since day one.  I use it for it&#x27;s consistency (it&#x27;s not your watered-down, greasy store-bought brand) and it&#x27;s ability to continue moisturizing the entire day.  I benefit from Hempz ability to get deep down in the skin and keep my hands soft regardless to how many times I wash my hands in a day... I&#x27;ve got that extra protection against the elements.  It&#x27;s a good buy for winter time for hand/elbows, and I even apply it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;Order a small bottle first and see what you think... pamper yourself a little... get rid of that crummy store-bought brand and feel how soft and protected your skin can be.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin loves this product. No razor butn after I shave and my hands and feet are soft and smooth. something I try very hard to keep up with. I also use the tanning lotion and I love the smell of both.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells damn good. This is definitely better than I expected. Expensive but pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I got my order very fast and with samples of other products too. Very happy and will use this vendor again</li>
            <li> I love this product because it never leaves my skin feeling greasy and it lasts all day.  I wash my hands a lot at work, and I keep a bottle close by at all times to prevent my skin from cracking.  I don&#x27;t even mind the price, it is well worth the extra money.  It even smells really good and one bottle usually lasts me about 6 months with continual use.</li>
            <li> A friend let me use some of this lotion of hers, and I was amazed, and I&#x27;m so happy to find it available here on Amazon. I am very particular about lotions and will not use any lotion that contains mineral oil. This lotion does not contain mineral oil. It smells fabulous but it is not overpowering, just a clean, fresh scent. It feels wonderful on the skin, softens very nicely, and lasts all day long. There are not many creams or lotions I can even use on my face, but the HEMPZ lotion feels exquisite on my face, neck, lips, arms, legs, feet, everywhere! Psssst. Don&#x27;t tell anyone, but I would probably pay just about any price for this lotion!</li>
            <li> I have always used Hempz.  It&#x27;s great especially for after tanning.  I often travel to Florida where I tend to have my shoulders burn slightly.  With the use of Hempz, it not only relieves the pain but also keeps me from peeling.  Instead of using tanning lotions for indoor tanning, I often just put this on in the morning and it still keeps me moisturized while tanning.  It&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is the 5th and 6th bottle we have bought. It was a gift to us and we have given several gifts of lotion ourselves. Now, these last two are for us.!.Everyone in the house loves it..Smells great, moisturizes great; especially during cold weather when the heater is on all the time. Highly recommend it....</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this lotion, but I decided to give it a try because I needed a new one and it had so many positive reviews. It came yesterday, thank god, because I&#x27;d gotten a sunburn. I put it on once before I went to bed. I woke up this morning and my sunburn was GONE! This does not ever happen with my fair skin! Truly amazing stuff. Also it smells nice (really soft, with like a hint of bubble gum) and grease really was minimal to non-existant. Highly recommended, along with this seller.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion!  I like to get if from Lotions2go because I receive my products very quickly.</li>
            <li> Hempz Herbal Moisturizer  is very good. Scent is mild &amp; it moisturizes well along with being absorbed quickly. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I bought it for my roommate and she uses it everyday. It is really hydrating and lasts a long while, plus it smells good.</li>
            <li> love the way it smells, love the way it doesn&#x27;t run out of moisturizing steam midday........love it and have had several of my friends order from this site as well.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the BEST!!!!!  I used to itch all the time but now I don&#x27;t and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I live in an arid part of the U.S. and it&#x27;s been difficult to find a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t become sticky or melt in the heat.  I love this lotion! I find it has a pleasant odor, makes my skin feel soft and not tacky, and is really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Hempz for years. This is the greatest moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever encountered. It smells amazing and for a few extra bucks, you feel moisturized all day. My face use to be really dry and ever since I started using this product, I don&#x27;t have to reapply lotion! I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about the lotions that I use - I don&#x27;t like lotions that are greasy and I have to go wash my hands after I use them AND I cannot use lotions that have any odor because the smells give me migraines.  This Hemp lotion is PERFECT !  It is not greasy and it has a very light, pleasant fragrance.  I keep one bottle in my kitchen and one on my desk at work - I love it !</li>
            <li> The product came in right away, along with a free sample of tanning lotion and cute tanning stickers!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the item I purchased &amp; the lenght of time it took to recieve it!! I will definitely order again from you!</li>
            <li> My gym had this product as a sample on their counter and now I&#x27;m hooked on the product.  This is the economy size lotion with a pump.  This is the best overall lotion that prolongs your tan, moisturizes your skin, and has a refreshing scent.  Use this to re-fill the travel 2.5 oz. size product and use it for every occasion.</li>
            <li> My wife recently moved to the Arizona desert and was complaining about dry skin. I sent her some of this and she loves it. She says it really conditions and moisturizes her skin and last quite awhile in the desert climate. It&#x27;s much better than the stuff she was getting off the shelf at most discount stores. It&#x27;s a little pricey but you&#x27;ll see why when you give it a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion about a month ago, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. It&#x27;s probably the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever had, its very thick and rich, and it smells really good. Leaves my skin feeling great!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best moisturizer I have used.  A friend gave me this moisurizer and it didn&#x27;t last long because my kids used it, boy and girl!!  I bought all three of us a bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I came here to buy another bottle of this amazing moisturizer and decided to share a product review.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer. It feels and smells amazing. It works so well. I re-order this whenever I start to run low. Get it, try it, enjoy it!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband to use on face and beard.  He at first used a lot, but after about half bottle stopped.  I ended up using rest.  I like the smell and the richness of lotion. Also bought some for my father to use on his face and hands.  Have not gotten any feedback from him yet.</li>
